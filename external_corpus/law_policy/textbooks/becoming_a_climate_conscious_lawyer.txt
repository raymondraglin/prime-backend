Foreword

                      Justice Brian Preston, Chief Judge of Land and Environment Court of NSW

Climate change is one of the planetary crises challenging the law, legal practice and
the legal system. Climate change prompts not only legal development, the normal
evolution of the law in response to a changing society, but also legal disruption.
Legal disruption occurs when problems cannot be managed using existing laws and
legal institutions, thereby necessitating change. In short, climate change is legally
disruptive.
Conversely, the law, legal practice and the legal system are implicated in climate
change. Climate change is an externality of a socio-economic system that is built
on the commodification and exploitation of Earth's natural resources. The law and
legal institutions enable and encourage that socio-economic system and hence the
environmental externalities. In short, the law is environmentally disruptive.
Law students of today will be practising during the time when urgent action to address
climate change needs to be taken. To hold the global average temperature increase to
no more than 2 캜, and preferably 1.5 캜, above pre-industrial levels by 2050 - the
targets set under the Paris Agreement - our socio-economic system, including aspects

                                                                 24

of modes of production, need to be transformed radically to achieve the needed energy
transition.

That energy transition is required not only to achieve ecological sustainability -
a liveable planet - but also environmental justice for all people. Climate change
is a cause of injustice in so many ways. One way is that the people who have
contributed the least to climate change suffer the most. The law enables and ensures
this distributive injustice. But taking the transformative action required to tackle
climate change can itself cause injustice. The energy transition must also be just, not
redistributing injustice between different groups in society.

To equip law students with the knowledge and skills to practice law in a climate-
transformed world, legal education needs to teach them about the legal disruption of
climate change and the environmental disruption of the law and how to justly address
both. This demands a transformation in legal education by mainstreaming climate
change in all aspects of the legal curriculum. This transformation entails a journey into
uncharted territory. A map is required to navigate the journey. This book provides the
map.

Edited by Julia Dehm, Nicole Graham and Zoe Nay, this book is a valuable collection
addressing the core legal curriculum - the 11 compulsory academic areas of
knowledge known as the Priestley 11 - and a range of elective subjects taught
at Australian law schools. The chapters identify, first, the legal disruptions and
developments that climate change is causing to these areas of substantive and adjective
law; second, why and how climate change is causing these disruptions and
developments; and third, what and how legal change can and should be made to
achieve sustainability for the planet and justice for all its people.

The book provides the map for the journey; it is our task to follow it.

Climate change impacts and the transition to a low-carbon society are already posing
fundamental challenges to key legal doctrines and principles and thereby transforming
of many areas of law. Further changes to key legal doctrines and principles across all
areas of law will be necessary to address the future impacts of climate change and
to ensure a rapid transition to a low-carbon society that is just and equitable. This
introductory chapter provides crucial background to complement for the later chapters.
The chapter briefly synthesises the current state of the scientific evidence surrounding
the climate crisis, with a focus on the impacts of climate change in Australia. The

                                                                 26

chapter begins by providing an overview of what is required to transition to a low-
carbon society and prevent further dangerous anthropogenic interference with the
global climate system (section 2). It then introduces the role of law in the changing
climate context and describes legal responses to climate change on both international
and national levels, with a particular focus on the Australian context (section 3). In
addition, the chapter highlights how all areas of law and the Australia legal system
are implicated in climate change (section 4) and provides a broad overview of the
skills and attributes needed to be a `climate conscious lawyer' (section 5). The chapter

                                             KEY QUESTIONS

                  How ambitious, effective and equitable do you consider existing
                    laws and regulations addressing climate change at the
                    international and domestic legal to be?

                  How do you understand the role of law in regulating, redressing,
                    and facilitating climate change?

                  What do you think are the essential competencies of a `climate
                    conscious lawyer' or legal professional? How can you better
                    develop these skills and attributes?

                  Do you think legal education should be more `climate conscious'?

 1. Introduction

  Climate change impacts and the transition to a low-carbon society are already posing
  fundamental challenges to key legal doctrines and principles and thereby transforming
  of many areas of law. Further changes to key legal doctrines and principles across all
  areas of law will be necessary to address the future impacts of climate change and
  to ensure a rapid transition to a low-carbon society that is just and equitable. The
  widespread legal change necessary extends beyond the specialised fields of `climate'
  and `environmental' laws and implicates all areas of law and legal practice, including
  corporate and fiduciary duties, property and tort law, constitutional administrative law
  and criminal law, as well as civil procedure, evidence law, professional obligations
  and many more.1 Legal change is already occurring through dispersed and multilevel
  approaches, including by way of international negotiation, domestic policymaking,
  climate change litigation and political activism.2

  This book is for all academic and practising lawyers, and law students and law
  academics who want to understand these legal changes in order to strategically and
  successfully navigate the rapidly changing legal landscape. This book provides crucial
  insights and resources for those who choose to use their skills and expertise to
  contribute towards advancing climate change mitigation and adaptation.

  Law students need a transformative legal education that will support them to become
  `climate conscious' legal professionals with the competency and knowledge to be
  thoughtful, strategic and successful advocates in a climate-transformed world. Many
  law students recognise that addressing climate change is an urgent imperative and
  would like to develop their skills and knowledge to promote climate mitigation and
  adaptation. When law graduates enter the legal profession, they need to navigate a
  fundamentally transformed climate context, with widespread but unequally distributed

  impacts experienced across systems, regions and sectors. An understanding of the
  impacts of climate change and its intersections with the law is necessary for law
  students to become strategic and successful legal professionals in a world grappling
  with intersecting and complex climate impacts.3 Finally, law students will become
  leaders of the profession at the middle of this century, a time at which the global
  community has committed to reaching `net zero' emissions.4 They need not simply to
  adapt to change but drive change in their professional lives. It is therefore crucial that
  climate change considerations are mainstreamed across legal education.5

 About this Collection

  This edited collection identifies the cutting-edge developments emerging in response
  to climate change and analyses the conceptual challenges that climate change presents
  to different areas of law. As the contributors to the edited collection demonstrate,
  greenhouse gas (GHG) emitting human activities that cause or exacerbate climate
  change are facilitated, regulated and limited by law. Moving beyond a siloed focus
  on international climate change law as a distinct legal field of sub-disciplinary
  knowledge, this edited collection contains chapters addressing core curriculum law
  subjects, as well as a range of elective subjects taught across Australian law schools.
  We hope that this edited collection will provide resources to embed climate change
  considerations throughout professionally accredited law cources, to equip the next
  generation of lawyers to deliver legal services and promote justice in a world
  transformed by climate change.

  To provide the conceptual foundations for the forthcoming chapters, this introductory
  chapter will briefly synthesise the current state of the scientific evidence surrounding
  the climate crisis, with a focus on the impacts of climate change in Australia. The

chapter begins by providing an overview of what is required to transition to a low-
carbon society and prevent further dangerous anthropogenic interference with the
global climate system (section 2). It then introduces the role of law in the changing
climate context and describes legal responses to climate change at international and
national levels, with a particular focus on the Australian context (section 3). In
addition, the chapter highlights how all areas of law and the Australia legal system
are implicated in climate change (section 4) and provides a broad overview of the
skills and attributes needed to be a `climate conscious lawyer' (section 5). The chapter
concludes with reflections on the method and pedagogy underpinning this book
(section 6), the importance of considering `climate anxiety' when learning or teaching
about climate change (section 7) and an outline of forthcoming chapters (section 8).

 2. Climate Science

  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is the main international
  scientific body on climate change and issues periodic assessment reports.1 The most
  recent IPCC Assessment Report concludes that it is `unequivocal' that GHG-emitting
  human activities are the primary cause of global warming since the mid-20th century.2
  The primary emissions-intensive activities driving global warming are first, fossil-fuel
  combustion and industrial activities, and second, the clearing of land for agriculture,
  industry and other human activities.3 These activities contribute to the emission of
  four main GHGs (carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, methane and halocarbons). GHG
  emissions trap heat in the atmosphere, leading to global warming and the
  consequential impacts of climate change. Concentrations of carbon dioxide in the
  atmosphere are unprecedented in comparison with the past 2 million years, and
  atmospheric concentrations of methane and nitrous oxide are higher than any time
  in the past 800,000 years.4 In this context, global temperatures have already risen by
  approximately 1.2캜 since the pre-industrial era.5 Moreover, states' GHG emission

  Human-induced climate change is associated with the increased occurrence and
  severity of extreme events, such as heatwaves and floods, as well as slow-onset
  events like temperature rise and ocean warming. These extreme and slow-onset events
  are already causing widespread but unevenly distributed adverse impacts and related
  losses and damages to natural and human systems, such as losses of biodiversity
  and ecosystem services; food and water insecurity; harmful outcomes for human
  health; damage to cities, infrastructure and settlements; and losses of territory, cultural
  heritage and Indigenous or local knowledges. Those that have contributed least to

      contributions are projected to result in global warming of 2.9캜 (with a range of 2.0 to 3.7). If all conditional
      nationally determined contributions are implemented, temperature rise may peak at 2.5캜. If all net-zero pledges are
      also fulfilled, temperature rise may be limited to 2.0캜. See United Nations Environment Programme, Emission Gap
      Report 2023: Broken Record -- Temperatures hit new highs, yet world fails to cut emissions (again) (UNEP Report,
      2023) Table 4.4.

   historic and current GHG emissions often face the first and worst impacts of climate
   change.7 Conversely, those that have contributed most to the causes of climate change,
   and thus benefited most from GHG-intensive activities, now possess more resources
   to respond and adapt to the impacts of climate change.

   Australia is in a unique position with respect to climate change, being highly
   vulnerable to the impacts of climate change while also disproportionally contributing
   to atmospheric GHG emissions relative to its population size. In Australia,
   temperatures have risen by an estimated 1.47캜 since 1910.8 This temperature rise
   has contributed to in an increased risk of bushfires in Australia.9 Simultaneously,
   surrounding sea levels are rising at a rate faster than the global average, resulting
   in coastal erosion and flooding throughout Australia's coastal regions and low-lying
   islands.10 The degradation of Australia's coral reefs and marine biodiversity similarly
   illustrates the adverse impacts of climate change in our region. Australia's coral
   reefs provide critical habitats for marine biodiversity and support ecosystem services
   in the coastal environment, such as fisheries productivity, drawing carbon from the
   atmosphere (`carbon sequestration') and helping to reduce marine pollution.11 The
   degradation of Australia's marine environment therefore has implications for
   economic and food security12 and the capacity for Australia to achieve and uphold

 3. Climate Law

  Given all that is at stake, it is unsurprising that `climate law' has emerged as a
  specialised field of international law. International climate change law is based on
  three international law treaties -- the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention
  on Climate Change (UNFCCC),1 the 1997 Kyoto Protocol2 and the 2015 Paris
  Agreement3 -- as well as the annual Conference of the Parties (COP) as the main
  decision-making body of the UNFCCC, subsidiary institutions and mechanisms, and
  the decisions and practices adopted therein. International climate change law interacts
  with many other fields of international law and has implications for almost all aspect
  of states' national policies, including energy, agriculture, transportation, disaster
  planning and health. In this context, most states have adopted laws and policies that
  govern action on climate change, generally relating to mitigating GHG emissions,
  adapting to the impacts of climate change, and disaster risk management.4 A subset
  of those domestic laws and policies link national and international action on climate
  change. The next section of the chapter will briefly describe the field of international
  climate change law and introduce Australia's approach to linking its international
  obligations with national laws and policies.

 3.1 International Climate Change Law

   principles that are intended to inform and guide the development of subsequent
   treaties, including that parties to the Convention should protect the climate on the basis
   of equity and in accordance with their "`common but differentiated responsibilities
   and respective capabilities"'.6 It also highlights the "`specific needs and special
   circumstances of developing country Parties"', especially those "`particularly
   vulnerable to the effects of climate change"',7 and the need for "`precautionary
   measures"'.8

   In the negotiation of the UNFCCC, state parties were unable to agree on specific
   legally binding emission reduction targets. In light of this, the UNFCCC primarily
   set out some general obligations and established institutions and processes, including
   subsidiary bodies, a secretariat and annual conferences (the COP) to allow for ongoing
   negotiations and norm development under the framework Convention. The UNFCCC
   created obligations for all parties to develop and publish national inventories and
   formulate and implement programs containing measures to mitigate climate change
   by addressing emissions from sources and removals by sinks.9 It also created further
   obligations for countries listed in Annex I of the Convention (industrialised countries
   that were part of the OECD, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
   Development, in 1992 and countries with economies in transition) to adopt national
   policies and take corresponding measures to limit emissions of GHGs and protect
   and enhance sinks.10 Finally, the UNFCCC created additional obligations for countries
   listed in Annex II (just the industrialised countries that were part of the OECD in 1992)
   relating to the provision of financial resources and technology transfer to support
   developing country parties, especially those that are particularly vulnerable to climate
   change.11

   commitments for Annex I, the developed countries party to the original Convention.
   In total, the Protocol sought to reduce overall GHG emission by at least 5 per cent
   below 1990 levels during its first commitment period (2008-2012).12 The quantified
   emission limitation or reduction commitments for each developed country was listed
   in Annex B. Australia was able to negotiate significant concessions at Kyoto: while
   other developed countries committed to emission reductions, Australia negotiated an
   agreed target that would allow it to increase its emissions by 8 per cent over the
   first commitment period (2008-2012). Another major concession was the so-called
   Australia clause (Article 3.3), which allowed Australia to obtain credit for reductions
   in land clearing since 1990 that were caused by separate policy changes. Despite
   negotiating an increasingly favourable deal, the Coalition government of Australia
   at the time, headed by Prime Minister John Howard, choose not to ratify the Kyoto
   Protocol. It was not until 2007 that Australia ratified the Protocol, after the election of
   the Labor Party led by Prime Minister Kevin Rudd.

   The Kyoto Protocol also established an international system of carbon trading,13
   including two carbon offset schemes, `Joint Implementation'14 and the `Clean
   Development Mechanism'.15 The former allowed developed country parties to support
   emission reduction in other developed country parties and in return allow the resulting
   emission reduction units from the project to be counted towards its own emission
   reduction commitments. The Clean Development Mechanism allowed developed
   country parties to support emission reduction projects in developing countries and
   in return allow the resulting certified emission reductions from the project to be
   counted towards its own emission reduction commitments. The Clean Development
   Mechanism was intended to generate win-win outcomes for developed and developing
   country parties, as well as the climate, but has been heavily criticised for failing to
   generate real and additional emission reductions and, at times, for contributing to
   negative human rights and social impacts where the projects were located.16

   The Kyoto Protocol did not come into force until 2005; however, the focus of
   international negotiations had already moved to what would come after it. The 2007
   Bali Action Plan launched a "`process to enable the full, effective and sustained
   implementation of the Convention"' up to and beyond 2012.17 This process sought to
   address a shared vision for long-term cooperative action, as well as enhanced action
   on mitigation, adaptation, technology development, and transfer and provision of
   financial resources and investment to support action. There were high hopes that
   a post-2012 agreement would be reached at COP15 held in Copenhagen in 2009;
   however, the conference only produced the controversial `Copenhagen Accord', which
   was `noted' but not adopted by the COP.18 However, a few years later in 2011
   a last-minute breakthrough in Durban saw a commitment to "`develop a protocol,
   another legal instrument or an agreed outcome with legal force under the Convention
   applicable to all Parties"' by 2015.19

   The subsequent 2015 Paris Agreement was widely celebrated as a `landmark' and
   `historical' agreement, even though climate justice groups simultaneously warned
   that it was an "`accord that failed humanity"' and a "`disaster for the world's most
   vulnerable and future generations"'.20 The Paris Agreement sets out a number of key
   objectives, including "`holding the increase in the global average temperature to well
   below 2 캜 above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature
   increase to 1.5 캜 above pre-industrial levels"'.21 Its objectives also include increasing
   the capacity to adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change22 and directing finance
   towards GHG emission reductions and climate-resilient development.23 In contrast
   to the Kyoto Protocol, the Paris Agreement adopts a more `bottom up' architecture
   and allows each country to put forward their own intended `nationally determined

   an NDC every five years,25 each reflecting a progression on their previous NDC
   and reflecting the particular country's "`highest possible ambition"'.26 Additionally,
   a "`global stocktake"' on collective progress towards achieving the objective of the
   Paris Agreement will be held every five years.27 The first global stocktake concluded
   in 2023, underlining that there remains a problematic gap between the NDCs put
   forward by state parties and the emission reductions necessary to stay within the global
   temperature limit set out under the Paris Agreement (see Figure 32).28

   The Paris Agreement also includes provisions on adaptation (Article 7), loss and
   damage (Article 8), finance (Article 9), technology transfer (Article 10) and capacity
   building (Article 11). More specifically, Article 7 sets out "`the global goal on
   adaptation of enhancing adaptive capacity, strengthening resilience and reducing
   vulnerability to climate change"', taking into account the sustainable development
   needs of state parties and the temperature limit in Article 2 of the agreement.29
   Despite mitigation and adaptation action, some losses and damages associated with
   climate change have already occurred and will continue to occur into the future. In
   Article 8 of the Paris Agreement, state parties "`recognized the importance of averting,
   minimizing, and addressing loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of

   climate change"'.30 Articles 9, 10 and 11 reaffirm that developed country parties
   must help developing countries in mitigation and adaptation by providing financial
   assistance, technology transfer and capacity-building support, respectively.31

   The international climate treaties have been surprisingly silent on the main causes
   of global climate change, namely the burning of fossil fuels. Although the 1988
   Toronto Conference on the Changing Atmosphere had already recommended that
   half of all emission reductions should come from decreasing fossil fuel supply,32 the
   UNFCCC and Paris Agreement do not include any commitment to reduce fossil fuel
   extraction or combustion. A key outcome of the 2021 Glasgow Climate Pact33 was
   a reference to "`accelerating efforts towards the phasedown of unabated coal power
   and phase-out of inefficient fossil fuel subsidies"'.34 The question of fossil fuels was
   central to the negotiations at COP28 in Dubai; however, the final text only called on
   parties to take action, including "`[a]ccelerating efforts towards the phase-down of
   unabated coal power"', "`[t]ransitioning away from fossil fuels in energy systems"'
   and "`[p]hasing out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies that do not address energy poverty
   or just transitions"'.35

  3.2 Australia's Climate Change Laws and Policies

   There are many compelling reasons for Australia to take strong and ambitious climate
   action. Australia has a high level of vulnerability to climate impacts, especially
   extreme weather events such as floods and fires.36 Moreover, economic assessments
   have consistently shown that `business as usual' is not a viable option and that
   the costs of acting will increase the longer we delay.37 Finally, Australia has many
   opportunities to benefit from and be a global leader in the transition to a low-carbon
   society.38 Yet despite this, Australia has historically been a `laggard' not a `leader' on
   climate policy.39

   Australia has one of the higher levels of per capita GHG emissions in the world:
   15.1 tonnes in 2021, which is almost double China's 8 tonnes per capita, or 50 times
   the per capita emissions of low-income countries (see Figure 43).40 This is due to the
   high reliance on coal and gas in Australia's energy portfolio, GHG emissions from
   coal mines, and the degradation of carbon sequestration in soils and forestry through
   agricultural activities and other land-use changes. Australia's largest contribution
   to global climate change is through its exports of fossil fuels, especially coal and
   gas. Australia has some of the largest coal reserves in the world and is the second

   20 countries are likely to be responsible for almost 90 per cent of the carbon pollution
   from new coal and gas fields between 2035 and 2050, and over 50 per cent of this
   planned expansion comes from five countries: Australia, the United States, Canada,
   Norway and the United Kingdom. However, there remains bipartisan support for
   fossil fuel production in Australia and there is "`no national policy framework aiming
   to restrict fossil fuel exploration, production, or infrastructure development"'.44
   Australian policy has thus long been blinded by a "`quarry vision"'45 and fossil
   fuel industries have "`constructed a covert network of lobbyists and revolving door
   appointments which has ensured that industry interests continue to dominate
   Australia's energy policy"'.46 As the United Nations Environment Program Production
   Gap Report 2023 notes, "`coal and gas industries have strong influence in political
   debate, diplomacy, economic strategy, and policy development, both nationally and in
   fossil-fuel-exporting states"'.47

   Climate policy is historically contentious and politically fraught in Australia: there
   has been a lack of bipartisan consensus about climate action, and climate debates
   have been a catalyst for change in government and internal party leadership in both
   major parties. The period from around 2007 to 2023 is often characterised at the
   `climate wars'. There were several unsuccessful attempts to introduce a national
   climate policy, including the Rudd Labor government's Carbon Pollution Reduction
   Scheme (introduced into Parliament in 2009, which was unable to pass and postponed
   indefinitely in 2010). Subsequently the Gillard Labor government, with support from
   the Australian Greens and independents, enacted the Clean Energy Future legislative
   package in 2011. This established a carbon pricing scheme, with an initial fixed price
   on carbon before the transition to a carbon trading scheme linked to international
   markets. Although the Clean Energy Future scheme was already influencing emission

   reductions,48 it was persistently opposed by the Liberal-National coalition in
   opposition. In 2014, shortly after they won government in 2013, the Liberal-National
   Abbott government repealed the scheme, replacing it with an Emission Reduction
   Fund that built upon the Carbon Credits (Carbon Farming Initiative) Act 2011 (Cth)
   (which was part of the Clean Energy Future package).49

   In the lead up to the Paris Agreement, Australia submitted an intended NDC to reduce
   emissions by 26 to 28 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. This commitment was
   widely viewed to be insufficient, particularly considering that Australia is a developed
   country expected to take the lead in mitigating GHG emissions.50 While most countries
   updated their NDCs prior to COP26 in 2021, the Australian government led by Scott
   Morrison simply resubmitted the unrevised, highly insufficient target. The Morrison
   government also released a plan to achieve net zero by 2050 which relied heavily
   on the future development of low-emission technology, land-use reduction and
   international offsets. It did not include any plan to phase out coal or reduce fossil fuel
   exports. In August 2022, the newly elected Albanese Labor government submitted
   Australia's new NDC to the UNFCCC. It included a target to reduce GHG emissions
   by 43 per cent by 2030 below 2005 levels. While Climate Action Tracker described
   this as a significant improvement in ambition it still gave the updated NDC an overall
   rating of `insufficient', given it was consistent with a temperature rise of 3 캜 above
   pre-industrial levels, far exceeding what the Paris Agreement establishes as necessary
   to prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate (see Figure 54).

   Australia has sought to codify its updated international NDC at the national level
   through the adoption of the Climate Change Act 2022 (Cth). The Climate Change Act
   is the main legislation in Australia that codifies Australia's international commitments
   to reduce net GHG emissions by 43 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030 and reach net
   zero by 2050. It also requires that a climate change statement is prepared annually and
   tabled in Parliament and provides that the Climate Change Authority should advise
   the current minister on this statement and on updated emission reduction targets.
   Various state and territory governments also have climate legislation that sets specific
   mitigation targets and promotes climate adaptation.51
   The other key national tool governing climate action in Australia is the `Safeguard
   Mechanism', which has been in place since 2016. The Safeguard Mechanism is
   enacted through the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act 2007 (Cth),

   although key details are included in various regulations.52 The Safeguard Mechanism
   requires facilities that emit more than 100,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent (abbreviated
   as tCO2-e) of covered emissions53 annually to comply with emissions limitations. Prior
   to 2023, the emissions limit was relatively consistent and set at business-as-usual
   levels. However, from 2023 onwards, facilities covered by the Safeguard Mechanism
   must reduce their emissions in alignment with Australia's international commitments.
   Facilities that exceed their emissions limits have the option to purchase `carbon
   credits'54 that are produced from `eligible activities' focused on emission reduction
   or carbon sequestration.55 However, a number of academic studies and civil society
   groups have highlighted environmental integrity issues with these carbon credits,
   and there are concerns that around 75 per cent of the credits do not represent new,
   additional or real emission reductions.56

   Outside of specific climate laws and policies, Australia's main environmental
   protection law -- the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act
   1999 (Cth) (EPBC Act) -- does not explicitly address the climate impacts of GHG-
   intensive projects.57 Various independent reviews and reports on the EPBC Act have
   called for the inclusion of a `climate trigger'.58 However, to date no such trigger has

53. Safeguard Rule (n 52). Covered emissions are defined in section 22XL as "`scope 1 emissions of one or more greenhouse
       gases, other than emissions of a kind specified in the safeguard rules"'. There are also a number of exceptions
       including: legacy emissions from the operation of a landfill facility (that is, emissions from waste deposited at the
       landfill before 1 July 2016); emissions which occur in the Greater Sunrise special regime area; emissions from the
       operation of a grid-connected electricity generator in a year covered by the sectoral baseline; emissions not covered
       under the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting (Measurement) Determination 2008.

   been included in the legislation. That said, as of 2023 and at the time of writing, there
   were two private member bills before Parliament that sought to modify the EPBC Act
   to require the consideration of GHG emissions and climate change considerations.59
   There have also been various attempts through litigation to ask courts to interpret
   the decision-making provisions of the EPBC Act to require the consideration of
   GHG emissions, including in Wildlife Preservation Society of Queensland Proserpine/
   Whitsunday Branch v Minister for the Environment and Heritage (`Wildlife
   Whitsunday Ccase'), Australian Conservation Foundation (ACF) v Minister for the
   Environment (`Carmichael Coal Mine' Ccase') and Environment Council of Central
   Queensland Inc v Minister for the Environment and Water (No 2) (`Living Wonder'
   Ccase'). These cases have (to date) been unsuccessful.

   More broadly, there has also been growing use of the courts to try to achieve climate
   regulatory outcomes.60 `Climate litigation' has been defined as "`cases that raise
   material issues of law or fact relating to climate change mitigation, adaptation, or the
   science of climate change ... brought before a range of administrative, judicial, and
   other adjudicatory bodies"'.61 There has been a drastic growth in climate litigation over
   the past decade globally.62 Over recent years, there has been a global and domestic
   surge in climate change related litigation. As of July 2023, some 2,180 climate
   change related court cases have commenced or concluded globally, spanning courts

   Australia is, after the United States, the jurisdiction that has seen the most climate
   litigation actions, with over 134 cases filed. While the `first generation' of climate
   litigation in Australia primarily used administrative law to challenge governmental
   decision-making, especially around coal-fired power stations and coal mines, the
   `second generation' of climate litigation has innovatively deployed a range of laws
   -- including company, trust, constitutional, tort, human rights laws and others -- to
   promote an "`accountability model whereby legal interventions are designed to hold
   governments and corporations directly to account for the climate change implications
   of their activities"'.65 Various arguments developed in climate litigation will be
   discussed in chapters throughout this book.

                      Why do you think Australia has been such a `laggard' on climate
                        action? What would it take to turn Australia from a laggard to a
                        leader?

                      Do you think Australia's commitment to reduce GHG emissions
                        by 43 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030 is adequate or
                        equitable? Why/why not?

                      Do you think existing Australian laws and policies will effectively
                        achieve the policy objectives to reduce GHG emissions by 43 per
                        cent below 2005 levels by 2030? Why/why not?

 4. The Climate Crisis and the Australian Legal System

  The previous section described the specialised international and domestic laws
  addressing climate change. However, if we just focus on the specialised fields of law
  that are concerned with promoting climate change mitigation and adaptation, we
  will fail to see how all areas of law have relevance for climate change. To understand
  better how current legal relations are implicated in facilitating the climate crisis, and
  how they could be re-purposed to mitigate or adapt to the effects of climate change, a
  deeper interrogation of the role of law in relation to climate change is needed.
  One of the main drivers of climate change is the institutionally protected entitlement
  to, accumulation of and subsequent disposal of the environment1 at a global scale
  by European and British imperial powers through their colonisation of places and
  peoples across the world.2 Research by legal scholars from several sub-disciplines of
  law illustrates the significant role that the law plays in producing and reproducing
  the socio-economic conditions of climate change, as well as the crucial role that laws

  and policies can play in addressing this.3 It is impossible to appreciate the sociogenic4
  complexity of climate change without analysing how the law, as a powerful socio-
  economic institution and specialist regulatory toolbox, conceived and constructed
  the rights of polluters to emit GHGs. International and domestic legal regimes also
  enabled the legal rights of fossil fuel producers and distributors to do what they do in
  lawful ways.

  Legal research on the significance of law to climate change is consistent with many
  First Nations and Indigenous analyses of adverse impacts on landscapes, waterscapes
  and countries from European and British colonisation and their maladapted legal
  institutions.5 The laws of Indigenous peoples are often understood as being `place-
  based', which means that they are responsive and specific to particular local
  geographical conditions and ecologies. Indigenous laws and regulatory regimes are

      from and across all human societies, that there is nothing inherently `human' about climate change. Rather, climate
      change is caused by the activities and choices of a particular kind of human society characterised by capitalist forms
      of economy. See Malm and Hornborg 2014, 66.

   often characterised by holistic ways of thinking about life and the world. Holistic
   ontologies (ways of being in the world) contrast with the dominant western worldview
   in which landscapes and ecologies are regarded as a suite of separable natural
   resources for the purposes of commodification, ownership and exchange. The
   sociogenic logic of nature as a suite of resources through which British and European
   laws regulate human relationships with non-human things as commodities constructed
   "`regimes of dispossession"'6 and entitlement to the goods of life. The universalising
   and abstract nature of this logic contrasts with the geographically specific and
   seasonally responsive nature of Indigenous legal regimes.

   It is important to recognise that there is no pan-Indigenous legal regime. But historical,
   anthropological and socio-legal scholarship is replete with studies of the myriad
   ways through which many place-based economies and laws foreground the authority,
   contingency and presence of non-human life, the interdependence of all life and the
   situation of life within the dynamism of time.7 These legal regimes are antithetical to
   economic models of infinite growth and global development.8

   Some of the dominant Anglo-European legal concepts and doctrines of our time
   -- indeed the private-public taxonomy of law itself -- were arguably developed to
   protect and defend the socio-economic institutions that constructed the conditions of
   what we now recognise to be climate change. One legal historian contends that the
   separation of public from private laws in the development of English common law
   was manufactured to shield private interests from the "`pursuit of collective goals"' in
   liberal democracies.9 Such historical accounts resonate with analyses of contemporary
   law as a form of regulatory capitalism through which markets themselves have now
   become "`important national, regional and global regulators"' protecting private
   interests from public interests such as taxation, public health and industrial relations.10

   Private law plays an instrumental role in climate change through its regulation of the
   "`building blocks of economic development"' and by "`promoting the maximisation of
   economic growth"'.11 Today, private corporations boast some of the largest economies
   in the world and are the locus of the vast majority of the goods of life. Groundbreaking
   analysis by Richard Heede has quantified the contribution of different corporate
   actors to the climate crisis and shown that just 90 producers of fossil fuels and
   cement -- the so-called carbon majors -- have created 63 per cent of cumulative
   worldwide emissions from 1751 to 2010.12 The legal rights to those goods are largely
   concentrated and protected through the key institutions of law: the corporation and
   private property.13 As such we might say that "`the structure of the corporate form
   in terms of its purpose and its relationships is incompatible with the world's fragile
   environmental ecosystem"'.14 Legal research has brought to light the global
   environmental harms facilitated by these legal institutions and their rich doctrinal
   toolboxes.15 The characteristic abstractness of Anglo-European laws and their
   disconnection from physical and material contexts is problematic in the context of
   climate change, since institutions such as corporations and rights over property are
   not situated within the materiality of geographical and metabolic relations and limits.16
   The laws of all human societies are significant to the health and viability of terrestrial,

   atmospheric, riparian and marine environments and ecosystems within and between
   their jurisdictions. In the case of the dominant global legal forms of the corporation
   and private property, that significance is profoundly upscaled: these legal forms and
   attendant armour have become contingent features of and threats to planetary health.

   The paradigms of the Enlightenment and liberalism that underpin the dominant legal
   subject, that imaginary autonomous individual who acts rationally and in their own
   self-interest. The paradigms have long been critiqued as inaccurate and unrealistic
   characterisations of human decision-making, since our relationships with others are
   fundamental to our experience and wellbeing in more connected, complex and
   networked ways.17 In addressing climate change, we must recognise that the dominant
   view of legal subjectivity as individualistic and self-interested is unhelpful at best and
   is at worst a barrier to adaptation. There are no solutions available to us by extending
   or reproducing these dated ideas of human decision-making and the economic models
   and legal doctrines "`born in colonial Britain"'.18 "`To continue current global trends
   of "`progress and development"' is to ensure the decline of all life on Earth."'19 The
   affluent populations of the world must "`open their eyes wide ... to see and know law
   beyond the colonialist foundation"'.20 It is necessary for lawyers to think and learn
   about the significance of law in the world differently -- but how should we think
   differently?

 5. Doing Law Differently: Climate Conscious
 Lawyering

  Law cannot solve the climate crisis independently of other socio-economic and
  political institutions. However, lawyers can and must play an important part in broader
  collective and collaborative strategies to address climate change by developing and
  executing effective, equitable and rapid responses in the sphere of regulation. `Law
  and legal institutions constitute a critical component of a society's adaptive capacity,
  and their influence may be positive or negative.'1 Moreover, identifying `institutions
  that are resistant to change or that change in small increments', including law, as
  `barriers to adaptation', `especially when transformational shifts are required', is
  critically important to addressing climate change. The converse is also true:
  institutions such as law can `facilitate the implementation of adaptation policies and
  respond quickly to new knowledge'.2

                                                KEY QUESTION
                    How can the institution of law shift from a negative influence on

                      the adaptive capacity of society -- a `barrier to adaptation' -- to a
                      positive one?

  The impact of climate change on law and regulation is apparent across all fields
  of law. The Law Council of Australia is the peak body for the legal profession in
  Australia and in 2021 issued its Climate Change Policy.3 The policy highlights the
  various implications that climate change has for the legal profession and the shifting

   59

  legal demands it creates through the changing needs of multiple sectors, industries
  and business entities to transition to a low-carbon economy. The policy observes
  that there are impacts to `agricultural, insurance and tourism sectors', as well as
  changes in `employment ... to support just transitions'. The policy also notes that the
  legal implications of climate change `are being tested before Australian, foreign and
  international courts and tribunals'.4

  Novel (new) causes of action involving complex questions of law are arising across
  multiple legal practice areas, including administrative law, corporations law, tort,
  consumer law, contract law, insurance law, occupational health and safety laws,
  planning laws and water rights.5 Particular industries and sectors require tailored
  legal advice to meet a myriad of climate change related challenges and opportunities.
  Diverse groups of Australians also present new demands, including rural, regional and
  remote communities and First Nations communities. The Law Council of Australia
  acknowledges that `the Australian legal profession has a critical part to play as it
  advises clients on the legal implications of all these shifts, challenges and opportunities
  [and] participates in the development of mitigation and adaptation measures'.6

  In light of the impacts of climate change on all areas of law and legal practice, `climate
  conscious lawyering' is increasingly encouraged and championed as appropriate, if
  not necessary, to legal professional development and ethics.7 As Justice Brian Preston
  -- the Chief Judge of the Land and Environment Court in New South Wales -- has
  explained, climate conscious lawyering requires an attentiveness to the relevance of
  climate change for different areas of law, and the provision of legal services, in a
  manner that seeks to meaningfully address climate change.8 This edited collection
  adopts and expands upon Preston CJ of the NSW Land and Environment Court's

  conceptualisation of climate conscious lawyering by examining not only the
  significant role of law and legal practitioners in addressing the adverse impacts of
  climate change and promoting justice in a climate-transformed world but also critically
  engaging with the ways in which different areas of law may be implicated in
  authorising excessive GHG emissions leading to climate change and contributing to
  inequalities that underpin the climate crisis (see Figure 6).9

   Figure 1.6: A framework for understanding climate conscious legal education and practice.

  In agreement with other scholars calling for climate conscious lawyering, we support
  the development of several legal competencies necessary for `climate conscious legal
  education and practice'. These include essential competencies for lawyers more
  generally, such as `problem solving, legal analysis and reasoning, legal research,

9. See further, Julia Dehm, `Reconfiguring Environmental Governance in the Green Economy: Extraction, Stewardship
      and Natural Capital' in Usha Natarajan and Julia Dehm (eds), Locating Nature: The Making and Unmaking of

     61

   factual investigation, communication, counselling, negotiation, litigation and dispute
   resolution, procedures, organisation and management of legal work, and resolution of
   ethical dilemmas'.10

   At the same time, due to the `legally disruptive' nature of climate change,11 this edited
   collection suggests that additional legal competencies will be necessary to respond
   to the climate crisis, including an understanding of the interaction between different
   areas of law in terms of the applicability to climate change; an appreciation of multi-
   level approaches to climate change governance, including international, regional,
   national and subnational laws and policies; a critical awareness of the broader context
   of climate change, including issues of globalisation, justice and equity; and an
   attentiveness to interdisciplinary insights, including a basic understanding of climate
   science and economics, among other disciplines.

   Finally, because climate change reflects and reproduces existing inequalities and
   vulnerabilities it is also unavoidably an issue of equity and fairness. `Climate justice'
   draws attention to how the responsibility for anthropocentric climate change is
   unevenly distributed and that the impacts of climate change will be unequally felt, and
   that it is often those who contributed least to causing climate change who will suffer
   most from its effects. Climate justice has various aspects:

             Distributive justice: paying attention to inequalities in the causes, burdens
               of addressing and experience of impacts.

             Procedural justice: ensuring participatory, accessible, fair and inclusive
               processes to address climate change.

             Recognition justice: centring voices of those who have historically been
               marginalised, such as First Nations in Australia.

             Reparative or corrective justice: considering what actions are necessary to
               redress and repair harms caused.12

   Thus, an additional legal competency necessary for climate conscious lawyers is
   attention to the complex, intersecting and cumulative justice issues that climate change
   enlivens, and how different legal and regulatory measures may accentuate injustice or
   promote greater equity and fairness.
   These competencies have been introduced in this introductory chapter and will be
   further developed in the forthcoming chapters of this edited collection.

 6. Mainstreaming Climate Change in Legal Education

  As recommended by the United Nations,1 numerous legal organisations around the
  world,2 including the Law Council of Australia,3 legal scholars4 and many legal
  educators, are beginning to incorporate climate change related case law, legislation
  and policy into learning materials, learning activities and assessments in the core and
  elective curricula of undergraduate and graduate law programs. Some law faculties
  and legal educators have made significant progress in formalising this inclusion, either
  through referring to sustainability or climate change in unit learning outcomes (at the
  subject level) or in course learning outcomes (at the program level). A small number
  of Australian universities have moved to include education and curriculum in various
  strategy statements and documents, and there is also discussion about introducing
  sustainability and climate change into university-level graduate attributes and qualities
  to apply to all award courses at some institutions. We are at a critical turning point, and
  the first edition of this book is intended to play its part in supporting the educational
  transformation underway across the country. Future editions will necessarily update
  content and broaden the scope to parts of the curriculum not yet included.

  It is imperative that legal educators enable the climate-striker generation to critically
  evaluate the role of law in acting as a barrier to or facilitator of positive action on
  climate change. Situating legal doctrines and categories within their broader socio-
  economic function is one way to help students understand the transformative potential
  of law to effect real-world change. Context-free pedagogy reproduces the notion
  that law functions in isolation from other social, economic, moral and environmental

  contexts or that law can be understood purely in its own terms. That approach would
  constrain law students' capabilities to retrieve or extend legal concepts and rules that
  are potentially helpful, and limit their competence and confidence to modify and
  reform those concepts and rules that are unhelpful in addressing climate change.

  The close relationship between affluence and the conditions of climate change5 means
  that effective regulatory approaches to addressing climate change will unavoidably
  involve changes to the legal mechanisms and institutions that facilitate and protect
  wealth generation and concentration. These changes increase the role of government
  and public law in regulating resource extraction and distribution and the control of
  its uses. Closely regulating the private sector is in some ways a contradiction of the
  structure and logic of modern western legal systems and will `test a range of legal
  doctrines intended to protect individual rights against government overreach'.6 This
  makes questions and decisions about effective law reform hard or even unthinkable.
  Nonetheless, law graduates need to be able to not only think about legal change but
  also do the changing. Legal change requires law graduates to have the highest levels
  of knowledge of existing doctrines and regulatory frameworks, so they understand
  which laws need to change and how to go about that work. Law graduates need
  not merely an intellectual openness to change but also the professional competence
  and confidence to develop and implement genuinely consequential changes which are
  likely to be subject to controversy and `sharp, sometimes bitter, legal and political
  contests'.7 Legal education is thus responsible for not only preparing law students for
  practice in the time of climate change with legal knowledge but also preparing them
  with critical competencies and insights to work in an era of transformational legal
  change.

  The ability to collaborate with a wide range of professional specialists who possess
  disciplinary and practical expertise beyond law, to listen to the perspectives and
  experiences of others from a diverse range of cultural and economic backgrounds and
  to strategise and prioritise changes in logical and viable ways may not be competencies
  we consider essential to legal education, and they may not be competencies we

   ourselves (as teachers) have from our own professional experience and training. But
   these are important skills for law students to develop because legal institutions remain
   viable and authoritative over time only to the extent that they are responsive to the
   times in which they operate. The disruptive nature of climate change8 brings an end
   to a paradigm of law that has seemed so viable and authoritative as to be right and
   natural, and it illuminates the reasons for different legal concepts, rules and functions.
   Law teachers could wait for `top-down structural changes to happen over time'9 but
   climate change is a time-sensitive problem and `the rate at which these legal changes
   will be developed' will not wait.10 As legal educators, `we must take up pedagogical
   opportunities to effect change before tipping points are reached beyond which such
   endeavours would be ineffectual'.11

 7. Climate Anxiety

  It is very likely that legal professionals, law students and legal academics engaging
  with and working on climate change related issues will experience `climate anxiety'.
  It is vital to support the emotional wellbeing and psychological resilience of legal
  professionals, law students and law academics. Due to the time lag between the
  emission of GHGs into the atmosphere and the manifestation of climate change
  impacts, many of the negative impacts of climate change will primarily and
  disproportionately affect young people and unborn future generations. According to a
  global survey of 10,000 young people aged 18 to 25, young people understand climate
  change to be the most important issue facing the world.1 There is a growing body of
  evidence linking the pressing issue of climate change to feelings of anxiety, despair,
  powerlessness and anger in young people.2 A perceived lack of government action to
  adequately respond to the climate crisis is associated with increased distress.3 In this
  sense, the phenomenon of climate anxiety is often rooted in the realities of what it
  means to live in a climate-transformed world and in uncertainties about the future.

  For law students who are learning about the role of law in regulating, redressing
  and even contributing to the climate crisis, this experience of climate anxiety may
  be particularly pronounced. On the one hand, to effectively respond to the crisis law
  students need to understand the challenges posed by climate change, as well as the
  systemic inequalities underpinning its causes and distributional impacts. However, it
  is equally important to equip students with the knowledge and skills to respond to
  climate crisis, and to work towards a more climate just future. Indeed, the first decades
  of the 21st century have seen a proliferation of youth-led climate activism, litigation,
  and political engagement, demonstrating that young people are not only affected by

  climate change but are also active agents of change. These youth-led movements and
  legal interventions can serve as a form of `disruptive dissent'4 through which young
  people seek to `transform norms, rules, regulations and institutions within existing
  political and economic structures'.5 Equally, these forums can empower young climate
  activists and amplify historically marginalised voices.6 Thus, when equipped with
  resources not only for understanding the law but also for managing climate emotions,
  law students have the potential to meaningfully contribute to sustainable climate
  action.

  There is a growing body of resources for managing climate anxiety, many of which
  foreground the needs and interests of young people, educators, those working on issues
  related to climate change, and marginalised or otherwise groups that are in situations
  of particular vulnerability to the adverse effects of climate change.7

8. Current and Forthcoming Chapters Outline

This edited collection provides the first detailed resource for law students, academics
and practitioners focused on mainstreaming climate change in legal education in
Australia.

The text contains 29 peer-reviewed chapters covering every core curriculum subject
and many elective offerings delivered in professionally accredited law degrees. Over
50 leading legal educators from 15 Australian universities have (co)authored chapters,
as well as members of the legal profession.

The collection was published in stages, with Tranche 1 published in 2024; Tranche
2 and Tranche 3 published in 2025; Tranche 4 published in early 2026 and some
outstanding final chapters published later in 2026.

This edited collection is regularly updated, with new editions reflecting the rapidly
developing nature of law and legal practice relating to climate change.

Section 1 commences with three foundational chapters that introduce themes cutting
across the other sections of the edited collection. The introductory chapter, `Legal
Education in a Changing Climate', explains the growing need for mainstreaming
climate change in legal education in Australia. Chapter 2, `First Nations, Native Title,
and Climate Change', introduces the central importance of First Nations knowledges
and perspectives for mainstreaming climate change in legal education, and for
developing legal responses to climate change. There is an urgent need for Australian
legal education to confront its colonial foundations and to embed First Nations law and
justice across all aspects of teaching and learning. Many of the chapters in this book
demonstrate the synergies between mainstreaming climate change in legal education
and decolonising the curriculum. The chapter on "Access to Justice and Climate
Change" shows how the challenge of ensuring access to justice in a climate changed
world means approaching lawyering in a way that is ethically grounded, community-
responsive, and resilient.

Section 2 includes chapters on all the core subjects required as part of a professionally

                                                                 68

accredited Australian law program (LLB and the JD courses). These have been
arranged in the order in which they are commonly taught, starting with foundational
subjects such as public law, tort law and criminal law and procedure; moving on to
intermediate subjects such a contract law, land law, constitutional law, administrative
law, company law and equity and trusts and concluding with capstone subject often
taught in the last year of a law degree civil procedure; evidence law and professional
responsibilities and ethics.

Section 3 includes chapters on popular elective offerings delivered in professionally
accredited law degrees. These include some subjects which are compulsory at some
universities such as legal theory and international law, as well as tax law; human rights
law; labour law; intellectual property and technology; public health law; migration
and refugee law; consumer law; strata title; personal and corporate insolvency law.
The section concludes with chapters that offer a more practical perspective on
mainstreaming climate change in legal education in Australia. These chapters
encourage students to think about how they might apply their legal skills in practice,
with chapters on clinical legal education; and public interest litigation.

First Nations peoples have lived and cared for Country, now known as Australia,
for at least 60,000 years. First Nations peoples in Australia have survived significant
climatic change in the past, including two ice ages and rising sea levels. In this
chapter, we argue that becoming a climate conscious lawyer is not possible without the
purposive inclusion of First Nations knowledges and perspectives, and the movement
must be part of the broader process of decolonising both legal education and the
colonial Australian legal system.

                                                                 73

  This chapter will introduce the central importance of First Nations knowledges and
  perspectives for climate conscious lawyers with a case study to illustrate the
  limitations of existing legal systems and responses to climate issues. Also included are
  short introductions to key concepts that are foundational to First Nations culture.

 1. Introduction

  For climate conscious lawyers to be part of any effective responses to the challenges
  posed by climate change, they must be aware and centre the knowledge and wisdom
  of First Nations peoples.1 The Australian settler-colonial legal system was founded
  on the doctrine of terra nullius and the discriminatory belief that First Peoples were
  barbaric peoples without laws.2 Consequently, the settler-colonial legal system has not
  been traditionally effective at listening to First Nations voices, especially on matters
  concerning Country. This chapter will foreground the issue of First Nations rights,
  sovereignties and laws. It will highlight how the violence of settler-colonial law has
  played a key role in causing the climate crisis. Through the use of a case study on
  Gomeroi peoples' fight against coal seam gas (`CSG'), this chapter concludes that any
  transformative response to the current climate crisis must also engage with questions
  of First Nations laws, rights, justice and decolonisation, as these can positively
  influence our ability to respond to climate change.

  Embracing First Nations ways of knowing are consistent with the goal of the
  Australian legal system to provide recognition justice for historical exclusion as well
  as procedural justice through inclusivity of First Nations peoples.3 These goals were
  introduced in the first chapter of this book.

  The term `Country' has been deliberately capitalised in this chapter, to emphasise its
  fundamental place in First Nations laws and cultures. It denotes more than the land,
  encompassing water, sea, air, animals and plants4 -- that is, the entire ecosystem in
  its widest sense. This approach is consistent with First Peoples' ontologies which

      peoples of Country.

   things.5

  1.1 The Historical Setting

   Colonisation was driven by the perceived need to provide the `necessities of life' from
   a European world view.6 The British colonisation of Australia coincided with the first
   industrial revolution and the emergence of new technologies, a shift to fossil fuels to
   generate energy, and large-scale land clearing for mining, pastoralism and agriculture.7
   8 Since 1788, these activities have continued largely unchecked, with First Peoples'
   ancient laws and knowledges effectively silenced under the settler-colonial myth of
   terra nullius.

   First Nations have consistently asserted the right to care for Country and opposed
   mining where it has posed a threat to the environment and sacred cultural sites.9
   Historically the settler-colonial legal system denied First Peoples citizenship and
   legal personality, with virtually no formal avenues to challenge activities which were
   harmful to Country.10 It was not until the 1970s that First Peoples used the Australian

                                                                                                                                                                   78

   legal system to attempt to stop mining and extractive industries on Country.11 The
   introduction of Aboriginal land rights legislation, cultural heritage laws12 and later the
   Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) (`NTA') created mechanisms to enable the return of lands
   and to raise objections about proposed land uses.13 These processes have however been
   limited in their capacity to address First Peoples' obligations to Country and in many
   ways have maintained colonial dominance over First Peoples.14

   In this context, First Peoples' caring for Country needs to be understood as an
   expression of our enduring laws and sovereignties, which continue irrespective of
   whether the settler-colonial legal system decides to recognise them or not.15 As Ngalia
   man Kado Muir has stated, native title recognition inevitably raises the question of
   `to what extent this dominant group is prepared to tolerate the operation of Indigenous
   laws in parallel to its own laws'.16 This lies at the heart of First Peoples' attempts to use
   the settler-colonial legal system to protect Country and mitigate the impacts of climate
   change. We do this not because we acquiesce to the settler-colonial state's assumed
   jurisdiction over us but because our laws mandate that we must protect Country for
   future generations.17 We simply must use whatever avenues are available to protect
   Country, kin and culture by asserting our custodial responsibilities and speaking back
   to colonial power.

  1.2 First Peoples Knowledges and Climate Change

   Calls for increased prioritisation of First Nations knowledges in current issues facing
   our society are not new.18 Tanganekald, Meintangk, Bunganditj and Potaruwutj scholar
   Irene Watson has written extensively on the enduring existence of First Nations
   peoples and their laws. More recently, there have been calls for a more holistic
   approach to climate change and the reform of legal education by re-centring First
   Nations knowledges and embracing a human rights informed engagement with First
   Nations peoples.19 This chapter reiterates those calls and argues that First Peoples
   knowledges and laws are essential to addressing climate change.

   The need to re-centre and engage with First Nations knowledges continues to be
   urgent, as there is a critical need for different perspectives on proposed climate change
   solutions such as the rise and expansion of green energy. While initially attractive,
   green energy projects such as large scale solar and wind farms carry implications for
   Country and its flora and fauna. If these projects are designated on Country for which
   First Nations peoples have custodianship, First Peoples' laws and the obligations to
   care for Country must be prioritised.20 The extraction of rare earth minerals -- vital to
   the renewable energy transition -- carries significant consequences for First Peoples,
   while also posing serious threats to the environment and biodiversity.21 With over 50%
   of rare earth minerals deposits on lands held by First Nations, there is an urgent need

   to work in partnership with First Peoples to ensure that Country and our rights are
   respected.22

   First Nations peoples' obligations to Country are part of our culture of relationality,
   as reflected in Indigenous notions of sovereignty which encompass an obligation to
   maintain Country for the benefit of future generations.23 Kombumerri and Waka Waka
   philosopher Mary Graham explains relationality as `the goodness of our relationship
   with nature, rather than nature itself ... when we can speak to the nurturing of a
   relationship, we are in a better position to articulate our shared responsibility'.24 The
   culture and insights of First Nations views on Country have been practised for at least
   60,000 years in Australia. First Peoples in Australia have also survived climate change
   in the past, including two ice ages and rising sea levels.25 Climate conscious lawyers
   have much to gain from respecting this knowledge and wisdom and championing the
   wider perspectives it can bring on responses to climate change.

   Knowledge of international human rights law must also inform climate conscious
   lawyers of the future, and particularly international law which is centred on First
   Nations rights. The pre-eminent example of this is the United Nations Declaration on
   the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (`UNDRIP').26 Article 25 of UNDRIP states:

               Indigenous peoples have the right to maintain and strengthen their
               distinctive spiritual relationship with their traditionally owned or otherwise
               occupied and used lands, territories, waters and coastal seas and other

               resources and to uphold their responsibilities to future generations in this
               regard.

   UNDRIP also confirms First Peoples' right to self-determination, and the need for free
   prior and informed consent (`FPIC') with respect to activities that may impact First
   Nations lands.27 The authors agree with Irene Watson that First Nations rights to self-
   determination must be more than a simple right to be consulted in a process where the
   final approval is granted by another.28 The question of what constitutes FPIC under
   UNDRIP is one that looms large for climate conscious lawyers.29 We argue that settler-
   colonial laws are currently silent on FPIC, especially the NTA, where there is no right
   for First Peoples to veto proposals which are detrimental to Country.30 The evolving
   native title system in Australia must be considered in the context of First Nations
   knowledges and climate change. In the case study in this chapter, the impact of native
   title with its vision of traditional owners advocating for Country is central. However,
   the native title system is not without its limitations, as the following case study shows.

                                                 KEY QUESTIONS

                      Why should First Nations knowledges be considered by climate
                        conscious lawyers advocating on climate change matters?

                      How will centring First Nations relationships to Country alter the
                        legal system's ability to respond to climate change?

                      Do you think there is more that can be done to include First
                        Nations knowledges? How could this best be achieved?

 2. Case Study: Native Title and Climate Change

 2.1 Gomeroi People and the Pilliga

  Over the last 50 years, significant areas of Country have been returned to First
  Nations under land rights and native title processes.1 With approximately 60% of
  mining projects occurring in close proximity to First Nations communities,2 there is
  an inextricable link between mining on First Peoples' Country and climate change.
  First Peoples must have the opportunity to influence the scale and scope of mining and
  associated climate change impacts. However, all governments are reliant on mining
  royalties to fund services for all Australians. The NTA provides for First Peoples
  the right to negotiate (`RTN') with mining and government parties in relation to
  future acts that may affect their native title rights and interests. There is also a huge
  power imbalance between First Nations, governments and mining companies in these
  negotiations.3 The potential for First Nations to use the native title system to mitigate
  against the impacts of climate change is explored in this case study.

  The Gomeroi peoples' fight against CSG in the Pilliga provides an example of First
  Nations interventions into the Australian legal system to protect Country against
  climate change. Gomeroi peoples' resistance also highlights how environmental and
  native title laws have largely failed to support First Peoples' obligations to protect
  Country for future generations. This case study will examine the proposed Santos
  Narrabri Gas Project (`NGP') and how Gomeroi peoples' objections were disregarded
  by both state and Commonwealth environmental assessment processes. It will then
  explore the NTA future acts process for the NGP, which at first instance authorised the

   project to proceed.4 Gomeroi peoples successfully appealed this determination in the
   Federal Court in 2024, a decision which had the potential to change how First Peoples'
   obligations to care for Country and broader environmental factors are considered
   under the NTA.5 However, on remittal of the case to the National Native Title Tribunal
   (`NNTT') the project was found to be in the `public interest' and approved subject to
   conditions, as will be discussed below.6

  2.2 Santos Narrabri Gas Project

   The proposed NGP covers 95,000 hectares in the heart of Gomeroi Country, south-
   west of Narrabri, including the Pilliga forest, a place of cultural and spiritual
   significance to Gomeroi peoples. It sits within the Gomeroi native title claim area,
   which was registered in January 2012.7

   Santos contends the NGP will make a significant contribution to the NSW economy,
   providing 50% of the domestic gas supply over 25 years.8 The projected greenhouse
   gas (`GHG') emissions from the NGP would represent less than 1% of all GHG
   emissions from Australia, and approximately half that of coal-powered energy.9 The
   NGP also relies heavily on water drawn from the Great Artesian Basin, with an
   estimated 4 million litres needed per day to sustain the operation. Santos argues
   that the NGP is in the public interest because it would provide a secure source of
   energy to support the transition to renewable energy. It also asserts that the NGP
   would bring positive economic and social benefits for NSW, through employment,
   royalties and tax revenue -- including $5.4 billion from gas sales, $3.1 billion in
   royalties and a $120 million community benefit fund.10 The NGP is also claimed to
   benefit local Aboriginal communities through the development of cultural heritage and

   environmental programs, training and business development, and employment.11 The
   NGP has been the subject of state and federal environmental assessment processes,
   and most recently a future act determination under the NTA. The outcomes from these
   processes will be discussed below.

  2.3 Gamil Means `No'!12

   Gomeroi peoples have consistently defended their deep connections to and obligations
   to care for Country in the face of environmental destruction and so-called
   development. As the Gomeroi Tribal Nation has stated:

               Gomeroi People hold inherent rights in our [C]ountry that were never traded,
               given or signed away. We the people of the Gomeroi Nation have continued
               to maintain our cultural identity and practices. As Gomeroi people we
               recognise our custodianship and ownership rights in [C]ountry, including
               our unique responsibility to care for land and water, the ecosystem and
               places of cultural significance ... We have cultural obligations to protect our
               [C]ountry and our special places.13

   Gomeroi peoples' responsibilities to care for Country have been asserted throughout
   the NGP environmental assessment and approval processes, with objections raised
   on cultural and environmental grounds. The environmental assessment process was
   criticised for failing to consider Gomeroi cultural values which could have informed
   its recommendations.14 Gomeroi peoples also argued that the environmental
   assessment failed to recognise the role of Aboriginal people to `determine the cultural
   value of a place or objects'.15 Concerns were also raised about the impact of the

   NGP on `water and our spiritual and cultural traditions ... associated with water', the
   cumulative impacts of development and intergenerational equity.16 In short, Gomeroi
   peoples asserted that the NGP would have `direct and irreversible impacts' to
   Aboriginal cultural heritage (including intangible cultural values associated with the
   landscape and flora and fauna).17

   Throughout the NGP environmental assessment process Gomeroi peoples have
   consistently said `gamil' -- which means `no' in Gamilaraay and associated
   languages. As Jared Field explains it, we have:

               ... one small gift `gamil'. It is the word, as in many east coast First Nations,
               that my mob take our namesake from: gamil means no. Otherwise put, the
               word we use to describe ourselves -- Gamilaraay -- teaching others how
               we decline to give consent.18

   Field urges all people to accept this gift and refuse to allow our land, waters and
   collective future to be threatened.19

   In 2020, `Gamil Means No' became the catchcry of protesters who took to the streets
   in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Canberra to oppose the NGP.20 However, as will
   be shown below, the environmental and native title approval processes do not afford
   First Nations the right to say `no' to stop the destruction of Country. Such processes
   do not hear `gamil' and consequently stand in the way of First Nations obligations to
   care for Country.

  2.4 State and Federal Environmental Processes

   Despite Gomeroi peoples' opposition to the NGP, both the NSW and federal
   governments granted approvals for the project in 2020.21 Gomeroi peoples' concerns
   about the `direct and irreversible impacts' to Aboriginal cultural heritage were ignored.
   22 Santos' environmental impact statement considered Gomeroi peoples' cultural
   heritage in terms of `stones and bones' (ie physical artefacts, or tangible cultural
   heritage), without any regard to the intangible aspects of Gomeroi peoples' culture and
   spiritual connections to Country.23 The fact there had been significant land disturbance
   in the NGP area was cited as a reason to minimise Gomeroi peoples' concerns.24 For
   Santos, any potential risks to Gomeroi cultural heritage could be managed through
   social and community programs, housing and employment.25 Gomeroi peoples'
   cultural obligations to care for Country were deemed to be either negligible or
   negotiable in exchange for social and economic benefits.

   The NSW Government Independent Planning Commission (`IPC') approved the NGP
   in September 2020.26 It concluded that:

               ... the potential impacts associated with the Project are manageable, and the
               risks of adverse impacts on the environment are low. The likely benefits
               of the project warrant the conclusions that an appropriately conditioned
               approval is in the public interest.27

   Aboriginal cultural heritage research,28 Gomeroi peoples strongly opposed the post-
   approval approach to cultural heritage assessment, calling it `fundamentally flawed'
   and totally unacceptable to Gomeroi Elders and custodians. These concerns fell on
   deaf ears.29

   The NGP was then referred to the federal government for assessment, and its approval
   was granted in November 2020.30 The federal government's approval was subject to
   additional conditions to protect biodiversity in the Pilliga and any potential impacts on
   groundwater aquifers.31

   Gomeroi peoples' reaction to the federal government's approval of the NGP captured
   the mood of First Peoples at the time, just months after the destruction of Juukan
   Gorge, an area sacred to the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura peoples, by mining
   giant Rio Tinto.32 Gomeroi woman Linda Whitten said:

               It wasn't a surprise ... But it still doesn't make you feel good ... I'm
               devastated for my people. Because now we have to continue the fight and
               when does it end.33

   Gomeroi traditional owner Aunty Polly Cutmore also said:

               This is just another example of attempted, devastating colonialism, only
               now instead of hiding behind the fence, we're at the table ... Gomeroi
               people are coming together, the whole Gomeroi Nation are talking about

               the destruction of the gas mining, especially to the Great Artesian Basin ...
               That's the number one fight we have -- to save the Great Artesian Basin.34

   Following a failed challenge to the IPC approval by local farmers,35 Gomeroi peoples
   continued their resistance through native title processes, determined to protect Country
   for future generations.

  2.5 The Native Title Future Acts Regime

   The NTA was introduced as the federal government's response to the High Court's
   decision in Mabo v Queensland (No. 2) (`Mabo'), which found that the Meriam
   peoples were `entitled as against the whole world to possession, occupation, use and
   enjoyment of the lands of the Murray Islands' in accordance with their traditional laws
   and customs.36 While the Mabo decision is widely credited as rejecting the settler-
   colonial myth of terra nullius, the effects of the decision were limited to dealings in
   land, and not to questions of sovereignty.37

   The NTA established a process for native title claims with reference to the rights
   and interests held under First Peoples' traditional laws and customs.38 It created a
   system for validating past acts granting interests in land that may otherwise be invalid
   due to the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 (Cth).39 The NTA also allows for the
   `extinguishment' of native title where it is inconsistent with the interests granted to
   other parties.40

   Future acts which may affect native title are also covered by the NTA, with claimants
   who have passed the native title registration test afforded the RTN with proponents

   and governments on future acts.41 However, the RTN does not give First Nations a
   `veto' right, or the right to say `no'.42 The NTA require parties to `negotiate in good
   faith with a view to obtaining the agreement of the native title parties to the doing of
   the act'.43 The NTA does not hear `gamil' -- it does not allow Gomeroi peoples to say
   `no' to the destruction of Country.

   If parties cannot reach agreement within six months they can refer the matter to the
   NNTT, which has the power to refuse or allow the act (with or without conditions).44
   However, the NNTT's power to refuse future acts has rarely been exercised, and then
   only in circumstances where the proposed future act would impact areas integral to the
   groups' culture and connection to Country.45 The NNTT may also refuse a future act
   where the proponent has not negotiated in good faith.46

   Going to the NNTT also carries risks for native title parties because the tribunal cannot
   impose conditions which would enable payments based on `the amount of profits
   made; any income derived, or things produced' as a result of the future act.47 Not
   surprisingly the NTA has been criticised for allowing proponents to adopt a `take-it or
   leave-it' approach to future act negotiations.48 The RTN only allows First Nations a
   seat at the table, and an opportunity to negotiate for `social and economic benefits' in
   exchange for the destruction of Country, law and culture.49 Clearly the NTA future act

   processes fall short of the right of FPIC as required by UNDRIP.50 We argue that First
   Peoples' obligations to Country need to be re-centred to address climate change and
   ensure a healthy environment for future generations.

  2.6 Gomeroi Native Title Claim

   The Gomeroi native title claim covers some 100,000 km2 and passed the native title
   registration test in January 2012.51 Despite being in the native title system for more
   than a decade there is still critical evidence needed before the claim can be decided.52
   Notwithstanding the lengthy claim process, the real business of native title continues.53
   Santos applied for four petroleum leases under the Petroleum (Onshore) Act 1991
   (NSW) to extract CSG from the project area in May 2014.54 Although negotiations
   between Santos and Gomeroi people started in 2011, the parties have not reached an
   agreement. In May 2021, Santos applied for a future act determination for the NGP
   under the NTA.55

   In March 2022, Gomeroi peoples voted overwhelmingly to oppose the NGP.56 In doing
   so, Gomeroi peoples were aware they would be excluded from a range of benefits they
   may otherwise receive. As a media release from Gomeroi peoples stated:

               We know that, by going down this path and trying to protect our [C]ountry,

               we run the risk of not getting any compensation at all from Santos. [But]
               that's the way the Native Title Act is.57

   For Gomeroi peoples, the love of Country and maintaining Gomeroi law and culture
   for future generations were more important than money.

  2.7 The Public Interest in Caring for Country

   Before the NNTT and Federal Court, Gomeroi peoples argued that the NGP should be
   refused because it was against the public interest in:

               Seeking to mitigate and prevent the worst likely effects of global warming,
               which has consequences at the global, national and local levels; and

               The preservation and continuity of the culture and society that underpins the
               Gomeroi People's traditional law [sic] and custom.58

   Expert evidence from Professor Steffan on behalf of Gomeroi peoples was that the
   NGP would contribute to GHG emissions and climate change, with the effect of
   increasing the intensity and frequency of heatwaves, bushfires, droughts, sand and
   dust storms, and heavy rainfall, together with rising sea levels and coastal flooding.59
   Professor Steffan concluded that the NGP was inconsistent with the objectives of the
   2015 Paris Agreement and not in the public interest due to its detrimental impact on
   the environment, the economy and human health.60 Further, the NGP was inconsistent
   with recommendations of the International Energy Agency that no new fossil fuel
   projects be approved, to stop global warming and the impacts of climate change.61 62

   Gomeroi peoples argued that the NGP would disrupt their cultural obligations to care

   for Country, including flora and fauna; their social, economic and cultural structures;
   and native title rights.63 They also argued that the NGP would have a detrimental
   impact on the Pilliga due to the fragmentation of vegetation zones and risks of
   groundwater contamination, especially the Great Artesian Basin, a critical water
   supply which if polluted poses a threat to all life on Gomeroi Country.64 Importantly,
   Gomeroi peoples asserted that long-term environmental considerations should prevail
   over the commercial gains of a few.65 They urged the NNTT to make a fresh decision,
   and consider new evidence relating to climate change that was not before the IPC or
   federal Minister.66

   Both Santos and the NSW government disputed that Gomeroi peoples had obligations
   to care for Country, and that the NGP would have detrimental impacts on the Pilliga.67
   The state asserted that Gomeroi people had not established the Pilliga as a place of
   spiritual significance to Gomeroi people.68 They argued that any impact on native title
   rights and interests would be minimal and temporary.69 Both submitted that the NNTT
   and Federal Court should follow the decision of the IPC, which had approved the
   NGP based on substantial scientific evidence, finding that the project was in the public
   interest.70 Further the IPC's decision had been subject to judicial review and should
   not be re-litigated before the NNTT.71

   The key issue before the NNTT was the interpretation of s 39(1) of the NTA, which
   sets out the matters that must be considered in making a future act determination,

63. Ibid [55].

64. Ibid [173]; Jenkins (n 33).

65. Gomeroi FC (n 5) [173]. Gomeroi peoples also contended that Santos had not negotiated in good faith, and therefore
       the NNTT was precluded from making a determination. This argument was rejected in both Gomeroi NNTT (n 4)
       [466]-[467] and Gomeroi FC (n 5) [82]-[98].

   and in particular s 39(1)(e), the `public interest'.72 While NNTT Member Dowsett
   accepted that GHG emissions are harmful to the environment, he found the Native
   Title Amendment Act 1998 (Cth) expressly excluded consideration of environmental
   issues unless there was a `particular environmental concern having a particular effect
   on native title' under s 39(1)(f), other relevant matters.73 Member Dowsett also found
   that environmental matters were excluded from consideration under s 39(1)(e), the
   public interest.74

   The NNTT found that Gomeroi peoples had not established that the Pilliga or the NGP
   area were places of cultural significance to Gomeroi peoples.75 Nor had they provided
   evidence of the exercise of native title rights and interests in the project area.76 It
   also determined that Gomeroi peoples' concerns were outweighed by the `significant
   public interest in the responsible exploitation of gas reserves'.77 The NNTT approved
   the NGP on the condition that an additional research program be undertaken to assess
   Aboriginal cultural heritage in the project area to inform the siting of infrastructure and
   avoid damage to cultural sites.78 In reaching his conclusions, Member Dowsett stated
   that climate change is a `worldwide phenomenon' which cannot be resolved by the
   NNTT, but rather is `a matter for governments'.79

   Gomeroi peoples successfully appealed the NNTT decision in the Federal Court in
   Gomeroi People v Santos NSW Pty Ltd and Santos NSW (Narrabri Gas) Pty Ltd
   [2024].80 Chief Justice Mortimer (with O'Brien J concurring) found that the NNTT
   had taken an unnecessarily narrow view of the public interest and that environmental
   factors may be considered under both s 39(1)(e), the public interest, and s 39(1)(f),

   other relevant matters.81 The Federal Court found that the NNTT had failed to exercise
   its distinct function of assessing future acts from the perspective of the native title
   group, which Mortimer CJ characterised as the tribunal's `veto' right over
   development.82 Consequently, Mortimer CJ found that Gomeroi peoples had been
   denied the possibility of a successful outcome, and the matter was remitted to the
   NNTT to decide according to the court's reasoning and `the law'.83

  2.8 The NNTT Determination

   Upon remittal to the NNTT, President Smith and Members Eaton and Kelly observed
   that the task before them was `an unprecedented future act determination' given
   the Federal Court's broad interpretation of the public interest.84 The Tribunal heard
   additional evidence from Gomeroi peoples about their cosmology and the relationship
   to the Pilliga; Gomeroi cultural values relating to land, water and peoples; and how
   the NGP will impact the physical environment and flora and fauna.85 Evidence on the
   climate change impacts included stress on water resources, mass deaths of wildlife
   and threatened animal species, impacts on food gathering and ceremony, and negative
   impacts on human health, including physical and mental health, and cultural and
   spiritual wellbeing.86 From Gomeroi peoples' perspective, the Pilliga is viewed as `an
   indivisible whole' that cannot be reduced to its constituent parts.87 Further, the NGP
   would have a significant impact on Gomeroi peoples' culture and way of life, and
   enjoyment of native title rights and interests.88

   The Tribunal agreed that the Gomeroi evidence demonstrated:

               ... there is an unquestioned scheme of things in which the spirit ancestors,
               the people of the clan, particular land and everything that exists on and in it,
               are organic parts of one indissoluble whole ...89

   However, it found that any risks to Gomeroi culture and way of life were `limited,
   manageable and acceptable' and could be mitigated with suitable conditions.90

   The NNTT interpreted the public interest broadly, including native title recognition
   and `preserving' Aboriginal culture, and the impacts of GHG on global warming.91
   Although the NNTT accepted that any GHG emissions would contribute to global
   warming, it urged a `commonsense approach' and limited considerations to the future
   act in question, and not the cumulative effects of GHG emissions and climate change.92

   The NNTT focused on three key issues relating to the public interest: energy security,
   environmental protection and social impact.93 It found the public benefit in ensuring a
   secure domestic gas supply to support the transition to renewable energy outweighed
   concerns about climate change and the impacts on Gomeroi culture and lifestyle.94
   With respect to the environment, the NNTT noted that the IPC conditions were
   sufficient to protect the environment and water, biodiversity and the risk of fires.95
   Although the NNTT found a direct link between the NGP and local climate change
   impacts, it determined that the full consequences of climate change could not be
   attributed to the NGP.96 Further, the NNTT found that the absence of a reliable, secure
   source of energy would have detrimental social impacts, and thus the NGP provided a
   net public benefit.97

    The NNTT concluded that there was `strong utility' in Gomeroi peoples being
    involved in the management of the Pilliga to assist to mitigate the environmental
    effects of the NGP, including climate change,98 recognising that:

                Gomeroi people are experts in their traditional knowledge systems as they
                relate to the environment, and this traditional knowledge will bolster and
                strengthen the regime which has already been put in place to manage and
                mitigate the implications of the Project.99

    The NGP was approved with conditions to establish a Gomeroi ranger program
    to monitor and mitigate the environmental impacts of the project.100 The NNTT
    also noted the deficiency of NSW cultural heritage laws and endorsed the IPC
    recommendation for a further cultural heritage study (including intangible cultural
    heritage) and that Gomeroi representatives be included in cultural heritage
    management protocols.101 While these conditions go some way to addressing Gomeroi
    peoples' concerns, they fall short of the requirements of UNDRIP. They put Gomeroi
    peoples in the unenviable position of bearing witness to the destruction of Country,
    while remaining powerless to stop it. Whether these conditions will enable Gomeroi
    peoples `to uphold their responsibilities to future generations' remains to be seen.102

   2.9 Gomeroi Conclusions

    The Gomeroi peoples' successful appeal to the Federal Court created an opportunity
    for the NTA future act regime to become an effective brake on fossil fuel projects
    which contribute to climate change when it is deemed to be in the public interest.
    However, when remitted to the NNTT, concerns about the environment and climate
    change were found to be outweighed by the public interest in ensuring a secure
    domestic gas supply to support the transition to renewable energy. In making this

      97

    decision, the NNTT considered the NGP in isolation, and not the cumulative effects
    of GHG emissions. This myopic approach to dealing with climate change stands in
    stark contrast to Gomeroi peoples' lawful obligations to look after Country for future
    generations.

    Gomeroi traditional owner Aunty Polly Cutmore said of the NNTT decision: `we
    live in a colonial system and the judgement was done by people who haven't taken
    consideration of us.'103 While writing this chapter in May 2025, the east coast of
    NSW was inundated with `unprecedented' rainfall and devastating flooding. As the
    impacts of climate change continue to intensify, is it possible that we may reach a
    `tipping point' where the public interest in protecting Country against climate change
    outweighs the use of fossil fuels to support the transition to a renewable energy future?
    This is a question only the settler-colonial legal system can answer. However, for
    Gomeroi peoples there is no choice. As Aunty Polly Cutmore says: `We are still here
    and will continue to fight. We love our country.'104

    The Gomeroi peoples' fight against the NGP highlights how state-centred
    environmental laws maintain colonial dominance over First Peoples by usurping the
    power to make decisions with respect to Country and thus denying First Peoples'
    obligations to care for Country. It also highlights how the NTA has mostly been
    ineffective in ensuring First Peoples' custodial imperatives are honoured and
    respected.

    The federal government's parliamentary inquiry into the destruction of Juukan Gorge
    found that NTA future act negotiations do not operate on a level playing field.105
    If native title parties do not agree, proponents can go to the NNTT confident they
    have a 98% chance of getting approval.106 The inquiry recommended a review of
    the NTA future acts regime, which is now underway.107 The Australian Law Reform

    Commission's review will examine ways to ensure the `fair and efficient operation'
    of the system as essential to First Peoples maintaining their `distinctive cultural,
    spiritual, physical and economic relationship' with Country.108 Bringing the NTA into
    line with UNDRIP and the right of FPIC would go some way to ensuring our custodial
    responsibilities to Country can be upheld for the benefit of future generations.109
    There is an urgent need for a fundamental shift in power relations to acknowledge the
    lawful obligations of First Peoples to protect Country under First Nations laws. These
    obligations must not be confined by the NTA or the economic imperatives of state and
    corporate actors. This moral imperative is a concern not just for First Peoples but for
    all people who value life on the planet.

 3. Conclusion

  This chapter stresses the importance of actively consulting and meaningfully listening
  to First Nations peoples on matters relating to climate change. The cultural
  imperative for First Nations communities in Australia has always been, and will
  always be, to care for Country. This chapter argues that there is a need for a variety
  of mechanisms for asserting the rights of First Nations peoples to Country. The range
  of mechanisms includes land rights, native title, environmental approval regimes
  and cultural heritage laws. There is no clear-cut pathway within the settler-colonial
  legal system which will suffice to advance the interests of First Nations peoples
  and their relational, custodial obligations to Country; instead, a variety of different
  mechanisms will need to be activated by First Nations peoples. Where it exists in
  Australia, human rights legislation can provide another mechanism for asserting the
  rights of First Nations people to Country.1 However, human rights are anthropocentric,
  and part of the problem is that Country is not centred within the coloniser's legislative
  and common law frameworks, while humans are. Therefore, the various human rights
  Acts can only ever be part of the response to First Nations issues, and the system
  has inherent limitations. In this context, it is interesting to record recent jurisprudence
  in Aotearoa New Zealand, where the Whanganui River was recognised to have legal
  standing.2 Expansion of legal standing to non-human entities could be the first step in
  a worldwide recognition that environmental concerns and First Nations conceptions of
  relationality as extending beyond humanity can and must be prioritised.

  On-Country knowledge from traditional First Nations custodians must form part of
  any transformative response to the current climate crisis by climate conscious lawyers.
  In such contexts, it is essential that climate conscious lawyers possess cultural
  awareness and humility and do not inadvertently appropriate First Nations cultural
  knowledge or seek to advocate on behalf of First Nations peoples by taking up the
  space that should be given over to First Nations voices.

We argue that becoming a climate conscious lawyer is not possible without the
purposive inclusion of First Nations knowledges and perspectives, and the movement
must be part of the process of decolonising both legal education and the settler-colonial
Australian legal system. Students, academics and practitioners must ensure that First
Nations knowledges are centred and not appropriated.

This chapter has invited you to consider the impact of Australia's colonial history
on First Nations peoples and Country. Now being more aware of the injustices and
the ongoing impacts, you should have greater appreciation for why climate conscious
lawyers need to engage with First Nations knowledges in any matter where Country is
potentially being impacted. It is essential that local First Nations voices, particularly
those with a strong connection to specific Country, are included to strengthen the
broader arguments being made about the climate change impacts of proposed
developments. This is crystallised in the phrase:

Listen to us! Care for Country!

Lawyers play an important role in society. Every day, lawyers help people resolve
disputes and understand their legal rights and obligations. Lawyers also support
institutional accountability and due process and contribute towards upholding the rule
of law. One of the most important features of a healthy democracy is equality before
the law and effective access to justice. Making sure that everyone in society (not just
the rich and powerful) can access justice is fundamentally the role of lawyers and the
legal profession.
In recent years, lawyers and legal scholars have been thinking about climate change as
a barrier to accessing justice. This chapter explores the connection between law, legal
systems, climate change, poverty and marginalisation. It examines what it means to be
an effective lawyer working to support access to justice in the Anthropocene.

 1. Poverty and Climate Change

                                               KEY QUESTIONS
                    What is access to justice?
                    How does climate change affect access to justice?

  We have known for decades that climate change excessively affects people living
  in poverty and those marginalised.1 This is clear whenever a climate-fuelled disaster
  strikes, like a bushfire or a flood. These disasters exacerbate social inequities and
  create a range of `everyday' legal problems such as tenancy, insurance, employment
  and discrimination law. People living in poverty or who are marginalised in Australia
  are disproportionately impacted by climate change due to inadequate income, poor
  housing and limited access to necessary social supports and health services. Poverty
  is not their fault; it is due to the way in which our social structures and systems
  have created the circumstances for poverty and social exclusion to thrive. Poverty is a
  structural issue that requires systemic solutions, and lawyers can use their legal skills
  to increase equity and access to justice across our society.
  Access to justice is a multidimensional concept.2 It focuses on the law's unequal
  relationship with different cohorts of society. Access to justice incorporates different
  dimensions of justice. As you can see in Figure 1, these include distributive justice
  (fairness in outcomes), procedural justice (fairness in processes), recognition justice
  (redressing cultural and social marginalisation) and interconnection, which sits around
  the circles as a meta-justice consideration.

 2. Australia's Legal Assistance Sector

                                                KEY QUESTION
                    What is the legal assistance sector, and how does it assist

                      people at risk of climate change?

  In Australia, providing access to justice is largely undertaken by the legal assistance
  sector, our national legal safety net for poor and marginalised populations. This
  sector provides essential, free, public legal services to population groups who often
  experience multiple and intersecting legal needs. They include women and children,
  young people, people on low incomes, people from culturally diverse backgrounds,
  Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, people with disabilities and people who
  are incarcerated.

  A diverse mix of organisational providers make up the Australian legal assistance
  sector. Some, like legal aid commissions, are very large, providing statewide legal
  services. In contrast, community legal centres can be relatively small. They are often
  place-based organisations that are embedded within a local geographic community.
  Lawyers working in the private legal profession also come under the umbrella of the
  legal assistance sector workforce if they deliver pro bono or low bono services (free or
  reduced services) -- often in partnership with community legal centres -- or through
  grants of legal aid in criminal, civil and family law matters.1

  This variety of legal service providers means that the legal assistance sector is
  commonly described as a `mixed model' sector. There are significant benefits to
  having a diversity of service providers catering to different communities and areas of
  law, but a mixed model can also bring challenges, especially around service funding,

1. According to National Legal Aid, in 2022-23, 72 per cent of legal aid matters were assigned to private practitioners:
      Impact Economics and Policy, Justice on the Brink: Stronger Legal Aid for a Better Legal System (National Legal Aid,
      2023).
                                                                   107
                                                                                                                                                                108

  collaboration and coordination. However, despite the variety, scale and type of legal
  assistance that these organisations provide, they all share a common aspiration: that
  all people, regardless of financial, social, cultural, linguistic, racial, geographic,
  environmental or climate barriers, deserve access to justice.

   Figure 3: Australian legal assistance sector. Source: From Monica Taylor, `Striving for Climate Justice: The
   Role of the Australian Legal Assistance Sector in Responding to Climate Change-Informed Civil Law Needs'
   (PhD Thesis, Queensland University of Technology, 2025), used under CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

  The legal assistance sector is guided by a National Strategic Framework for Legal
  Assistance.2 The National Strategic Framework encourages a unified and coordinated
  approach to legal service delivery, to ensure that the justice system is focused on areas
  of greatest legal need. It describes the overarching purpose of legal assistance services
  funded by the government as intending to help:

              ... vulnerable people facing disadvantage, who are unable to afford private
              legal services, to access and engage effectively with legal solutions and the
              justice system in order to address their legal problems.3
  Six key principles guide the sector to achieve this objective: (1) service delivery
  is focused on people facing disadvantage; (2) services are appropriate and client
  centred; (3) services are delivered collaboratively and through integrated approaches;
  (4) responses are appropriately timed and include preventative action; (5) services

  empower people and communities, and build resilience; and (6) services are supported
  to continuously learn and improve.4

 2.1 The Rise of Disaster Legal Services

  In recent years there has been a sharp increase in public funding for the legal assistance
  sector to deliver climate related legal help, often in the disaster recovery space.
  Disaster legal help is recognised as an important element in supporting individuals and
  communities to recover from devastating extreme weather events. Research shows that
  people impacted by climate disasters find it difficult to associate that event with their
  subsequent legal problems.5 This can make it difficult for legal services to know the
  best way to help their clients, when clients themselves don't realise they even have
  legal problems after a disaster. This is especially difficult when problems take years
  to surface and are often harder to resolve than non-disaster related legal problems.6
  As climate change continues to intensify, we can expect to see more funding for the
  legal assistance sector to deliver increasing amounts of disaster legal assistance. This
  will require access to justice organisations to develop and deepen their organisational
  resilience to climate change in the coming years.7

 3. Building Organisational Resilience to Climate
 Change

  As a future lawyer who cares about access to justice, you will likely work in a range
  of workplaces that form part of the legal assistance sector. It is important that these
  workplaces are organisationally resilient. What does this mean? Organisations need to
  be well designed, adaptive and sustainable. They need to have what is called adaptive
  capacity -- the ability to adjust to potential shocks, take advantage of opportunities
  and respond to consequences. Legal assistance sector organisations need to make
  strategic short- and long-term decisions to plan for and respond to the negative and
  positive implications of climate change across their workplaces.1 Staff need to feel
  supported and able to cope with climate and disaster-related legal work, and they
  should have access to training to grow their professional skill sets. It also means
  that leaders within these workplaces understand the importance of taking a climate
  conscious approach to legal work (see The Legal Profession and Climate Change) and
  that organisations are adequately funded to work proactively to prevent legal harm
  from climate change, rather than reactively responding to the after-effects of climate
  impacts. Legal protections through law reform and community legal education are
  essential, together with strong networks and collaboration, infrastructure and
  resourcing.2 Next, we explore adaptive capacity by taking a close look at some key
  individual skill sets needed to deliver access to justice in the Anthropocene.

   breaking floods. Northern Rivers Community Legal Centre was at the heart of this
   climate driven disaster: both of its premises were destroyed, and many staff
   members suffered personal losses. In 2023, Community Legal Centres NSW
   produced a short film documenting the community legal centre's experience, and
   its work in responding to the floods. The film shows how the disaster affected the
   organisation's people and services, and it highlights how a changing climate
   intensifies legal needs. Even after losing its offices, the Northern Rivers
   Community Legal Centre was instrumental in helping the local population rebuild,
   by offering free legal and social work assistance to those displaced at evacuation
   hubs and later at disaster recovery centres. Beyond the immediate physical and
   emotional toll, events like these often exacerbate legal problems -- for example,
   disputes over insurance, housing and tenancy, income and social security, debt
   and credit, family violence and family law matters, and the loss or destruction of
   important documents such as wills.

4. Key Ingredients for Delivering Access to Justice in
a Climate Changed World

There is a particular skill set needed for legal practitioners to deliver effective access
to justice in a climate changed world. Drawing on our combined expertise as lawyers
working across the legal assistance sector, and our scholarly work, we have distilled
these skills into four key ingredients:

        1. Developing climate conscious lawyering approaches that are resilient and
            sustainable;

        2. Cultivating the knowledge and skills to practice trauma-informed
            lawyering;

        3. Developing the capacity for deep collaboration towards holistic service
            delivery; and

        4. A systemic mindset.

Whether you gravitate towards working at legal aid or in a community legal centre,
or you see yourself as a future government or private sector lawyer, we believe these
ingredients form the foundational knowledge and skills for all lawyers working in
pursuit of access to justice in a climate changed world.

The next sections of this chapter describe each ingredient. We include some practical
examples and case studies to help illustrate what they mean.

4.1 Climate Conscious Lawyering that is Resilient and
Sustainable

Resilient lawyering spans the full climate disaster cycle -- preparedness, emergency
response and long-term recovery -- while ensuring legal services are organisationally
resilient and can withstand and adapt to extreme heat, bushfires, floods and other
disruptions. This ingredient requires practitioners and organisations to cultivate

                                                                 112
   113

  flexibility, emotional strength and institutional foresight so that impacted communities
  receive consistent, culturally safe support when they need it most.1

  Central to building resilience is taking a climate conscious approach that integrates
  an active awareness of climate change into legal practice. This staggered approach
  recognises the impact of climate change on legal issues and addresses them in ways
  that contribute to climate justice. Climate conscious lawyers acknowledge that climate
  change exacerbates existing barriers to justice and can lead to new types of legal
  problems such as climate displacement. Climate conscious lawyers identify the
  intersection between legal problems and climate change issues, provide advice and
  litigate in ways that meaningfully address these issues, while considering the
  immediate legal context and broader implications for the environment and society.2

  Climate impacts rarely occur in isolation and they often act as a stress multiplier,
  compounding issues across housing, health, finances and family systems. A climate
  conscious approach helps lawyers to see the hidden role of climate disruption behind
  seemingly routine legal problems, and to pursue remedies that address both symptoms
  and root causes. Climate stressors often present in layered and indirect ways; heat
  stress, displacement and income loss can surface as tenancy disputes, debt,
  employment issues or family violence. Organisations that have climate informed
  intake processes are better equipped to see these connections, leading to more effective
  and tailored justice responses.

  Early identification of climate driven legal needs enables timely intervention,
  preventing escalation and supporting more effective resolution. Recognising these
  hidden drivers also informs systemic reform, ensuring laws and services adapt to the
  evolving realities that communities face in the wake of climate disruption.

  Ensuring communities have the tools and capabilities to respond to climate change
  impacts means that legal preparedness is emerging as a fundamental part of
  supporting climate resilience efforts (see the clinical legal education chapter for further

  discussion on resilience and legal preparedness). Lawyers working in access to justice
  will most likely be called upon to undertake disaster legal preparedness activities.

                                  EXAMPLE: COMMUNITY LEGAL EDUCATION

     A key element in empowering communities to be resilient to climate change
     impacts is working to mitigate or reduce the impacts of legal problems through
     community legal education (`CLE'). Though not a substitute for other types of
     legal support, CLE involves awareness raising activities that aim `to educate
     community members about the law and legal processes in order to assist them to
     resolve their legal problems most effectively and participate in law reform'.3
     CLE can be delivered in person or online. There are many highly creative
     methods such as theatre, music, dance and even comedy. It also includes online
     and paper-based `... resources such as factsheets, booklets and DVDs [and
     digital/web-based material]'.4 Supporting people to understand the law, legal
     processes and the potential for future legal problems to arise improves their legal
     literacy.5
     Lawyers working in access to justice must develop the skill to provide CLE, whilst
     also being able to engage with communities in place (such as at community
     events, recovery hubs and community information briefings). The Climate Justice
     Field Guide6 includes a case study documenting the successful use of CLE and
     engagement approaches to increase legal preparedness and community
     resilience following an extreme storm weather event.

  Practice

   As a future lawyer working in access to justice, taking a trauma-informed approach
   to legal practice is essential. Disaster survivors are often deeply traumatised, with
   evidence showing this trauma can continue to impact survivors for many years. There
   is emerging evidence that there are also negative wellbeing impacts for lawyers
   undertaking this work.7

   Learning from other professions over the last 10 years, the legal assistance sector has
   developed a deeper and more nuanced understanding of the impacts of trauma and its
   intersection with legal problems. There now exists a body of literature on the approach
   and frameworks that guide trauma informed lawyering.8

   At its most fundamental, trauma-informed practice is:

               ... when the practitioner ... puts the realities of the clients' trauma
               experiences at the forefront in engaging with the client and adjusts the
               practice approach informed by the individual client's trauma experience.
               Trauma-informed practice also encompasses the practitioner employing
               modes of self-care to counterbalance the effect the client's trauma
               experience may have on the practitioner.9

   Knowing how to de-escalate a situation, understanding your client's personal
   boundaries and triggers, taking pauses during meetings with a client if needed, not
   overpromising and underdelivering, and ensuring your client does not need to repeat
   their story to multiple stakeholders and service providers are all examples of trauma-
   informed practice captured in recent research.10

   Through this framing we can understand that a critical component in trauma-informed
   lawyering is to develop and hone the capacity for self-reflection, which is discussed in
   detail in the chapter regarding clinical legal education. Self-reflection can assist us to
   better support disaster-impacted clients and also manage the real risks to mental health
   and wellbeing that exist for us, whether we are lawyers or law students involved in
   disaster and climate related legal work.11

   To be a truly trauma-informed lawyer, one must understand and be aware of the deeply
   interconnected nature of legal, social, financial and health problems, and take a holistic
   and integrated approach to legal practice -- one that involves building on trusted
   referral pathways and collaborating across disciplines. This is the third ingredient,
   which we will now address.

  4.3 Deep Collaboration Towards Holistic Service Provision

   Climate change is complex. It demands that various professions and sectors work
   collaboratively with one another, and the communities they serve, so that climate
   justice can be holistically realised. Lawyers are traditionally trained to practice in
   silos, which can result in cultural, professional and institutional barriers to authentic
   collaboration. But when we are helping communities impacted by extreme weather
   events and climate impacts, our clients need their practitioners to holistically
   understand their problems and work with others to address them.

   Legal assistance lawyers must have the ability to work collaboratively with other
   professionals, both legal and non-legal, as part of their skills in responding to
   communities impacted by climate disasters and extreme weather events.12
   Collaboration is therefore an essential ingredient in enabling access to justice because
   it brings diverse actors and sectors together to address the full range of interconnected
   issues that people can experience post disaster. Working in collaboration reduces the
   siloing of service systems. Learning how to collaborate authentically and effectively
   is a professional skill that can take many years. We recommend you make good use of

     117

   available guides, toolkits and the broader research and evidence on design principles
   for effective collaboration.13

   4.3.1 Cross-Sector Collaboration

   Collaborating across sectors involves strategic collaboration between agencies and
   sectors beyond the legal assistance sector -- for example, a community legal centre
   (`CLC') or a coalition of CLCs working with health, emergency, human and social
   support services to address intersecting, complex and compounding problems that
   people often face in times of crisis. A good example is what occurred during the
   2019-20 bushfires and COVID-19 pandemic. Health Justice Australia remarked,
   `More than ever before, the crises of this period demonstrated the importance of health,
   legal and other human services working together to collaborate around the needs of the
   people and communities they serve.'14

   As a climate conscious, legal assistance sector lawyer, you must develop the skills to
   engage and work collaboratively with (non-legal) community, emergency and other
   service professionals to address social, financial and related health issues that intersect
   with an individual's post-disaster legal problem and recovery. All lawyers must take
   care not to see people as one dimensional, or just `a legal problem to be solved'.
   It is crucial that we see people holistically, as humans whose lives, experiences and
   problems hold multiple dimensions that we cannot and should not attempt to solve
   alone. Collaborating with organisations providing disaster recovery support services
   can be crucial in addressing the complexity of issues that affect a person's ability to
   resolve their legal problem.

   Writing from the perspective of CLCs, Taylor and Lay describe cross-sector
   collaboration:

               Climate change is a diffuse problem that calls for integrated solutions;
               it cannot be adequately addressed through a siloed approach ... forming
               interagency partnerships to deliver comprehensive wraparound support and

               to reach clients with the least legal capability will support fast, effective
               resolution of legal problems arising from extreme weather and slow-onset
               events.15

   For example, problems with insurance abound post disaster, at a time when people
   are potentially experiencing significant trauma.16 Having a strong understanding and
   relationship with key referral services means lawyers can connect people with social
   and emotional wellbeing support services. This may assist them (and you as the
   lawyer) to address complex insurance-related legal problems.

   4.3.2 Legal Sector Collaboration
   As the above example demonstrates, you will likely be exposed to a diverse, broad and
   often tangled mess of legal problems. Lawyers cannot be expected to hold knowledge
   across so many diverse, complex and often highly technical areas of law. The ability
   to recognise limitations and use referral pathways to find the most appropriate legal
   support for your client is essential. You should therefore be aware of, and work
   collaboratively with, specialist free legal services, pro bono legal help and any existing
   central referral pathways such as Disaster Legal Help Victoria, Disaster Legal Help
   (Queensland) or Disaster Response Legal Services in New South Wales.

  4.4 A Systemic Mindset

   A systemic mindset is the final key ingredient for delivering effective access to
   justice in a climate changed world. Systems thinking can help identify climate justice
   legal needs. Systems thinking is an approach to understanding complex problems
   by examining how parts of a system interact, influence one another and contribute
   to the behaviour of the whole. Rather than isolating components, systems thinking
   emphasises interconnection, feedback loops, emergence, nonlinear causality and
   contextual awareness.17

17. Diana Wright and Donella Matthews, Thinking in Systems: A Primer (2009) Taylor & Francis Group
     119

   Systems thinking helps legal assistance sector lawyers consider the interconnectedness
   of various components within a system, rather than isolating individual parts. When
   we engage in systems thinking, we start to understand the broader environment that
   gives rise to legal problems.18 Thinking within complexity allows us to comprehend
   not just immediate climate impacts but also cascading and compounding impacts.
   Climate change is legally disruptive.19 It exposes the limits of law and professional
   careers that are designed to thrive under stable environmental conditions. An adaptive,
   fit-for-purpose legal system is one that evolves ahead of harm; it is one that
   incorporates equity, community knowledge and resilience at its core. To see the link
   between climate change impacts and climate justice outcomes is to understand the
   interconnections between the changing nature of the places we live and how reliant our
   social, legal, cultural and economic lives are upon a stable and healthy environment.
   Climate justice is also intersectional, in terms of how we understand and resolve
   issues. Intersectionality includes acknowledging history, communities, identities and
   institutions, as well as environments, geographies and relationships to Country.20
   Taking an intersectional approach to access to justice in the context of climate change
   means understanding that people experience multiple inequities through the many
   layers of systemic injustice. This requires us to work holistically and to simultaneously
   recognise and dismantle those intersecting injustices.

   4.4.1 Systemic Advocacy, Policy and Law Reform
   Systemic advocacy and law reform has long been an important tool in advocating
   for social justice.21 Through a climate change lens, this work aims to address the
   root causes of climate injustice by challenging laws, policies and regulations that can

21. Jude McCulloch and Megan Blair, `From Maverick to Mainstream: Forty Years of Community Legal Centres' (2012)

     121

   detrimentally impact communities' interests. Law reform and strategic policy work
   helps to address disaster-related legal problems as part of preparedness activities.22

   Our current legal system is not fit for purpose in a climate changed world; it must be
   adapted to reduce climate harm across communities and ecosystems. Many existing
   laws and regulatory frameworks across tenancy, construction, planning, insurance and
   criminal law domains remain largely blind to slow-onset climate impacts such as
   heat stress, mould and displacement. Without reform, these systems risk becoming
   maladaptive; they may exclude affected communities and lock in future climate harms.
   Achieving climate justice requires a fundamental shift from reactive problem-solving
   to proactive, anticipatory support.23 This transformation depends on legal creativity
   that is inclusive of diverse legal traditions and knowledges, including the enduring
   wisdom of First Nations law and lore, to ensure legal systems remain relevant and
   regenerative.

   Crucially, this transformation demands systems thinking -- an approach that reveals
   how legal, social and ecological systems are interlinked and how interventions in
   one domain ripple across others. True reform must interrogate the interdependencies
   among legislators, regulators, planners, service providers and community leaders --
   challenging the assumptions that shape how laws are made, interpreted and enforced.
   There are many practical `advocacy toolkits' which can assist legal assistance sector
   lawyers in this work.24

                                              CLIMATE JUSTICE PROGRAM

      Climate change is already shaping the lives and legal problems of individuals
      living in poverty and disadvantage. In Melbourne's south-east, communities face

compounding disadvantages, from insecure housing and precarious work to rising
living costs and limited access to support services. Climate related challenges
such as extreme heat, floods and bushfires further intensify these pre-existing
vulnerabilities.

South-East Monash Legal Service (`SMLS') operates as a community legal centre
dedicated to delivering access to justice for these communities. SMLS is a CLC
working at the intersection of poverty, legal exclusion, and now, climate change.
SMLS clients include renters in substandard housing, migrants with limited visa
protections, single parents navigating family violence, people living with
disabilities and low-income workers in insecure jobs. Increasingly, the legal issues
they face -- including evictions, work-related illness and family breakdown, are
shaped by the climate crisis.

In response, SMLS launched the South-Eastern Climate Justice Program, an
initiative to explore how climate change affects people's legal rights and access to
justice, and to embed climate conscious lawyering into its practice and community
engagement.

Laying the Foundation: Ambition to Action

When SMLS launched the program, its ambitions were broad. SMLS staff knew
that disadvantaged communities were disproportionately affected by the climate
crisis, but as a workforce, SMLS itself needed to first understand how a legal
service could meaningfully respond. The SMLS team returned to first principles:
they immersed themselves in climate science, explored international legal
developments, and engaged with experts across law, environment, and public
health.

In the first year, the emphasis was on research and internal training. However, a
key lesson soon emerged; SMLS had underestimated the importance of
beginning with robust community engagement. Without this grounding, there was
a risk that proposed solutions would be disconnected from real experiences.

SMLS course-corrected by actively seeking input from those most affected.
Through focus groups, social media callouts, and surveys, SMLS learned how
climate change was impacting people's legal and personal lives: homes too hot to
live in, employers refusing breaks on hot days, domestic violence worsened by
climate stress, and rising housing costs after disasters. This community-led
insight became foundational to the work of SMLS and continues to shape its
direction.
123

  A Unique Legal Lens: Connecting Climate Impacts to Everyday
  Legal Issues

   SMLS's research confirmed a striking gap. While global climate litigation had
   largely focused on emissions targets and environmental law, the legal system had
   yet to grapple with the day-to-day effects of climate change on people's individual
   legal problems.

   Climate change affects tenancy, employment, migration, family violence, and
   family law -- but legal systems have not kept pace. Australia's weak human rights
   protections leave few clear pathways for clients to seek redress for climate-
   related harm. Still, international conventions like the International Covenant on
   Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and United Nations Declaration on the
   Rights of Indigenous Peoples offer valuable interpretive tools, and SMLS uses
   them to guide analysis and advocacy.

  Climate Conscious Lawyering in Practice

   To create meaningful change, SMLS knew that it needed to organisationally
   evolve. SMLS introduced internal training on climate conscious lawyering,
   examining how climate impacts show up in employment law, tenancy, migration,
   family law, and family violence. This wasn't just theory; it was an invitation for
   lawyers to reimagine their roles in the face of the climate crisis.

   SMLS staff responded with curiosity and conviction. They explored new
   arguments under general protections for workers dismissed after heatstroke and
   examined rent reductions and urgent repairs in the context of uninhabitable
   housing. Their training also prompted broader shifts -- climate risk now features
   in outreach plans, disaster readiness protocols, and even in strategic advocacy.

   Recognising the value of shared learning, SMLS offered their training to CLCs
   across Victoria, refining it with feedback. This culminated in a flagship full-day
   workshop co-hosted with the Federation of CLCs Victoria and Melbourne Law
   School, where practitioners, students, and experts co-created pathways for
   climate conscious lawyering, highlighting both the urgency and potential of cross-
   sector collaboration.

  Community Engagement and Systemic Impact

   Community engagement is now a core pillar of the program. SMLS has hosted
                                                                                                                                                        124

stalls at local festivals, partnered with environment groups, and contributed to
community resilience mapping. These activities both inform and are informed by
the legal work of SMLS. They also build trust with groups who are often excluded
from legal and climate policy processes.

SMLS's systemic advocacy also continues to grow, and falls into three broad
categories:

          Housing and tenancy reform, including input into minimum rental
            standards, disaster-related tenancy frameworks, and responses to
            homelessness during climate events

          Climate adaptation policy through engagement with Victoria's Climate
            Change Strategy, planning laws, and resilience inquiries

          Human rights and law reform through letters and submissions on the
            right to housing, equitable redevelopment, and protections for migrant
            workers during climate shocks

By integrating service delivery, law reform, and lived experience, SMLS aims to
influence climate adaptation strategies that are just, inclusive, and grounded in
community realities.

Looking Ahead

SMLS is shifting from reactive support to anticipatory, place-based lawyering. The
team is building early warning systems, training lawyers in climate rights, and
embedding disaster readiness into legal design. Trauma-informed, culturally safe
practice remains central as SMLS supports communities shaped by exclusion and
displacement. The long-term vision of SMLS is to make climate conscious
thinking integral to community lawyering, because justice in a climate-affected
world demands foresight, empathy, and structural change.

The South-Eastern Climate Justice Program is still evolving, but SMLS hopes it
offers a roadmap for educators, lawyers and policymakers. Climate change is
transforming our world, and the law must evolve with it -- starting with how law is
taught and practised, and how communities are supported. SMLS's message to
future lawyers is clear: climate conscious lawyering isn't niche; it's foundational to
justice in the Anthropocene.

 5. Conclusion

  Organisations in the legal assistance sector are working hard to respond to everyday
  legal problems. To take a climate justice-oriented approach that is broader in scope
  than just disaster recovery legal assistance, they need to do a few things. First,
  organisations and funders need to shift from a reactive to a proactive mindset that
  is climate conscious. This means increased efforts in law reform, CLE and network
  building to proactively protect people from legal harms arising from climate change,
  not reactively help them pick up the pieces. Second, organisations must continue
  to apply their significant knowledge and understanding of the impacts of trauma
  and its intersection with legal problems. Third, organisations in the legal assistance
  sector should continue to prioritise deep cross-sector and intra-sector engagement and
  collaboration to strengthen holistic service provision. And finally, organisations and
  individuals need to embrace systems thinking and an expanded outlook about the role
  of legal assistance services, together with the capacity to see broader causes of legal
  problems. These are all key ingredients for delivering effective access to justice in a
  climate changed world.

  Climate change is reshaping legal practice. As a future climate conscious lawyer, the
  challenge of ensuring access to justice in a climate changed world means approaching
  lawyering in a way that is ethically grounded, community responsive, innovative
  and resilient. Climate change is a poverty-making machine that deepens inequality,
  disrupts livelihoods and compounds disadvantages. Climate change needs to be
  acknowledged as a driver of injustice across our public legal service system. This
  requires adequate resourcing across all state and national frameworks for legal
  assistance.1

The State is an increasingly important actor in responding to the climate change
emergency. Therefore, public law, as the body of laws that governs the exercise and
restraint of State power, should be paramount in analysing effective climate responses.
It shapes the sites and conceptions of climate action, in the sense of which branch
and level of government can respond to the climate crisis and any restrictions on
those responses. Yet public law in Australia is often absent in discussions of climate
responses, which are treated as a policy issue to be determined and accounted for in
the political realm.
In this chapter, we will explain how Australia's public law framework, and its heavy

                                                                 127

reliance on the liberal democratic tradition and political accountability, has
contributed to this situation. We explore how Australian public law, in particular its
instantiation of federalism, representative government and the rule of law (including
separation of powers and judicial review), has shaped the effectiveness of responses
to climate change.

In this chapter we will also consider how the climate crisis has shaped -- and will
shape -- the practice of public law in Australia. In encouraging you to consider
responses to this issue, we conclude by introducing a number of different ways that
Australian public law could develop so that it can facilitate effective societal responses
to the climate crisis, particularly through the State.

                                             KEY QUESTIONS

                  How has Australian public law shaped climate action, including
                    the sites for action to address climate change, and the way
                    climate action is conceived?

                  How has Australian public law interacted with the climate crisis in
                    relation to:

 1. The Central Significance of Public Law in the
 Climate Crisis

  Public law conventionally refers to the law governing the State, specifically, the
  exercise of State power. It is -- and will increasingly be -- central to societal
  responses to the climate crisis.

  According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, `rapid, far-reaching
  and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society'1 are necessary to stave off
  climate catastrophes. These changes will require climate mitigation (actions to limit
  the amount of greenhouse gases causing climate change) and climate adaptation
  (actions to adjust to the effects of climate change). The State is primary to both types
  of actions. As climate disruptions become more extreme, there is a more existential
  question of whether existing public law institutions are sufficiently robust to navigate
  the overlapping crises that are likely to ensue (ecological, political, social and
  economic). This gives rise to a deep and complex relationship between public law and
  the climate crisis.

  At one level, there is the question: how does public law shape the climate crisis?
  Included within this question is how public law shapes responses to climate action
  (its extent, timing and sites) and the effect of public law on how climate action is
  conceived (specifically if it is treated as a legal or political issue). The answer to this
  depends on the design of institutions exercising State power, the distribution of power
  amongst these institutions; the nature of their exercise and the public law principles
  that traditionally govern their operation (including federalism, representative
  government, separation of powers and the rule of law).

  From a different, less obvious, perspective, we can ask: how does the climate crisis
  shape public law? In this question, we consider how governmental institutions, their

                                                                   130

  powers and public law principles have already adapted, and ought to -- or must --
  adapt to the particular challenge of the climate crisis.

  This chapter takes up these questions in relation to Australian public law. Its analysis is
  situated within the context of Australian climate politics, where there is the historical
  influence of high-emission industries, including fossil fuels and agriculture, as
  dominant forces in the Australian economy. As a result, climate policies have become
  highly politically contentious and are now largely a partisan issue. On the left, the
  Labor Party and particularly the Greens have supported more ambitious climate action,
  while on the right, the Liberal Party and National Party have been more cautious, and
  at times stanchly resistant to climate change policies.2 The rise of the so-called Teal
  I ndependents, with their heavy focus on climate action in the 2022 federal election,
  illustrated voter concern with the failures of the conservative parties to address climate
  change.3 Interwoven with climate party politics are the interests at play. These include
  the fossil fuel industry, First Nations, agricultural interests, fisheries, interested non-
  government organsiations (`NGOs') and community groups, the media and the wider
  public.

  At the heart of the questions examined by this chapter is the challenge of developing
  public law so that it can facilitate effective societal responses to the climate crisis,
  particularly through the State. While this challenge is far too large and complex
  to be dealt with comprehensively by this chapter, we seek to provide more critical
  understanding of the central role of public law in contributing to and responding to
  climate change into the future, so as to guide current and future legal professionals and
  others who must confront this challenge.

 2. How Australian Public Law Shapes the Sites and
 Conceptions of Climate Action

  Public law is concerned with the empowerment and constraint of the institutions that
  exercise State power:

            It establishes and empowers institutions within a State responsible for
              governing in the public interest and implementing policy responses to
              social, economic and environment problems, and it delineates the
              relationships between these institutions.

            It restrains those institutions by making sure they are exercising their
              powers within legal limits and institutional competence.1

  Australian public law shapes the sites of climate action and how climate action
  is conceived through two particular features. The first is its reflection of liberal
  democratic traditions. At the core of these broad traditions are three key principles:

            The principle of democratic government in the sense of government by the
              people, which is usually institutionalised through representative
              government based on regular elections.

            The principle of limited government, which is institutionalised through
              legal limits on State power (the rule of law and an independent judiciary)
              and distribution of power amongst different institutions with accompanying
              checks and balances (separation of powers, federalism).

            The principle of individual liberties, with emphasis on the protection of the
              individual against the State (freedom from State power) and priority given
              to civil and political rights (with each considered vital for human
              flourishing as well as democratic government).

  A subterranean premise of the third principle is the significance ascribed to private

      Alexander Reilly, Australian Public Law (OUP, 4th ed, 2023) ch 1.
                                                                   132
   133

  property rights. This significance can be traced to abiding tenets of liberal philosophy
  as well as the deep intertwining of liberalism with capitalism, a mode of production
  based on private property rights.2

  The second feature is Australian public law's particular blend of legal
  constitutionalism, where constitutional norms and principles are given effect through
  legal processes (including judicial review), and political constitutionalism, where
  political processes predominate (including accountability of the executive to the
  legislature and elections for members of the legislature). The Australian system relies
  heavily on political constitutionalism; for instance, the framers of the Commonwealth
  Constitution believed that the protection of liberties was best secured not through a
  constitutional Bill of Rights but through the processes of representative government.
  This reliance has important consequences for the sites and conceptions of climate
  action.

  The constraints of power placed by Australian public law on the possible sites of
  climate action have not proven to be hindrances to effective climate action where the
  political will exists. That Australia is a climate laggard has not resulted from lack of
  State power.

  The federal nature of the Australian State means that State power is allocated vertically
  between the states (as regional governments) and the Commonwealth (as the federal
  government), with local governments also playing a role. As we elaborate later, all
  levels of government have power in relation to climate action -- they are all sites of
  climate action. While the Commonwealth has constitutional primacy, the states and
  local government are also sites with ample power for climate action.

  Australian public law also distributes power horizontally among the three branches of
  government (executive, legislature and the judiciary). Reflecting its liberal democratic
  roots and reliance on political over legal constitutionalism, Australia's public law
  system treats responses to climate change and environmental protection largely as a
  policy issue within the public law system. This means that climate action is principally

      McPherson (Hackett Publishing, 1980 ed). Marx, on the contrary, saw property relations as dependent on the mode of
      production with capitalism, in particular underpinned by private property rights; see Karl Marx, A Contribution to the
      Critique of Political Economy (Kessinger, 2007 ed).
                                                                                                                                                             134

viewed as the province of the executive and the legislature and not of the judiciary.
Unlike many countries with more recently designed public law systems, Australian
public law does not directly address the government's obligations in relation to the
environment or, more specifically, to address climate change; nor does it provide for
express limits or rights relating to environmental justice.

This has two major consequences. First, in terms of the institutional division of labour.
Climate action is to be mainly determined by the political actors in the legislatures
and executive, accountable through elections. While legal frameworks are enforceable
in the courts, there has (thus far) proven to be little leeway for the development of
disruptive climate-change responsive judicial doctrine. The effect is that executives
and legislatures at various levels of government are the main institutions where climate
action is directed, not the courts. The dominant context of political constitutionalism
brings to the fore the system of representative government under Australian public
law. Conversely, the rule of law as a principle of Australian public law has had an
attenuated role in the climate crisis.

Second, apparent agnosticism towards the ends of climate action combines with an
acute risk of a structural bias towards narrow interests. Elections by design place the
power to decide in the hands of the voters; under the Australian electoral system,
voters who determine the composition of the lower house will also decide which
party forms government. Danger arises when voter preferences are reduced to highly
localised -- even individualistic -- considerations with no or peripheral engagement
with wider societal interests. This strongly risks the framing of the climate debate in
terms of the self-interests of voters, and in particular, voters in marginal seats. This
overlooks the national geography of the climate crisis, as well as the intergenerational
nature of it.

These dynamics can be contrasted with many Indigenous systems of governance,
where the individual is placed in the context of responsibilities to the collective, and
individual and collective responsibilities (as opposed to rights) to the land and the
wider environment are often centred. Another contrast is with constitutions which
impose duties on citizens to protect the environment for present and future generations,
expressly at times as trustees.

Bound up with conceiving climate action as a policy issue is to not view it as a
   135

  matter of public law. Like a frame that disappears from the view, the deep connection
  between climate action and public law is submerged, with the impact of public law on
  climate action not recognised and its significance for progressing the climate agenda
  not realised.

  Another way Australian public law distorts thinking about climate action is through
  the public/private distinction it assumes. Consonant with liberal democratic principles
  of limited government and individual liberties, this distinction conventionally
  establishes mutually exclusive areas of law where private law regulates the
  interactions of individuals (a horizontal relationship among legal equals) and public
  law regulates the relationship between the State and individuals (a vertical or
  hierarchical relationship between rulers and ruled). This understanding posits the
  public sphere as the domain of politics and the State, just as public law is the law
  which governs the State. The private sphere comprises the supposedly apolitical, non-
  State domains of the economy and the family, just as private law is the law governing
  economic and familial relationships among individuals. The underlying assumption
  is that these spheres are governed by different principles. In this view, public law
  principles such as representative government and the rule of law do not apply to
  the private sphere and private law, among others, because the latter are not seen as
  political and/or involving the exercise of power.3

  These understandings can have the effect of naturalising capitalism and its underlying
  system of private property rights. As part of the economy, both are considered to be
  in the private sphere: outside of State power -- indeed, not involving the exercise of
  power at all -- and exempt from public law principles.

  This highly problematic distinction is increasingly apparent in the case of climate
  action. Care for the environment -- and the flow-on effects for the climate and
  people -- can be seen as both a public and a private matter in Australian public
  law; the traditional distinction between public and private obscures the complexity
  of State and individual responsibility needed for effective climate responses.4 The
  traditional public/private law division, combined with liberal democratic concern

  for the protection of private property rights, has meant that environmental care and
  degradation has generally been considered a private matter. This, however, overlooks
  the importance of public law in this space. As a matter of public law, precious metals,
  coal, petroleum and mineral resources are the property of the Crown (under our federal
  system, the state crowns). Those seeking to mine these resources need permission to
  explore for and extract them, hence the need for mining licences. Today, the states
  regulate exploration and mining so that some compensation is paid to the states for
  minerals (by setting fees and taxes), and the states regulate the safety and sustainability
  of practices (by setting conditions on how mining operations are run).

  Governments also regulate the use and development of land more generally, requiring
  planning permits for certain types of development. The scope, exercise and
  administrative review of powers in relation to mining and planning permits has been
  the focus of much of what has been traditionally referred to as `environmental law', a
  focused area of administrative law. In more recent cases and law reform, the traditional
  private/public law distinction in this area has been challenged, for instance in the
  case of Minister for Environment v Sharma (`Sharma') that we discuss below, where
  the plaintiffs argued that a Minister had a private law duty of care to avoid harm to
  children in the exercise of a public law power to approve mines.

  More generally in terms of climate action, State action is primary but not exclusive.
  Highly effective climate institutions are essential in all aspects of society, including
  non-State domains. This is particularly so in the economy and with commercial
  enterprises given the undoubted role of fossil fuel capitalism in causing the climate
  crisis.5 This means that climate regulatory responses typically combine public law
  and private law elements.6 A key regulatory challenge is designing measures that
  effectively integrate both, a task that is impeded by the public/private distinction.
  Relatedly, discernment -- rather than rigid rejection -- is vital in determining
  principles such as representative government and the rule of law to climate legal
  measures.

  In the concluding section of this chapter, we reflect on how Australian public law can

go beyond the occlusion of its fundamental role in climate action and the distortions
that occur through the public/private distinction. For now, we emphasise that the
causal relationship between Australian public law and the climate crisis does not
run just one way -- from public law to climate action. As we highlighted in the
first section, there is also the impact of the climate crisis on Australian public law.
Nor are these two causal processes separate -- there is complex interplay between
both. It is this interaction that we will proceed to examine in relation to federalism,
representative government and the rule of law.

 3. The Interaction Between Australian Public Law and
 the Climate Crisis

 3.1 Federalism

  The preamble to the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900 describes
  our system as an indissoluble federal Commonwealth. Here, we outline the practical
  realities and future possibilities that the Australian federal system holds for effective
  responses to climate change.

  But first, it is helpful to reflect on the spatial dimensions of climate change, which has
  repercussions for Australia's federal system as it divides power across different spatial
  spheres. Climate change is at once international, national and local. Climate change
  affects all countries but with uniquely damaging effects on some due to geography,
  level of development and resources. This means that Australia's domestic political
  response to climate change will be heavily influenced by geopolitical factors and the
  need for international cooperation and response. How Australian public law governs
  transnational relationships and internationalisation therefore influences its climate
  response, as well as the State's capacity to implement international commitments. The
  local is also important in climate responses, with local communities at the front line
  of the impacts of climate change and therefore having strong views about mitigation
  and particularly adaptation. How Australian public law (and specifically its practice
  of federalism) allows for subsidiarity (ie decision-making at the most local level)
  while providing a framework for national cooperation and response will influence the
  effectiveness of its climate response.

  The division of powers across different levels of government characteristic of federal
  systems might be considered as facilitating or hindering effective responses to climate
  change.1 On one hand, federalism provides more localised sites of action and greater
  responsiveness to local community concerns as to the need to take action to address

   139

  and mitigate against the effects of climate change, as well as the possibility for
  experimentation, inter-jurisdictional learning and competition to develop effective
  policy responses.2 It can also create `redundancy', so where one level of government
  refuses to act, this can be compensated for by other levels. On the other hand,
  federalism can facilitate local responses that preference short-term economic interests,
  and the federal division of powers can make more holistic and coordinated national
  reform, including reforms to meet international commitments, difficult, such as
  through blame-shifting, and a race to the bottom.

  Under the division of legislative and fiscal powers in the Australian federation both
  the Commonwealth and the states have the power to respond to climate change --
  that is, there is a dual or coordinate responsibility. The Commonwealth, however,
  retains dominance through a number of mechanisms. Where there is inconsistency
  between Commonwealth and state laws, Commonwealth law will prevail under s 109
  of the Constitution. Further, the Commonwealth has financial dominance which, as
  we explore later, has been used to dictate policies to the states in areas outside its
  legislative competence.

  There is no clear federal head of power to deal with the environment, or climate
  change. The states have traditionally had responsibility within their plenary residual
  power for land and resource management, transport and urban planning, infrastructure,
  network utilities and the environment.3 However, the Commonwealth Parliament has
  an amalgam of powers that has been -- and could be -- used to respond to climate
  change. These powers include the trade and commerce power (s 51(i)), the taxation
  power (s 51(ii)), the corporations power (s 51(xx)), the races power (s 51(xxvi)), the
  treaty implementation aspect and the geographically external aspects of the external
  affairs power (s 51(xxix)), and the implied nationhood power.4

  The external affairs power has proven to be an important legislative power for
  responding to climate change and environmental degradation. Under the international

  law taxonomy, Australia operates as a dual system: the executive government can
  enter into international commitments (including treaties) but these will not have the
  force of domestic law unless incorporated through legislation (although they might
  have other influences on the law such as the development of the common law).
  So it is through the external affairs power that the Commonwealth can implement
  its international environmental and climate commitments. Equally, the expansion of
  international law to include environmental protection has influenced the development
  of Australian constitutional law: it was an attempt to protect the wilderness of
  Tasmania through an international treaty that the modern understanding of the scope
  of the external affairs power was developed.

  The High Court in the case of Commonwealth v Tasmania5 considered whether the
  Commonwealth Parliament had the power to pass the World Heritage Properties
  Conservation Act 1983 (Cth). The Act had been passed to prevent the Tasmanian
  Hydro-Electric Commission from constructing a hydro-electric dam on the Gordon
  River, which would have flooded the Franklin River. The High Court upheld this
  legislation as connected to a number of heads of legislative power: most famously
  that it implemented the international Convention Concerning the Protection of World
  Cultural and Natural Heritage and so was with respect to external affairs (s 51(xxix)).

  While there are many important federal statutes that respond to climate change, there
  also remain significant state-level regimes. For instance, electricity power networks,
  which are responsible for the majority of emissions caused by coal-fired power
  stations, are regulated by the state governments, and historically were state owned and
  run (this is still the case in Tasmania, Western Australia and Northern Territory and is
  again the case in Queensland). However, the Commonwealth also now has an interest
  in energy generation, through the National Electricity Market that covers five of the
  states (excluding Western Australia).

  In addition to this amalgam of federal legislative powers available to it, the
  Commonwealth can pursue its policy objectives by relying on its significant financial
  power. This power can be traced to Australia's exacerbated vertical fiscal imbalance
  (`VFI') -- that is, the financial dominance of the Commonwealth due to its significant
  revenue base as against the expenditure responsibilities of the states. The VFI in

   141

  Australia is addressed through different forms of funds transfers between the central
  and state governments. Under s 96 of the Constitution, the Commonwealth has an
  almost unlimited power to make conditional grants to the states; these are not limited
  by the areas within the Commonwealth's legislative power. So, for instance,
  significant monetary grants to mining companies (through the states) under the
  Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility Act 2016 (Cth) (`NAIF Act') have been
  made under the grants power.6

  Alan Fenna explains that in Australia, the dual source of legislative power, and the
  overlap and duplication that has created, has largely operated in relation to climate
  change response in a beneficial way through what he refers to as `compensatory
  federalism'.7 Neither the Commonwealth nor the states have historically been more
  effective in their response to climate change and environmental protection. Rather,
  the redundancy of the two levels of government has allowed them to compensate for
  each other. While in the 1980s, advocates may have turned to the Commonwealth to
  intervene to prohibit the construction of the Gordon-Franklin dam, there have also
  been significant periods during Coalition government rule when the Commonwealth
  has not progressed responses to climate change and environmental protection so that
  advocates have turned to the states, as well as local governments, to achieve their
  policy objectives. In this way, locally driven political pressure to respond to the threats
  of climate change has in many senses revitalised federalism in Australia.

  During the Howard Liberal-National coalition Commonwealth government
  (1996-2007), the states introduced a number of progressive climate policies, including
  state/territory-based emissions trading schemes (in NSW and the ACT) and renewable
  energy production incentives, as well as horizontal coordination and advocacy in

   (2013-2022), which turned to a less ambitious and effective `direct action' policy. In
   the wake of the roll back by the federal government, the states re-entered the field with
   ambitious emissions reduction and renewable energy targets.8

   Reliance on states without national standards and coordination, however, brings with
   it a danger of patchwork and inconsistent responses. This is also evident in Australia.
   While there has been significant progress in most states towards the adoption of
   renewable energy, and meeting emissions targets, the Climate Council in September
   2024 identified Western Australia and the Northern Territory as jurisdictions that
   had approved coal and gas projects and were struggling to meet their emissions
   reduction targets.9 There is also some cooperation between the Commonwealth and
   states through the standing cooperative mechanism of the Energy and Climate Change
   Ministerial Council, which reports to the National Cabinet on work plans and key
   priorities.

   Local government is neither established nor regulated at the constitutional level in
   Australia, but it nonetheless plays an important role in the federal system, and this
   has proven the case with climate responses.10 Local governments have been highly
   responsive to local community concerns about climate mitigation and adaptation.
   Many have issued `climate emergency declarations', adopted ambitious emissions
   reduction targets and taken action to achieve these, including investing in new low-
   carbon technology; transitioning their own operations through the adoption of
   sustainable transport (such as electric vehicle or EV fleets); introducing low-emission
   infrastructure and services in areas such as energy, transport, waste disposal and
   sanitation; and supporting local businesses and residents to reduce their emissions.
   They have also taken a proactive role in working with communities that need to adapt
   for climate change related weather events such as floods, droughts and fire.

   However, local governments can only achieve so much. They are limited by resources
   (and heavily reliant on federal funding) and are ultimately subject to control by the
   states. They are also limited in what they can achieve without regional and national

                       climate crisis from a federalism perspective?

  3.2 Representative Government

   A key principle of Australian public law is that of representative government. This
   refers to a system of government where legislative and executive power are ultimately
   exercised by representatives elected in elections. Selected aspects of this system
   are provided for under the Commonwealth Constitution (including direct election of
   representatives and a bicameral system comprising the House of Representatives and
   the Senate). The High Court has also implied under the Commonwealth Constitution a
   freedom of political communication and a right to vote.11

   Most aspects of the Australian system of representative government rely heavily on
   political constitutionalism and are a matter of convention and practice, most notably
   in the doctrine of responsible government where the executive is responsible to the
   legislature. Key features of Australian electoral systems include:

             the secret ballot (called the `Australian ballot' in some countries);
             compulsory voting;

11. For detailed discussion, see Appleby et al (n 10) ch 7; Joo-Cheong Tham, `Political Participation' in Cheryl Saunders
       and Adrienne Stone (eds), The Oxford Handbook of the Australian Constitution (OUP, 2018).
                                                                                                                                                                  144

             uniform franchise of adult citizens;

             constituencies of comparable numbers of electors; and

             independent electoral commissions responsible for administering elections
               and drawing electoral boundaries.12

   All state constitutions except for that of Western Australia have established four-
   year fixed terms for elected representatives. By comparison, the Commonwealth
   Constitution stipulates the maximum term for members of the House of
   Representatives (through s 28) but enables the actual term to be determined by the
   government of the day, which has the power to call for federal elections through
   the Prime Minister advising the Governor-General to dissolve the House of
   Representatives (s 5).

   There is a clear yet complicated relationship between the system of representative
   government under Australian public law and understandings of democracy. In essence,
   democracy means government by the people. Within this core meaning, there is
   considerable debate as to the scope of democracy, in particular whether it extends
   beyond government through the State to `private government';13 direct and
   representative democracy; and aggregative, participatory and deliberative
   approaches.14

   The understanding of democracy reflected in Australian public law is limited to the
   exercise of power through the State and is mainly based on representation (with
   the major exception of referendums necessary for changes to the text of the
   Commonwealth Constitution). It has specifically focused on the election of
   representatives and done so with unmistakable emphasis on the aggregation of the
   preferences of voters and their participation. It has been far less concerned with
   the deliberative aspects of democracy (including the information environment of

   elections), 15 as well as how power is exercised by elected representatives and
   governments. This suggests an abstentionist approach consistent with liberal
   democratic thinking that vacating by the State would invariably give rise to democratic
   flourishing. Whether this assumption is warranted is a question we take up at the end
   of this chapter.

   The system of representative government in Australia has been -- and is -- the
   primary site of contestation with the climate crisis because of the role of the State and
   the dominant context of political constitutionalism. This contestation has been fierce,
   so much so that it is common to refer to the `climate wars' in Australia. These climate
   wars have contributed to the ousting of three prime ministers since 2007, as well as
   distorted different interests to the point that they have become irreconcilable, thereby
   providing a platform for political polarisation and the exploitation of division for
   electoral gain. Such polarisation is reflected in the importance ascribed to emissions
   reductions by voters, which sharply divides along political party lines. It has also
   resulted in divisiveness and conflict -- much of which was unnecessary -- and false
   trade-offs between protecting jobs as opposed to the environment, regions and cities,
   and blue-collar and white-collar workers.16 This polarisation has been a major cause of
   Australia being a climate laggard. But what has been the role of Australia's system of
   representative government in all this?

   There is an important yet unexamined question whether such polarisation has been
   exacerbated by the potential structural bias of Australian public law towards the
   interests of voters who will determine the composition of the lower house, particularly
   voters in marginal seats. Similarly unexamined is the impact of the lack of fixed-term
   elections at the federal level and whether federal adoption of fixed four-year terms as
   in most states would make a positive difference.

   More clearly, the laws relating to public protests and the significance of political
   constitutionalism have allowed widespread protests such as the student climate strikes
   and meant a degree of tolerance of campaigns based on civil disobedience. Such
   activism has, however, prompted attacks on the ability to protest through anti-protest

   laws that have been enacted in a number of states17 (although some of these restrictions
   have been subject to successful constitutional challenge under the implied freedom
   of political communication18), and the use of strategic litigation against activists (see
   more on this latter in section 3 on `Rule of Law').19

   Sins of omission are easier to identify. Central to campaigns for stronger climate action
   such as the student climate strikes is intergenerational equity and the obligation of the
   current generation to bequeath a planet safe for human existence to the generations
   to come. While the Australian system of representative government does not preclude
   such consideration, it fails to provide a systematic imperative for such consideration.
   Worse, as the system is oriented towards the interests of voters, a particular section of
   the current generation, there is all the risk (and reality) of intergenerational concerns
   being marginalised.

   A major blind spot of what would otherwise be considered strong electoral systems
   concerns the funding political parties, candidates and other political actors at the
   federal level. Here there is a `decidedly laissez-faire' approach20 with no current limits
   on political contributions or spending.21 The focus on the election of representatives,
   with far less regard for how governments exercise power, has also contributed to weak
   regulation of lobbying (attempts to influence government decision-makers). These
   have contributed to what has been called a fossil fuel hegemony in Australia; one that,
   perhaps, was vividly illustrated by former Prime Minister Scott Morrison brandishing
   a lump of coal provided by the Minerals Council of Australia in the Commonwealth
   Parliament.22 Some have pointed to the nexus between the fossil fuel industry and

   Australia's highly concentrated media.23 Professor Ross Garnaut, who wrote two
   comprehensive reports on climate change, has observed in relation to Australia that
   `[e]missions-intensive industries have invested heavily to influence climate change
   policy since the early days of discussion of these issues'.24 The investment in influence
   by these industries is notable in the following ways:

             The resources industry is by far the largest sector making political
               contributions.

             The success of the $22 million advertising campaign by mining companies
               against the Rudd government's resource super-profits tax is part of political
               folklore -- to the extent that `[i]t's now become routine for industry groups
               to threaten a "mining tax style campaign" every time they don't get their
               way with government'.

             Employees and lobbyists of industry have included former ALP ministers,
               former National Party leaders and former Liberal Party ministers.25

   Power of this nature has a profound impact, and enlivens the notion of `policy
   capture'.26 Marian Wilkinson's book The Carbon Club provides a meticulous account
   of how a network of climate-science sceptics, politicians and business leaders brought
   about decades of climate inaction in Australia.27 Under the Howard government,
   climate change policy was effectively determined by fossil fuel lobbyists (many of
   whom were former senior public servants), who likened themselves to organised crime
   through a self-styled label -- the greenhouse mafia.28 And perhaps the most singular

   fact -- fossil fuel companies have played an instrumental role in ousting two out of the
   five prime ministers in office since 2007; namely, Kevin Rudd and Malcolm Turnbull.

   While the prospect of robust regulation of federal lobbying seems distant,29 this has not
   the case with political finance laws. In November 2024, the federal Labor government
   proposed the Electoral Legislation Amendment (Electoral Reform) Bill. The Bill
   included significant changes to the two pillars of current federal laws (disclosure
   and public funding), while adding another two (caps on contributions and caps on
   electoral expenditure). It is the most ambitious reform of federal political finance laws
   attempted since the current regime was established four decades ago. The original
   bill would have reduced the influence of big money in politics, but it did not go far
   enough in curbing large donations and excessive spending. Its scorecard on promoting
   fair elections was mixed: it will make elections fairer in key respects, but it will also
   unduly favour the major parties, political parties with wealthy candidates and those
   with investment income.30

   After securing the support of the opposition, the Labor government pushed through
   an amended Bill after two days of debate by the Commonwealth Parliament. The
   Electoral Legislation Amendment (Electoral Reform) Act 2025 (Cth), which comes
   into effect in 2026, maintains the features of the original Bill in relation to disclosure
   obligations, caps on electoral expenditure and public funding. However, it more than
   doubles the caps on contributions, to $50,000 per year for each recipient, rendering
   this essentially hollow. The upshot is an ambiguous picture where a shameful
   parliamentary process has produced laws that are unfair and ineffectual in significant
   ways and yet democracy-enhancing in others.31

   Without doubt, the climate crisis has and will continue to shape Australia's system

   increasing power of the executive arising from the climate crisis and how the crisis has

                                                 KEY QUESTIONS

                      Is Australia's system of representative government well designed
                        to respond to issues that raise intergenerational inequities such
                        as climate change?

                      What are the `climate wars' in Australia?
                      In what ways are the climate wars connected to the institutional

                        framework of Australian democracy such as the design of the
                        electoral system, term lengths of parliamentarians, the tolerance
                        (or not) of political protest, and the regulation of political
                        donations and lobbying?

  3.3 Rule of Law

   The rule of law is generally associated with a set of standards or principles directed
   at the constraint of the arbitrary exercise of State power for the purpose of protecting
   individual liberty and dignity.32 Focused on constraining power and reducing arbitrary
   discretion, the rule of law has been critiqued by those who would like to see greater
   government intervention in matters such as social welfare and, similarly, addressing
   climate change. The rule of law has also been associated with other objectives.
   The World Bank, for instance, has described the importance of the rule of law
   for providing `a stable investment environment and the predictability necessary for
   markets to operate'.33 The cry for stability under rule of law can cut in different ways

32. For a general and accessible introduction to the rule of law, see Kristen Rundle, Revisiting the Rule of Law (CUP, 2022).

                                                                                                                                                                  150

   in the climate change debate. It can be an important driver to retain the status quo for
   vested interests in emitting industries such as fossil fuels, but a stable regime is also an
   important factor for emerging markets such as renewable energy.

   What elements constitute the rule of law principles differs according to the definitional
   approach. A `thin' or `formal and procedural' account of the rule of law emphasises
   a list of formal qualities: the equal application of law; the separation of powers;
   accessible judicial review and an independent judiciary; and prospective, clear, stable
   and publicly promulgated laws. More contested are `thick' proscriptions for the rule of
   law, which build on the thin conceptions to add more substantive protection for rights.
   More recently, this has given rise to the idea of `environmental rule of law', in which
   the formal rule of law principles are integrated with individual and environmental
   rights and obligations to improve environmental governance.34

   The rule of law, the role of law and the courts within the legal system prompt questions
   about where responsibility best lies for addressing climate change. The Australian
   instantiation of the rule of law is generally associated with the thin, formal and
   procedural version. The Constitution protects some -- but not all -- of the procedural
   aspects of the rule of law, including the right to seek judicial relief from the actions of
   Commonwealth and state officials, judicial independence and minimum standards for
   a fair trial.35 This has given the judiciary an important role in ensuring the oversight
   of violations of environmental law by governments, individuals and industry. Judicial
   review of government decisions to grant approvals or licences for mining and other
   activities that would damage the environment and contribute to climate change has
   been an important lever for advocates.

   Some within government and industry have criticised the use of the law and the courts
   in this way. Former Commonwealth Attorney-General under the Howard coalition
   government George Brandis explained his concerns about `green lawfare', which
   he described as using `the law and the institutions and processes of the law ... to

       governance/what-we-do/promoting-environmental-rule-law-0>.

       2011).
     151

   conduct a kind of social, political or environmental warfare by other means'.36 But the
   use of law as part of a larger campaign to achieve broader interests is not limited to
   environmental groups. The use of `strategic lawsuits against public participation',
   or `SLAPP suits', by industry against NGOs and prominent campaigners has also been
   a dimension of climate change politics in Australia. For instance, in 2020 a subsidiary
   of Indian multinational company Adani brought a $600 million compensation claim
   against an environmental campaigner for unlawfully disrupting operations at its
   Carmichael mine in Queensland. The ACT has attempted to ban such suits under the
   Protection of Public Participation Act 2008 (ACT).37

   However, there are limits to what judges can do under this traditional conception
   of judicial review and a formal and proceduralised account of the rule of law. In
   particular, it limits the courts to reviewing legality and procedure of decisions, rather
   than the substance of the decision in relation to its effects on climate change and the
   environment, or future generations.

   In Australia, protection of more substantive aspects in relation to human rights and
   environmental protection rely on a complex mix of political and legal
   constitutionalism, and there has been legislative inaction and judicial pushback
   against the idea that the courts might play a broader oversight role in relation to
   addressing climate change risk. These concerns have played out in recent Federal
   Court litigation, culminating in Minister for Environment v Sharma.38 The Full Court
   of the Federal Court denied a claim by a group of children that the federal Minister for
   the Environment owed them -- as representing the next generation -- a duty of care
   to avoid injury or death arising from the emission of greenhouse gases in the exercise
   of a discretion under the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act
   1999 (Cth) to issue a coalmine extension. Part of the reasoning lay on the ground
   that such a legal development would draw the judiciary into the determination of
   complex `multidisciplinary' policy issues that required difficult judgement calls and
   the negotiation of domestic as well as international affairs. They are matters, in the

   government responsible for law-making and policy-making' and `inappropriate for

   `structure of responsible and representative parliamentary democracy'.40

   These concerns are not unique to Australian public law, and they can be identified
   also in New Zealand and American case law.41 This can be contrasted to European
   courts, which have embraced this role for courts as overseers in relation to government
   commitments to take steps to address climate change.42 Zoe Bush has argued that
   the reason for this differing approach across systems could be attributed to different
   constitutional cultures, where those with legally enforceable social and economic
   rights are more likely to embrace a role for the courts in ensuring adequate political
   responses to climate change.43 Scholars have argued that rather than undermining
   traditional understandings of the separation of powers these cases represent an
   adaptation of the separation of powers to ensure the independent judiciary is able to
   act as an effective check on majoritarian democracy, concerned for the immediate
   interests of the majority of the current generation. Court decisions have not dictated
   government policy outcomes to the government but rather required the government to
   explain and justify their policy choices, thus strengthening the legitimacy and quality
   of political decision-making.44

                  Are the rule of law and judicial review necessarily associated with

                    encouraging responses to the climate crisis?
                  How does Australia's system of judicial review limit the way that

                    courts can oversee governments' responses to climate change?

4. Directions of Climate Reform for Australian Public
Law

This section explores how the evolving climate crisis will shape the future directions
of Australian public law. We highlight the mutually constituting relationship between
public law and the crisis. By `mutually constituting', we refer to the dynamic process
already introduced earlier in the chapter, where phenomena fundamentally and
iteratively shape each other; that is, public law provides the framework for the sites
and conceptions of climate action in Australia, and in turn the climate crisis actively
reconfigures Australian public law. Here, we consider a spectrum of possible future
reforms.

A key dimension of the future of climate responses is the growing role of the State.
Traditionally, as we have seen, climate change has been framed within Australia as a
policy issue -- a challenge that can be delegated to various levels of government or
private actors to solve. However, as the climate crisis deepens, there will be increasing
pressure to position the State as the central structure through which Australia responds.
This includes both a national and international dimension, as the State will need
to ensure that it meets its global climate commitments while addressing domestic
impacts. The imperative of direct and decisive State action will directly challenge
the occlusion of public law and the assumed, but problematic, public/private divide.
Public expectations of State responses will require greater public sector involvement
in mitigation and adaptation strategies, including State-led investments in renewable
energy, infrastructure development and emergency response systems. This is already
happening, with, for instance, the Future Made in Australia Act 2024 (Cth) and the
creation of the statutory investment Net Zero Economic Authority.

In this changing landscape, it is the federal executive that is likely to emerge as a
central player, as there is a growing expectation that Australia will meet its global
obligations to combat climate change. Domestically there is a need for a holistic and
coordinated national responses. The power of the executive will also tend to increase

                                                                 154
   155

  in terms of dealing with the specific states of emergency resulting from climate
  disasters and the `long emergency' of the crisis.1

  With the increased role and powers of the executive will come an increased need for
  public law to be able to support climate responses; that is, to hold the government to
  account for meeting these existential challenges. The three principles that we have set
  out above -- federalism, representative government and rule of law -- will each need
  to be reconstituted to be able to address this future.

 4.1 Federalism: From Vertical Distribution to Vertical
 Integration

  The climate crisis requires a national response that is holistic, effective and
  coordinated, and also anchored in international cooperation and solidarity. There is no
  constitutional reason that Australia's federation cannot meet this challenge, but it does
  require a reimagining of the practice of federalism and greater integration between
  local, state and national responses to climate change. To be effective, this integration
  and coordination needs to be nationally led and enduring, and not dependent on
  the political makeup of the federation. As we introduced above, there is already
  some structural scaffolding that can assist this, including the Ministerial Councils
  and National Cabinet. Strengthening these institutions, making their processes more
  transparent and giving them greater accountability would go some way to address
  the partisan divides that have emerged in the federation.2 Recognising the crucial
  role played by local governments in climate response and constitutional reforms that
  recognise the status of local governments within the federation and return them to
  the discussions of the National Cabinet would also bolster the political imperative for
  longer-term coordination.

 Vested Interests to Intragenerational and Intergenerational

 Responsiveness

  The increased role of the State necessitated by the complexity of the climate crisis
  response must be accompanied by commensurate evolutions in the mechanisms of
  accountability . As we detailed above, the Australian public law system's instantiation
  of representative government and reliance on political constitutionalism have been
  inadequate to respond to the complex intragenerational and intergenerational
  challenges of the climate crisis as a short-term and long-term emergency.

  Strengthening and deepening democratic practices underlying Australia's system of
  representative government are essential as an antidote to discontent with this system.
  Prominent climate activists have likened the crisis to a war -- even a world war
  -- which they argue necessitates the suspension of democracy.3 For instance, Peter
  Garrett, former Labor Minister for Environment, has said that `the climate emergency
  dictates the nation must go onto a "war" footing'.4

  There are immediate reforms that might be able to address the acute deficiencies
  of current practices. These include addressing the distorting influence of vested
  influences through money in politics reforms (more effective donations and
  expenditure regulation), the regulation of lobbyists, strengthening media regulation
  and oversight, and addressing the silencing of public dissent through anti-protest
  legislation or the use of SLAPP suits, which target those advocating stronger climate
  action. Strengthening the mandates and independence of integrity institutions,
  sometimes referred to as the `fourth branch' of government, including anti-corruption
  commissions, ombudsman offices and the Auditor-General, will also address these
  concerns.

  More challenging is the need for representative government to address its failure to
  incentivise longer-term action. Longer terms (federally) might go some way towards
  doing this, although whether it would be sufficient is doubtful. Another option is to

   recraft what Tocqueville called `the spirit of democracy'5 to integrate `a solidaristic
   ethos'.6 This is about countering short-termism and self-interest in political systems
   and providing imperatives for intragenerational and intergenerational solidarity. One
   way to achieve this could be through a dedicated institution, such as a Future
   Generations Commission, to hold the government to account for its actions on behalf
   of future generations. This idea has been adopted in Wales through legislation7 that
   places a duty on every public body to carry out sustainable development, which
   requires acting in a manner that `seeks to ensure that the needs of the present are
   met without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs'.8
   Another alternative is what Ron Levy has referred to as `fixed constitutional
   commitments'.9 These are constitutionally set targets to address climate change that
   would provide a constitutional imperative for democratic response and enduring
   commitment to addressing climate change.

   How to invigorate multi-vocality in the practice of democracy is a more complex
   challenge. Australia's practice of democracy through representative government needs
   to be made more inclusive for climate-vulnerable communities that have historically
   been marginalised, including women and girls, youth, Indigenous peoples and climate
   migrants. This requires a shift from a focus on elections and representatives to the
   ongoing inclusive and deliberative practice of democracy. The Uluru Statement from
   the Heart's proposal for a First Nations Voice was a structural reform directed to such
   an end. While the 2023 referendum rejected the constitutional establishment of this
   body, its imperative, that there needs to be dedicated and properly resourced structural
   mechanisms for these groups to be heard in society, remains acute.10

Other options that might promote a more inclusive practice of democracy include the
greater use of mechanisms such as deliberative multilateral forums (eg forms of
citizens assemblies) to generate and determine policy responses to the climate crisis.
If carefully designed, and seen as legitimate within the broader democratic system,
these reforms would ensure that the most vulnerable have a seat at the table as well as
fostering a shared responsibility across society to address the climate crisis.

4.3 Rule of Law Reforms: From Empowerment and
Constraint to Legal Duties?

With the increased role of the executive there is naturally a turn to an increased -- and
possibly different -- role for the courts. This might entail relatively modest reforms
to the current system, such as increasing the courts' oversight role by expanding the
range of grounds for judicial review, with greater statutory legal rights and obligations
to serve as footholds for future litigation. An example of such a reform was the attempt
to reverse the Full Court of the Federal Court's decision in Sharma in 2023 through
the Climate Change Amendment (Duty of Care and Intergenerational Equity) Bill
2023. This Bill provided a new, legally enforceable duty for government decision-
makers to consider the health and wellbeing of current and future children in relation
to decisions that would affect climate change. Another relatively modest reform
to increase oversight would be to introduce greater scope for merits review of
environmental decisions through the independent tribunal system.

There are other more radical and climate-directed reforms which move beyond the
concepts of empowerment and constraint on the State towards the conception of direct
and legally enforceable duties on the State. This is a move that would previously have
been antithetical to the political constitutionalism and liberal democratic traditions
of Australia. But perhaps it is needed for the climate crisis, where the traditional
institutions of representative government have proven inadequate. This might be
achieved through the inclusion of judicially enforceable constitutional rights and
duties on the State in relation to various aspects of climate justice, including to
provide a healthy environment, to protect nature and to provide for future generations.
This is not as radical as it might sound to an Australian public lawyer. Many, in
    159

   fact most, other countries have constitutional environmental-related rights protections,
   with concomitant duties on the State,11 although they have varied in their effectiveness.

                                          DISCUSSION QUESTIONS

           Consider the broad range of different options canvassed in this section for
           reforming Australian public law in ways that might facilitate more effective
           responses to the climate crisis, including:

                     strengthening the coordinating institutions of Australian
                       federalism such as the Ministerial Councils and National Cabinet,
                       making their processes more transparent and giving them greater
                       accountability;

                     recognising the role played by local governments in addressing
                       the climate crisis through constitutional recognition and
                       participation in the National Cabinet;

                     addressing the distorting influence of the fossil fuel industry
                       through money in politics reforms and the regulation of lobbyists,
                       strengthening media regulation and oversight and addressing the
                       silencing of public dissent through anti-protest legislation or the
                       use of SLAPP suits;

                     strengthening the mandates and independence of integrity
                       institutions, sometimes referred to as the `fourth branch' of
                       government, including anti-corruption commissions, ombudsman
                       offices and the Auditor-General;

                     creating a Future Generations Commission to hold the
                       government to account for its actions on behalf of future
                       generations;

                     introducing `fixed constitutional commitments' that constitutionally
                       set targets to address climate change;

                     making greater use of mechanisms such as deliberative

5. Conclusion

In this chapter we have highlighted how traditional liberal democratic conceptions of
Australian public law, with their heavy emphasis on political constitutionalism and
accountability, have tended to obscure its importance for climate change mitigation
and adaptation. However, we have shown that Australian public law and climate
change are mutually constituting. As the effects of climate change are amplified, the
role of the State and the public law framework within which it operates grows in
importance. In this context, we have highlighted a spectrum of public law reforms --
from those that centre and reinforce political accountability for climate change action
(or inaction) to more radical shifts that would provide greater judicial accountability
for climate change policy failures.
In important respects, these reforms demand a more stringent application of liberal
democratic principles (eg enhanced oversight of the executive, more robust integrity
agencies and eliminating the undue influence of vested interests). Many of them,
however, call for a repositioning of Australian public law in relation to these
principles. They will mean a reimagining of these principles (eg a vertically integrated
federalism) and going beyond them (eg solidarity and multi-vocality in representative
government, and duties on the State).

                                                                 161

  This chapter explores a range of issues about the connections between climate change
  and criminal law and procedure. The aim is to help students broaden and deepen their
  understanding of each, and their connections. The chapter addresses various issues
  concerning the interpretation of existing law, critical analysis of the law, conceptual
  reconfigurations of the law's possibilities and normative prescriptions for law reform.
  These different topics intersect in multifarious ways and should not be treated in
  isolation.

Through the actions the law criminalises and the ways the criminal justice system
processes accused persons and offenders, a society formally recognises what counts
as `harms', who counts as a `victim' and who counts as a `criminal' -- and these will
reflect and express a range of fundamentally important social and political values. The
criminalisation of conduct and the subsequent prosecution and punishment of crimes
are also very important ways through which a society seeks to change the behaviour
of some of its members. The creation of new criminal laws, and the prosecution and
punishment of criminal offenders, are usually intended to deter undesirable future
behaviour (such as pollution or environmental destruction) and possibly encourage
desirable behaviour (such as lower carbon emissions). The criminal law can also
be an effective, if rather blunt, tool in protecting the status quo, by criminalising
and punishing activism that seeks to change how things are being done and by not
criminalising environmentally destructive activity.

 1. Criminal Law and Combating Climate Change

 1.1. Criminalising Excessive Greenhouse Gas Emissions
 and Production of Fossil Fuels

  1.1.1. Criminalisation as Means of Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions
  Given that the main cause of anthropogenic climate change is excessive emissions of
  greenhouse gases, much effort has been put into law reform proposals that aim at
  reducing such emissions, through incentives, disincentives, or a combination of both.
  Such proposals include emissions trading schemes, tax incentives for cleaner energy
  sources, government subsidies for reducing emissions, and licensing regimes whereby
  only industries that emit within specified limits may retain their licence.1 Another
  option is to make it a criminal offence to emit excessive amounts of greenhouse gas
  (GHG). This involves imposing the disincentive of criminal punishment, and would
  clearly be a more radical step, as criminalisation is usually regarded as properly only a
  `last resort', after other forms of legal regulation have at least been considered.2

  1.1.2. The Justification of Criminalisation
  What would be an acceptable policy basis for criminalising excessive GHG emissions?
  `Traditional' serious crimes such as assault, theft or threats to kill are usually made
  offences because they are actions which not only cause harm but also do so wrongfully
  or culpably. That is, it is not just because someone is harmed by such acts (eg
  they suffer physical pain, injury, loss of property, fear) that they are made criminal
  offences, it is also because these acts involve inflicting such harm in a morally
  objectionable or wrongful way (eg the acts are done with intent to harm, or with
  awareness of the probability of harm, or with dishonesty). The criminal law, as

      Australia (LexisNexis, 11th ed, 2023) [4.22]-[4.62].

      Law as Last Resort' (2004) 24(2) Oxford Journal of Legal Studies 207
                                                                   167

  Simester and von Hirsch have argued, is `a morally loaded regulatory tool',3 which
  means that making something a crime is not just a matter of prohibiting it but also of
  censuring (or morally blaming) those who commit such acts.4

  That may (or may not) be relatively straightforward for traditional crimes against the
  person or property offences, but how well would this approach to criminalisation apply
  to a `non-traditional' crime such as excessive GHG emissions? Emitting greenhouse
  gases can now be regarded as a harmful activity, but what makes such conduct
  wrongful or morally culpable? Does it merit the morally loaded label of being a
  crime? Is that label merited because, now that it is clear to reasonable people that such
  emissions are harmful (to humans, other animals and other organisms), to engage in
  such action intentionally, knowingly, recklessly or grossly negligently is sufficiently
  morally blameworthy to warrant being censured as `a crime'?

  Alternatively, criminalisation might be justified on the basis simply that it is socially
  desirable that emissions be reduced. Making excessive emissions a criminal offence,
  on this argument, is not so much a moral condemnation as just a way to `nudge' people
  into complying with socially desirable behaviours, in much the same way that parking
  offences are a tool for getting people to use parking spaces fairly, and not a form of
  moral condemnation.

                                               KEY QUESTIONS
                    Do you find either of these arguments persuasive?
                    Is there another justification for criminalisation of excessive

                      emissions?

  1.1.3. Defining the New Crime

  If the legislature decided to make excessive GHG emissions a crime, there is then the
  question of how this new offence should be defined. The legal definition of a criminal
  offence consists of the elements of the offence, these being the distinct factual matters
  that need to be proved for the offence in question to be proved. Criminal offence
  elements are traditionally divided into two basic kinds: physical elements (actus reus
  -- the guilty act) and mental or fault elements (mens rea -- the guilty mind).5 Physical
  elements are usually one of three kinds: conduct, circumstance and result. The most
  common fault elements are intention, knowledge, recklessness, gross negligence and
  dishonesty.

  In brief, in the definition of a criminal act, a person performs some act or omits to
  do so (the conduct), does so in a particular situation (circumstance) and does so with
  some result being caused by that conduct. Not every criminal offence has to have
  a circumstance or result; some criminal offences have just a conduct element as the
  physical element. Each physical element might also have a fault element associated
  with it; for example, the conduct might have been intentional, with the circumstance
  being known, and the person being reckless as to the result.

  With regard to the definition of a new offence of excessive GHG emissions, it would
  seem that the conduct element would need to be a matter of emitting a specified GHG
  beyond a specified amount, over a particular time period. It would also seem necessary
  to specify under what circumstances the excessive emission occurred; for example,
  are the emitters to be anyone or just certain industries? Most criminal offences apply
  to everyone: murder, theft and threats to kill do not specify that they only apply to
  some people. Should that approach apply to a new offence of excessive emissions? Or
  would it be appropriate to restrict the offence so that it applied only to corporations or
  individuals engaged in identified GHG-emitting industries?

  With regard to the fault elements of the new offence, it would seem that there could
  be a range of possible mental states: there could be different offences for intentional,

5. See the High Court case of He Kaw Teh v R (1985) 157 CLR 523 for the highly influential analyses of criminal offence
      elements by Gibbs CJ and Brennan J (as he then was). Chapter 2 of the Commonwealth Criminal Code (being a
      schedule to the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth)) sets out a clear analysis of the basic types of criminal elements for
      Commonwealth offences, influenced by the analysis in He Kaw Teh (via the national Model Criminal Code project of
      the 1990s).

  knowing, reckless and negligent breaches of the relevant limit. There is also the
  possibility that the new offence should have no fault elements. No-fault offences
  consist solely of the physical elements, with no need for the prosecution to prove any
  fault elements. If the accused is allowed by law to raise the defence of mistake of
  fact in relation to such an offence, then the offence is a strict liability offence; if the
  defence is not available, then the offence is an absolute liability offence. That defence
  is satisfied if the accused mistakenly but reasonably believed in the existence of facts
  which, had they existed, would have meant that the accused's conduct would not have
  constituted an offence. Usually, the accused needs to provide or point to evidence that
  raises the issue (the evidential burden); the onus is then on the prosecution to disprove
  it.6

  Similar to the defence of honest and reasonable mistake is the defence of due
  diligence. This appears in various statutory provisions and allows, in essence, that it
  is a defence if the accused corporation took reasonable precautions and exercised due
  diligence to avoid committing an offence and the offence occurred because of causes
  beyond the accused's control.7

                    How do you think a new offence of excessive GHG emissions

                      should be defined?
                    What physical and fault elements would you give the offence?

  legislatures to be seen to be doing something.8 However, the question must always be
  asked whether criminalisation is effective in changing behaviour. This is especially
  important where what is being criminalised is not a clear moral wrong that most people
  would see as deserving condemnation and punishment (such as murder or rape) but
  is more a matter of something that is socially undesirable. The point of criminalising
  such conduct is to try to prevent the conduct from happening in the first place rather
  than punish those who have engaged in it. If the point of criminalisation is not so much
  to morally censure offenders but to deter people from offending, then there should
  normally be good evidence to support the claim that criminalisation would be effective
  as a deterrent.
  One of the fears concerning the criminalisation of conduct where the main offenders
  are commercial corporations is that where fines constitute the penalty for breaking
  the law, that burden simply becomes part of the cost of doing business. The criminal
  penalty thus runs the risk of being simply the `government fee' for engaging in the
  targeted conduct, rather than an effective deterrent.

                           1.2. Ecocide

  1.2.1. Background to the Proposed Offence of Ecocide

   The scale of the effects of climate change has raised the prospect of the destruction
   of whole ecosystems. This has renewed calls for the creation of a new offence, under
   international criminal law, of `ecocide'. International criminal law is criminal law
   that has been created at the international level, in contrast with domestic or national
   criminal law, which is where most criminal offences are found. International law
   as such usually concerns the rights and obligations of states; international criminal
   law, however, imposes criminal liability directly on individuals and provides for
   enforcement through international judicial institutions such as the International
   Criminal Court.9

   According to one of the champions of the idea of ecocide, the late Polly Higgins,

               [e]cocide is the extensive damage to, destruction of or loss of ecosystem(s)
               of a given territory, whether by human agency or by other causes, to such an
               extent that peaceful enjoyment by the inhabitants of that territory has been
               severely diminished.10

   The term `ecocide' has gained currency since the 1960s. Ecocide was originally
   conceived as a possible war crime.11 But the idea has since evolved such that large-
   scale environmental harm is something that can be done in peacetime and with
   sufficiently harmful effects that it should be part of both domestic and international
   criminal law.

   Higgins and others have argued that ecocide should be included in the Rome Statute
   of the International Criminal Court, an international treaty adopted in 1998 that

11. The works of Richard Falk were very influential in this regard. See, eg, his early article, `Environmental Warfare and
       Ecocide -- Facts, Appraisal, and Proposals' (1973) 4(1) Bulletin of Peace Proposals 80-96.
     173

   established the International Criminal Court.12 The jurisdiction of that court is limited
   to `the most serious crimes of concern to the international community as a whole'
   (Article 5, para 1). Ecocide, it has been argued, should be included as a fifth
   international atrocity crime, after the existing four core international crimes of
   genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and the crime of aggression.13

  1.2.2. Proposed Definition of `Ecocide'

   In June 2021, an Independent Expert Panel for the Legal Definition of Ecocide,
   convened by the Stop Ecocide Foundation, proposed a definition of `ecocide' to be
   inserted into the Rome Statute:

               "ecocide" means unlawful or wanton acts committed with knowledge that
               there is a substantial likelihood of severe and either widespread or long-term
               damage to the environment being caused by those acts.

   The Panel then proposed that the following definitions of key terms also be included
   in the Rome Statute:

                       a. "Wanton" means with reckless disregard for damage which would
                           be clearly excessive in relation to the social and economic benefits
                           anticipated;

                       b. "Severe" means damage which involves very serious adverse
                           changes, disruption or harm to any element of the environment,
                           including grave impacts on human life or natural, cultural or
                           economic resources;

                       c. "Widespread" means damage which extends beyond a limited
                           geographic area, crosses state boundaries, or is suffered by an
                           entire ecosystem or species or a large number of human beings;

                       d. "Long-term" means damage which is irreversible or which cannot

       Ch 8, Division 268.

                           be redressed through natural recovery within a reasonable period
                           of time;
                       e. "Environment" means the earth, its biosphere, cryosphere,
                           lithosphere, hydrosphere and atmosphere, as well as outer space.

            READ THE PANEL'S COMMENTARY ON THE PROPOSED OFFENCE
                  AND DEFINITIONS, AND THEN CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING
                                                    QUESTIONS:

                      Are the elements of the proposed offence sufficiently clear to
                        enable them to be readily applied to conduct in the real world?

                      To whose actions do you think the offence would most likely
                        apply? Governments? Corporations? Individuals?

                      If the offence covers damage to `any element of the environment'
                        so long as it was very serious and either widespread or long
                        term, would that mean that eradicating all the rabbits on
                        Macquarie Island was a case of ecocide? If it was, would that be
                        a problem for the definition of ecocide? If it was not a case of
                        ecocide, is that because we assume that that population of
                        rabbits was not `an element of the environment' or because
                        eradication of a `pest species' is not actually a harm to the
                        environment, even if thousands of animals died painfully in the
                        process?

  1.2.3. Is Ecocide Still a Human-Centric Concept?

   The offence of ecocide represents a major shift in thinking as to whose or what
   interests the criminal law can and should protect. The criminal law relating to fatal
   offences has traditionally been very human-centred. Fatal offences in Australia such
   as murder and manslaughter have been limited to the killing of human beings.14
   The killing of animals, where it is a crime, has largely been left to offences under

14. See, eg, R v Hutty [1953] VLR 338.
     175

   legislation intended to prevent cruelty to animals.15 Human-centrism is also the norm
   in international criminal law.16

                                                 KEY QUESTIONS
                      Some proposals for a crime of ecocide present it as a crime

                        involving a breach of the duty of care owed to humanity in
                        general.17 Is that a human-centric way of looking at things? That
                        is, does it measure environmental harm primarily in terms of the
                        harm it does to human beings? Is that desirable?
                      Should ecocide instead be restricted to the idea that ecosystems
                        and non-human living entities have inherent value in themselves
                        and can suffer harms regardless of whether human beings suffer
                        any harm?18
                      How human-centric is the Independent Expert Panel's definition
                        of `ecocide', given it includes damage to cultural and economic
                        resources?

    1.3. Criminal Responsibility of Corporations
                      for Climate Offences

  1.3.1. Corporate Criminal Responsibility

   Much of the activity that contributes to climate change is performed by corporations
   rather than individual human beings. It may be argued, then, that if ecocide or emitting
   excessive amounts of greenhouse gases were to be criminalised, the offences should
   be drafted to reflect the fact that the most likely (and most important) culprits will be
   corporate entities.

   A corporation is an artificial legal person, and, being a legal person, can acquire
   and dispose of property, enter into contracts, and sue or be sued. It can also be held
   criminally responsible. It is conceptually reasonably straightforward to attribute the
   actus reus or physical element of a criminal offence to a corporation: where the
   employees, servants or agents of the corporation engage in certain conduct while
   performing their contractual duties, that conduct can be attributed to the corporation.

   It is more difficult to make sense of how mens rea or fault elements (things such as
   intention, knowledge, recklessness, negligence and dishonesty) are to be attributed to
   an abstract entity with no real mind of its own. One of the main ways that the common
   law attributes fault to a corporation is to identify some particular human being (or
   more than one) who embodies `the mind and will' of the corporation.19 If a human
   being is the corporation's guiding mind and will and, while they were acting in their
   role, they had the relevant intention or knowledge, then that intention or knowledge
   can be attributed to the corporation. Such people will usually be very senior officers
   of a corporation: directors, chief executives or senior managers. The Commonwealth
   Criminal Code provides for the attribution of fault where the board of directors or a
   `high managerial agent' of the corporation `explicitly, tacitly or impliedly authorised
   or permitted the commission of the offence'.20

                                                 KEY QUESTIONS
                      What if a junior officer of the corporation committed the offence

                        and had the relevant fault element? If the junior officer was acting
                        outside the scope of what their senior managers authorised or
                        permitted, should the corporation be allowed to argue that it is
                        not responsible for such a `rogue' employee?
                      Should the corporation also be required to prove a defence of
                        `due diligence' and show that it took appropriate positive steps
                        (eg education and training of staff) to prevent the offence from
                        happening?21
                      What could such appropriate steps be in the case of new climate
                        offences such as ecocide or excessive emission of greenhouse
                        gases?

  1.3.2. Corporate Culture

   Another approach to corporate criminal liability is not to look at the level of
   individuals' conduct but to look instead at the corporation's `culture'. The
   Commonwealth Criminal Code defines this as `an attitude, policy, rule, course of
   conduct or practice existing within the body corporate generally or in the part of the
   body corporate in which the relevant activities takes [sic] place'.22 A corporate culture
   is thus something distinct from and not reducible to the minds of individuals.

   The Code provides that criminal fault can be proved where there was a corporate
   culture `that directed, encouraged, tolerated or led to non-compliance with the relevant
   provision'.23 This can be especially relevant to offences involving omissions or
   negligence.

                      What evidence do you think would prove the existence of the

                        relevant kind of corporate culture?
                      If a corporation's culture of disregarding environmental harms

                        simply reflected the broader society's culture of such disregard,
                        would it be fair to find that corporation to be criminally
                        responsible?

  1.3.3. Would the `Carbon Majors' be Complicit in Criminally
  Excessive Emissions?

   There is also the question of the responsibility of corporations which extract and
   supply the fossil fuels whose subsequent consumption creates excessive GHG
   emissions. Some have argued that the major fossil fuel production corporations (the
   `carbon majors') can be seen as complicit where they knew such emissions would
   follow when they supplied the fuels, in much the same way that a person who gives
   another person a gun, knowing that they will use it to murder someone else, can be
   regarded as an accessory to the subsequent murder.24

   Under the Commonwealth Criminal Code, criminal responsibility is extended, via the
   concept of complicity, to those who thus enable the principal offender to commit the
   offence:

   A person who aids, abets, counsels or procures the commission of an offence by
   another person is taken to have committed that offence and is punishable
   accordingly.25

 2. Criminal Law and Climate Activism

 2.1. Anti-Protest Laws

  Climate activists engage in lawful forms of advocacy and various forms of civil
  disobedience. The concept of `civil disobedience' is much contested, but one
  influential definition presents it as `a public, non-violent and conscientious breach
  of law undertaken with the aim of bringing about a change in laws or government
  policies'.1 There has been a long history of environmental activists engaging in civil
  disobedience.2 Law-abiding climate activism, including school climate strikes, can
  be very effective. Nevertheless, law-breaking on the part of climate activists has
  become more common in recent years. `Extinction Rebellion' is a powerful global
  phenomenon; this climate activist group embraces the tenet that civil disobedience is
  a necessary pathway to the radical social and political changes required to prevent
  cataclysmic climate change.3 Subsequently, the arrival of even more radical offshoots,
  such as `Just Stop Oil' in the United Kingdom (UK) and `Blockade Australia' and
  `Disrupt Burrup Hub' in Australia, has heralded a further escalation in tactics, with a
  focus on disruption and real or simulated property damage.4 This includes the throwing
  of food and gluing of hands to the perspex covers of major artworks in public galleries.

  It is important to keep in mind that the approach adopted by groups such as Extinction
  Rebellion in which activists should be prepared to be arrested for acts of civil
  disobedience does not necessarily factor in the discriminatory treatment of people of
  colour within criminal justice systems. In 2019, the grassroots collective `Wretched of

      Blow Up a Pipeline : Learning to Fight in a World on Fire (Verso, 2021). In 2023, a film with the same title was
      released; this is a fictitious portrayal of young activists preparing to destroy an oil pipeline. You can watch the trailer

  the Earth' wrote that `[t]he strategy of XR [Extinction Rebellion], with the primary
  tactic of being arrested, is a valid one - but it needs to be underlined by an ongoing
  analysis of privilege as well as the reality of police and state violence'.5

  Anti-protest laws that clearly target environmental activists have been passed in most
  Australian jurisdictions.6 Such legislation has been enacted despite a High Court ruling
  7 that Tasmania's original anti-protest legislation infringed a constitutional implied
  freedom of political communication. In another constitutional challenge in 2023,
  Kvelde v NSW [2023] NSWSC 1560, NSW anti-protest legislation passed in 2022
  was struck down as invalid. This legislation imposed penalties of up to two years
  imprisonment and/or fines of up to $22,000 for disrupting or damaging major roads or
  major public facilities. Similarly draconian anti-protest legislation has recently been
  enacted in the UK.8

  Some activists arrested for minor offences, such as traffic obstruction, have been
  granted bail with conditions that are far more onerous than those usually imposed in
  relation to such charges.9 These conditions seem to be aimed directly at preventing the
  protester from exercising basic civil and political rights. One example is that of Scott
  Ludlum, a former Senator for the Greens Party, who was arrested and charged with

7. Brown v Tasmania (2017) 261 CLR 328.

8. For instance, the Public Order Act 2023 targets climate activists with new offences of `locking on', going to protests with
      equipment to lock on, obstructing major transport works, interfering with national infrastructure and tunnelling; there
      are maximum penalties of prison sentences (up to three years for tunnelling) and/or unlimited fines.

9. When a person has been arrested and charged with a criminal offence, there is a fundamentally important question as
      to whether they should be kept (`remanded') in custody until their trial or whether they should be given back their
      freedom (granted bail) on the understanding that they will voluntarily attend their trial. Often, it will be a magistrate
      or bail justice who makes the decision about bail, but police can grant bail as well. A presumption of bail is reflected
      in Article 9(3) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (1966), which provides (in part): `It shall
      not be the general rule that persons awaiting trial shall be detained in custody, but release may be subject to guarantees
      to appear for trial, at any other stage of the judicial proceedings, and should occasion arise, for execution of the
      judgement.'

   obstructing traffic and granted bail by police on the condition that he not come within
   2.5 km of the Sydney Town Hall or attend future Extinction Rebellion events.10

   Problematically, acts of civil disobedience on the part of climate activists are
   increasingly conflated with acts of terrorism or `ecoterrorism'. Governments in the
   Global North are resorting to various forms of counterterrorism surveillance.11 There
   have been pre-emptive strikes on Australian activists, mirroring the pre-emptive nature
   of many anti-terrorism offences. In June 2022, a police raid on a gathering of climate
   activists at Mount Colo led to the arrest of seven activists, with the so-called leader
   charged with `aiding and abetting the commission of a future crime' and refused bail.12
   Later that year, police officers, including members of the Queensland counter-terror
   command unit, visited the homes of climate activists to deter them from participating
   in protests at the forthcoming International Mining and Resources Conference.13 The
   pre-emptive surveillance and policing of Australian climate activists in Western
   Australia was exposed in a 2023 Four Corners program.14

   There are also international instances in which law-breaking activists have received
   sentences designed for terrorists. For instance, in 2016 and 2017, Jessica Reznicek
   and Ruby Montoya blasted holes in parts of the Dakota Access Pipeline in the United
   States (US) with a blowtorch. Reznicek was sentenced to 96 months in prison, and

   clause. Her appeal against this sentence was unsuccessful.15

   We are familiar with historical examples of law-abiding behaviour being
   retrospectively criminalised, as in the Israeli trial of Nazi bureaucrat Adolf Eichmann,
   who was following orders in orchestrating the transportation of countless people to
   concentration camps. The converse position, as articulated by many in the climate
   movement, is that `protesters condemned as criminals today will be the heroes of
   tomorrow'.16

                                                 KEY QUESTIONS
           Do you think that acts of civil disobedience by climate activists should be
           punished as crimes or acts of terrorism? Why/why not?

  2.2. Defence of Emergency or Necessity

   In raising the defence of necessity,17 a defendant in a criminal prosecution does not
   dispute that they committed the act which constitutes the alleged offence but claims
   that it was justified on the basis that it was a necessary action to prevent or avert a
   greater evil. Climate activists are using this defence to argue that it is necessary to
   break the law in order to avert the far greater evils associated with climate change.

       criminals-heroes-truth>.
17. The defence of necessity or sudden or extraordinary emergency is available in all Australian jurisdictions. The
       Commonwealth Criminal Code's version of the defence of sudden or extraordinary emergency (s 10.3) is
       representative: `(1) A person is not criminally responsible for an offence if he or she carries out the conduct
       constituting the offence in response to circumstances of sudden or extraordinary emergency. (2) This section applies if
       and only if the person carrying out the conduct reasonably believes that: (a) circumstances of sudden or extraordinary
       emergency exist; and (b) committing the offence is the only reasonable way to deal with the emergency; and (c) the
       conduct is a reasonable response to the emergency.'
                                                                                                                                                                  184

   In Australia, the common law defence of necessity is available in NSW18 but, to
   date, has not been successfully invoked by climate activists. In other Australian
   jurisdictions, the defence is codified as the extraordinary emergency defence. In
   Queensland, `a person is not criminally responsible for an act done under such
   circumstances of sudden or extraordinary emergency that an ordinary person
   possessing ordinary power of self-control could not reasonably be expected to act
   otherwise'.19

   An early success with the defence, framed as lawful excuse, occurred at the 2008 trial
   in the UK of six members of Greenpeace. They were charged with criminal damage
   after climbing the Kingsnorth power station chimney, graffitiing it, and causing the
   temporary closure of the power station. A jury acquitted them after five expert
   witnesses explained the property damage that would result from climate change. One
   activist posed this question:

               If jurors from the heart of Middle England say it's legitimate for a direct
               action group to shut down a coal-fired power station because of the harm it
               does to our planet, then where does that leave government energy policy?20

   British climate activists have had little subsequent success in presenting the defence of
   necessity, with judges holding that it is inapplicable. This was certainly the direction
   to the jury in the 2019 trial of Extinction Rebellion founder Roger Hallam and another
   climate activist for property damage; the jury nevertheless acquitted them after hearing
   evidence on climate change risks.21 Arguing the defence or even alluding to the
   climate crisis, in the face of judicial instructions to the contrary, can have serious

18. See, eg, Veira v Cook [2021] NSWCA 302 (an animal rescue case, in which rescuing chickens from cruel conditions did
       not satisfy the defence of necessity).

19. Section 25 of the Criminal Code 1899 (Qld). In Victoria and South Australia the common law defence of necessity has
       been abolished and replaced with a statutory defence of `sudden or extraordinary emergency': see Crimes Act 1958
       (Vic) s 322R and Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1935 (SA) s 15E.

   consequences; defendants who do so have been jailed for contempt of court.22 Even
   holding up a sign stating `Jurors: you have an absolute right to acquit a defendant
   according to your conscience' outside a courtroom in which climate activists are tried
   could lead to contempt charges.23

   In the US, there have been no acquittals on the basis of necessity. The defence has
   been allowed to be put to the jury in a number of trials,24 including the 2014 trial of
   two activists who used a lobster boat to block the delivery of coal to a generating
   station and the 2016 trial of the `Delta Five', who blocked railway tracks used by crude
   oil trains. In 2019, Ken Ward, one of five `valve turners' who shut down emergency
   valves on tar sands crude oil pipelines, successfully appealed a lower court's refusal to
   allow him to argue necessity.25

   In January 2020, a Swiss court upheld the defence of necessity in the trial of climate
   activists who played tennis in a Lausanne branch of Credit Suisse, but this decision
   was later overturned on appeal.26 Climate activists have also argued in a number of
   French courts that unhooking President Macron's official portraits to highlight climate
   inaction can be justified on the basis of necessity.27

       of the offence charged. This is the right to return a `perverse verdict' (in the United States it is referred to as `jury
       nullification'). It may be that, in some cases where the necessity defence has been argued, the jury has not been
       persuaded that the evidence meets the legal test for the defence, but nonetheless has in good conscience acquitted
       the accused because they believe that, morally speaking, they do not deserve to be convicted. See Richard Vogler,

   Climate change constitutes an extraordinary emergency, even if it is not a sudden
   one and the peril is not perceived as imminent. Would or should `an ordinary person
   possessing ordinary powers of self-control' respond with acts of civil disobedience?
   It may well be viewed as reasonable to respond to this global emergency with actions
   designed to prevent the construction of a large coalmine or impede the transportation
   of coal by rail. This has not, however, been the approach taken by Queensland
   magistrates, as activist Greg Rolles found out in his 2019 trial.28 Four others have
   subsequently failed to establish that the extraordinary emergency of climate change
   justifies or excuses law-breaking in Queensland.
   The defence of emergency or necessity permits law-breaking and can be viewed
   as undermining legal norms, and hence the rule of law. Climate activists, however,
   believe that the climate crisis poses a far greater threat to the rule of law than do non-
   violent acts of civil disobedience.

                                                  KEY QUESTION
                      Why do you think that judges/magistrates are so reluctant to

                        accept the defence of emergency or necessity?

   activists who engage in such activities.30

   2.3.1. Sentencing Purposes Relevant to Unlawful Climate Activism
   When imposing sentence on a person found guilty of a criminal offence, the sentencing
   judge needs to decide not just what the sentencing order will be (eg imprisonment,
   community-based order, fine) but also the purpose the sentence is to serve. The
   standard permitted sentencing purposes are retribution (or just punishment), deterrence
   (both of the offender specifically and other potential offenders generally), community
   protection, denunciation of the offending, and rehabilitation of the offender.31

                                                 KEY QUESTIONS
                      Which sentencing orders and which sentencing purposes, if any,

                        do you think are most relevant in sentencing climate activists?
                        Why?
                      How important is it, for sentencing purposes, that the activist's
                        law-breaking was non-violent and restrained?

30. See, eg, Helena Horton and agencies, `Just Stop Oil Protesters Jailed for Dartford Crossing Protest', The Guardian

       which purposes are legislated for, and how they are to govern sentencing. See Sentencing Act 1991 (Vic), s 5; Crimes

                      If a climate protest involved violence, physical resistance,
                        threatening behaviour or property damage by a protester, should
                        that change which sentencing orders and sentencing purposes
                        are relevant?

   2.3.2. Are Climate Protesters' Motives Mitigating or Aggravating?
   When deciding the sentence, the sentencing judge needs to consider a range of relevant
   factors, some of which aggravate the sentence to be imposed (eg premeditation, use of
   a weapon, the particular vulnerability of the victim), while others mitigate the sentence
   (eg the offender's youth, their remorse, their good character). One very important
   factor is motive. If the offender acted out of genuine altruism, for example, that might
   mitigate the seriousness of the punishment they deserve. In contrast, if the offender
   acted out of greed or revenge, that could aggravate the punishment.32

   Many, if not most, climate activists who commit criminal offences do so in order to
   draw attention to the problems of climate change and the need for action, and not
   for any personal gain or out of malice or ill-will. Many climate activists are also
   deeply committed to the broader political cause of trying to change many of our
   well-entrenched economic and commercial practices, in order to avert or mitigate the
   damage threatened by climate change, and some are prepared to keep breaking the law
   and go to jail repeatedly in order to further that broader cause.33

                  If a climate activist commits a criminal offence for altruistic
                    motives, how, if at all, should that fact influence the sentencing
                    judge's decision?

                  If a climate activist is prepared to break the criminal law
                    repeatedly in pursuit of the political goal of shutting down the coal
                    industry, does that mean they are `fanatical' or `extremist' and are
                    more at risk of future offending? Or does it just show how sincere
                    their altruism is? How, if at all, should that affect the sentencing
                    judge's decision?

This chapter explores issues at the intersection of climate change and tort law in
Australia. Its aim is to orient the reader to questions that arise as a result of tort law's
collision with the complex new societal challenges facing us as a result of climate
change, both at a general level and in terms of its implications for specific torts.
The word `torts' (which means `wrongs') is an umbrella term that denotes a range
of distinctive civil causes of action (other than for breaches of contract or property
law) that entitle a person (natural or legal) to seek a remedy from another where their
legally protected interests have been impaired. While they have much in common,

                                                                 193
                                                                                                                                                             194

the various torts have different elements and functions that make their collision with
climate change distinctive.
To date, there has been limited tort-based climate litigation in Australia. However,
there are significant examples of tort-based climate litigation in other parts of the
world and scholarly literature that explores what similar litigation might mean in
Australia. This chapter draws on actual and possible developments in Australian tort
law that are animated by the challenge of climate change.
The first part of the chapter explores broad thematic issues that arise when a field of
the `private law' is called to form part of the solution to a collective problem such as
climate change. It explores the legally disruptive potential of climate litigation for tort
law, as well as its appeal to litigants. The second part of the chapter looks at some
principal torts and how those may or may not be amenable to climate litigation. This
part does not aim to be comprehensive, but illustrative of developments in tort law that
climate litigation will demand. Finally, part three considers possible future trajectories,
including those suggested by significant cases overseas.

                                             KEY QUESTIONS
                  To what extent might climate litigation disrupt Australian tort law

                    and is such disruption desirable or problematic?
                  What might `success' look like for litigants seeking to use tort law

                    as a mechanism for achieving climate justice?

 1. Tort Law and Climate Change

  Tort law entitles a person who has suffered harm to a legally recognised interest to
  seek a civil law remedy from the person to whose conduct that harm can be attributed,
  usually in the form of damages, though sometimes in the form of an injunction or
  declaration of interests. It is a part of the field of private law and is paradigmatically
  concerned with interpersonal (relational) responsibilities in the context of one-to-one
  social encounters. For this reason, tort law can be viewed as an inapt legal tool for
  dealing with collective societal challenges such as climate change -- challenges that
  are instead viewed as primarily political or regulatory in nature. Certainly, tort law
  presents an array of doctrinal barriers to climate litigation success. As Kysar notes:

              Built as it is on a paradigm of harm in which A wrongfully, directly, and
              exclusively injures B, tort law seems fundamentally ill-equipped to address
              the causes and impacts of climate change: diffuse and disparate in origin,
              lagged and latticed in effect, anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions
              represent the paradigmatic anti-tort, a collective action problem so pervasive
              and so complicated as to render at once both all of us and none of us
              responsible. Thus, courts will have ample reason -- not to mention doctrinal
              weaponry -- to prevent climate change tort suits from reaching a jury.1

  Nevertheless, around the world litigants are turning to tort law as a legal avenue that
  might help to hasten governmental and private sector action on climate change in the
  face of regulatory failure or help to fund efforts to adapt to, or mitigate, climate harms.
  At the international level, especially prominent have been attempts to use the tort of
  nuisance (particularly in the United States) and the tort of negligence, though other
  torts may also be relevant.2 While Australia is a leader in climate litigation, there have

  been few tort-based climate cases here so far. This is predicted to change, however, as
  part of a second generation of climate litigation in this country.3

  There is a longstanding debate over the social functions of tort law, and the theory
  of tort law one adopts has implications for how one views the legitimacy of climate
  litigation through tort law.4 Much of tort law is best explained through the lens of
  corrective justice or civil recourse theory. Both theories posit that, at its core, tort law
  is a mechanism to empower one person to enforce another's duty of repair to them
  for wrongful harms, a duty personally owed. It is, in that sense, principally backward
  looking.5 Other theories emphasise the forward-oriented regulatory or deterrence
  functions of tort.6 Unlike those other theories of tort law, however, corrective justice
  and civil recourse theory seem to best explain the dyadic structure of tort law -- why
  it is that one person, as a private individual, is entitled to make a claim against another
  specific person for the harm they have caused or may cause.7 This structure, however,
  also underpins why tort-based climate litigation is expected to be difficult.

  Critical challenges raised by tort law's relational structure have been neatly
  summarised into the plaintiff problem, the defendant problem and the causation
  problem.8 The first is the question of why these plaintiffs -- why is it that some victims
  of climate change should be entitled to a personal remedy in light of the fact that
  we will all, ultimately, be victims of climate change. The second is the question of
  why these defendants -- why is it that some actors should be civilly liable for climate
  harms above others, given our collective enmeshment in a carbon economy. And the
  third is the question of how to causally link the two in a way that properly reflects the
  responsibility of repair owed by the second person to the first. While developments

   in attribution science are going some way to addressing these questions, they loom
   large in tort-based climate litigation.

   Whether, and how, tort law can and should evolve in response to the challenges of
   climate change also ties to how we view the role of judges in our constitutional
   context. In Australia, tort law is a combination of common law and statute. While
   many tort principles are malleable, in order to ensure their appropriate application to
   a wide variety of factual matrices, Australian judges are likely to be wary of stepping
   too far into the domains of the legislature and executive when dealing with climate
   change. This raises the question of whether, and to what extent, the nature of the
   threat of climate change and the scale of regulatory failure to date warrant a more
   interventionist judiciary, as well as the risks of such a policy.

   If some commentators are right and the prospects of successful torts claims for
   climate change harms in Australia is low,9 this prompts the question of whether such
   cases should be discouraged. Certainly, civil litigants in Australia face costs risks
   in pursuing cases that are unlikely to succeed.10 However, the appeal of tort law
   as part of a broader climate litigation strategy is understandable for a number of
   reasons. First, tort law has the capacity to evolve, sometimes radically, in the face of
   unprecedented new societal challenges, and it has done so before. For example, new
   realities brought about by the industrial revolution (such as the enlargement of risks
   of accidents and widespread pollution) resulted in developments in nuisance law and
   the emergence of the tort of negligence, a fact that may give cases from that era a
   renewed relevance today.11 Moreover, the failure of tort law to evolve appropriately
   in response to a pressing new social need may prompt the legislature to intervene.
   In Australia, examples include the emergence of alternative statutory compensation
   schemes in settings where risks of injury are particularly acute and the introduction
   of statutory institutional duties of care to protect against child abuse, each of which
   resulted in part to address perceived deficiencies in the common law of torts.

   Increasingly, climate change is understood as a human rights problem. This links to a

       Transnational Law and Practice (Cambridge University Press, 2011) 67, 85-103.

     199

   second factor that renders torts appealing in the Australian context, which is our lack
   of a federal human rights instrument to enable an alternative route to accountability.
   Tort law has sometimes been used to fill that gap, operating as a quasi human
   rights mechanism, for example in relation to the rights of asylum seekers.12 There are
   features of tort law that render it appealing for this role, including its concern with
   the protection of human interests considered either inviolable or fundamental to social
   order. Moreover, tort principles delimit broader normative spheres of public rights and
   wrongs.13 At the same time, the lack of a human rights instrument in Australia through
   which to frame and influence tort law development may make torts climate claims
   more challenging.

   A third factor that can explain the turn to tort law as a part of a broader climate
   litigation strategy is the ways in which tort litigation can create desirable secondary
   social effects, irrespective of formal litigation success. For example, in the context of
   climate change, tort litigation might help to render better known factual histories of
   how we find ourselves still dependant on a carbon economy regardless of longstanding
   science about its risks; it might produce authoritative normative frameworks for
   thinking about the relationship of different actors to climate change and its harms; and,
   as discussed above, it might prompt policy reforms. For example, while the claim in
   Sharma v the Minister for the Environment, discussed below, formally failed, there is
   a political strategy building on that litigation towards the introduction of a statutory
   duty of care to protect against climate change.14

   Finally, it has been argued that the reason why tort law must engage with climate
   harms ties as much to the future of the field itself as to the interests of specific
   litigants. Arguments along these lines suggest that if tort law fails to evolve so as to
   be capable of grappling with the challenges of climate change, it will lose some of its
   social relevance. Courts will be forced to `deem nontortious activities that nevertheless

   threaten core interests tort law claims to protect'.15 The ability of tort law to adapt to
   the new realities of climate change is thus critical to ensure the future integrity of the
   field itself. In short, to survive, tort law `will need to be climatised'.16

 2. Developments in Tort Law in Response to Climate
 Change

 2.1 Negligence

  The tort of negligence refers to a civil cause of action that depends on the plaintiff
  being able to demonstrate that they have suffered a legally recognised injury that
  was caused by the defendant's lack of reasonable care in circumstances where the
  defendant had a duty to take such care. Negligence has been the basis for the two
  major tort-based climate cases in Australia thus far: the completed Sharma v Minister
  for the Environment1 (`Sharma') and the pending Pabai Pabai v the Commonwealth2
  (`Pabai').

  2.1.1 Duty of Care
  In Sharma, a group of Australian children argued that the Commonwealth Minister
  for the Environment (the Minister) owed Australian children a duty to consider future
  harms to them in deciding whether to approve an expansion of the Vickery coalmine
  in New South Wales.3 If approved, the mine's expansion was expected to increase coal
  extraction from 135 to 168 million tonnes (mt), generating a further 100 mt of Scope 3
  emissions over the lifespan of the project. The Minister's decision was pursuant to the
  Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (Cth) (`EPBC Act').

  Because the case related to future harms, the nature of the claim was unusual.
  Negligence is a damage-based tort; it depends upon injury to the plaintiff. The remedy
  sought usually relates to that damage -- compensatory damages aimed at putting the
  plaintiff in the position they would have been had the tort not occurred. There have,
  however, been negligence cases in Australia where litigants have successfully sought

      (2022) 291 FCR 311 (`Sharma Appeal').

                                                                                                                                                                202

  injunctive relief to prevent harm that has not yet occurred but is anticipated to follow
  from a defendant's breach of a duty of care.4 This was what the children sought in
  Sharma.

  The key question for the Federal Court was whether the Minister owed the children
  the duty of care that they claimed. As a novel duty case (one that did not fall into
  established duty categories), this question had to be determined from first principles.
  The duty of care inquiry in negligence serves a gatekeeping function, setting normative
  boundaries around those to whom we are legally obligated to personally account to
  for our conduct, and those to whom we are not. While the decision of courts as to
  whether to recognise a novel duty is guided by precedent and principle, it has also been
  described as an exercise in value judgment, involving `questions of fairness, policy,
  practicality, proportion, expense and justice'.5 Further, it ties to the relational nature
  of tort law. A duty is not owed in the abstract. It is owed to specific persons, not `the
  world at large.'6 In this sense, `negligence in the air, so to speak, will not do'.7

  In determining novel duties, Australian courts apply the `salient features' or
  `multifactorial' approach, evaluating features of the present case that precedent
  demonstrates are relevant to the question of whether or not a duty of care arises.
  In Sharma, in the first instance, Bromberg J found the salient features of the case
  supported the plaintiffs. He held that a risk of future harms to Australian children was
  foreseeable to the defendant in light of the volume of emissions the mine expansion
  would contribute and the potential for climate `tipping points', where even small
  contributions could trigger a 4 캜 future world scenario.8 He also held that the specific
  risk of harm in question was within the Minister's control, given that power to approve
  the mine expansion fell to her alone and notwithstanding her lack of control at other

   relevant causal points leading to harm.9 The children's special vulnerability to risks
   created by the Minister and their special reliance upon the government to address
   a problem entirely outside their making were also central.10 The harms they face,
   Bromberg J held, `will largely be inflicted by the inaction of this generation of adults,
   in what might fairly be described as the greatest inter-generational injustice ever
   inflicted by one generation of humans upon the next.'11

   The Full Court of the Federal Court disagreed. Allsop CJ found four salient features
   in particular weighed against a duty of care. Those were that the claim exposed the
   Minister to a scope of liability that could not be adequately anticipated (indeterminate
   liability)12 and that the children lacked any special vulnerability or reliance upon the
   Minister, beyond the general political reliance we all have as Australians upon our
   government.13 He also held that the purported duty in negligence was incoherent with
   the Minister's statutory duties.14 Unlike Bromberg J, Allsop CJ held that the EPBC
   Act is not principally concerned with protecting the environment, and the human
   communities relying upon it, but with managing the relationship between levels of
   government.15 But Allsop CJ's primary concern was that in assessing whether the
   Minister had breached the purported duty of care, a court would be asked to scrutinise
   core governmental climate policy. This task, he argued, is `unsuitable for the Judicial
   branch to resolve in private litigation by reference to the law of torts and potential
   personal responsibility'.16

   Justice Wheelahan relied on similar considerations to Allsop CJ to reject the duty of
   care but also found that reasonable foreseeability of harm itself was not made out
   due to the tenuous causative link between the Minister's decision and anticipated

   future harms.17 Finally, Beach J held that the relationship between the parties was
   simply not of a sufficiently proximate kind in the sense that is foundational to a
   duty in negligence. There was not, he held, the `requisite sufficient closeness and
   directness' between the Minister's exercise of her discretion to approve or reject
   the mine expansion and the effects of this on the children, in light of temporal,
   geographical and causal gaps between the two.18

   At first glance, the outcome in Sharma does not bode well for future negligence-based
   climate litigation in Australia. There are, however, reasons to remain optimistic. First,
   the science upon which the claim was pursued was not challenged by the Minister
   and was accepted by the courts. Second, the various reasons given by the judges to
   explain their decisions demonstrate the potential for reasonable minds to differ on
   the operation of specific negligence principles in the context of climate litigation.
   The Full Court was divided on a number of points and there are promising lines of
   argumentation within the reasons of even those judges that found against a duty of care
   that future litigants might adopt. Finally, there is evidence that the judges were alive
   to the need for negligence law to evolve. Justice Beach went so far as to suggest that
   negligence principles in Australia may well have `reached their shelf life'.19

   Some of the difficulties in Sharma reflected the prospective nature of the claim: the
   elements in negligence are interrelated and the contours of a purported duty of care to
   others are brought into sharper relief once harm has occurred. Without damage, a court
   lacks a critical lens through which to define and limit a duty of care and will thus be
   more conservative. The pending case in Pabai is thus one to watch. Pabai is a class
   action brought by two Indigenous leaders on behalf of Torres Strait Islanders for harms
   to their lands and their culture they argue result from Commonwealth failures on
   climate change.20 The plaintiffs in Pabai are seeking a declaration from the Federal
   Court that the Commonwealth owes a duty of care to protect Torres Strait Islanders
   from climate harms impacting them, their lands and their cultural practices, and a

   finding that it has breached that duty, together with injunctive relief to enforce the
   duty and damages.21 Unlike Sharma, the plaintiffs point to actual harms already being
   experienced in the Torres Strait as a result of rising sea levels and coastal erosion, as
   well as how those will worsen if steps aren't taken. Those harms include damage to
   cemeteries and to traditional practices for growing food and gardening. Moreover, the
   claimants can point to specific legislation that shapes a unique relationship between
   them and the Commonwealth, which speaks to the plaintiff problem. Together, these
   factors may prove consequential.

                                                 KEY QUESTIONS

                      How might evidence of actual, rather than prospective, harm
                        change the assessment of whether a duty of care in negligence
                        is owed by one person to another?

                      Do you think that there are other groups of people in Australia
                        who might make a compelling case that they are especially
                        vulnerable to climate harms and thus owed a duty of care as a
                        distinctive class?

                      Is there something uniquely hazardous about approving or
                        undertaking new fossil fuel projects today that justifies revisiting
                        the idea that a relational duty of care cannot be owed to the world
                        at large?

   2.1.2 Causation
   The other element of negligence that will be particularly challenging for climate
   litigants is causation. Causation in negligence requires a court to find, on the balance
   of probabilities, that the defendant's breach was a necessary condition of the plaintiff's
   harm. While this does not require the defendant's breach to be the only or direct cause
   of the plaintiff's harm, in the ordinary case it does require that the plaintiff would not

       the Commonwealth, VID622/2021, 15 March 2023, [33]-[34].
                                                                                                                                                                  206

   have been injured `but for' the defendant's breach.22 The burden is on the plaintiff to
   prove this.

   Clearly, this test will be difficult to demonstrate in some climate cases, though not
   necessarily in all. For example, in Pabai one of the plaintiff arguments is that failures
   of the government to construct an adequate sea wall are the cause, in the traditional
   `but for' sense, of specific damage to coastal areas due to erosion that it could
   anticipate.23 For climate harms tied in more complex ways to a defendant's conduct,
   however, such as those that depend upon demonstrating a causative link to harm
   through a causative link to weather events, traditional approaches are inadequate. Yet
   climate change is not the first causatively complex scenario that tort courts have had to
   grapple with. In Australia, cases related to diseases caused by exposure to asbestos in
   particular (so-called toxic torts claims) have been important in this respect. As a result,
   alternative approaches to causation have developed.

   The position of litigants in Australia in arguing causation in negligence-based climate
   cases is somewhat more tenuous than that of their peers in other common law
   countries. This is because Australian courts have so far not adopted the Fairchild line
   of argument that, in some circumstances, increased risk can satisfy cause. Developed
   in the United Kingdom, those principles provide that a defendant's contribution to an
   increased risk of injury to a plaintiff is sufficient to satisfy causation in a negligence
   claim where multiple events may have caused the plaintiff's injury but it is
   scientifically impossible to say which, in fact, did.24 If this is an appropriate way to
   characterise how climate science explains the causation of climate harms in a given
   case (perhaps, for example, in light of climate `tipping points'), then the lack of an
   `increased risk' doctrine in Australia is significant. While causation was not directly
   at issue in Sharma, it was addressed at some length by some of the judges. Where

22. It should be noted, however, that the `necessary condition of harm' test and the `but for' test are not precisely the same,
       and the positive framing of the former may well be more amenable to application in the kind of complex causation
       situations that climate harms will involve.

       Commonwealth, VID622/2021, 30 April 2024, [751]-[757].

24. These principles have been developed in a line of cases: Fairchild v Glenhaven Funeral Services Ltd [2003] 1 AC 32;

   they did, they suggest that to succeed the case would turn on an increased risk type
   argument.25 Whether the court got this right, however, can be challenged.26

   Despite the lack of an increased risk doctrine in Australia, our civil liability legislation
   allows for an alternative approach to causation in negligence, other than the necessary
   condition of harm test, when a court deems it appropriate. Emerging science on
   probabilistic and indeterminate causative pathways in the context of climate change
   and the harms it produces may provide a principled basis for adopting such alternative
   approaches.27 An existing alternative means of proving causation in Australian
   common law is the `material contribution to harm' test. This approach allows that a
   material (more than de minimus) contribution to a harm will suffice in circumstances
   where the defendant's breach is one of a few sources that have cumulatively brought
   about the plaintiff's harm. In Amaca v Booth, for example, the High Court of Australia
   held that it was open to a trial judge to find that the claimant's mesothelioma was
   caused by his cumulative exposure to asbestos from multiple sources over many
   years working as a brake mechanic, including from the brake products of the two
   defendants.28 In cases like this, causation is proven through demonstrating that a
   defendant's breach was a material part of a set of causes that together were necessary
   to the outcome.29 This test may well be more appropriate than the increased risk test in
   some climate change cases.30

                                                 KEY QUESTIONS
                      Does climate change constitute a good policy reason for courts to

                        adopt more plaintiff-friendly approaches to causation? Why or
                        why not?
                      Is it fair for certain defendants to be personally liable for
                        contributing to climate harms in light of the many and varied
                        causative sources of climate change?
                      How might an analysis of causation in cases involving climate
                        harms be similar to, or different from, the analysis of causation in
                        complex disease claims?

  2.2 Nuisance

   Nuisance is concerned with unreasonable and substantial interferences to a person's
   use and enjoyment of their land (private nuisance) or to a right common to the public
   (public nuisance). It is sometimes described as an environmental tort, as a complaint
   may relate to material or sensory impacts of noise, smells or other forms of `emission'
   pollutants caused by industrial activities. Nuisance thus seems, on the face of it, to be
   particularly relevant to climate litigation.31 Despite this, nuisance has not been widely
   adopted as a climate litigation tool in Australia to date, though that might change. To
   be sure, nuisance has been the basis of a number of overseas climate claims, including
   by state and local governments in the United States32 and by Indigenous leaders in New
   Zealand33 against major industrial contributors to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.
   A claim in nuisance can avoid some of the challenges of a negligence claim. For
   example, requirements to prove fault on the part of a defendant in nuisance (in so

     209

   much as it arises) may not be as onerous as in a negligence claim.34 Nor does nuisance
   require the plaintiff to establish a duty of care, and while the starting point for
   causation in negligence is the `but for' test, in nuisance (especially public nuisance)
   the focus is on `the defendant's creation of, or contribution to, a rights-infringing state
   of affairs'.35 That said, there are aspects of nuisance law that will be challenging for
   climate litigation, three of which are discussed briefly below.

   A preliminary challenge is standing. Private nuisance is a proprietary tort, meaning
   a person can only bring a claim where they have an adequate interest in land to
   which their complaint relates. This may preclude many from using private nuisance to
   pursue climate justice. However, there are certain categories of claimants that we can
   anticipate might meet this threshold, such as coastal36 or First Nations37 communities
   whose lands are impacted by climate change. A private claim in public nuisance, by
   contrast, does not require a proprietary interest in land but it does require a person
   to show that they suffered special damage that is different to, or greater than, harm
   suffered by the public at large. This standing requirement has presented a hurdle
   in overseas public nuisance climate claims, in light of the anticipated widespread
   impacts of climate change. Bullock, however, argues that there is substantial judicial
   misunderstanding of the rule and that it is less of an obstacle to climate claims than
   generally believed.38

   Another challenge for nuisance-based climate claims reflected in overseas
   jurisprudence is non-justiciability, meaning the judicial view that the case raises
   matters for parliament and not the courts.39 While non-justiciability is not a formal
   element of nuisance in Australia, Emmanouil et al note that similar considerations

   are likely to be reflected in determinations as to whether an interference is
   `unreasonable'.40 Determining whether an interference is unreasonable involves a
   balancing exercise between the plaintiff's and the defendant's interests that draws on
   a range of considerations. It is defined by a `live and let live' ethos that requires us
   to put up with a degree of discomfort demanded by our social interconnectedness.
   To demonstrate reasonableness, a defendant might argue that their impugned conduct
   (say, the extraction of coal or industrial GHG emissions) is a reasonable use of land,
   as reflected in governmental climate policy and its social value.41 Having said this,
   what is reasonable to a given place and time changes as society changes, and this kind
   of argument may have less purchase as coal extraction and GHG emissions become
   less socially defensible in the face of climate harms42 or where differentiated and
   disproportionate impacts on certain communities become more evident. Nuisance does
   not sanction some individuals subsidising the social utility of a defendant's business
   for the benefit of others.43

   Finally, the defence of statutory authorisation may present a challenge. According to
   this defence, a person is not liable for an interference attributable to them where it is
   an inevitable outcome of their compliance with a statute. Much comes down to what is
   mandated or what is simply permitted by a statute, as well as questions as to whether
   more care could have been taken by a defendant, including whether to go ahead with
   authorised usages of land at all. While it is difficult to assess the likely success of
   this defence in the abstract, Emmanouil et al suggest that it may present a particularly
   potent defence for emissions from land used for coalmining activities authorised by
   statute.44 As with reasonable use, however, views on what due care under a statutory
   authority means are likely to evolve.

                                                 KEY QUESTIONS

                      Do you think we are entering into an era where fossil fuel
                        extraction is no longer a reasonable use of land, for which
                        toleration of emissions must be expected? Why or why not?

  2.3 Other Torts

   There is growing evidence that fossil fuel companies have been aware for decades
   that their products cause `globally catastrophic' climate change.45 In the face of this
   knowledge, rather than sharing the information, altering business operations and
   supporting policy action, evidence is emerging of the extent to which companies
   have engaged in a `multi-decade disinformation campaign' aimed at extending the
   lifespan of their business model.46 This behaviour suggests the potential relevance
   of the tort of deceit and of principles of civil conspiracy, in the style of earlier
   tobacco company litigation.47 While such a claim is likely to be challenging, in light
   of the high threshold to demonstrate deceitful (fraudulent) conduct and the need to
   link misrepresentation to personal damage, the approach may nonetheless be viable.48
   Another type of disinformation that is emerging as we move towards a green economy
   and that may constitute a tort is corporate misinformation about green credentials;
   misrepresentations of this kind have been pursued in Australia as misleading and
   deceptive conduct under consumer laws.49

   A further issue that might arise in tort law due to climate change is the attempt to
   present a climate necessity defence to justify climate direct action in a civil trespass

   case. This defence has been tried in criminal trespass cases,50 but its traction in a civil
   law matter would be different in light of the different interests protected by tort and
   crime law, and their distinctive social functions.
   Finally, there are questions as to how principles of proportionate liability may
   complicate climate litigation.51 Under civil liability legislation around Australia, where
   a plaintiff's damage can be attributed to more than one wrongdoer, a defendant's
   liability for that harm is limited to such an amount as a court considers just, having
   regard to the extent of their responsibility for loss. While this rule only applies to
   certain claims relating to property damage and economic losses, and not to personal
   injuries claims or intentional harm such as that caused by deceit, it raises challenging
   questions as to how a court will assess proportionality in light of multiple wrongful
   sources of climate harms.

 3. Future Trajectories

  Tort-based climate litigation in this country is still in its infancy. There are a number
  of legal strategies that have been attempted overseas that have not yet been trialled
  here and that we might reasonably expect to see in our courts in the future.

  One possibility is the pursuit of claims against fossil fuel companies, in the style of
  the Aotearoa New Zealand case of Smith v Fonterra1 (`Smith'). In that case, Mori
  elder Michael Smith brought a claim in negligence and nuisance against seven of the
  country's largest GHG emitters on the basis that they are collectively responsible for
  one-third of all of New Zealand's GHG emissions. The claim is that the defendants
  knew (or ought to have known) of the need to reduce their emissions to avoid
  environmental harms that will impact specific Mori communities, such as loss of
  sites of cultural and spiritual significance, damage to fisheries and adverse health
  impacts. Demonstrating how a similar type of claim might be pursued in respect of
  Australian companies, McGrath notes that the operator of the Victorian Loy Yang A
  Power Station would be a `logical choice ... [as] Australia largest single, direct emitter
  of GHGs'.2

  Another possibility suggested by Smith is the prospect of the courts simply creating
  a new environmental tort capable of responding to the climate crisis. This is a third
  ground for alleged liability in Smith, in addition to the claims in negligence and
  nuisance. In Australia, it seems unlikely the judiciary would take such a step, in light
  of its reluctance around other prospective new torts, such as a tort of privacy, but times
  change. For now, a more feasible option may be a new statutory tort. In that respect,
  Senator Pocock's Climate Change Amendment (Duty of Care and Intergenerational
  Climate Equity) Bill 2023 (Cth) is interesting. It proposes two new statutory duties
  on government actors when making decisions likely to result in substantial GHG

  emissions: first, to consider the likely impact of those decisions on current and future
  Australian children; and second, to not approve exploration or extraction of fossil fuels
  where the resulting GHG emissions are likely to pose a material risk to current or
  future Australian children. Statutory duties may be actionable in tort where decision-
  makers fail to comply, in negligence or the tort of breach of statutory duties.

  Overseas, a number of the most significant tort-based climate cases have been
  bolstered by human rights frameworks. For example, in Urgenda v The State of
  the Netherlands,3 Dutch citizens sued their government in negligence, arguing its
  inadequate climate policy was a breach of duty of its care. They were successful in
  this argument and obtained orders for more ambitious Dutch state emission reductions.
  Similarly, in Milieudefensie v Royal Dutch Shell plc4 (`Milieudefensie'), seven non-
  government organisations argued that the company had breached its duty of care to
  Dutch citizens through its GHG emissions. They were successful in the first instance
  and obtained specific orders for the company to substantially reduce its emissions.
  However, this order was overturned on appeal on the basis that imposing mandatory
  emissions reductions on the company was not consistent with existing regional
  regulations. Nonetheless, the Hague Court of Appeal confirmed Shell's duty of care
  and emphasised the relevance of human rights law to the determination of that issue.
  Indeed, in both cases the courts were aided in reaching their decisions by drawing on
  regionally binding human rights norms, as well as (in the case of Milieudefensie) the
  UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.

  At present, human rights play little role in the interpretation and application of tort
  law in Australia. Australia does not have a national bill of rights, and it has few
  constitutional rights protections. However, there are renewed efforts towards a
  national human rights instrument in Australia that, if successful, could be
  consequential. In the meantime, the three existing state human rights acts offer
  possibilities for human rights to ground domestic legal actions that could be explored,

 4. Conclusion

  Chief Judge of the Land and Environment Court of New South Wales, Brian J Preston,
  wrote in 2011 that:

              Private law actions, such as in tort, to remedy and restrain pollution of
              the environment were the original environmental litigation ... With the
              new focus on treaties and legislation, private law actions fell effectively
              into disuse for addressing environmental problems ... The pervasive and
              pernicious effects of climate change, however, have led to reflection and
              review of this approach.1
  While tort law is sometimes considered inapt to deal with complex environmental
  challenges, it will have to find its place in the struggle to respond to climate change
  or risk irrelevance. History demonstrates tort law's capacity to adapt and respond
  to complex collective harms, without betraying its roots. While of a different scale,
  climate change shares some characteristics of the early industrial era that helped shape
  tort law as we know it today. And while climate change is a global phenomenon,
  it is also cognisable as an interpersonal one -- some have benefitted most from the
  greatest causes of climate change, while others will suffer more from its harms. For
  these reasons, we can expect every effort by litigants and jurists alike to bend tort law's
  future towards climate justice.

Australian land law governs the legal relationships between people and land. It
establishes and regulates rights in defined parcels of land and provides mechanisms
for enforcing these rights against competing claims. These rights, often referred to as
real property rights, are broadly categorised into estates and lesser non-possessory
interests. Estates -- either freehold or leasehold -- confer a right to possession, along
with associated rights of use, enjoyment and alienation. In contrast, lesser or non-
possessory interests -- such as servitudes (including easements, covenants and profits)

                                                                 219
                                                                                                                                                             220

and security interests (such as mortgages and charges) -- do not grant possession but
allow limited rights over another's land or secure the performance of an obligation.

Although rights in land are abstract legal constructs, the common law has traditionally
treated land -- the object of these rights -- as permanent and immovable. These
characteristics underpin legal remedies that permit the removal of individuals from
land or the recovery of land itself. While land retains an element of permanence
in legal doctrine, it is nonetheless subject to significant change. As part of Earth's
broader ecosystem, land is affected by its interactions with dynamic systems such as
weather and climate. As discussed in Legal Education in a Changing Climate, natural
forces -- particularly wind, heat, precipitation and waves -- are being intensified
by climate change, resulting in physical transformations of land. Human activities,
including construction, excavation and environmental degradation, are also altering
land. Together, these natural and anthropogenic forces are reshaping the physical
characteristics of land and the ways in which people engage with it. These changes are
ongoing and will unfold in foreseeable and unforeseeable ways.

This chapter examines the legal implications of climate induced changes to land --
both in terms of how such changes affect property rights and the potential for land law
to support climate change mitigation and adaptation objectives. Part 2 outlines some
foundational principles of land law and, departing from the traditional scope of most
real property law textbooks, explicitly links land law to environmental and planning
laws. This integrated approach recognises that land law operates within a broader
regulatory framework that shapes the exercise of land rights in the context of climate
change. Part 2 explores how land law is already evolving in response to climate
change, including the emergence of new forms of property rights -- such as solar
access and rolling easements -- and the growing influence of climate considerations
in land use planning decisions. Part 3 turns to future-facing developments, focusing
on the legal treatment of climate related risk in mortgage lending, the disclosure of
climate risk in property transactions and the role of land law in facilitating managed
retreat. Together, these sections demonstrate how land law is both shaped by and
shaping society's response to a changing climate.

 1. Land Law and Climate Change Impacts

 1.1 Historical Development of Land Law: From Land to
 Property

  The historical development of English land law reflects a profound transformation
  in how law constructs the relationship between people and land, and how law itself
  has conceptually changed from land law to property law. Central to this history is
  the process of dephysicalisation -- a legal and conceptual shift in which land ceased
  to be a place imbued with social, political and physical meaning and instead became
  an abstract, commodifiable object within a legal relationship defined solely between
  people.1

  In the feudal period, land was not seen as a disposable asset, but as the very basis
  of social identity, political obligation and communal hierarchy.2 It could not be freely
  bought or sold; instead, landholding was governed by networks of reciprocal duties,
  often defined by political status, custom and familial ties.3 Legal relationships to
  land were layered and plural: many people could hold different, often non-exclusive,
  interests in the same parcel of land. These forms of tenure connected people to place
  in deeply embedded ways. Power flowed from land ownership, but that power was
  inseparable from the obligations it carried. In this system, land was not a thing to
  be exchanged in a land market, but a lived context that sustained communities and
  regulated status.

  With the gradual decline of feudal structures and the rise of capitalism from the 17th
  century onward, this place-based model was replaced by lawmakers with a new legal
  regime that prioritised the right to exclude others from the land. The legal relation

  that people had to land became abstract and individualised. Importantly, land was
  reimagined as an alienable commodity, capable of being privately owned, sold and
  used to generate wealth.

  This shift -- what legal scholars call the dephysicalisation of property4 -- entailed
  two fundamental changes. First, the unique physical and social characteristics of land
  were removed from the legal equation. No longer seen as a socially embedded `place'
  full of context, land became a legally neutral `thing' that could be owned. Second,
  the `person' in the legal relation to land was also redefined: from a member of a
  community or family with longstanding and legally protected connections with the
  land to a solitary legal subject exercising `rights' over property. Thus, property came
  to be understood not as a relationship involving land and people, but as a relation
  between legal persons governed by abstract legal rights.5

  This transformation was driven by both domestic reform and imperial ambition. In
  England, enclosure laws passed by Parliament between the 17th and 19th centuries
  forcibly dispossessed people from vast areas of common lands which were converted
  into privately owned estates.6 The rights of communities to access and use their
  common lands were systematically extinguished in the name of `improvement' -- a
  powerful moral and economic discourse7 that was used to justify both enclosure of
  common lands and the colonisation of foreign lands.

  Beyond England, the British colonial project applied similar approaches to the lands
  of First Nations (see For the Love of Country: First Nations, Native Title and Climate
  Change). Colonisation was a violent physical, political and legal process of erasing
  existing place-based legal relations, often by declaring Indigenous lands as `terra
  nullius' -- meaning `land belonging to no one' and thus available for extraterritorial

   acquisition.8 Whether through enclosure at home or colonisation abroad, the historical
   development of English law played an active role in reshaping land as a commodified,
   alienable resource.

   The emergence of this new approach to land and land law required new justifications
   for ownership that could replace the hereditary and hierarchical claims of feudal
   tenure. The 17th century philosopher John Locke9 and 19th century philosopher John
   Stuart Mill10 published individualistic theories of property, grounding land ownership
   in certain kinds of labour and utility, rather than in status or community.11

   By the 19th century, the alienability of land had become completely normalised in law.
   As Mill observed, the value of land was now determined not by its productive capacity
   or social function, but by what someone was willing to pay for it.12 This opened the
   door to a much broader legal regime that reconceptualised and renamed land law as
   `property law' -- a framework which could encompass not just physical land, but
   intangible commodities such as shares, patents and copyrights. As we shall see in a
   later section of this chapter, new species of property interests are now being created to
   address climate change.

   Subsequently, legal theorists such as Bentham and Hohfeld were instrumental in
   consolidating this abstract model of relations between people and land. Bentham
   famously defined `property' not as a relation between a `person' and a `thing', but as a
   relationship exclusively between `legal persons' -- structured entirely by legal rules.13
   However, by the 20th century, legal scholars began to question the abstract model as

   `vacant' or emptied of intrinsic meaning,14 as well as its coherence and implications in
   environmental, political and social domains.

   In this context, 21st century legal responses to climate change have prompted renewed
   scrutiny of the model of dephysicalised property. As land becomes increasingly
   vulnerable to climate induced change -- through sea level rise, drought, fire and
   erosion -- abstract models of property struggle to account for the relational and
   ecological dimensions of land. Some scholars argue that the erasure of land from
   property law has contributed to unsustainable land use practices, reinforced the
   commodification of land and its resources, and inhibited more adaptive, place-
   sensitive legal frameworks.15

   The history of English land law illustrates how law can reshape the natural and social
   worlds. It reminds us that the laws of land use and ownership are not timeless truths,
   but products of historical, intellectual and economic changes. And it raises important
   questions about how the law might once again reimagine the relationship between
   people, land and the communities that bind them.

   determined by the State, typically through an initial cadastral survey or a subsequent
   subdivision of land. These boundaries are then recorded in a centralised land
   administration system, which defines and registers the parcel -- commonly referred to
   as a lot -- for the purposes of legal recognition and regulation.

   While most land parcels (or lots) are defined by notional boundaries identified through
   geospatial coordinates, some are bounded by natural features such as rivers, lakes or
   the coastline. Both common law and statute recognise that water boundaries may shift
   over time, and accommodate such changes where they are gradual, imperceptible,16
   and caused by natural processes under the doctrines of accretion and erosion. In
   contrast, sudden or substantial alterations to water boundaries -- such as those
   resulting from floods or storm surges -- will generally fall outside this
   accommodation under common law. As climate change contributes to more frequent
   and extreme weather events, including sea level rise and coastal inundation, such
   changes challenge conventional legal conceptions of land boundaries. Over time,
   rising water levels may cause land to become permanently submerged. Since
   ownership of land below navigable waters and the seabed is typically vested in the
   State, these longer-term shifts in water boundaries may lead to the reallocation or loss
   of private property rights in land.

   However, the lateral boundaries of land only tell part of the story. At common law,
   the vertical boundaries of land ownership were traditionally described as extending
   `up to heaven and down to hell'17 meaning upwards into the sky and downwards
   beneath the surface of the land. Over time, this expansive notion has been curtailed in
   various ways -- for example, in strata title (see Climate Change and Housing: Strata
   and Community Title) and common law principles that recognise a height to which
   land can be reasonably used and enjoyed.18 Similarly, depth limitations exist beneath
   the surface of the land established by reservations in the original Crown grant. These
   reservations mean that landowners do not possess ownership of subsurface minerals,

   restrictions are particularly significant in the context of climate change, as they grant

   the State control over subterranean spaces that can be utilised for carbon capture and
   storage and other climate mitigation technologies.

   Lastly, the elements that constitute `land' can change over time. Items that were once
   classified as personal property may become fixtures -- objects that are attached to
   the land in a sufficiently permanent manner to be regarded as part of the land itself.19
   While buildings such as houses, sheds and other structures are commonly recognised
   as fixtures, vegetation and trees growing on the land may also qualify as fixtures.
   These natural fixtures are not only subject to the physical impacts of climate change
   but also serve an important function as carbon sinks, which can be utilised to offset
   greenhouse gas (`GHG') emissions.

   Accordingly, the legal concept of `land' as the object of property rights encompasses
   both less than -- and in some respects more than -- the physical landscape as
   commonly understood. This includes exclusions such as certain subsurface resources,
   and inclusions such as fixtures that become part of the land through attachment.
   Climate change has the potential to alter the characteristics of land in relation to all
   these aspects, thereby challenging conventional land law doctrines and the ways in
   which lawyers conceptualise and engage with land.

  1.3 Land Administration Systems

   Land law concerns the State's recognition of land ownership, encompassing the nature

of property rights and the way these rights are created, transferred and enforced in
relation to the rights of others. In Australia, land titles are created and regulated
primarily by state and territory legislation, with the notable exception of native title,
which is governed by Commonwealth law. Figure 2 illustrates the broad classification
of different types of land title and the statutory frameworks that create or regulate
them. Although mining interests, water rights, and environmental and planning
regulation do not constitute real property, they significantly affect interests in land
held by private individuals (freehold), the State and Indigenous communities.
Moreover, these regulatory mechanisms operate alongside land law to address the
complex challenges posed by climate change.

Just as land law recognises that land consists of various components -- such as soil,
minerals, water, vegetation and fixtures -- ownership of land can also be divided
or `fragmented' into different types of property rights. The term `ownership' of land
generally refers to ownership of a freehold estate, which represents the most extensive
interest in land that the State can grant to a private individual. The most common
form of freehold estate is the estate in fee simple, which predominates in urban areas
throughout Australia. Other forms of freehold tenure include Crown or State land, as
well as Aboriginal freehold land, which is typically found in regional and remote parts
of the country.
229

Freehold land in Australia is created and regulated predominantly by the Torrens
system of land ownership. Under this system, the State grants land in fee simple
estates, and the grant is recorded on the Torrens register of interests. Registration of
an interest in the register confers an indefeasible title to the registered proprietor. This
means that the registered interest cannot be defeated by an unregistered interest, except
in limited circumstances expressly provided for by statute or recognised by courts --
commonly referred to as exceptions to indefeasibility. Information about registered
estates and interests in Torrens system land can be found on a central register, which
can be searched by people dealing with land and by the public.

The register forms part of a broader system of land data, recording the plan of survey,
the registered proprietor and any other lesser interests in the land. While the existence
of a registered interest does not prevent creation of other, unregistered interests, a
registered interest generally prevails over an unregistered interest and is subject only to
prior registered interests. In such cases, the holder of an unregistered interest generally
cannot assert a claim to possession of the land itself. Notably, it is possible to buy,
sell and create interests in land without physically inspecting the land, as rights in land
today exist independently of the physical object of those rights.

Unregistered interests in land continue to be recognised at common law and in equity.
Although such interests are not protected by the principle of indefeasibility, they may
nonetheless be enforceable by the courts in certain circumstances. In some Australian
jurisdictions, unregistered interests in land may be recorded or noted on the certificate
of title contained in the register. Common examples include restrictive covenants and
profits  prendre (which can be included on certificates of title to land by various
means in jurisdictions such as Tasmania, Victoria and Western Australia, and to a
limited extent in Queensland, Northern Territory and Australian Capital Territory), as
well as equitable security interests such as charges and liens, and planning agreements.
In several jurisdictions, the register is also being used to record emerging legal
interests connected to climate change mitigation projects (see Part 3), and it holds
increasing significance in highlighting parcels of land that are vulnerable to climate
related risks (see Part 4).

1.4 Regulating Land Use: Environmental and Planning Law

Environmental and planning laws regulate land use by imposing limits on what
a landholder can do with their land. While these laws are becoming increasingly
important as tools for governments to manage land in the context of climate change,
they remain separate and distinct from land law. This distinction is often overlooked
in discussions about how land should be regulated in response to climate related
challenges. Land law and environmental and planning laws also function differently.
For example, decisions under environmental and planning laws are typically made by
government ministers or public authorities (see Climate Change and Administrative
Law). While this can make environmental and planning law more flexible and
responsive than land law in addressing climate change, it can also create uncertainty
or result in outcomes that undermine long-term climate mitigation and adaptation
objectives.

State and territory governments may also regulate land use by imposing conditions
through environmental and planning laws, using systems of approvals, permits or
licences. For example, land may be zoned for specific uses (such as residential or
commercial purposes) or recognised for its features -- environmental significance,
built or cultural heritage, or vulnerability to erosion, flooding or bushfire. Depending
on these characteristics, certain activities on land may be permitted without restriction,
require formal approval or be prohibited entirely. In some cases, zoning decisions,
planning approvals or environmental licences may even enable GHG-emitting
activities, such as the construction of coalmines. It is important to recognise that
the laws governing both land use and ownership have, through their combination,
contributed to the conditions underlying the current climate crisis.
231

In the 1980s, governments moved beyond initial approaches to regulation known as
`command and control' methods towards those influenced by free market ideology
and neoliberal philosophy. The regulatory landscape became characterised by market-
based instruments to address certain problems, including environmental problems.
This was rationalised as providing more flexible, cost-effective and incentive-based
approaches to achieving environmental goals.

The increasing use of environmental markets as regulatory tools presented challenges
for property law. These markets rely on the creation, allocation and trade of rights
over environmental goods and services -- such as biodiversity credits, emission
allowances and fishing permits. In doing so, they have raised fundamental legal
questions about the nature and limits of property, as well as deeper normative concerns
about commodifying elements of the natural world. Natural capital accounting seeks to
quantify the economic value of ecosystem services -- such as carbon sequestration
and biodiversity.

Unlike traditional property rights in land or physical things, environmental credits or
permits typically represent a `right' to pollute, conserve, access or refrain from using
certain environmental resources. These rights are often intangible and statutory in
origin. These newer property rights often function as part of larger environmental and/
or climate change policy frameworks. There are interesting and important questions
about the doctrinal significance of environmental markets, and there are also ethical
and ecological questions to consider.

                  Can and should society treat wetlands, biodiversity or the

                    rights?

                  Is it appropriate to allocate rights to pollute based on the ability to
                    pay?

                  Should rights to exploit nature be severed from obligations to
                    protect or care for it?

2. Recent Developments in Land Law

In this section, we consider four developments in land law that respond to the
challenges of climate change:

          the recognition of new proprietary rights;
          the evolution of common law rules relating to easements and covenants;
          the incorporation of climate change considerations into land use and

            planning decisions; and
          the disclosure of climate related risks in the sale of land.

These developments represent only the beginning of the complex legal issues that
future lawyers may need to consider when advising clients in the context of a changing
climate.

2.1 The Introduction of New Kinds of Property Rights

As described in the previous section, the concept of property rights has been
increasingly used to create new legal tools for achieving environmental management
objectives. Property rights are particularly valued for their capacity to create tradeable
interests in land. Land, however, has been reconceptualised over the last few centuries
not as a single, unified parcel, but as a bundle of separable and severable component
parts -- such as soil, sand, rock, water, vegetation etc. It is easy to see how interests
in smaller parts of landscapes may resemble things over which property rights might
be claimed. While such interests do not constitute land or property, in the legal senses
described above, they sometimes do function as new kinds of property rights to the
extent that they might enable access, use and even transferability in ways that seem
familiar to us as valuable land-adjacent (and land-dependent) interests.

Such novel interests -- such as permits to discharge pollutants or fishing quotas -- are
typically not classified as property rights in a legal sense. However, the ability for a
legal entity to hold an exclusive right to use natural resources in particular ways allow

                                                                 232
   233

  those resources to be valued and can incentivise protective or sustainable behaviours.
  As environmental regulation has evolved, interested parties have increasingly gained
  not only the right to use natural resources but also the ability to buy, sell or trade
  those rights on primary and secondary markets. Early examples include national and
  regional emissions trading schemes for nitrogen oxide (NOx) and sulphur dioxide
  (SOx), which were developed to reduce acid rain caused by air pollution. In the United
  States, such schemes have been implemented under the Clean Air Act of 1963 and
  through the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative.

  Building on the success of NOx and SOx trading schemes, emissions trading schemes
  draw on property law concepts and doctrines to create emissions `units' or
  `allowances' that represent a specified quantity of GHG emissions. These units can be
  bought, sold or traded between participants, including transactions involving the State.
  Article 17 of the Kyoto Protocol (1997) provided the framework for an international
  emissions trading scheme (`ETS'). Although a unified global scheme was never
  implemented, more than 36 national and regional ETS are currently in operation
  worldwide, including in Australia. An Australian Carbon Credit Unit (`ACCU'),
  representing 1,000 kilograms (1 tonne) of avoided or sequestered GHG emissions, is
  currently valued at approximately $35 per unit. The Carbon Credits (Carbon Farming
  Initiative) Act 2011 (Cth) expressly recognises an ACCU as personal property, capable
  of being transferred between private parties by assignment, will or operation of law.1

  Property law is also now used to establish and protect carbon sequestration rights
  -- rights to benefit from the capture and storage of carbon in natural carbon sinks
  such as trees, vegetation and soil. In New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia,
  Tasmania, Victoria and Western Australia, carbon sequestration rights are recognised
  as specific or general types of property interests in land. Legislation in New South
  Wales, Victoria and Western Australia also recognises rights created by covenants and
  agreements created by personal arrangements between landowners and third parties
  to access, occupy or use land in ways that facilitate carbon sequestration. There is an
  acknowledged lack of consistency, certainty and integration of carbon sequestration

  rights within Australian state laws, and there is debate regarding the kind of property
  rights that can be properly regarded as `property rights' in sequestered carbon.2

  Rights relating to the storage of carbon in engineered systems -- such as disused
  coalmines -- have similarly been recognised under legislation including the
  Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2009 (Cth), Geothermal Energy Act 2010 (Qld) and Land
  Title Act 1994 (Qld). Future lawyers will need not only to understand the nature of
  these rights and how they can be created, transferred or enforced by clients but also to
  advise on the broader legal implications that arise from their existence.

                              CASE STUDY: ACCUS AND TORRENS REGISTERS

     ACCUs can be generated through activities that reduce or offset GHG emissions,
     including the sequestration of carbon in trees, vegetation and soil.3 While ACCUs
     create opportunities for landowners to profit from their land through sustainable
     land management practices, participation in the scheme requires a commitment
     to maintain carbon sequestration on the land for periods ranging from 25 to 100
     years. If carbon is released during this time -- due to events such as fire, flood,
     pest infestation or land clearing -- participants may be required to take remedial
     action to restore carbon sequestration to prior levels.
     Compliance with the Carbon Credits (Carbon Farming Initiative) Act 2011 (Cth)
     can affect the rights and obligations attached to land. The Act empowers the
     `relevant land registration official' to `make entries or notations in or on registers'
     about carbon sequestration projects to draw attention to `the existence of the
     eligible offset projects' and `carbon maintenance obligations'.4 While such
     notations may serve as a form of constructive notice to third parties, their legal
     status is potentially problematic, particularly in light of the long-term duration of

     statutory obligations affecting land use, and the absence of clearly defined

                    What are the potential benefits and risks of using legislation to

                      recognise new rights in land in response to climate change,
                      compared to relying on the development of common law or
                      equitable principles?

 2.2 Easements: Solar Access and Sea Level Rise

  Easements are a type of servitude interest that confer rights or impose restrictions on
  the use of land for the benefit of other land.6 At common law, the land that benefits
  from an easement, referred to as the dominant tenement, must be clearly identifiable.
  For example, Figure 3 shows that Lot 2 is the dominant tenement benefitting from a
  right of way (ie an easement of way) that provides road access over Lot 1, which is the
  servient tenement.

Statute can also be used to create easements in gross. Such easements are expressed
to be for the benefit of a utility provider (eg electricity, water or sewerage), so that
there is no dominant tenement. However, lots on either side of the servient tenement in
fact receive the benefit of the utility which is the subject of the easement. In Australia,
easements typically create positive rights over land owned by another. However,
`negative easements' can also be created in limited circumstances, to restrict how land
may be used to preserve certain rights, such as access to light or views. Easements
registered on a certificate of title are protected by the principle of indefeasibility.
Nonetheless, unregistered easements may still be enforceable against registered
interests under statutory exceptions.
In the context of climate change, the law of easements has developed in two ways.
First, `solar easements' are being used to provide access to direct sunlight necessary
for the generation of renewable energy, thereby supporting climate change mitigation
efforts. Second, `rolling easements' have been introduced to enable wetlands, beaches
and other coastal ecosystems to migrate inland in response to sea level rise.
2.2.1 Solar Easements
To enable the generation of renewable energy on land, easements may be used to
     237

   provide access for electricity transmission lines or to secure uninterrupted sunlight
   through solar easements. The creation of such easements for the installation of
   renewable energy infrastructure can impose physical restrictions on how a landowner
   may use their land. However, associated payments for hosting infrastructure may
   provide valuable economic support -- particularly for farming operations facing
   financial hardship.7 As such, the development of property interests related to the clean
   energy transition not only facilitates climate mitigation but also creates new economic
   opportunities for landowners.

   Restrictive easements or covenants can be used to ensure that a landowner continues
   to receive sunlight to a rooftop where solar panels are installed.8 Such instruments
   operate by limiting the height or placement of buildings on the burdened lot. Creating
   such property interests requires an agreement between two landholders, and a
   landholder may be unwilling to agree to burden their lot to protect solar access
   for a neighbouring property.9 In some jurisdictions, courts -- particularly specialist
   environmental courts -- have legislative power to impose easements in limited
   circumstances, such as when determining merit appeals of development applications.10
   However, these powers are not always directed toward, or well suited to, facilitating
   solar access for neighbouring landholders.11 More commonly, such powers are used
   by applicants for development consent to obtain a right of way over another parcel of
   land.

   The transition to cleaner forms of energy production is essential to achieving GHG-
   emission reduction targets (see Legal Education in a Changing Climate). This
   transition involves the installation of solar farms (Figure 4) and windfarms on land,
   together with related infrastructure such as large-scale batteries and extensive new
   transmission lines, given that renewable energy infrastructure is often located in rural
   and remote areas. While such developments are a necessary and beneficial part of the
   clean energy transition, they can also be contentious due to their impact on the physical
   landscape.12 Common concerns include noise generated by wind turbines,13 impacts
   on views14 and potential reductions in property values.15 As a result, it is not only the

   physical effects of climate change that are reshaping the property landscape but also
   the legal and spatial consequences of efforts to mitigate GHG emissions.
   Planning law has also played a role in protecting `solar collectors', such as rooftop
   solar panels, on private properties adjoining proposed development sites through
   requirements and guidance in planning instruments. When assessing development
   applications, decision-makers must balance the developer's interests in maximising
   the use and economic potential of their land with potential impacts on neighbouring
   property owners, including any loss of access to sunlight.

                           CASE STUDY: PROTECTION FOR SOLAR COLLECTORS

      Local planning controls for the Manly area in NSW seek to protect solar panels
      from overshadowing, with an objective of `provid[ing] equitable access to light and
      sunshine'.16 The provision states that `[a] minimum of 6 hours solar access be
      retained to solar collectors on neighbouring properties'.17 These provisions are
      taken into account by decision-makers in assessing development applications.18

   2.2.2 Rolling Easements
   The narrowing of beaches and the flooding in low-lying coastal and riparian lands
   are recurring events that are exacerbated by climate change.19 Rising sea levels and

   buildings and infrastructure in these vulnerable areas.20 With over 87 per cent of
   the Australian population living within 50 kilometres of the coast,21 pressing legal
   questions arise about how best to address these challenges.

   One strategy is the construction of seawalls to `defend' properties from erosion, for
   example at Collaroy Beach in Sydney (Figure 5). However, seawalls often cause
   adverse effects on adjacent land, as the energy and volume of water in storm surges
   is redirected along the coastline, intensifying erosion and inundation on neighbouring
   properties. This has prompted disputes, public controversy, and litigation over
   appropriate responses to climate related impacts on private land. The Land and
   Environment Court of New South Wales has issued several decisions concerning the

   legality and appropriateness of defensive structures such as seawalls.22 These cases
   underline the limitations of isolated, site-specific responses and highlight the need for
   coordinated, landscape-scale strategies and more robust planning mechanisms, such as
   coastal management plans. We discuss mechanisms that might facilitate `planned' or
   `managed' retreat from these locations later in this chapter.

   While environmental and planning laws are typically the primary legal tools for
   addressing environmental risks, climate change has prompted the innovative
   adaptation of traditional land law concepts, most notably, the easement. In the United
   States, rolling easements have been developed as a flexible mechanism to respond
   to the dynamic nature of coastlines. Rather than establishing a fixed, permanent
   relocation of an entire community, a rolling easement over an individual property
   adjusts over time as the shoreline moves.23 The aim is to allocate the risk between
   the private landholders and the State. Under this approach, once the sea moves
   further landward, only the affected portion of the land is permanently lost from the
   landholder's title, and the landholder is not compelled to move. In some jurisdictions,
   financial compensation is available for the lost portion of land while in others it
   is not.24 Although not a simple or universally applicable solution, rolling easements
   illustrate the potential of land law mechanisms to help mediate the complex interface
   between public regulation and private land interests in the context of climate change.25

  2.3 Environmental and Planning Laws

   Earlier in this chapter, we introduced environmental and planning laws as frameworks
   that operate alongside land law to regulate land use. In this section, we examine how
   conservation agreements established under environmental and planning legislation can
   support climate change mitigation, and how the anticipated impacts of climate change
   are considered in processing development applications.
   2.3.1 Conservation Agreements and Land Management
   Environmental and planning laws enable landowners to voluntarily enter into
   agreements with the State to permanently manage and protect natural resources and
   biodiversity on private land. Conservation covenants address both climate change
   mitigation and adaptation. They can be used to protect trees, vegetation and soils that
   function as carbon sinks, helping to offset GHG emissions. At the same time, they
   contribute to building the resilience of natural ecosystems to the impacts of climate
   change.
   More than 6,000 conservation covenants currently exist,26 under programs in all
   Australian states as shown in Table 1.

By entering a conservation covenant, landowners may be required to undertake
positive actions, such as planting or maintaining native vegetation, or may be restricted
from certain activities, such as land clearing or development. While some landowners
may enter these arrangements for philanthropic reasons, most programs offer financial
incentives to encourage participation. In Victoria, for example, the Trust for Nature
covers the costs of establishing and maintaining the covenant. In addition, landowners
with conservation covenants may be eligible for tax deductions and concessional
capital gains tax treatment under the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (Cth) div 31.

Conservation covenants are recorded on the title of the protected land. In Queensland,
they are registrable and may appear on a title to land lodged with the Queensland Titles
Registry. In other jurisdictions, however, conservation covenants -- like other positive
and restrictive covenants -- exist only in equity and are not protected by the principle
of indefeasibility upon registration. Nonetheless, recording a conservation covenant on
the certificate of title to land in the register can serve as notice to parties dealing with
the land and enables the covenant to be enforced against third parties in perpetuity.

                      CASE STUDY: BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION ACT 2016 (NSW)

      Section 5.5(1) of the Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016 (NSW) allows a
      landowner to enter into a biodiversity stewardship agreement (`BSA') with the
      Minister for the Environment to establish a biodiversity stewardship site. Under s
      5.6 of the Act, the landowner is required to undertake specified management
      actions -- such as planting native vegetation or excluding livestock from grazing
      -- and to refrain from certain development activities.
      BSAs are registered as an interest on the NSW Land Registry and bind future
      owners of the land in perpetuity.27 In return, s 5.6 entitles the landowner to receive
      biodiversity credits for carrying out these statutory management actions. These
      credits can then be sold to developers under s 6.19, allowing them to offset the
      residual biodiversity impacts of a separate development project. A central aim of
      the BSA scheme is to generate a market for biodiversity credits, principally for
      property developers, that facilitates biodiversity offsetting within a regulated
      framework.28

   2.3.2 Adapting Land Use for Climate Change
   In Australia, environmental and planning laws are increasingly used to take a proactive
   approach to the predicted impacts of climate change on land, buildings and
   infrastructure. This occurs through both strategic planning instruments and
   development assessment processes. In jurisdictions such as New South Wales,
   Victoria, South Australia and Queensland, a growing body of decisions has imposed
   conditions on residential property development -- or refused development approval
   altogether -- where proposed sites are vulnerable to climate related risks.

   Development approvals for properties have been withheld or conditioned in
   circumstances where sea level rise, flooding, inundation, storm surge or coastal
   erosion pose significant threats over the projected `economic life' of a building

28. Ibid ss 6.2, 6.4, 7.13(3).
     245

   (typically around 30 years).29 While structural stability is a central concern, planning
   authorities also weigh risks to critical infrastructure -- including water supply, power
   and drainage systems30 -- as well as the ongoing accessibility of land by emergency
   services.

             CASE STUDY: MANAGEMENT OF COASTAL AND MARINE ENVIRONMENTS

      Across Australia, areas of land are at increasing risk of subsidence (`sinking'),
      flooding, inundation and coastal erosion because of climate change --
      threatening communities and the critical infrastructure they depend upon. In the
      Torres Strait, residents sought recognition of these risks through claims that the
      Australian Government owes them a legal `duty of care' in responding to climate
      impacts, although this claim was ultimately unsuccessful.31
      Coastal and marine environments are primarily managed under state and territory
      legislation, including the Coastal Management Act 2016 (NSW), the Coastal and
      Marine Act 2018 (Vic), the Coastal Protection and Management Act 1995 (Qld)
      and the Coastal Protection Act 1972 (SA). These statutes establish planning
      objectives and principles to support the integrated and coordinated management
      of coastal areas, promote awareness of climate related risks, and incorporate
      those risks into land use planning decisions.
      These laws ultimately aim to build the resilience of both public and private lands
      to the impacts of climate change. For example, in Victoria, the Coastal and
      Marine Act 2018 has facilitated the creation of coastal and marine management
      plans in 14 local government areas. These plans specifically address risks such
      as sea level rise, coastal erosion and flooding, and support the application of land
      use zoning and overlay controls to reduce exposure to those risks.

        CASE STUDY: TIME-LIMITED DEVELOPMENT APPROVALS IN NEW SOUTH WALES

      In New South Wales, local governments have attempted to respond to the
      uncertain impacts of climate change by placing time limits on residential
      development approvals. For example, Great Lakes Council approved a residential
      property development on land located across the road from a beach, which was
      identified as being at risk of coastal erosion.32 Among the conditions imposed, the
      development approval was limited to a duration of 20 years. At the end of this
      period, the landowner would be required to make a new request for development
      approval, supported by a coastal hazards report.33
      However, in that case, the Court held that the time-limited condition was
      unreasonable, as it created uncertainty and offered no assurance that the existing
      lawful use could continue.34 By contrast, development approvals that impose
      staged resilience measures -- such as the installation of seawalls or other
      protective infrastructure after a specified time -- have been upheld in other
      decisions.35

3. Future Trajectories of Land Law

Land law focuses on creating interests in and over land and protecting and enforcing
property interests. However, to date it has generally not been concerned with creating
obligations towards, or even encouraging, sustainable land use practices. While
environmental and planning laws have stepped in to the gap left by land law, these
laws still fall short in adequately addressing the climate crisis, and further amendments
will be required. As the pressures of mitigating climate change and adapting to its
impacts increases, further changes to property and environmental and planning laws
will be needed to accommodate more stringent regulation of property rights and land
use. While the future trajectories for land law are unknown, there are areas where
development of new regulatory frameworks seem imminent, including:

          risk of climate change to security interests;
          disclosure of climate risk upon sale of land; and
          managed retreat from land at significant risk of climate damage.

3.1 Mortgagee Risk

In a mortgage transaction, an owner of a fee simple estate (the mortgagor) borrows
money from a bank or other lender (the mortgagee). In doing so, the mortgagor not
only promises to repay the debt but also grants the mortgagee an interest in the land.
This interest entitles the mortgagee, in the event of a default (when the mortgagor does
not repay the debt as promised), to take possession of the land or sell it to recover the
outstanding debt. The parties' relationship is illustrated in Figure 6.

                                                                 247
                                                                                                                                                             248

Figure 6: Parties to a mortgage. Source: created by Kate Galloway, icons created using ChatGPT.

The rights and obligations of the parties arise from common law, equity and statutes,
including land registration statutes and the National Credit Code (which applies to
mortgages granted by individuals for domestic purposes). While each jurisdiction has
its own formulation, fundamental obligations owed by a mortgagor to a mortgagee
commonly include the duty to keep the land insured against loss or damage, and
the duty to preserve the land in its current state. These obligations operate in the
mortgagee's favour, safeguarding the value of land and ensuring that it does not fall
below the level needed to recover the debt if the mortgagor defaults on repayment.
Against this background, mortgagors and mortgagees have reason to be concerned
about climate change in two respects.
First, in relation to climate change mitigation, mortgagees are increasingly subject
to pressure from their shareholders to cease financing emissions-intensive activities
such as mining and fossil fuel energy generation, particularly considering corporate
mitigation targets and net-zero commitments (see Climate Change and Company
Law). As a result, mortgagees are likely to influence land use choices by declining
to finance GHG-intensive developments, or by imposing increasing climate related
   249

  requirements on mortgagors, such as the preparation and implementation of emissions
  reduction plans.1

  Second, mortgagees face both direct and indirect financial risks arising from the
  physical impacts of climate change on land. Direct financial risk occurs where the
  secured land is physically damaged or destroyed by climate related events. Indirect
  risk arises where land is perceived to be vulnerable to such impacts, even if no physical
  damage has yet occurred. In both situations, the value of land may decline -- either
  due to market perceptions of risk or because of government-imposed restrictions on
  certain land uses.

  As these actual and perceived risks increase, insuring land against loss or damage
  becomes more difficult. In some areas affected by natural disasters, insurers have
  begun refusing to provide coverage altogether or have raised premiums to levels that
  landowners can no longer afford. This shift in insurance availability and cost has
  heightened mortgagees' concern that greater financial risk will be transferred onto
  them as more land becomes vulnerable to climate related damage or destruction.
  Looking ahead, land law will need to adapt to this context to address how the burden
  of managing climate related risks -- particularly in relation to insuring land against
  loss and damage -- is allocated between mortgagor and mortgagee.

                                        CASE STUDY: STRANDED ASSETS2

     Some banks have adopted policies refusing to accept fossil fuel operations as
     security.3 The concern is that such property may become a stranded asset -- an

   asset that remains physically usable but, if fossil fuels are phased out, can no
   longer be operated profitably and therefore loses most of its value. In this way,
   mortgagees are increasingly unwilling to assume the risks associated with the
   transition to a decarbonised economy.

                                              KEY QUESTION
                  In the context of climate change, is it reasonable for mortgagees

                    to require mortgagors to insure land against loss and damage?
                    Discuss with reference to both legal principles and policy
                    considerations.

3.2 Disclosure of Climate Risks Upon Sale of Land

One of the most common transactions handled by property lawyers is the sale of
land from one person (the vendor) to another (the purchaser). In such a transaction,
a fee simple estate in land is transferred through a process known as conveyancing.
Conveyancing includes tasks such as negotiating and drafting contracts for the sale and
purchase of land, completing due diligence on land and title issues, and completing
documentation necessary to register the purchaser as the proprietor of the relevant
property interest. While Figure 7 shows the process of traditional Torrens
conveyancing, the process has been largely moved online through e-conveyancing
platforms such as PEXA and Sympli with small (but notable) changes shown in Figure
8.

In Australia, the purchase and sale of land is subject to strict consumer protection
legislation. In some jurisdictions, this legislation requires the vendor to disclose certain
information about the land to prospective purchasers at the time of sale. For example,
under Sale of Land Act 1962 (Vic) s 32, a vendor must provide a vendor's statement
to the purchaser before entering a contract of sale. This statement must disclose
matters such as financial outgoings (including land tax and council rates), notices
and other matters affecting the land, building permits, owners corporation or strata
arrangements, connected utility services, and evidence of title. Much of this
information is obtained from searches of government databases.
Some of the information disclosed in a vendor's statement is relevant to climate
change, including whether (1) the land is in a flood or bushfire zone; (2) planning
laws apply to the land and whether its current uses comply with zoning or overlay
requirements; and (3) buildings on the land comply with building regulations. Law
societies, such as the Law Society of New South Wales, have already issued guidance
   253

  to practitioners on the types of risks climate change may present in property
  transactions. In future, statutory disclosure requirements could be expanded to require
  information about the specific climate related risks affecting the land.

                                               KEY QUESTIONS
                    Should it be the vendor's responsibility to know and disclose

                      climate change risks affecting the land to the purchaser? Discuss
                      the practical and legal challenges involved.
                    If a vendor intentionally fails to disclose known climate risks, what
                      penalties or remedies should be available? Evaluate existing
                      legal frameworks and consider possible reforms.

 3.3 Managed Retreat / Buyback of Land

  As discussed above in the context of solar or rolling easements, environmental and
  planning law regulations can do a lot to permit or restrict certain uses of land in
  specific locations to manage risks posed by climate change. However, there may come
  a time where a more strategic approach needs to move people and their associated
  assets (houses, commercial premises, public buildings and infrastructure) out of
  harm's way.4
  Leading Australian environmental lawyer Jan McDonald has observed that:

              there is considerable anecdotal evidence in Australia that local authorities in
              coastal regions have avoided or delayed the introduction of retreat policies
              in their planning schemes because they cannot afford compensation claims

4. New Zealand Ministry for the Environment, Report of the Expert Working Group on Managed Retreat: A Proposed
      System for Te Hekenga Rauora/Planned Relocation (Report, 2023) [1.25].
                                                                                                                                                                254

              brought by property owners complaining of lost development rights and
              lower property values.5

  Planned retreat is widely recognised as both a political and financial challenge, due
  largely to the scale of Australia's population living on and near coasts and waterways.
  However, inaction also carries significant legal and economic risks. By continuing to
  approve residential and commercial developments in vulnerable coastal and riparian
  zones, governments expose themselves to liability and broader economic losses, many
  of which are uninsurable.

  Planned or managed retreat on such a large scale is unlikely to be carried out by
  regulating land use alone. Instead, managed retreat might require the State to take back
  property rights granted to private citizens that allow use of land in the first place. In
  Australia, private property is protected by both Commonwealth and state constitutions,
  as well as by statute. While the State may legally take private property, it must be taken
  for specific purposes (eg a public purpose) and only upon providing compensation. In
  the future, land law may need to be developed to give effect to managed retreat through
  taking of property rights.

                                           CASE STUDY: STATE BUYBACK

     After several catastrophic flood events in 2021-22, the Queensland Government
     established the Resilient Homes Fund6 to provide financial assistance for people
     to move out of locations affected by natural disasters. In this instance, the State
     accepted the risk of climate related consequences and landowners were
     compensated for giving up their property. Any mortgages could be paid out from
     the buyback compensation.

4. Conclusion

Land law provides a regulatory framework that is essential to the functioning of
Australian society. It not only governs ownership and transactions involving land but
also complements environmental and planning laws that regulate land use.
While land law has played a role in facilitating and protecting the use of land in
ways that have contributed to GHG emissions, it is already developing some responses
towards climate change mitigation and adaptation objectives. Recent developments
in land law include the creation of new kinds of property rights such as `emissions
units' or `carbon sequestration rights', and development of easements to support solar
access and respond to sea level rise. Environmental and planning laws also operate
alongside land law and can impose protective conditions on land use in coastal areas
most vulnerable to climate risks.
Crucially, land law holds substantial potential as a tool to build resilience and advance
climate change adaptation in Australian society. In the future, land law could be
developed to regulate mortgage interests granted over stranded assets, provide greater
opportunities for climate risk disclosure at the time land is bought and sold, and
support strategic relocation of people and assets away from high-risk areas or buyback
of uninhabitable land by the State.
Using land law as part of a climate response will require us to think about how land,
and interests in it, are valued by our society. We must also consider how settled rules
of land law can be adapted or changed in principled ways to achieve crucial climate
policy objectives in relation to mitigation, adaptation, loss and damage.

  The Commonwealth Constitution (`Constitution') is the foundational law in Australia.
  It establishes the Commonwealth of Australia as a federation governed under a
  parliamentary system of representative and responsible government. It distributes and
  regulates powers both horizontally -- across the federal parliament, the executive and
  the judiciary -- and vertically between the states and the Commonwealth. All laws
  passed by a parliament or actions undertaken by an executive must be consistent with
  the Constitution as the supreme law in this country. This means that the instrument
  establishes the legal and political system within which climate change must be
  addressed in Australia.
  The Constitution does not mention the environment or climate change. In part, this

is because the document was drafted in the 1890s, before modern environmental
concerns existed. It is also due to the framers' preference for a model of political
constitutionalism for rights-based adjudication. Political constitutionalism aims to
hold government accountable through political institutions and processes. It prioritises
the creation of a robust democratic system in which government wrongdoing may be
curbed through political means, such as public debate and parliamentary scrutiny. In
contrast, solely legal constitutions look primarily to the courts to control the executive
by placing detailed limits on government power.

The Constitution is the primary source of constitutional law, but it sits alongside other
constitutional sources. These include constitutional conventions, state constitutions,
key legal instruments issued on the path to Australian independence from the United
Kingdom, such as the Australia Act 1986, and decisions of the High Court of Australia.
As we will see, even though the Constitution does not mention the environment,
important decisions by the High Court continue to shape legal and political responses
to climate change.

The result is the Constitution empowers the Commonwealth and states to collectively
address the climate crisis largely as they see fit. The primary constitutional tools
available to people dissatisfied with climate laws and policies are the various
democratic processes set up by the Constitution to keep governments accountable,
alongside some forms of judicial review.

This chapter examines the strengths and weaknesses of this arrangement. We begin, in
part 1, by outlining how the Constitution divides control over climate change between
the Commonwealth and states (and the High Court's role in resolving tensions
between the two). In part 2, we explore the few constitutional limitations that restrain
governmental decision-making in this policy area. Part 3 looks to the future. It offers
a critique of how climate change has been handled within the largely political
constitutionalist framework, then considers two possible avenues for improvement --
constitutional amendment and constitutional implications.

 1. Government Powers to Address Climate Change

 1.1 Federalism

  The Constitution embodies a model of political constitutionalism in rights review.
  As we noted, this means that government is largely held accountable through `the
  common law and political processes',1 alongside some judicially enforceable
  guarantees. There are two key consequences that flow from this model for our
  purposes. First, the Constitution is designed to facilitate effective governance.2 It
  empowers representative Parliaments with the capacity to enact laws on a broad range
  of matters and holds that governments will ultimately be accountable to the people
  for the policies and laws that they pursue. Second, as a corollary, there is little in the
  Constitution that can be used to compel government to act. This may cause challenges
  when some people believe government is moving too slowly in the face of the climate
  crisis.

  This does not mean there are no legal limits on what governments can do. The
  Constitution preserved the already established colonies of New South Wales,
  Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria and Western Australia. It
  transformed these colonies into `states' and created a new national tier of government
  known as the `Commonwealth'. The Constitution's enactment in 1901 saw the states
  and Commonwealth begin governing Australia collectively (with the British
  Parliament retaining its ability to oversee this governance well into the 20th century).
  This power-sharing model of government is known as `federalism'. In part 1, we
  outline how governmental responsibilities regarding climate change are divided
  between the Commonwealth and states. As we will see, some of the most significant
  High Court decisions in the environmental field are actually conflicts over federalism:
  that is, whether the Constitution allows the Commonwealth or states to enact laws in
  that space.

                                                                                                                                                                262

 1.2 State Powers

  The Constitution grants the states `plenary power', meaning that they have a general
  power to make laws on whichever topics they wish (subject to certain limitations
  in the Constitution, discussed in part 2).3 The states may therefore legislate freely
  on environmental and climate protection. An example of this is Victoria's Climate
  Change Act 2017, which establishes the state's long-term emissions reduction target
  of net zero by 2050.

  In the event of inconsistency between a state law and Commonwealth law, section
  109 of the Constitution holds that the state law will be invalid to the extent of
  the inconsistency. Inconsistency includes, inter alia, situations in which the
  Commonwealth might choose to `cover the field' of climate mitigation through a
  comprehensive legislative regime. State laws which also address climate mitigation
  would then be invalid.

 1.3 Commonwealth Powers

  While the states can legislate on almost any topic that they choose, the Commonwealth
  can only legislate on certain topics permitted by the Constitution. These topics are
  known as `heads of power', most of which are listed in section 51. Notably, none of
  these heads of power refer directly to the environment. There are two reasons for this.
  First, the states were granted plenary power because they, as colonies, pre-existed the
  Commonwealth. The framers wanted the states to continue governing most aspects of
  societal life. Their view was that the Commonwealth should only be responsible for a
  specific list of topics that were national in character.

  Second, in the 1890s, environmental matters were seen as `local' issues and, thus,
  better left to the states.4 Awareness of the environment as a complex, interconnected
  set of ecosystems only emerged around the 1970s. It was in this period, as concerns
  over pollution and other large-scale ecological challenges developed, that the

      Press, 1992) 1, 2.

  Commonwealth took more of an interest in environmental matters.5 It passed its first
  environmental protection legislation in 1974, the Environment Protection (Impact of
  Proposals) Act.

  To pass such legislation, the Commonwealth needed to fit its laws within existing
  heads of power (again, none of which directly relate to the environment). This caused
  tensions between the Commonwealth and states (among others), particularly in the
  1970s and 1980s.6 In a series of cases, the High Court was called upon to clarify
  whether various heads of power were expansive enough to cover environmental policy
  areas. These cases proved to be some of the most significant in the High Court's
  history, altering the trajectory of Australian constitutional jurisprudence.

  In the 1983 Tasmanian Dam Case, the Commonwealth passed environmental
  protection legislation to stop Tasmania damming the Franklin River, which is situated
  within a World Heritage site.7 The Commonwealth argued that the external affairs
  power in section 51(xxix) permitted it to pass laws on external matters, including
  implementing international treaty obligations, even if it did not possess a head of
  power on the subject matter of the treaty. A narrow majority of the Court agreed,
  concluding that the Commonwealth legislation protecting this World Heritage site
  aligned with the UNESCO Convention for the Protection of the World Cultural and
  Natural Heritage 1972. In reaching this decision, the High Court was careful to
  explain that it was `in no way concerned with the question whether it is desirable or
  undesirable ... that the construction of the dam should proceed'. Rather, it answered
  the `strictly legal question' about the scope of Commonwealth power.8

  The external affairs power could similarly be used to pass legislation ratifying climate
  treaties, such as the 2015 Paris Agreement. However, the Commonwealth can only
  draw upon the external affairs power to implement a treaty if certain conditions
  are met. One such condition is that the Commonwealth law must be reasonably

   appropriate and adapted to achieve the relevant treaty obligations.9 Such obligations
   also need to have sufficient specificity. As noted in the Industrial Relations Act Case,
   vague, aspirational statements will not activate the external affairs power.10 This may
   be of concern if the climate treaty in question is drawn in terms that are too ambiguous.

   The High Court has generally taken a broad view when interpreting heads of power.
   This provides the Commonwealth with ample opportunity to legislate on
   environmental and climate matters.11 In Murphyores v Commonwealth, for instance,
   the Commonwealth drew upon the trade and commerce power in section 51(i) to
   protect the ecologically fragile K'gari (Fraser Island).12 Commonwealth regulations
   required an environmental assessment be conducted on mining practices on the island
   before export approval of the minerals could be granted. The Court upheld the validity
   of this law. This was because, as long as the law was sufficiently connected to this
   head of power's subject matter (interstate or international trade and commerce), it was
   irrelevant that it `touches or affects a topic on which the Commonwealth has no power
   to legislate', namely, environmental protection.13

   Thus, even though no head of power directly refers to environmental management,
   the Commonwealth has substantial power to legislate on climate matters. A range of
   heads of power beyond those discussed above are relevant in this regard. The taxation
   power in section 51(ii), for example, may support carbon tax legislation. Similarly,
   the corporations power in section 51(xx) may support Commonwealth laws requiring
   trading corporations to restrict their fossil fuel production or use.

                      How does the broad approach to the interpretation of heads of
                        power support climate action?

   Other avenues can also be considered. For instance, the Commonwealth's fiscal
   dominance allows it to influence state policies. This primarily occurs through section
   96, which enables the Commonwealth to offer grants to the states with conditions
   attached. These conditions often require that the states carry out aspects of the
   Commonwealth's policy agenda -- again, even concerning matters where the
   Commonwealth does not have legislative power.14 The states are susceptible to such
   offers, given the country's `vertical fiscal imbalance'. This is the term used to describe
   the reality in modern Australia that the Commonwealth enjoys far more lucrative
   tax revenue streams (and less spending responsibilities) than the states, leaving the
   Commonwealth with substantial bargaining power. Thus, the Commonwealth could
   offer tied grants to the states, requiring them to undertake significant climate
   mitigation and adaptation strategies.

   A more consensual approach would be to rely on section 51(xxxvii). This provision
   allows the states to refer policy areas to the Commonwealth where it does not have
   the head of power needed. While the Commonwealth and states have disagreed
   on environmental matters over the years, in contemporary times both are generally
   committed to a cooperative federalist approach in which they work together.15 As Peter
   Johnston concludes, the Constitution has proven `remarkably adaptable' in extending
   federalist arrangements to environmental issues.16

   What if, however, people believe that neither the states nor the Commonwealth are
   willing to use their powers to take necessary climate action -- or are using their powers

to accelerate climate change? This is where constitutional limitations on government
power, or the lack thereof, become relevant.

                  Can you think of additional provisions in the Constitution that the

                    Commonwealth could rely on to pass legislation to protect the
                    climate?

 2. Constitutional Limitations to Promote Climate
 Action

 2.1 The Absence of Environmental Protection Provisions

  The Constitution contains no provisions pertaining to environmental protection. We
  must remember that the framers wrote the Constitution in the 1890s, before modern
  understandings of the environment and its fragility had developed.1 Indeed, James
  Crawford has suggested that given the philosophical and political views of the time,
  any environmental provision may have focused upon the `difficulties in
  "overcoming"' Australia's environment rather than protecting it.2

  This absence of environmental protection provisions is also due to the framers'
  choice to adopt a political constitutionalist model with only limited legal avenues for
  judicial review.3 That is, while they opted to include narrow limitations on government
  power in the Constitution for the courts to enforce on environmental matters or
  otherwise, they focused on creating a strong democratic system where political
  mechanisms could curb undesirable government activity. Of course, the framers were
  not purists on this point. They included some limitations on Commonwealth and state
  powers in the Constitution, on topics ranging from freedom of religion (section 116)
  to printing money (section 115). The High Court has also identified certain implied
  limitations on government power to ensure the proper functioning of the Australian
  constitutional system, such as the implied freedom of political communication
  discussed below.

  In part 2, we explore how litigants, without environmental protection provisions to

      Press, 1992) 2.

3. This is in contrast to a model of `legal constitutionalism', where a longer list of specific limitations on government power
      is placed in a nation's constitution: `If you dislike something which the government has done or is proposing to do,
      instead of lobbying for parliamentary scrutiny, you simply sue the government in court or seek some form of judicial
      review': Adam Tomkins, Public Law (Oxford University Press, 2003) 19.

  rely upon, have drawn on the express and implied limitations in the Constitution to
  address climate and environmental concerns. As we will see, this typically requires
  careful thinking to reframe climate concerns to trigger the relevant limitation.4

                                                KEY QUESTION
                    What would the framers have thought about including

                      environment protection provisions in the Constitution?

 2.2 Interstate Trade (Section 92)

  Section 92 of the Constitution provides that `trade, commerce, and intercourse among
  the States ... shall be absolutely free'. On its face, this provision has nothing to do
  with environmental or climate action. However, the most significant case exploring its
  meaning (which was contentious for decades before this point) concerned regulations
  dealing with fishery conservation. Regulation 31(1)(d) of the Tasmanian Sea Fisheries
  Regulations 1962 prohibited any person from possessing crayfish of less than 105 mm
  for females and 110 mm for males to maintain breeding stock. Similar regulations
  in South Australia set the minimum size at 98.5 mm. David Whitfield was charged
  under reg 31(d) for importing crayfish from South Australia to Tasmania that met the
  South Australian standard but not the Tasmanian requirement. In Cole v Whitfield, he
  argued that the Tasmanian regulations were invalid by virtue of section 92.5 The High
  Court unanimously disagreed, holding that the regulations were not discriminatory
  and protectionist in character. The decision thus ensured that states could enact their
  own conservation regimes so long as they did not impose `discriminatory burdens of a
  protectionist kind'.6

6. Ibid 394.
     269

   This standard was applied in Castlemaine Tooheys Ltd v South Australia.7 In 1975,
   South Australia introduced a container deposit scheme based on the polluter pays
   principle. The Beverage Container Act 1975 imposed a mandatory deposit of 5 cents
   per bottle, which would be refunded when returned. The deposit scheme did not
   apply to refillable bottles. In the 1980s, an interstate brewer that used non-refillable
   bottles began a campaign to substantially increase its market share in South Australia.
   In 1986, the South Australian Parliament passed an amendment to the Beverage
   Container Act 1975 which would make the sale of beer in non-refillable bottles
   commercially disadvantageous. South Australia submitted that the object of the
   amendment was to promote litter control and conserve energy and resources. The
   High Court noted that the Constitution allows a state to enact laws `for the well-
   being of the people of the State' and accepted the legislation was directed at resolving
   `pressing social problems'.8 Nonetheless, the Court found that the means with which
   the state pursued this objective was not proportionate and thus breached the guarantee
   in section 92.

  2.3 Implied Freedom of Political Communication

   Sections 7 and 24 of the Constitution provide that the House of Representatives and
   Senate shall be `directly chosen by the people'. In two cases in 1992,9 the High Court
   drew on these provisions to uncover an implied freedom of political communication.
   The Court held that sections 7 and 24 require an informed choice, which necessitates
   access to relevant political information. The implied freedom has been described as
   a `shield' rather than a `sword'.10 It operates as a limitation on Commonwealth and
   state legislative and executive power. Laws or actions that unduly burden freedom of
   political communication will be found unconstitutional.

   Environmentalists have sought the protection of this freedom with mixed success.

   In Levy v Victoria,11 for instance, the High Court heard a challenge to regulations
   prohibiting access to duck hunting areas. The plaintiff argued that the regulations
   prevented him from entering an area to protest the practice of duck hunting to thereby
   ensure `that the people of Victoria could form informed political judgments about
   the position of the Victorian Government on the issues'.12 The Court dismissed these
   arguments (deeming the regulations appropriate to maintain public safety given duck
   hunting sites are spaces were guns are being fired) without exploring the merits of
   duck hunting or environmental protection more broadly.

   Twenty years later, in Brown v Tasmania,13 the High Court considered whether a
   Tasmanian law prohibiting environmentalists from protesting logging at certain
   forestry sites impermissibly burdened the implied freedom. The Court agreed with
   the plaintiffs. However, while the justices recognised the link between environmental
   protests and political communication, the consequences of forestry on ecosystems in
   Tasmania were not at issue.

   The recent decision of Kvelde v NSW14 centred on climate protesters. In April 2022, the
   NSW Parliament enacted amendments to the Crimes Act 1900 that made it an offence
   for a person to trespass on or block entry to a major facility, with a maximum penalty
   of two years imprisonment. This amendment was introduced after climate activists
   caused major traffic disruptions at Port Botany. Two members of the `Knitting
   Nannas', a climate advocacy group, challenged the law, arguing that it impermissibly
   burdened the implied freedom of political communication. The NSW Supreme Court
   agreed. The Court held that these offences would have a `chilling effect on political
   communication via protests and public assemblies'.15 Brown and Kvelde demonstrate
   that the implied freedom can protect climate protests. This limited protection may have

   increased utility in the future, given the recent trend of Australian legislatures passing
   harsher anti-protest laws to quell acts of civil disobedience by climate protesters.16

  2.4 Excise Duties (Section 90)

   We have noted that the Constitution distributes powers between the Commonwealth
   and the states. While the heads of power in section 51 are concurrent, meaning that
   both the Commonwealth and the states may pass laws on these matters, some powers
   are reserved exclusively to the national government. Section 90 is one such example.
   This provision prohibits states from imposing customs and excise duties.

   In the recent decision of Vanderstock v Victoria, the High Court considered section
   90.17 In this case, two owners of electric vehicles challenged s 7(1) of the Victorian
   Zero and Low Emission Vehicle Distance-based Charge Act 2021. The provision
   required owners of zero- and low-emission vehicles to pay a charge for the use of the
   vehicle on public roads calculated by reference to the distance travelled. The plaintiffs
   argued that the provision was invalid, as it imposed a duty of excise inconsistent with
   section 90 of the Constitution. The High Court agreed, holding that a tax on goods is
   an excise if it bears a close relation to the production or manufacture, sale, distribution
   or consumption of goods and be of such a nature as to affect demand.

   The decision was seen as a victory for the climate cause. Kathleen Davies, one of
   the litigants, explained that she took action because she believed that the tax `was
   an obstacle to electric vehicle uptake and we need to do all we can to de-carbonise
   the roads'.18 However, while the Court noted `differing and evolving Commonwealth
   and state policies on greenhouse gas emissions' and `the role of electric vehicles in
   contributing to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions',19 this factor played no role

   law.

  2.5 Acquiring Property (Section 51(xxxi))

   The discussion above has demonstrated that climate advocates need to be creative
   when relying on constitutional law. It has also shown that the Australian Constitution
   can be employed to obtain results that support the goals of climate advocates.
   However, it is also important to note that other provisions of the Constitution might
   introduce additional challenges to climate mitigation and adaption endeavours.

   Section 51(xxxi), for example, states that any acquisition of property by the
   Commonwealth must be on just terms. The Commonwealth, therefore, would need to
   compensate coal and gas companies if it passed legislation decommissioning mining
   sites -- a substantial disincentive against climate action. This is illustrated by the
   High Court's decision in Newcrest Mining (WA) Ltd v Commonwealth.20 In this case,
   the Commonwealth passed legislation to expand Kakadu National Park, prohibiting
   Newcrest Mining from exploiting its mining sites in affected areas. The High Court
   held that this was an `acquisition' of Newcrest Mining's property under section
   51(xxxi). The Commonwealth would need to compensate the company for its loss of
   revenue if it prevented mining from taking place on this land.

                                                 KEY QUESTIONS
                      In what ways might constitutional limitations assist or hinder

                        climate action?

                      Why do you think the High Court has been careful to explain that

                        deciding cases that touch on the environment or climate?

273

The Australian Constitution contains no environmental protection provisions and few
other limitations on government power of assistance to Australian climate litigants.
While some of the most significant cases in Australian constitutional history revolve
around environmental issues, the courts' decisions do not turn on the need to protect
the environment. Of course, climate advocates may still draw upon the political
avenues established by the Constitution to seek stronger government action on climate
change. In the final part of this chapter, we discuss the viability of these avenues and
consider possible future trajectories in Australian constitutional law.

 3. Future Trajectories of Australian Constitutional
 Law

  As noted in part 2.1, the Constitution embodies a model of political constitutionalism
  for rights protections.1 This generally means that people rely more on political
  processes than judicial enforcement of constitutional limitations to compel
  governments to respond to issues like climate change. Australia has a history of strong
  environmental protest movements that have successfully influenced legislatures. For
  instance, such a movement was instrumental in pushing the Commonwealth to stop
  the damming of the Franklin River, the subject of the Tasmanian Dam Case discussed
  in part 1.3. However, many climate advocates wonder whether political processes are
  sufficient in the current climate context. Australia continues to rank among the world's
  worst climate actors, despite decades of protests, lobbying, media scrutiny and more.2
  The fossil fuel industry exercises considerable influence over Commonwealth and
  state governments. Some have described this influence, which has seen climate laws
  and policies continually weakened or abandoned and anti-protest laws strengthened,
  as an example of `corporate state capture'.3 With more than three decades largely
  squandered, time is now running out before dangerous climate tipping points are
  reached.4

  Climate advocates should utilise the political mechanisms available under the

  Constitution to their full extent. The last 30 years of experience, however, suggests
  that additional legal mechanisms are needed. In this part, we explore two potential
  developments. First, we consider whether the High Court might uncover an
  implication within the text and structure of the Constitution to help address climate
  wrongdoing. Second, we examine the feasibility of amending the Constitution to
  explicitly include environmental protections.

 3.1 Constitutional Implications

   repeating cycle. Source: Created by authors.

  Language requires interpretation. When resolving disputes over the meaning of a
  constitutional provision, the High Court will start by construing the text. However,
  that text may contain not only a range of possible meanings but also a `spectrum of
  implications' based on context and purpose.5 Over the years, the High Court has found
  several implications within the text and structure of the Constitution. For example,
  we discussed in part 2.3 that drawing on provisions that mandate that the legislative
  and executive branches of government are `ultimately answerable to the Australian

   people',6 the Court has held that the Constitution implicitly protects freedom of
   political communication as `indispensable to that accountability'.7 Likewise, drawing
   on the federal nature of the Constitution, the High Court has found limits to
   Commonwealth legislative power. The Melbourne Corporations principle prevents the
   Commonwealth from making laws which destroy or significantly burden or weaken
   the capacity of the states to carry out or exercise their legislative, executive and
   judicial functions.8 Could a constitutional implication that protects the environment be
   uncovered?

   Courts in at least 20 nations, including Argentina, Greece, India, Kenya and Malaysia,
   have found environmental protections implied in their constitutions.9 The common
   rationale is that a right to a healthy environment and/or climate is a fundamental
   component of explicit constitutional rights, such as the right to life or right to health.10
   In Leghari v Pakistan, for example, the High Court of Lahore held that the Pakistani
   government's failure to implement its climate policies violated the constitutional rights
   of its citizens, including the right to life, right to human dignity, right to property and
   right to information.11 The Court held that these rights provided `the necessary judicial
   toolkit to address and monitor the Government's response to climate change'.12

   As this suggests, implications require fertile soil. The absence of rights protections in
   Australia's Constitution might appear to leave courts tilling a barren text.13 However,
   some pathways forward have been suggested. For instance, Costa Avgoustinos
   proposes that an `implied right to a healthy environment' (or `ecological limitation')

   may be found within the text and structure of the Constitution.14 Avgoustinos notes
   that the implied freedom and Melbourne Corporations principle aim to secure the
   structural integrity of the Australian constitutional system. He argues that
   Commonwealth and state activity worsening climate change (such as government
   approval of a new coalmine) may be viewed as posing a threat to our constitutional
   system. This is because the overlapping crises of escalating temperatures, disease,
   natural disasters, food and water insecurity and more may impair, if not destroy,
   state relationships, parliamentary and electoral processes, court functions and other
   fundamental aspects of the Australian constitutional system in the coming decades
   and centuries.15 For this reason, an ecological limitation could be uncovered. Indeed,
   as NSW Supreme Court judge Franois Kunc states, `inadequately mitigated climate
   change could undo our social order and the rule of law itself'.16

   Other approaches have also been proposed. Section 100 of the Constitution provides
   that the Commonwealth shall not abridge the right of a state or its residents to
   reasonable use of waters. Although the section `is silent on the rights of State inter
   se', Nicholas Kelly has argued that it could carry an implied limit on water use by
   the states.17 Adam Webster has made a similar argument, drawn from the Melbourne
   Corporations principle. Webster suggests that the maintenance of the Constitution's
   federal balance might extend to restraining one or more states depriving another of
   water in certain transboundary river disputes.18 This has particular salience in the

   context of climate change's expected detrimental impacts on the Murray-Darling
   Basin water supply.

   Consider one more possible implication. In 2009, Steven Gageler (now Chief Justice
   of the High Court) outlined a persuasive vision of the Constitution based in the
   principles of representative and responsible government. The vision expounded by
   Gageler gives an understanding of political accountability as the primary method
   of constraining government power but sees judicial power as `tailoring itself to the
   strengths and weaknesses' of the ordinary method.19 This rationale explains `the broad
   sweep of constitutional doctrine', including when and why the Court has uncovered
   constitutional implications.20 Could this vision justify an environmental implication
   along the lines proposed by Costa Avgoustinos above? The severity and impact of the
   climate crisis is delayed; the young and future generations will be left to respond to
   its worst effects. Yet, because they are not eligible to vote, these groups are unable
   to employ the political mechanisms available under the Constitution to protect their
   interests now when it matters most. In Theophanous v Herald & Weekly Times Ltd,
   McHugh J noted that the Constitution is an intergenerational compact `intended to
   endure for centuries'.21 The interests of future generations, and the deficiencies of
   our political processes to address them in the context of the climate crisis, cannot be
   dismissed.

   It is beyond the scope of this chapter to examine whether these arguments might
   succeed in litigation. It is important to note, however, that the High Court has
   historically been hesitant to derive new implications from the Constitution or extend
   existing implications too far. Such hesitancy reflects concerns over the proper
   development of constitutional jurisprudence and democratic legitimacy. After all, the

   Constitution contains its own method for amendment in section 128.22 Nevertheless,
   the Court's general position is that constitutional implications are a legitimate, and
   unavoidable, aspect of constitutional jurisprudence.23 This is because, as Dixon J
   explains, written constitutions must be `expressed in general propositions wide enough
   to be capable of flexible application to changing circumstances'.24 Perhaps the
   cumulative effect of the climate crisis might encourage -- or compel -- a future court
   to read the Constitution in a new way, responsive to radically changed circumstances.

                                                 KEY QUESTIONS
                      Can you think of other implications that might be drawn from the

                        text and structure of the Constitution relevant to the climate
                        crisis?
                      What institutional constraints must courts manage when
                        considering whether to draw an implication from the text and
                        structure of the Constitution?

  3.2 Constitutional Amendment

   Discerning an environmental implication within the text and structure of the
   Constitution may be challenging. It would also likely attract criticism as a particularly
   `inventive judicial decision'.25 A more formal approach to reform would follow the
   process outlined in s 128, which gives the Australian people the opportunity to decide.
   Section 128 sets out the process by which the Constitution may altered. It imposes
   three steps.

           1. A bill to amend the Constitution must be passed by the Parliament (or
               passed by the same House twice within a period of six months). The bill is
               then submitted to the Australian electors.

           2. The bill must obtain an absolute majority of voters; and

           3. The bill must also obtain a majority of voters in a majority of states (ie four
               out of six states must approve the alteration).

   Constitutional amendment has proven difficult. Of the 45 attempts to amend the
   Constitution since 1901, only eight proposals have succeeded. The last amendment
   was made in 1977. This record suggests that any attempt to bolster environmental
   protection at the federal level will be challenging.

   The Australian Constitution stands increasingly isolated in its failure to incorporate
   provisions requiring governments to undertake environmental protection or limits on
   government power to restrict environmental degradation. A majority of nations (157
   out of 193) have constitutions that include environmental protection provisions.26
   These include duties placed on governments to protect the environment,27 rights
   of citizens to a healthy environment28 and rights of nature itself to flourish.29 The
   constitutions of 12 nations even refer to climate change explicitly.30

   Climate litigants across the world have used the environmental protection provisions
   in their respective national constitutions to tackle climate change. In Colombia, for
   example, the Constitutional Court struck down two laws that threatened the nation's
   pramos, resulting in the revocation of hundreds of mining licences.31 These alpine

   tundra ecosystems operate as carbon sinks and provide Colombia with up to 70%
   of its drinking water. The Court emphasised that climate change and its impacts on
   water security may make this water supply even more valuable in the future.32 The
   Court's decision relied, in part, on the breach of the public's constitutional right to
   clean water and the government's constitutional obligations to justify decisions that
   degrade environmentally sensitive and valuable areas.

   Similarly, in the landmark case of Urgenda v Netherlands, the Hague District Court
   drew on environmental protection obligations in the Dutch Constitution to help
   establish the government's `duty of care' to take climate action in tort law.33 Article
   21 of the constitution states that: `It shall be the concern of the authorities to keep
   the country habitable and to protect and improve the environment'. The court held
   that although Urgenda, a Dutch environmental group, cannot derive rights from this
   constitutional provision directly, the provision was relevant to the question of whether
   the state had failed to meet its duty of care to Urgenda. Similar reasoning has been,
   and is currently being, pursued in climate litigation in other jurisdictions.34

   If Australia is to adopt a provision on environmental protection in the Constitution,
   what approach should it take? Some scholars have suggested that a right to a healthy
   environment could be entrenched in the document on its own or as part of a broader
   Bill of Rights.35 In August 2024, for example, the ACT Legislative Assembly passed

       the Commission on Intersectoral Infrastructure and Strategic Projects to class specific projects as exempt from
       particular local regulation. Law No. 1753 of 2015 prohibited particular activities in the pramos, such as mining,
       unless authorised prior to certain dates.

   legislation to add a `right to a healthy environment' into its statutory Human Rights
   Act 2004.36

   However, a right to a `healthy environment' is aspirational and broad. A court required
   to determine whether some government action, such as permitting the construction of
   a mine or failing to legislate sufficiently robust carbon emissions targets, may struggle
   to clearly resolve the dispute. It is likely that the right will be found to be subject to an
   express or implied limitation or otherwise limited through a balancing exercise. The
   risk for climate activists is that the indeterminate and ambiguously worded right will
   be read down.

   Ron Levy has argued that a better approach is to insert a provision that provides a fixed
   constitutional commitment.37 These provisions impose precise, binding and entrenched
   obligations. Several examples exist. The Victorian constitutional prohibition on
   fracking, discussed above, imposes a clear ban on the practice. Similarly, in Bhutan
   and Kenya, constitutional provisions require a set percentage of forest cover (60% and
   10%, respectively).38 While these two cases are somewhat ambiguous (what counts as
   forest?), they seek to establish a clearly defined baseline through which government
   can be held to account.

                      Why do you think most constitutional amendments in Australia
                        have failed?

                      Why do you think the Australian Constitution differs in this regard
                        from that of other countries?

   Constitutional amendment is simpler at the state level. This is because state
   constitutions are flexible and capable of being amended by passage of ordinary
   legislation.39 Given the ease with which amendments can be made, state Parliaments
   may choose to entrench climate protection legislation through constitutional
   amendment. In 2021, for example, the Victorian Parliament amended the Victorian
   Constitution to constrain the power of the Parliament to make laws repealing or
   altering a ban on fracking, coal seam gas exploration and mining.40
   However, the flexibility of state constitutions means the effect of this entrenchment is
   uncertain.41 State Parliaments may only entrench legislation through manner and form
   provisions, which are only valid in relation to laws relating to the `constitution, powers
   or procedure of the Parliament'. The Victorian constitutional provision noted above
   does not relate to the composition, powers or procedure of the Parliament and is likely
   of no legal effect.

                                                 KEY QUESTIONS
                      If the Victorian constitutional prohibition on fracking is of no legal

                        effect, why did the Victorian Parliament amend the Victorian
                        constitution? Does state constitutional amendment serve broader
                        goals?

4. Conclusion

This chapter has explored how climate change has been addressed in Australian
constitutional law. It presents a complicated picture. The Constitution empowers the
Commonwealth and states to combat climate change and places few limitations on
their ability to do so. Nonetheless, for many climate advocates, governments have not
used their broad powers with sufficient speed and enthusiasm. While environmental
and climate advocates have at times been able to secure success in court, the absence
of environmental protection provisions suggests that future activity will need to be
directed to the political sphere.

Administrative law provides an important avenue for protecting the rights and interests
of citizens affected by the decisions and actions of government agencies. Governments
regularly make a range of climate-related decisions, such as deciding whether to
approve new coalmines. Concomitantly, there is a high volume of climate-related
administrative law challenges in Australia and internationally. Although these legal
challenges have met with mixed success, their broader significance includes
generating pressure for evolution in regulatory and policy frameworks.
This chapter considers the extent to which climate change is disrupting administrative

review: illegality, irrationality and procedural impropriety. It also considers merits
review cases involving climate change.
The chapter invites you to reflect on why climate litigation has not, to date,
significantly disrupted well-established Australian administrative law doctrines,
particularly through the judicial review avenue. It also encourages reflection on the
important role administrative law plays as a pathway for catalysing regulatory change
in Australia and beyond.

 1. Administrative Law and Climate Change

  Climate change generates a high volume of administrative law challenges in Australia
  and internationally.1 Climate-related litigation has become an important avenue for
  seeking to enforce governments' climate change obligations. Indeed, more than 70
  per cent of climate litigation internationally names the government as respondent or
  defendant in diverse cases brought by non-governmental organisations, individuals
  and companies.2 Within Australia and globally, litigation of climate change matters
  often takes the form of judicial reviews of administrative decisions to approve
  potentially climate-damaging projects such as coalmines.3 Indeed, the `first
  generation' of climate litigation in Australia largely concerned administrative law
  challenges to government decision-making, particularly under planning and
  environment legislation.4

  A frequent argument in administrative law challenges is that government decision-
  makers have failed to adequately consider climate change in statutory decision-making
  processes.5 A common `climate conscious' approach to administrative law advocacy
  has involved seeking to incorporate climate change within the scope of decision-

   making, particularly for projects with substantial climate impacts, by reference to
   broader statutory purposes.6 While climate litigation in administrative law has met
   with mixed success, its significance extends beyond the court room as an important
   mechanism for raising public and political awareness of climate change and generating
   pressure for broader regulatory change.7

   Climate change requires an urgent response and is widely understood to be legally
   disruptive.8 In response to disruptive situations, `legal frameworks must evolve or new
   authoritative legal frames must be developed'.9 However, the potential for climate
   change to generate pressure for evolution in legal doctrines and frameworks is in
   tension with the comparatively rigid and homeostatic nature of administrative law.
   This is particularly the case for Australian administrative law, which is characterised
   by, among other things, prescriptive judicial review legislation, a `preference to
   work within existing historic or doctrinal categories' and Australia's `especially rigid'
   and constitutionally entrenched separation of judicial power.10 It is thus important to
   distinguish between legal disruption and legal development. Legal disruption occurs
   when problems cannot be managed using existing legal frameworks, thus necessitating
   a change in business-as-usual practices. In contrast to legal disruption, legal
   development is the normal evolution of the law. Disruption is therefore a useful frame,
   as it allows for categorising and defining disruptive processes that have more than a
   normal evolutionary impact on legal doctrines and frameworks.11

   The distinction between legal disruption and development raises two important
   questions that are explored in this chapter.

                                                 KEY QUESTIONS
                      To what extent is climate change disrupting administrative law

                        doctrines against the backdrop of the separation of powers?
                      In what ways is climate litigation in administrative law generating

                        pressure for evolution in regulatory frameworks?

   In examining the first question, this chapter primarily focuses on the Australian
   administrative law context, which, as noted above, is distinctive in terms of its strict
   and constitutionally entrenched separation of powers constraints. We examine climate
   litigation in judicial review generally under each of the three main categories of
   review: illegality, irrationality and procedural impropriety.12 We also explore the
   disruptive potential of climate change for both judicial review and merits review.

   In addressing the second question, relevant examples from Australia and pertinent
   comparator jurisdictions illustrate possibilities for climate litigation in administrative
   law to generate pressure for change in regulatory frameworks. The chapter considers
   a perspective that climate litigation is not significantly disrupting well-established
   Australian administrative law doctrines. Even so, we consider whether it is true to
   say that it still plays an important role in catalysing regulatory evolution, particularly
   through the judicial review avenue, both in Australia and beyond.

   existing doctrines and frameworks, it is useful to check your broad understanding

   of the Australian administrative law context. Administrative law provides important
   mechanisms for protecting the rights and interests of citizens affected by the decisions
   and actions of government agencies. Two of the key avenues of administrative law,
   judicial review and merits review, are the primary focus of this chapter. The
   availability of judicial review is entrenched in s 75(v) of the Australian Constitution.13
   The High Court has reinforced the importance of the judicial review process in
   Australia, confirming that there is `an entrenched minimum provision of judicial
   review' in Commonwealth matters.14 Legislative grounds of judicial review, which
   largely codify the pre-existing common law grounds of review, are found at both
   Commonwealth and state and territory levels.15

   Judicial review is the avenue of administrative law in which climate-related challenges
   are most frequently initiated.16 Within judicial review matters, climate change can be
   raised as a central or peripheral consideration.17 Decisions made under environmental
   and planning laws provide the most common context for raising climate change
   issues in a judicial review.18 As considerations of climate change, the land and the
   environment are almost wholly governed by legislation, statutory interpretation plays
   an important role in climate-related administrative law challenges.19 The courts'
   discretion in statutory interpretation is largely exercised within the boundaries of

   upholding the separation of powers doctrine, as the courts are required to interpret
   statutes in line with the intention of Parliament.20 Within the judicial review process,
   disruption can occur when novel arguments or interpretations of statutes lead to
   climate change being read into existing doctrines, which may in turn promote climate
   conscious decision-making.21

   The rule of law and separation of powers both shape and constrain administrative law.
   Australian government ministers and officials are often the respondents in judicial
   review proceedings. This is an important aspect of the rule of law which holds that
   the Parliament, the executive and the judiciary are bound by rules and procedures to
   ensure that the law is knowable, and that it applies to all.22 There are also separation
   of powers constraints that define the powers that can be exercised by the judiciary
   in administrative law. Under Australia's constitutionally entrenched separation of
   powers, two functions that are exclusively judicial in character are the power to
   conclusively interpret the legal meaning of a statute,23 and the power to determine
   the validity of executive action by reference to the authorising statute.24 Unlike in the
   United States, Australian courts do not defer to a government agency's reasonable
   interpretation of an ambiguous legislative phrase, despite an agency's experience
   working with the legislation it routinely administers.25

   The separation of judicial power underpins the important distinction between legality
   and merits in administrative law. In judicial review, courts must confine their analysis
   to the legality of a decision -- that is, whether there has been a legal error. The legality/
   merits distinction is seen clearly in judicial review matters in which a court remits
   a decision back to the original decision-maker to be remade in accordance with law
   if the court determines that there has been a legal error. In contrast, merits review
   tribunals are able to take into account the facts and merits of a case.26 Merits review
   tribunals have broader review powers and, as a result, climate change may have a
   greater disruptive impact.27
   Against this backdrop, this chapter considers potential legal disruption arising from
   climate litigation in administrative law. First, in Section 2, we examine the extent to
   which climate litigation is causing legal disruption via evolution in administrative law
   doctrines through the avenues of judicial review and merits review. Second, in Section
   3, we consider the ways in which climate litigation is generating pressure for evolution
   in regulatory frameworks responding to climate change.

 2. Developments in Administrative Law in Response
 to Climate Change

 2.1. Judicial Review

  In this section, we invite you to evaluate climate litigation cases across the three
  broad categories of judicial review grounds: illegality, irrationality and procedural
  impropriety.1

  2.1.1. Illegality
  For a lawful decision, the `decision-maker must understand correctly the law that
  regulates [the] decision-making power and must give effect to it'.2 In contrast,
  illegality can include a failure to consider or comply with statutory requirements in
  the exercise of government power in administrative decision-making.3 An example
  of an administrative law case in this category is Australian Conservation Foundation
  v Minister for the Environment.4 This case involved a judicial review challenge of
  the environment Minister's decision to approve the Carmichael coalmine in central
  Queensland. One of the grounds of review the Australian Conservation Foundation
  (ACF) raised was that the Minister had not correctly applied s 137 of the Environment
  Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (Cth) (the EPBC Act), which
  requires the Minister not to act inconsistently with Australia's obligations under the
  World Heritage Convention (WHC).

  The ACF claimed that the Minister made an error of law in failing to apply the
  statutory prohibition in s 137 of the EPBC Act. Namely, approval of the mine was
  claimed to be inconsistent with Australia's obligations under the WHC, as the effect

   297

  of the mine's combustion emissions overseas posed a risk to the World Heritage listed
  Great Barrier Reef.5 While the Federal Court of Australia accepted that a challenge on
  this basis was justiciable, it nevertheless held that the ACF failed to establish that the
  Minister had breached the statutory prohibition imposed by s 137, as he had sufficient
  regard to his obligation not to act inconsistently with the WHC in making the decision
  to approve the mine.6

                                               KEY QUESTIONS
                    Does the case of Australian Conservation Foundation v Minister

                      for the Environment evidence legal disruption?
                    What is the role of the legality/merits divide in this decision?

  2.1.2. Irrationality
  The category of irrationality includes grounds of review such as a failure to take
  into account relevant considerations expressly required or implied by a statute, which
  is the most common way of framing judicial review challenges involving climate
  change.7 It also encompasses legal irrationality, illogicality and unreasonableness.
  In this subsection, we first consider cases where climate change is a mandatory
  consideration, before examining cases where consideration of climate change is
  implied by a statute. We conclude by examining the limits of irrationality arguments
  in the context of climate-related administrative law cases.

                                       a) Mandatory Requirements

  An example of an administrative law challenge in which consideration of climate
  change impacts was mandatory is KEPCO Bylong Australia Pty Ltd v Independent

   Planning Commission & Anor (`KEPCO Case').8 In September 2019, the NSW
   Independent Planning Commission (IPC) rejected an application from KEPCO Bylong
   Australia to construct an open-cut and underground coalmine in NSW due to, inter
   alia, inadequate plans for minimising downstream scope 3 greenhouse gas (GHG)
   emissions.9 KEPCO initiated an unsuccessful judicial review challenge in the NSW
   Land and Environment Court10 and a further unsuccessful challenge in the NSW Court
   of Appeal.11 A key issue in both judicial review proceedings was whether the IPC had
   taken non-applicable considerations into account, including by considering the NSW
   Climate Change Policy Framework, which contains a net zero emissions objective, in
   its decision. Relevantly, under cl 14(2) of the State Environmental Planning Policy
   (Mining, Petroleum Production and Extractive Industries) 2007 (NSW) (the Mining
   SEPP), the consent authority -- in this case, the IPC -- must consider an assessment
   of potential GHG emissions from a proposed mining development, including
   downstream emissions, and must do so having regard to any applicable state or
   national policies, programs or guidelines.12 In dismissing the appeal, the NSW Court
   of Appeal held that the IPC is entitled to consider the NSW Climate Change Policy
   Framework for the purposes of `applicable ... policies, programs or guidelines' under
   the Mining SEPP.13

   The KEPCO Case thus confirms that the IPC can exercise its discretion in applying
   and constructing the mandatory consideration in cl 14(2) of the Mining SEPP.
   Specifically, it has broad discretion in determining what constitutes an `applicable'
   policy or guideline for assessing potential GHG emissions from a proposed project.
   We consider that the court requiring the IPC to take into account the considerations

   specified in cl 14(2) of the Mining SEPP is not necessarily disruptive; this is a
   straightforward application of the requirement to consider relevant mandatory
   considerations in administrative law. However, the NSW Court of Appeal's
   construction of cl 14(2) was broad, reinforcing the wide discretion of planning
   authorities in assessing climate change impacts.

                                                  KEY QUESTION

                      Do you consider that the court's interpretation of the scope of the
                        cl 14(2) requirement in the KEPCO Case has a disruptive impact
                        beyond the standard incremental development of the law?

                                           b) Implied Requirements

   More commonly, there is no express legislative requirement to consider climate
   change or GHG emissions, raising the question of whether a statute impliedly requires
   consideration of these matters. This requires consideration of a statute's subject matter,
   scope and purpose.14 For example, Australia's principal federal environmental statute,
   the EPBC Act, notably does not mention climate change once in its more than
   500 provisions, let alone require its inclusion as a mandatory consideration in
   administrative decision-making processes. There have been various calls for
   legislative change to include an express legislative requirement or a `climate trigger',
   including a proposed `duty of care' Bill.15 The Climate Change Amendment (Duty
   of Care and Intergenerational Climate Equity) Bill 2023 (Cth) requires authorised
   officers making decisions that facilitate the financing and development of projects
   that may significantly increase GHG emissions to be (a) required to consider the
   impact of significant decisions on the health and wellbeing of current and future
   Australian children;16 and (b) prevented from making significant decisions involving

   the exploration or extraction of coal, oil or gas that could harm the health and
   wellbeing of current and future Australian children.17

   Despite the general lack of legislative requirements to consider climate change, the
   courts' interpretation of environmental principles of `ecologically sustainable
   development' (ESD) commonly referred to in environmental statutes, including the
   `precautionary principle' and `intergenerational equity', does allow for consideration
   of climate change.18 As part of the principles of ESD, which encourage integration of
   short- and long-term environmental, economic and social factors in decision-making,
   the precautionary principle seeks to ensure that scientific uncertainty does not prevent
   a prudent approach to minimising the risk of serious and irreversible impacts, and the
   principle of intergenerational equity aims to take into account the welfare of future as
   well as present generations.19 By their very nature, these principles require weighing
   of competing considerations, and they are not prescriptive. Thus, if a decision-maker
   appropriately considers climate change in applying these principles, they will not have
   failed to take into account a relevant consideration if they ultimately prioritise other
   considerations.

   An example of an administrative law case in which consideration of climate change
   was impliedly required is Gray v Minister for Planning.20 The matter concerned a
   proposal to build the Anvil Hill coalmine, an open-cut mine in the NSW Hunter
   Valley. In this case, the NSW Land and Environment Court held that the Director-
   General was to have regard to the principles of ESD, particularly the precautionary
   principle and the principle of intergenerational equity, in determining the adequacy of

   environmental assessment required under pt 3A of the Environmental Planning and
   Assessment Act 1979 (NSW).21 The expansive interpretation of relevant considerations
   in this case evidences doctrinal evolution. Moreover, this case subsequently prompted
   the introduction of the Mining SEPP discussed above, which expressly requires
   downstream scope 3 GHG emissions to be assessed for all coal projects.22 Thus,
   although the case did not ultimately prevent the mine from going ahead, it had
   a disruptive effect by generating pressure for development in associated doctrinal
   and policy frameworks. This is significant, as it illustrates the potential for climate
   litigation in administrative law to disrupt regulations and government policy.

                                     c) Flawed Reasoning Processes

   Another potential ground of review for challenging administrative decisions on
   climate grounds is legal unreasonableness, including serious irrationality or
   illogicality. Reasonableness in administrative law is `inherently sensitive to context'
   and `cannot be reduced to a formulary'.23 Unreasonableness has been variously
   described as decisions or conduct that are arbitrary, capricious, illogical, irrational,
   unjust24 or that lack `an evident and intelligible justification'.25 These words and
   phrases should not be viewed as different categories of unreasonableness,26 but rather
   as useful markers.

   Despite an expansion of the scope of unreasonableness review in the last decade,27
   unreasonableness is difficult to establish and often remains a ground of `last resort'.28
   There is also a significant risk that unreasonableness review will descend into merits
   review. Indeed, `of all the jurisdictional error grounds, none is more fraught with the

   possibility of impermissible transgression by the judicial branch into the constitutional
   remit of the executive branch than unreasonableness'.29

   Although unreasonableness is often a ground of last resort, in the case of Bushfire
   Survivors for Climate Action v Narrabri Coal Operations,30 the sole basis of the
   applicant's judicial review challenge against the IPC's grant of development consent
   for the Narrabri coalmine expansion was that the decision was legally unreasonable.
   The judicial review challenge was ultimately unsuccessful, with the NSW Land and
   Environment Court ruling that the IPC's approval of the coalmine expansion was
   legally reasonable even though the project will emit the equivalent of Australia's
   total annual carbon dioxide emissions.31 The court considered that a finding of legal
   unreasonableness in this instance would involve engaging in a `substitution of the
   Court's determination of the merits of the Application -- such is not open in
   proceedings such as these'.32

   The Federal Court case of Environment Council of Central Queensland Inc v Minister
   for the Environment and Water (No 2)33 further exemplifies these limits in the context
   of climate litigation. The case involved challenges to the federal environment
   Minister's findings that decisions on new or expanded coalmines can legally exclude
   assessment of their climate impacts under the EPBC Act. The applicant argued that
   the Minister's reasoning was flawed in multiple respects, including that it was legally
   irrational.34 The Federal Court rejected all the applicant's appeal grounds, and
   emphasised the limited role of courts in judicial review in assessing the Minister's
   reasoning. As McElwaine J observed:

               [T]his Court is not concerned with the merits of the Minister's decision. The
               judicial function is a limited one. The question is not whether the Minister

               made the correct or preferable decision on the merits or whether this Court
               disagrees with the outcome. To succeed, the applicant must demonstrate
               that the Minister erred in her understanding of the nature or the limits
               of the statutory power or, as contended in the proceedings, made legally
               irrational findings. ... It was legally open to the Minister to weigh and
               assess the applicant's material and submissions cognisant of the potentially
               catastrophic effects of climate change on MNES. The Minister in
               discharging what is clearly a heavy responsibility was not obliged to reason
               in the manner contended by the applicant. Ultimately, the applicant's
               arguments, anchored by the extensive scientific material relied on, raise
               matters for Parliament to consider whether the Minister's powers must be
               exercised to explicitly consider the anthropogenic effects of climate change
               in the manner the applicant submits they must.35

   We consider that the court's strict adherence to the legality/merits divide in this case
   foreclosed opportunities for either legal disruption or development. As noted above,
   the EPBC Act does not explicitly require consideration of climate impacts in assessing
   projects, raising the question of whether legislative reform is needed to address this
   gap.

                                                  KEY QUESTION

                      Should the EPBC Act be reformed to require consideration of
                        climate impacts in assessing projects?

   2.1.3. Procedural Impropriety
   Finally, the category of procedural impropriety encompasses a failure by a decision-
   maker to comply with a procedure required by statute. There is a legal error if
   procedures a statute specifies need to be observed in the making of a decision were
   not observed. Not all breaches of procedures required by statute will invalidate a

                                                                                                                                                                  304

   decision; rather, the key question is: do the subject matter, scope and purpose of the
   Act indicate that it was a purpose of the legislation that an act done in breach of
   the relevant procedural provision should render the decision invalid?36 For decisions
   regarding development applications, a statutory requirement for the preparation of
   an environmental impact assessment (EIA) is likely to be construed as a necessary
   precondition to a valid decision to approve a development.

   For example, in Gray v Minister for Planning, discussed above, the EIA for the
   proposed Anvil Hill coalmine was held to be inadequate, as it failed to assess the
   impact of downstream GHG emissions caused by the burning of the coal. Accordingly,
   it did not adequately satisfy the EIA requirements prescribed by the Director-General
   under pt 3A of the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 (NSW).
   However, the procedural nature of EIA mechanisms do not prescribe particular
   outcomes. This means that if procedural EIA requirements have been met, or are
   subsequently rectified after judicial review, a project may proceed even if the EIA
   process shows that the project will have adverse climate change impacts. The ultimate
   outcome of a successful judicial review application may thus be an extension of
   the initial environmental assessment undertaken, or reconsideration by the original
   decision-maker, even if the final outcome is substantively similar or unchanged.37

   Administrative law challenges on climate-related grounds most commonly pertain to
   decisions under environmental and planning laws, but they do on occasion relate to
   decisions made under other types of legislation. For example, in The Environment
   Centre NT Inc v Minister for Resources and Water (No 2),38 an environmental group
   sought judicial review of decisions of the Minister for Resources and Water providing
   for grants to an oil and gas company for exploratory drilling under the Public
   Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013 (Cth) (the PGPA Act). There
   were two relevant grounds raised relating to climate change. The first was that the
   minister failed to make reasonable inquiries in respect of climate change and climate
   change impacts and as a result failed to comply with s 71(1) of the PGPA Act. This

   section prohibits expenditure of relevant money unless the Minister is satisfied, after
   making reasonable inquiries, that the expenditure would be of proper use.39 The second
   was that by failing to have adequate regard to climate change and climate change
   risks, the Minister's decisions were legally unreasonable, illogical or irrational.40 The
   first ground is an example of procedural impropriety as it pertains to failing to follow
   procedural rules set out in legislation. The second ground is an example of the
   irrationality category, discussed above.

   Although the court upheld a challenge to one of the impugned decisions on other
   grounds, neither of the applicant's grounds relating to climate change was successful.
   The court found that the requirement in s 71(1) of the PGPA Act for `reasonable
   inquiries' to be made before determining whether expenditure of public money would
   be a proper use of that money involved the subjective, self-directed assessment of
   the Minister as to what inquiries were reasonable.41 Moreover, the court rejected
   the applicant's claim that the Minister failed to consider climate change risks when
   deciding whether the project expenditure was a proper use of money, as the Minister
   was only required to be satisfied that granting funds to the project was a proper use of
   money in the context of the program.42 Similarly, in relation to the second ground, the
   court was not convinced that the making of the statutory instrument or the approval
   decision were legally unreasonable due to the Minister's alleged failure to consider
   climate change and its associated risks.43

   In relation to both unsuccessful grounds of review, the court was mindful of the
   legality/merits divide and the importance of not encroaching on merits review.
   Regarding the first ground, Griffiths J in the Federal Court noted that `there is
   considerable force in the Commonwealth's submission that the applicant's position
   threatens to draw the Court into a form of merits-based assessment of Ministerial

   expenditure decisions across the full gamut of Commonwealth policy areas'.44
   Similarly, in relation to the legal unreasonableness claim, Griffiths J opined that
   the argument that climate change risks were significant and directly relevant to the
   minister's decision `reveals disagreement with the merits of the Approval Decision,
   not legal unreasonableness'.45 Thus, despite the novel interpretation of the legislative
   provisions presented by the applicant, there was limited scope for legal disruption due
   to the court's adherence to the constitutionally entrenched separation of judicial power.

                        challenges of successful climate litigation in administrative law.
                        Brainstorm some of the other practical considerations that might
                        influence a potential applicant's decision as to whether it is
                        feasible to initiate an administrative law challenge on climate
                        grounds. What might be the role and limitations of environmental
                        public interest litigation in this context?

  2.2. Merits Review

   In contrast, merits review has a wider scope than judicial review, which may allow
   climate change to have a more disruptive impact on existing doctrines.46 While judicial
   review focuses on the lawfulness of an administrative decision, merits review involves
   the reconsideration of the facts, law and policy aspects to determine the correct and
   preferable decision.47 In merits review, the tribunal or court conducting the review re-
   exercises the same power as the original decision-maker. The merits review avenue is
   frequently provided for in statutes, but notably there is no provision for merits review

   under the EPBC Act. However, merits review is provided for in some state-based
   environmental legislation, and it has on occasion facilitated successful challenges of
   administrative decisions on climate change grounds.

                                                  KEY QUESTION
                      Merits review appeal rights are limited in many statutes and

                        jurisdictions. Should they be more readily available, particularly in
                        environmental and planning legislation?

   For instance, in the case of Gloucester Resources v Minister for Planning (`Gloucester
   Case'),48 Preston CJ of the NSW Land and Environment Court undertook a merits
   review of a government decision to refuse an application for the `Rocky Hill Mine
   Project'.49 This was an important case in which an Australian court rejected a coalmine
   application, in part due to climate change impacts. The case took the form of a merits
   review under div 8.3 of the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 (NSW),
   which provides that the court can exercise all the functions and directions available to
   the original decision-maker when reviewing development approval decisions.

   Preston CJ ultimately dismissed the appeal on the basis that the negative impacts of
   the project, including the climate change impacts, outweighed the other public benefits
   of the project.50 In his judgment, Preston CJ stated:

               In short, an open cut coal mine in this part of the Gloucester valley would
               be in the wrong place at the wrong time. Wrong place because an open
               cut coal mine in this scenic and cultural landscape, proximate to many
               people's homes and farms, will cause significant planning, amenity, visual
               and social impacts. Wrong time because the GHG emissions of the coal mine

                                                                                                                                                                  308

               and its coal product will increase global total concentrations of GHGs at a
               time when what is now urgently needed, in order to meet generally agreed
               climate targets, is a rapid and deep decrease in GHG emissions. These dire
               consequences should be avoided. The Project should be refused.51

   Although the principal reason for refusing the mine on the basis of significant and
   unacceptable planning, visual and social impacts is not in itself disruptive, Preston
   CJ's reasoning on the `market substitution' argument arguably is. This argument is
   based on the premise that refusing coalmine projects due to their GHG emissions may
   not achieve overall emissions reductions, as the avoided emissions will be generated or
   substituted elsewhere.52 In Gloucester, Preston CJ considered and rejected this market
   substitution argument.53 He noted that `[t]he potential for a hypothetical but uncertain
   alternative development to cause some unacceptable environmental impact is not a
   reason to approve a definite development that will certainly cause the unacceptable
   environmental impacts'.54 This reasoning has influenced subsequent decisions; for
   example, the NSW IPC's rejection of the Bylong Coal Project in September 2019,
   discussed above, was based on similar reasoning to Preston CJ in Gloucester,
   including rejection of the market substitution argument.55

   Administrative challenges before decisions about mining lease approvals are made can
   also facilitate closer scrutiny of claims made in EIAs. For example, the Land Court
   of Queensland has a role in hearing objections to mining leases and other approvals
   before a decision is made by the ultimate decision-maker. In an objections hearing in
   Adani Mining v Land Services of Coast and Country,56 the Land Services of Coast
   and Country challenged the granting of mining leases and environmental authorities in
   respect of the Carmichael coalmine. The court concluded that certain evidence about

   the financial and economic benefit of the mine in the environmental impact statement
   (EIS) was overstated. Specifically, while the EIS estimated the number of Queensland
   jobs generated by the mine alone to be over 10,000 full-time equivalent (FTE) jobs per
   annum by 2024, the correct figures, based on expert evidence before the court, were
   that the mine project would increase average annual employment by 1,206 FTE jobs
   in Queensland and 1,464 FTE jobs in Australia.57 The court drew this information to
   the attention of the Minister who was the ultimate decision-maker for the mining lease
   and environmental authority decisions.58
   In sum, the wider scope of merits review provides the reviewing body with broader
   review powers. As a result, climate change may have a more disruptive impact on the
   development of legal reasoning, as seen in the Gloucester Case. This is supported by
   international climate litigation trends identified by Setzer and Higham; namely, that
   54 per cent of relevant procedural decisions made on merits had successful outcomes
   favourable to climate change action.59

 3. Future Trajectories of Administrative Law: Climate
 Litigation and Regulatory Evolution

  The above analysis considers the perspective that, at least in the context of judicial
  review, there is limited scope for climate-related legal disruption to administrative
  law doctrine, particularly as the existing law is strongly shaped by separation of
  powers constraints. This is unsurprising given the general limits of achieving systemic
  change through judicial review.1 Nevertheless, at times administrative law challenges
  can play an important role in catalysing regulatory and policy reform to address
  climate change.2 This is significant, as an increase in regulation and policies requiring
  consideration of climate change in decision-making may lead to a rise in successful
  climate litigation and vice versa.3 In this section, we consider climate litigation cases
  from Australia, the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States (US)4 that have
  generated pressure for evolution in regulatory and policy frameworks.

  Climate litigation in administrative law can create impetus for development in policy
  guidelines to ensure administrative decision-makers adequately consider climate
  change. For example, in Bushfire Survivors for Climate Action Incorporated v
  Environment Protection Authority,5 a climate action group sought an order in the
  nature of mandamus to compel the NSW Environmental Protection Authority's
  (EPA) performance of a duty to regulate GHG emissions under the Protection of

   the Environment Operations Act 1997 (NSW) (the PEOA). In the NSW Land and
   Environment Court, Preston CJ held that there was a failure to perform a public duty
   and ordered the NSW EPA to `develop environmental quality objectives, guidelines
   and policies to ensure environment protection from climate change' under s 9(1)(a) of
   the PEOA.6 Therefore, even in instances where legislation does not enshrine climate
   change as a relevant consideration for administrative decisions, it may still be open to
   the judiciary to require government to develop policies to address these limitations.

   Similarly, in the US, climate litigation has played an important role in shaping
   regulatory responses to climate change.7 The Obama administration justified
   significant regulation of motor vehicle and power plant emissions under the US
   Clean Air Act in response to the US Supreme Court's landmark 2007 decision in
   Massachusetts v EPA.8 The substantive legal issue in this case9 was a statutory
   interpretation question as to whether the EPA had the authority to regulate GHG
   emissions from motor vehicles under s 202 of the Clean Air Act.10 The Supreme
   Court concluded that the provisions of the Clean Air Act, while not specifically
   referencing fossil fuel burning, were sufficiently broad to confer statutory power
   on the EPA to regulate GHG emissions from new motor vehicles.11 In response to
   the Supreme Court's decision in Massachusetts v EPA, the Obama administration
   introduced regulations to limit GHG emissions from motor vehicles and stationary
   sources such as power plants.12 Although many of these Obama administration

 9. This case also involved an unusual standing issue, with the US Supreme Court ultimately holding that the State of
       Massachusetts had standing to challenge the EPA's denial of its petition to regulate GHG emissions under the Clean
       Air Act. The Court held that Massachusetts had standing as it suffered an injury as a result of the emissions as it was
       the owner of the coastal land which would be affected by storms and sea level rise associated with climate change:

   regulations were subsequently rolled back under the Trump administration,13 this case
   exemplifies climate litigation that directly catalysed regulatory reform.

   A recent example of a UK administrative law case that led to policy reform was
   R (on the application of Friends of the Earth) v Secretary of State for Business,
   Energy and Industrial Strategy.14 This judicial review case was premised on the
   argument that the Secretary of State failed to comply with ss 13 and 14 of the Climate
   Change Act 2008 when reaching certain conclusions in the government's economy-
   wide decarbonisation plan, the `Net Zero Strategy'.15 Section 13 imposes a duty on the
   Secretary of State to prepare policies and proposals to enable the carbon budgets as per
   the Climate Change Act to be met, and s 14 provides that the Secretary must produce
   a report to Parliament setting out policies and proposals for meeting the budgetary
   periods as soon as practicable after setting a carbon budget.16 The applicants claimed
   that the Secretary was not entitled to reach the conclusion that the proposals in the
   Net Zero Strategy would enable the carbon budgets to be met as per s 13, and that he
   did not include information legally required to discharge reporting obligations under
   s 14, including omitting explanations of how the proposals would allow the carbon
   budget to be met.17 The High Court of Justice held that the Secretary lacked the legally
   required information to adopt the Net Zero Strategy and did not take into account
   the risk that policies would not achieve the statutory carbon budget as required under
   s 13 of the Climate Change Act.18 The s 14 ground was also upheld by the court,
   with some exceptions.19 Importantly, the court required the government to produce, re-
   approve and publish a revised and improved strategy by March 2023.20 This case thus

4. Conclusion

This chapter has invited you to reflect on why climate change is not significantly
disrupting well-established Australian administrative law doctrines, particularly
through the avenue of judicial review. It suggests that these trends are unsurprising in
light of the legality/merits divide against the backdrop of Australia's constitutionally
entrenched separation of powers. There is, however, greater evidence of legal
disruption in merits review cases such as Gloucester. Moreover, the significance
of climate litigation extends beyond the courtroom as an important mechanism for
catalysing regulatory and policy change, both in Australia and relevant comparator
jurisdictions such as the US and the UK. Although the disruptive impacts of climate
change on administrative law doctrine are relatively limited to date, this chapter
considers that climate litigation is playing an important role in creating pressure
for regulatory evolution in Australia and internationally. These challenges and
opportunities are important to consider in weighing the desirability of pursuing a
climate-related action in administrative law compared to other legal pathways.

Climate Change and Company Law

The company is the primary vehicle for conducting business in Australia and in many
countries around the world. Companies are involved in a wide range of activities that
contribute to climate change through associated greenhouse gas (`GHG') emissions,
including resource extraction, production, manufacturing and transport. The business
activities of companies are also increasingly impacted by climate change -- by its
physical effects (such as extreme events and longer-term changes to resource
availability) and by the legal, policy, technological and market shifts that are occurring
in response to climate change.
Company law is concerned with the formation and regulation of companies as business

                                                                 317
                                                                                                                                                             318

entities and their governance. It does not directly regulate business activities which
contribute to climate change, or business responses to climate change. However,
company law has a significant indirect influence on both.

For example, climate change is widely recognised as a financially material risk for
companies, enlivening obligations under company law to identify, disclose and
manage these risks. The way in which companies approach climate risk management
can help to reorient business activities and investment away from high-emitting,
climate-damaging activities. Investors and civil society are increasingly engaging with
company law to influence the approach that companies take to climate change, using
member resolutions and strategic litigation to pressure companies to shift away from
high-risk business models. Corporate regulators are also establishing standards and
guidance for climate risk disclosure and management, actively monitoring company
performance, particularly disclosure practices that may be misleading or deceptive
(greenwashing) and taking enforcement action.

                                             KEY QUESTIONS

       To understand the complex relationship between company law and climate
       change, this chapter invites you to consider two underlying questions:

                  How is climate change relevant to the legal obligations of
                    companies and their directors and officers set out in company
                    law?

                  How is company law relevant to society's response to climate
                    change? Does it facilitate, or does it impede, timely and effective
                    responses to climate change?

In this chapter, we consider these questions by exploring the way in which climate
change intersects with three core areas of company law: directors' duties, the rights of
shareholders as members and disclosure. We also engage with long-running debates
about the role and purpose of the company in society and the potential of company law
reform to shift the organisation and regulation of business away from existing models

focused on short-term profit generation, which contribute to social and environmental
harms like climate change, towards more sustainable models.

 1. Introducing Company Law and Climate Change

 1.1. Companies and Company Law

  Company law is primarily concerned with:

            the establishment and legal personhood of different forms of company;
            the internal governance of companies, including the allocation of roles,

              responsibilities and liabilities between company management (the board of
              directors, supported by officers) and shareholders (as members); and
            the relationship between companies and external stakeholders, such as
              creditors who provide capital to companies through debt.

  Although there are many forms of business organisation -- including sole
  proprietorship, partnerships and business trusts -- the company1 has become the
  dominant form for incorporated businesses in Australia2 and in most other countries.
  The modern company is an abstract entity, recognised by law as an autonomous
  legal person even though it does not take a physical form. It is endowed with legal
  personhood -- a company can buy and sell property, borrow money, bring legal
  proceedings and be subject to legal proceedings. It also enjoys perpetual succession,
  meaning that it can continue to exist despite a change in membership. Importantly
  it also shields those who benefit from the company' activities -- its officers and
  shareholders -- from liability for its debts.

1. There are different types of companies, including public companies (generally larger entities, which may be allowed to
      list securities on the stock exchange, where they can raise funds by selling equity and debt instruments); proprietary (or
      private) companies (owned and controlled by a smaller number of shareholders, and mostly used by small businesses
      though large businesses held by a small number of shareholders also use this company form); and state-owned
      companies (majority owned by government, often created to provide essential services and infrastructure). Business
      entities often also group together through complex contractual or ownership arrangements across jurisdictions to
      facilitate access to labour and raw materials and to take advantage of more favourable regulatory environments
      (multinational enterprises).

                                                                   320

  A company is often described as being `owned' by its shareholders, although the
  actual legal relationship is more complex.3 Shareholders are generally not liable for the
  debts of the company (limited liability) beyond the value of their shares. Ownership
  rights and management rights are split in relation to companies. The board of directors
  manages, or oversees the management of, the company (separation of ownership
  and management). Board members in turn are generally appointed by the general
  meeting (`GM') of members -- that is, those shareholders who are registered as
  members.4 Members are often passive investors who may not actively participate in
  GMs, especially in large companies.

  These core features of the modern company -- particularly limited liability and
  separation of ownership and management -- provide the structural foundation for
  capitalist market economies. The economic model assumes that social benefits come
  through economic growth, which is best served by more efficient and profitable
  businesses and stable, fair and competitive markets. Companies are vehicles to
  facilitate the investment of capital to expand production and consumption and thereby
  drive economic growth -- with relatively low risk for those who govern and those
  who directly profit from a company's activities and in-built protections for market
  actors that interact with companies, such as creditors, suppliers and insurers, which
  often provide the main working capital of the company through debt and financing
  instruments. An economic system predicated on unlimited growth, which fails to
  adequately factor accountability for social and environmental harms into the price of
  production and consumption, and which operates beyond the biophysical limits of the
  planet, is also the root cause of problems like global climate change.5

  Company law does not directly regulate the business activities of companies, which

3. Strictly speaking, shareholders do not own the company. Rather, they own shares in the company, and these provide
      them with rights as set out in the company's constitution and law. Such rights may include, eg, a right to a specified
      proportion of the company's share capital, voting rights in the GM and rights to share in declared dividends. Share
      ownership may also include obligations -- eg, the obligation to pay calls on partly paid shares.

4. Some companies, eg, companies limited by guarantee used primarily by not-for-profit entities, do not issue shares but
      do have members that provide guarantees to provide limited financing to the company, especially in insolvency. These
      companies therefore only have members and not shareholders.

      modern corporation within these models, see further: Sally Wheeler, `The Corporation and the Anthropocene' in Louis

  contribute to environmental and social harms like climate change. Indeed, in capitalist
  market economics, problems such as climate change are typically treated as market
  `externalities', which are regulated directly (whether more or less effectively) through
  substantive climate laws that constrain harmful business activities.6 Examples include
  environmental licensing regimes for high-emitting activities, or taxation or emissions
  trading to price GHG pollution.

  However, it is important to recognise that company law itself -- foundational as it is
  to capitalist market economies -- is a significant, albeit indirect, determinant of how
  companies respond to climate change and can therefore significantly impact society's
  response to climate change, particularly where substantive climate law is weak or
  lacking. In this chapter, we encourage you to think about the relationship between
  company law and climate change in two dimensions:

            How is climate change relevant to the legal obligations of companies and
              their directors established by company law?

            How is company law relevant to society's response to climate change?
              Does it facilitate, or does it impede, timely and effective responses to
              climate change?

 1.2. How is Climate Change Relevant to Company Law?

  To explore this question, we focus on three core areas of company law (as set out
  in the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) and the general law): directors' duties, member
  (shareholder) rights and meetings, and disclosure and reporting. Our particular focus
  is on large, investor-owned public companies.

  Directors' Duties
  Company directors, as members of the board of directors, play a pivotal role in
  setting the strategy of a company and monitoring its management. The board has
  a significant influence over which business lines are pursued by companies, how
  companies allocate capital and resources and how they manage assets over time.

      Ecological Approach to Regulatory Studies?' (2018) 45(1) Journal of Law and Society, 136-55.
     323

   Company law sets out the legal duties of directors that apply to their office, powers
   and functions. Most of these obligations also apply to officers of the company, but this
   discussion focuses on company directors.

   For example, the duty of good faith requires directors to exercise their powers and
   discharge their duties in good faith, in the best interests of the company and for a
   proper purpose.7 Older Australian cases interpret the `best interests of the company' to
   mean the `best interests of the shareholders as a general body'.8 However, courts have
   also found that the best interests of the company can be broader than the interests of
   shareholders. For example, when a company is insolvent or sliding into insolvency,
   the best interests of the company should be determined with reference to the interests
   of the creditors, not the shareholders.9 Further, directors are permitted (and may indeed
   be advised) to consider the interests of non-shareholder stakeholders and related social
   and environmental considerations (like climate change) if this is undertaken in the
   context of acting in the company's long-term interests, including with a view of
   avoiding reputational harm.10

   Also relevant is the duty of due care and diligence, which requires directors to
   exercise their powers and discharge their duties with the degree of care and diligence
   that a reasonable director in their position would exercise.11 This includes informing
   themselves of foreseeable risks to the company's interests and adopting proportionate
   measures to manage such risks.12 In discharging this duty, directors are granted some

   discretion to exercise their judgment in making business decisions, which often
   involve complex risk calculations. The business judgment rule provides a defence for
   a director who acts, or decides not to act, based on an informed, rational assessment
   of the company's best interests.13 Where climate change poses material risks to a
   company, its directors are understood to have legal duties to identify, disclose and take
   steps to manage these risks, as part of their duty of care and diligence.14

   Importantly, these legal duties are owed by directors to the company itself. The
   corporate regulator -- the Australian Securities and Investments Commission
   (`ASIC') -- can bring an enforcement action for breach of duty, with a range of civil
   and criminal penalties available.15 The company, or the company's liquidator, can
   apply to the court for a compensation order for breach of duty.16 Members can also
   seek leave of the court to bring a derivative action against directors for breach of duty
   on behalf of the company.17

   As we discuss in part 2, a series of influential legal opinions have articulated the
   evolving standard of care expected of company directors in relation to climate change.
   Strategic litigants are also seeking to enforce directors' duties as a pathway to compel
   companies to address climate change in a timely fashion.

   Member Rights and Meetings

   Reflecting the separation of ownership and management in the company form,
   company law makes a clear distinction between two spheres of decision-making. The
   board of directors is empowered to manage the affairs of the company (eg staffing,
   finance or investment decisions) whereas the general meeting (GM) of members
   (shareholders who are registered on the members' register of the company) have
   certain control rights over the company and can, for example, make decisions to

   appoint or remove directors, or to change the company constitution.18 The boards
   of public companies are furthermore compelled to report to members by tabling
   an annual financial report, directors' report and auditor's report at the annual GM
   (`AGM') (see further below).19

   While members have specific statutory rights to requisition a GM20 and to bring a
   resolution to the meeting,21 these rights are constrained by the strict division of powers
   between the board of directors and GM of members. Members cannot requisition, or
   put a resolution to, a GM if the subject is a matter of management exclusively vested
   in the board.22 Unlike other jurisdictions, like the United States (`US') and United
   Kingdom (`UK'), there is no express provision for non-binding advisory member
   resolutions in Australia, through which members can express their views on how
   directors might exercise their powers.23

   Members also vote annually on the company's executive remuneration report, which
   includes the salaries and bonuses for directors and executives. If more than 25% of the
   members vote against this report at consecutive annual meetings, then the entire board
   faces a `spill' motion. If the spill motion passes by a simple majority, directors will be
   required to stand for re-election.24

       least 5% of the votes or number at least 100 members.

   superannuation funds are using member resolutions and voting on the appointment of
   directors and their remuneration to pressure companies on their approach to climate
   change, even within this comparatively restrictive legal framework.

   Disclosure and Reporting

   One of the key functions of company law is to ensure that adequate information
   on the financial position of companies is provided to market stakeholders to inform
   and support their decision-making, particularly in relation to the allocation of capital.
   Accordingly, companies are subject to various disclosure obligations, including the
   preparation of an annual report, which includes the company's financial statements
   and the directors' report discussing business strategy and prospects.25 Financial
   reporting in Australia is informed by accounting standards adopted by the Australian
   Accounting Standards Setting Board (`AASB'), which are based on international
   standards.26

   A key focus of company reporting is identifying and quantifying any financially
   material risks to the business. Such risks should be discussed in the directors' report27
   and reflected in the financial statements and any notes to the statements.28 According
   to the AASB, information is considered to be material `if omitting, misstating or
   obscuring it could reasonably be expected to influence the decisions that the primary
   users (potential investors, creditors or lenders) of financial statements make on the
   basis of those financial statements.'29

25. Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) s 292-5. These duties extend to all public companies, large proprietary companies and
       registrable superannuation entities. Small proprietary companies may also be subject to such a duty -- eg, when
       directed by ASIC or 5% of their members to do so (ss 292(2), 293, 294).

       Disclosure in an Operating and Financial Review (Regulatory Guide 247, August 2019), which states that `it is likely
       to be misleading to discuss prospects for future financial years without referring to the material business risks that
       could adversely affect the achievement of the financial prospects described for those years' [RG247:62].

   Directors and auditors must sign off on the financial statements to confirm they
   accord with prescribed accounting standards and present a `true and fair view' of
   the company's financial position and performance.30 Conduct (including disclosure)
   which is misleading or deceptive, or which is likely to mislead or deceive, is
   prohibited.31 Representations made about future matters which lack a reasonable basis
   will be taken to be misleading,32 and in such cases a court may impose civil liability or
   order injunctive relief.33

   There is now broad recognition that climate change poses financial risks to companies
   across the economy and that information on the potential impacts of climate change
   on a company's financial position, performance and prospects is therefore decision-
   useful and material to a reasonable investor.34 This has the effect of enlivening legal
   obligations to disclose climate-related financial risks in the annual report, both within
   the management commentary in the directors' report and within the financial
   statements.

   In part 2, we note significant recent developments in relation to climate risk disclosure,
   including pressure from investors to adopt voluntary best practice standards, increased
   scrutiny and guidance from corporate regulators, and most recently, the introduction
   of mandatory climate reporting standards.

  1.3. How is Company Law Relevant to Society's Response
  to Climate Change?

   The three areas of company law discussed above can all indirectly influence company
   behaviour in relation to climate change.

   For example, directors' duties can influence whether and how social and
   environmental issues like climate change are considered by directors, how directors
   balance competing considerations (short-term versus long-term interests and
   shareholders versus external stakeholders) and to whom directors are held
   accountable. This is particularly important when short-term, profit-driven
   considerations conflict with longer-term considerations of the social and
   environmental impacts of decisions on company value and reputation. These are
   pertinent questions for many companies engaged in climate-damaging business
   activities such as fossil fuel extraction and production. If directors' duties are
   interpreted to oblige them to maximise profits for shareholders in the short term, they
   will have little scope and incentive to take account of the social and environmental
   impacts of company activities (shareholder primacy).35 If they have discretion to
   consider the interests of a broader group of parties either affected by the company
   or with a stake in the company and some influence over its success, or are required
   or incentivised to do so, they may make decisions which contribute positively to
   addressing climate change (stakeholder capitalism).36

   As significant shareholders, institutional investors like superannuation funds can play
   a role in stewarding investee companies in relation to climate change and other
   environmental and social issues. Member resolutions and voting provide tools for
   investors to engage with and escalate pressure on companies and their directors in
   relation to these issues.37 These tools can help to focus company attention on climate
   change and incentivise companies to develop, disclose or better defend their approach
   to relevant risks and impacts.

   It is important to understand the underlying drivers for investors to engage with these

35. See, eg, Beate Sjfjell and Mark Taylor, `A Clash of Norms: Shareholder Primacy vs. Sustainable Corporate Purpose'
       (2019) 13(3) International and Comparative Corporate Law Journal 40-66. These authors argue that `shareholder
       primacy' has become a pervasive social norm and legal myth, with widespread influence over the interpretation of
       legal duties set out in company law.

       and Directors' Duties: Law, Theory and Evidence' (2012) 35(1) UNSW Law Journal 291, 292-3.

       risk management and a deliberate extension of the `divest or engage' binary, see Clara McDonnell and Joyeeta Gupta,

   tools. For diversified and universal investors38 such as superannuation funds, which
   hold shares in companies across all sectors of the economy, financial returns depend
   on the overall performance of the economy, not just the profits of an individual
   asset.39 Further, superannuation funds typically manage assets over long timeframes
   (with the purpose of providing a retirement income to beneficiaries). Such investors
   therefore have a financial imperative and implied legal duty to mitigate sustainability-
   related systemic risks through their allocation of capital and their stewardship of
   investee companies.40 In theory, such investors should therefore place expectations
   on individual companies to disclose information about the environmental impacts of
   their operations that threaten the stability of the economy and to take reasonable steps
   to address these impacts. However, the financial imperative to address sustainability-
   related systemic risks is not fully understood across the financial sector.41 Further,
   like companies themselves, institutional investors face many pressures to prioritise
   short-term investment returns over longer-term considerations, which will impact their
   decisions on capital allocation and stewardship.

   Finally, reporting and disclosure can draw internal attention to climate risks and
   impacts, which may incentivise companies to take steps to address these. Reporting
   also provides information on a company's risk exposure, management and
   performance to external actors -- such as investors, lenders, civil society -- who
   may use this in their decision-making and advocacy, thereby also influencing the
   company. Yet the impact of information instruments on company behaviour depends
   heavily on what a company is required to report. For example, if companies are only
   required to disclose climate-related financial risks to the company and not report on
   their GHG emissions and other harmful climate impacts, they may have less incentive

       (financial) outcomes for their beneficiaries is explained and debated in these recent articles: Alasdair Docherty,

   to take timely steps to reduce emissions and adverse impacts. If climate risks are
   only discussed in the management commentary of the annual report or indeed outside
   the annual report, this may have less impact on decision-making than if these risks
   are covered in the annual report with quantification in the financial statements. If
   companies are not required to follow a specific reporting standard, which allows for
   comparison across other business entities in the same industry and for measuring
   performance over time, information can be more easily obscured or omitted and will
   not necessarily be decision-useful for investors and other stakeholders.

   Before we turn to a more detailed consideration of the interaction of these areas of
   company law with climate change, we invite you to explore some recent academic
   literature which scrutinises the influence that company law can have on social and
   environmental harms like climate change.42

                                                 KEY QUESTIONS

                      Do you agree with the proposition that company law is climate
                        law?

                      Of the three focus areas considered in this chapter (directors'
                        duties, member rights and meetings, reporting and disclosure),
                        which area of company law has the most influence over a
                        company's approach to climate change? Are there other areas of
                        company law that are also influential?

                      In what ways does company law allow or disallow, incentivise or
                        disincentivise, and require or prohibit companies and their
                        directors to consider climate change in company decision-

 2. Developments in Company Law in Response to
 Climate Change

  Since the international Paris Agreement of 2015,1 there have been many significant
  developments in company law in response to climate change, triggered by the
  recognition that climate change poses financially material risks to company interests
  (and broader systemic risks to economic systems) and therefore enlivens legal
  obligations to disclose and manage these risks. Over time, the focus has shifted to how
  companies should approach climate risk management, with institutional investors and
  other stakeholders pressuring companies to align their risk management to the goals of
  the Paris Agreement.2

 2.1. Directors' Duties

  There has been a lively debate in Australia regarding the way in which directors'
  duties, particularly the duty of care and diligence, apply to climate change. Although
  this has not yet been tested by the courts, there is consensus among leading
  commercial law barristers,3 regulators4 and industry bodies5 on the general point that

1. UNFCCC, `Report of the Conference of the Parties on its Twenty-first Session, held in Paris from 30 November to 13
      December 2015' UN Doc FCCC/CP/2015/10/Add.1, Annex -- Paris Agreement (Paris Agreement).

2. The central goal of the Paris Agreement is to limit global warming to well below 2 캜 above pre-industrial temperatures
      (and pursue efforts to limit warming to 1.5캜 above pre-industrial temperatures) to avoid dangerous climate change
      (art 2.1(a)). In support of this temperature goal, article 4.1 provides that state parties aim to achieve `a balance between
      anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of GHG in the second half of this century', thereby setting
      a goal of carbon neutrality.

  company directors, as part of their duty of care and diligence, are required to inform
  themselves of foreseeable risks posed to company interests by climate change and
  take proportionate measures to manage these risks. A series of legal opinions from
  prominent commercial law barristers Noel Hutley and Sebastian Hartford-Davis have
  helped to articulate the evolving standard of care in relation to climate-related risks.

  In their first legal opinion, published in 2016,6 Hutley and Hartford-Davis recognised
  the increasing evidence of the extent and foreseeability of climate risks for a range of
  companies in different sectors and argued that the duty of care and diligence obliged
  directors to identify and assess these risks where they were material to the company.
  Directors who failed to perceive, disclose or take steps in relation to foreseeable
  climate-related risks that could be demonstrated to have caused harm to the company
  were cautioned about increasing liability risk. The opinion noted that while in some
  cases directors should take further actions to manage material climate-related risks,
  the duty did not necessarily require directors to act in a particular way.7 In 2019, a
  supplementary opinion drew attention to emerging policy developments, increasing
  investor and community expectations, and scientific projections, which evidenced that
  climate risks may manifest in the short to medium term, and which therefore elevated
  the standard of care expected of a reasonable director.8 The opinion concluded:
  `company directors who consider climate change risks actively, disclose them properly
  and respond appropriately will reduce exposure to liability. But as time passes, the
  benchmark is rising'.9

  In 2021, a further update noted that the standard of care expected of directors in
  relation to climate risk continues to rise, and there had been a discernible shift in focus
  from risk identification and assessment to risk management:

              it is no longer safe to assume that directors adequately discharge their duties

               simply by considering and disclosing climate-related trends and risks; in
               relevant sectors, directors of listed companies must also take reasonable
               steps to see that positive action is being taken: to identify and manage
               risks, to design and implement strategies, to select and use appropriate
               standards, to make accurate assessments and disclosures, and to deliver on
               their company's public commitments and targets.10

   In particular, directors should take care to carefully align any public commitments on
   climate change (including net-zero emissions targets) with the company's operational
   strategy, as a failure to do so may expose directors to liability for misleading and
   deceptive conduct.11

   In 2022, following a royal commission into a series of corporate scandals involving
   financial services,12 the Australian Institute of Company Directors commissioned a
   legal opinion from barristers Bret Walker and Gerald Ng, focusing on the duty of
   good faith.13 Although this did not exclusively focus on climate change, the opinion
   is relevant to the way in which directors consider climate change, among other
   `stakeholder' considerations in their decision-making. The opinion confirmed that
   directors have considerable discretion to identify the best interests of the company
   and that while shareholder interests are central, directors can and should consider a
   range of different stakeholder interests. Employees, customers, suppliers, creditors,
   traditional owners, the environment and broader community were all noted as
   legitimate concerns for directors, tied back to the long-term interests of the company,

   including its interest in avoiding reputational harm.14 Further, directors were advised
   to take a long-term view of where the company's interests lie.15

   Litigation seeking to enforce directors' duties as they apply to climate change is
   slowly emerging around the world, referencing both the duty of care and diligence
   and the duty of good faith. A 2023 case brought in the UK against the large energy
   company Shell (dual-listed in the UK and the Netherlands) has important implications
   for Australia.

   In ClientEarth v Shell's Board of Directors, public interest environmental law group
   ClientEarth (which purchased shares in the company) filed a derivative action against
   Shell's board, alleging that the directors were in breach of their duties under UK
   company law, due to a failure to adopt and implement a robust and credible climate
   transition strategy in line with the Paris Agreement.16 Similar to Australia, UK law
   requires directors to promote the success of the company and to act with due care
   and diligence.17 Shareholder plaintiffs require the permission of the court to continue
   a derivative claim, and an application for permission cannot proceed if the court finds
   that there is no prima facie case arising.18

   This case focused on Shell's climate targets and associated strategy, which, at the time,
   included a net-zero emissions plan with a 2050 target. On the basis of independent
   assessments,19 ClientEarth argued that the strategy excluded short- to medium-term

       duty under Australian Corporations Law (Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) s 181) in that it specifically directs company
       directors to consider a range of stakeholder interests, including the impact of the company's operations on the
       community and the environment. See further discussion in part 3.2 (below n 17).

   targets to reduce the companies' scope 3 emissions that equate for 90% of its overall
   emissions20 and that the net emissions of the Shell group were calculated to only fall
   by 5% by 2030.21 Further, the case alleged that Shell's ongoing allocation of capital to
   new oil and gas projects, as well as high reliance (and lack of transparency) on carbon
   capture and storage and use of carbon offsets to meet climate targets, did not establish
   a reasonable basis for achieving the net-zero target. ClientEarth also noted that Shell's
   targets and transition strategy were inconsistent with an order issued by the Hague
   District Court in the Netherlands against Royal Dutch Shell in 2021, which required
   the company to reduce their GHG emissions by a net 45% by 2030 across its own
   operations and scope 3 emissions. In this Dutch case (since appealed), the court found
   Shell's failure to take adequate and proportionate action to curb GHG emissions was
   in breach of the duty of care owed under the Dutch Civil Code and European human
   rights obligations.22

   In May 2023, the UK High Court dismissed ClientEarth's claim, finding that there
   was an insufficient prima facie case to allow the derivative action to proceed;23 this
   decision was confirmed following an oral hearing.24 The court noted that Shell did
   have a plan to manage climate-related risks, and it is for the directors (not the courts)
   to consider how best to promote the success of a company.25 The court also highlighted

       combustion of fossil fuel products by a third party.

       Appeal in the Hague decided that while Shell had a legal duty of care to curb dangerous climate change, it was not
       possible for the court to impose on Shell a specific emissions reduction obligation. For recent commentary on the

       which should go into their consideration of how to deal with climate risk, amongst the many other risks to which
       Shell's business will inevitable be exposed, that no reasonable director could properly have adopted the approach that
       they have.'

   that ClientEarth was a minority shareholder, holding only 27 shares in Shell, that its
   claim was supported by a small fraction of the Shell membership and that the majority
   of the members supported the directors' strategic approach to climate change risk
   (88.4% of the votes cast by members at the 2021 AGM and 80% at the 2022 AGM).26
   These factors suggested to the court that ClientEarth's `real interest is not in how
   best to promote the success of Shell for the benefit of its members as a whole.'27 ...
   [I]t is that (membership) constituency, as a whole, whose views should carry very
   considerable weight when determining how Shell can best manage ... climate change
   risk.'28

   The outcome in the Shell case raises interesting questions about the potential and
   the limits of directors' duties and the use of derivative actions to influence company
   approaches to climate change:

             A focus on material risks at the entity scale: The judgment underscores
               that the duty of care and diligence is focused on material financial risks to
               the company (not the risks and impacts of the company's activities on the
               climate). Directors are provided considerable discretion to respond to such
               risks. Even though financial materiality of climate change is well
               established, there are still gaps between what is material to a company (and
               how a company might manage those risks) and what is needed to meet
               international climate goals and to address the more systemic risks posed by
               climate change. The Shell case suggests that, at least in the UK High
               Court's view, it is reasonably open for directors to decide to continue to
               pursue climate-damaging activities such as new oil and gas developments
               in the short to medium term as part of their business model if they are
               profitable and the financial risks associated with these activities can be
               appropriately managed (eg through sufficient diversification of business

       and complexity of that of Shell will require the Directors to take into account a range of competing considerations, the
       proper balancing of which is a classic management decision with which the court is ill-equipped to interfere.'

               activities and investment of resources and capital in developing alternatives
               over time), even though this is completely at odds with the timely phase out
               of fossil fuels required to achieve the Paris Agreement goals.29
             Short-term shareholder interests dominate: The case also reflects a
               tendency to prioritise shareholder interests (or more specifically, the short-
               term, profit-focused interests of current shareholders above the interests of
               longer-term or even future shareholders) in interpreting the best interests of
               the company. While directors may have permission to make decisions to
               reduce harmful climate impacts if this is beneficial for the company and the
               shareholders in the longer term, this may not be enough to incentivise
               improved climate performance at the extent and pace necessary to achieve
               global climate goals.

                                                            EXERCISE

      After reading the judgments in the Shell case, consider the following questions:
                 How did the court approach the consideration of the company's best
                   interests in determining if there was a prima facie case to answer on a
                   breach of directors' duties?
                   Do you think similar litigation might emerge in Australia?
                 How might judicial assessment of the company's best interests develop
                   over time as the risks and opportunities associated with climate change
                   materialise?

  2.2. Member Rights and Meetings

   Despite the legal hurdles (see part 1.2), member resolutions have been used by activist
   members and institutional investors to pressure Australian companies (especially

29. International Energy Agency, Net Zero by 2050: A Roadmap for the Global Energy Sector (May 2021).
     339

   fossil fuel, energy and finance companies) on their approach to climate change.30
   These resolutions are typically brought in two parts: as a special resolution requesting
   constitutional change to allow non-binding advisory resolutions, and with an
   accompanying advisory resolution addressing the substantive matter in question. This
   approach means that the board is legally required to at least put the constitutional
   change resolution to the GM. Typically, companies have not challenged the legality
   of the accompanying advisory climate resolutions,31 and have published GM voting
   on these, even though the advisory part is not legally effective without a successful
   constitutional change resolution (requiring 75% of the vote).

   Over time, climate resolutions have developed to address a wide range of matters.
   Early resolutions focused on climate risk disclosure, seeking to drive the uptake of
   best practice disclosure standards by Australian companies or to pressure companies
   to address public lobbying activities that were inconsistent with their climate change
   goals.32 More recent resolutions are pressuring companies to set Paris-aligned
   emissions reduction targets accompanied by decarbonisation plans that demonstrate
   alignment of company strategy and capital allocation to these targets,33 to disclose
   liabilities associated with decommissioning oil and gas infrastructure in line with
   Paris-aligned net zero scenarios,34 to disclose how their capital allocation to fossil
   fuel assets aligns with Paris goals35 and to bring forward closure dates for coal assets
   in alignment with Paris goals.36 These more recent resolutions explicitly address the

       constitution are legally ineffective and do not have to be put to shareholders as members in the AGM.

   systemic nature of climate risk and focus on aligning corporate risk management and
   mitigation of corporate climate impacts with the goals of the Paris Agreement.

   Voting on the constitutional change resolutions themselves has remained reasonably
   low over time. However, voting on the accompanying substantive climate change
   resolutions has been significantly higher (albeit variable) as larger institutional
   investors become more active in their engagement on climate change.37

   Certain members have also voted against board-proposed, ordinary resolutions to
   express dissatisfaction with directors' governance on climate change.38 For example,
   a member with a 11.28% interest in AGL (a large Australian energy company)
   nominated four directors with climate risk and energy transition expertise to the
   AGL board at its 2022 AGM. Despite AGL's board recommending that members
   vote against three of the proposed directors, all four directors were elected through
   ordinary resolution.39 At the 2023 AGM of Woodside Energy (a large Australian
   oil and gas company), 35% of members voted against the re-election of one board
   member, with some members justifying their decision to do so due to Woodside's lack
   of commitment to emission reduction targets. Despite most members favouring re-
   election, this action amplified pressure on Woodside's board to oversee and implement
   a Paris-aligned climate strategy.40

   Beyond member resolutions and voting, shareholders have also exercised their rights
   to inspect internal company documents41 as a strategy to hold companies accountable
   for representations made in relation to climate change. For example, in 2021,
   shareholders of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia successfully requested access
   to documents concerning the bank's involvement in financing fossil fuel companies,
   which, the plaintiffs argued, were inconsistent with the bank's environmental and
   social policy.42

                                                 KEY QUESTIONS

                      What considerations would be relevant for large institutional
                        investors in deciding whether to support a member resolution on
                        climate change or to vote against company directors in relation to
                        their climate performance?

                      Even though advisory resolutions on climate change in Australia
                        are not binding on company boards, what factors might lead
                        them to influence company decision-making on climate change?

  2.3. Reporting and Disclosure

   As noted in part 1.2, public and large proprietary companies are required to prepare
   an annual report, which includes discussion of future business prospects and any
   material risks that could affect the achievement of those prospects.43 Where climate
   change poses material risks to a company, these general financial risk disclosure
   obligations apply. Until recently, there has been considerable scope for companies to

   take different approaches to determining the materiality of climate risks and reporting
   on these. Expectations for climate reporting have however hardened over several
   years through the establishment of voluntary industry standards, strategic litigation,
   increased regulatory oversight of disclosure practices, and most recently, law reform
   to standardise climate reporting in line with international standards.

   Voluntary industry standards have played an important role in developing best
   practice expectations for climate risk disclosure and management in relation to the
   general financial risk disclosure obligations found in company law (see part 1.2).

   The international, industry-led Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures
   (`TCFD'), formed in the wake of the 2015 Paris Agreement, was instrumental in
   articulating different categories of climate-related financial risks (physical risks arising
   from the physical impacts of climate change and transition risks arising from the
   policy, regulatory, market and technology shifts occurring as society transitions to
   clean energy systems) and highlighting financial implications for operating companies
   and associated finance sector entities.44 In 2017, the TCFD set out a four-part
   framework for climate risk disclosure and management covering risk governance,
   strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets (used to assess and manage
   climate-related risks and opportunities).45 Over time, the TCFD has provided
   increasingly detailed guidance, including encouraging entities to report on the
   direction and ranges of potential financial implications of climate change to their
   business under different climate-related scenarios (including scenarios aligned to Paris
   Agreement goals), to set quantified targets to manage climate risks (eg GHG emissions
   reduction targets), to set out comprehensive business transition strategies to meet
   targets and to report regularly on progress using common indicators and metrics to
   allow for progress tracking and comparison.46

   Although voluntary in Australia, many Australian companies committed to align to

   the TCFD standard.47 This was driven by the engagement and advocacy activities
   of investor groups and civil society (including through member resolutions; see part
   2.2), many of which have focused on improving climate risk disclosure. Corporate
   regulators also endorsed the TCFD, referencing the framework in various updates to
   regulatory guidance on financial reporting.48 Yet despite a surge in the quantity of
   climate risk disclosure provided by Australian companies, several empirical studies
   have highlighted that early reporting practices were highly variable and often poor
   quality, with only partial implementation of the TCFD framework. While companies
   were providing more qualitative discussion of climate risk in the directors' report,
   these risks remained under-reported and unquantified in financial statements.49
   Further, few companies disclosed robust transition plans using relevant targets and
   metrics to allow for progress reporting and comparison across entities.50 Accordingly,
   investors and civil society stakeholders raised concerns about the quality and decision-
   usefulness of climate reporting.51

   Strategic Litigation

   Many Australian companies have made voluntary commitments to achieve net-zero
   emissions (in line with the Paris Agreement) and set out related interim climate
   targets and actions. Strategic shareholder litigants are engaging company law to hold
   companies accountable to these commitments. For example, in 2021, the Australasian
   Centre for Corporate Responsibility (`ACCR') commenced litigation against the large

   Australian oil and gas company Santos Ltd. The case concerns a series of statements
   that Santos made in its 2020 annual report, including that it had a clear and credible
   pathway to achieve its 2030 emissions reduction targets and 2040 net-zero target, and
   that natural gas and hydrogen produced from natural gas with carbon capture and
   storage were `clean' and `zero emissions'. ACCR alleges that these statements are
   misleading and deceptive and lack a reasonable basis, and therefore are in breach of
   Australian company law (and related provisions in the Australian Consumer Law).52
   ACCR argues that Santos has failed to disclose that it intends to pursue growth of its
   oil and gas business beyond 2025, which will increase its overall emissions, and that
   its net-zero plans depend on a range of undisclosed and unreasonable assumptions,
   including in relation to the viability of carbon capture and storage technology.

                                                 KEY QUESTIONS

                      Within the meaning of Australian company law, do you think it is
                        misleading and deceptive for a company to make a commitment
                        to net-zero emissions but continue to carry out or invest in
                        activities like fossil fuel expansion?

                      What role might litigation like ACCR v Santos play in improving
                        corporate climate reporting and risk management?

   Regulatory Scrutiny and Enforcement
   In recent years, corporate and prudential regulators and the Australian Competition
   and Consumer Commission (`ACCC') have increased their scrutiny of climate risk
   disclosures, with an increased focus on greenwashing practices more generally.
   Greenwashing refers to representations, acts or omissions made in relation to

   environmental issues by companies which are false, misleading or lack a reasonable
   basis.

   For example, ASIC developed guidance on how to avoid greenwashing when offering
   or promoting sustainability-related products.53 ASIC has also increased its surveillance
   of company disclosures, including capital raising documents, intervening in situations
   of potential misleading marketing or greenwashing, including by issuing infringement
   notices and commencing civil penalty proceedings.54 One of ASIC's focus areas has
   been net-zero statements, targets and claims of decarbonisation that lack a reasonable
   basis or are factually incorrect.55 Companies involved in ASIC investigations have
   subsequently corrected misleading statements, and in some cases, have been issued
   infringement notices and financial penalties.56

                                                 KEY QUESTIONS

                      What impact do you think this regulatory scrutiny will have on
                        corporate climate reporting practices?

                      Could it have the unintended effect of disincentivising companies
                        from making climate commitments to avoid potential liability
                        (greenhushing)?

                      If a company reduces or simplifies its climate risk disclosures to
                        avoid liability, would company directors still be discharging their
                        broader legal duties to take proportionate steps to address risks
                        posed by climate change and to ensure full disclosure of material
                        climate-related risks? (See further discussion in part 2.1.)

   Law Reform

   In 2024, the Australian Government amended the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) to
   explicitly require large public and private companies,57 as well as high-emitting
   companies,58 to provide climate risk disclosures in their annual reports, in line with
   a reporting standard developed by the AASB.59 The Australian reporting standard
   is based on international standards developed by the International Sustainability
   Standards Board (`ISSB'),60 which in turn builds on the four part TCFD framework.61

   Under the new regime, reporting entities are required to disclose the climate-related
   risks and opportunities that could reasonably be expected to affect the entity's
   financial position and prospects;62 the current and anticipated effects of those risks and
   opportunities on the business model and value chain, as well as on company strategy
   and decision-making;63 and the climate resilience of the entity's strategy and business
   model (using emissions reduction scenarios aligned with the Paris Agreement's more

57. Large entities that are already required to prepare and lodge annual reports under Chapter 2M of the Corporations Act
       will be covered by the new requirements. This includes financial institutions as well as asset owners such as registrable
       superannuation entities and investment schemes.

58. Entities subject to emissions reporting obligations under the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting scheme (NGER)
       will also be required to disclose, regardless of their size.

59. See Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) ss 292A, 296A, 296B, 296C, 296D (as amended by the Treasury Laws Amendment
       (Financial Market Infrastructure and Other Measures) Bill 2024 (Cth)). The AASB reporting standard -- AASB, S2
       Climate-related Disclosures -- was finalised in September 2024.

60. Since the 1990s, there has been a shift in approaches to corporate reporting around the world, from single bottom line
       reporting (focused on the financial affairs of the company) to triple bottom line reporting (focused on the economic,
       environmental and social performance of a company) as well as considerable efforts at harmonisation. Following
       multiple institutional developments and mergers, the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) Foundation
       is now responsible for the development of global accounting and sustainability standards via its two standard-
       setting boards, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and International Sustainability Standards Board
       (ISSB). In 2023, the ISSB released their ISSB Sustainability Disclosure Standards (IFRS S1 General Requirements
       for Disclosure of Sustainability-related Financial Information and IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures) and is
       developing further standards for other aspects of sustainability reporting. As a result, sustainability-related standard
       setting has now been integrated into the framework of international accounting standards, providing a uniform
       foundation for adoption in different jurisdictions.

   ambitious 1.5 캜 temperature goal).64 Disclosure of any climate-related targets and
   associated transition plans developed by the company,65 as well as GHG emissions,
   including scope 1, scope 2 and scope 3 emissions, is also required.66

                                                           EXERCISES

      Now that Australian companies must provide comprehensive climate risk
      disclosures using a common reporting standard, what changes might we
      anticipate in the approach that companies take to climate change? What impact
      might mandatory scope 3 emissions reporting have on company decisions and
      behaviour?

                 Exercise 1: Choose three large Australian companies covered by the
                   new disclosure regime across a range of sectors (eg energy, mining,
                   manufacturing, finance). Explore the climate disclosures provided by
                   these companies before and after the introduction of mandatory
                   reporting standards. How do climate disclosures differ between
                   industries and sectors -- for example, what risks are more prominent
                   (physical or transition)? What targets and transition plans are disclosed?
                   Do the companies set out a clear and credible pathway to achieve
                   targets?

                 Exercise 2: Choose three large Australian companies covered by the
                   new disclosure regime involved in the same industry/sector (eg energy,
                   mining, manufacturing, finance). Explore climate risk disclosures before
                   and after the introduction of mandatory reporting standards. Are climate
                   risk disclosures easy to compare across the three companies? What
                   targets and transition plans are disclosed? Do the companies set out a
                   clear and credible pathway to achieve targets?

 3. Future Trajectories in Company Law

  Several emerging developments in and around company law have the potential to
  shift company decision-making and behaviour on climate change. In thinking about
  likely future developments in Australia, it is useful to consider regulatory trajectories
  in leading and comparative jurisdictions like the European Union (`EU') and UK.

 3.1. Sustainable Finance Reforms

  Following similar developments in other jurisdictions, particularly the EU, the
  Australian Government released its Sustainable Finance Roadmap in 2024.1
  Sustainable finance strategies are underpinned by two main objectives: managing the
  financial risks posed to market actors by climate change and other sustainability risks,
  and aligning private capital and resources to help address climate change and other
  sustainability issues in line with relevant international and national goals and targets
  such as those set out in the Paris Agreement. These strategies involve a range of
  reforms to company law and associated business regulation.

  For example, as part of the EU Sustainable Finance Reform package, the EU
  introduced a new Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (`CSRD').2 Companies
  covered by the regulation are required to report sustainability information in line
  with the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (which have been developed to
  address climate change along with a wide range of other environmental and social
  issues, including biodiversity and ecosystems, workers in the value chain, and resource
  use and circular economy).3 Importantly, the EU reporting standards adopt the

2. Directive (EU) 2022/2464 of The European Parliament and of The Council [2022] OJ L 322/15. Obligations on financial
      sector actors are imposed separately via the Sustainable Finance Regulation.

3. The standards developed by the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group and adopted in July 2023 include ESRS 1
      General principles, ESRS 2 General disclosures, ESRS E1 Climate change, ESRS E2 Pollution, ESRS E3 Water and
      marine resources, ESRS E4 Biodiversity and ecosystems, ESRS E5 Resource use and circular economy, ESRS S1 Own
      workforce, ESRS S2 Workers in the value chain, ESRS S3 Affected communities, ESRS S4 Consumers and end-users
      and ESRS G1 Business conduct.

  concept of double materiality, requiring companies to disclose not only the material
  risks posed to company interests by sustainability issues but also the material impacts
  of company activities on people or the environment. These include impacts directly
  caused or contributed to by the company in its own operations, products or services,
  as well as impacts which are otherwise directly linked to the company's upstream and
  downstream value chain.4 The reporting standards also require companies to disclose
  climate transition plans that demonstrate how the business model and strategy is or
  will become compatible with the 1.5 캜 temperature goals of the Paris Agreement.5

  The EU has also introduced a Sustainable Finance Taxonomy, a classification system
  to help investors and other stakeholders understand whether the economic activities
  undertaken by companies are environmentally and socially sustainable, and to support
  the direction of capital flows to activities that substantially contribute to climate
  change mitigation and other sustainability objectives set by the EU.6 Finance sector
  entities such as superannuation funds are obliged to report on the alignment of their
  portfolio against the taxonomy, and all companies that report under the CSRD are also
  obliged to report on the extent to which their activities align with, support a transition
  to or detract from the sustainability objectives set out in the taxonomy (taxonomy
  activity reporting).

  In a related development, the EU has also introduced the Corporate Sustainability
  Due Diligence Directive (`EU CSDD')7 and a number of European countries have

   introduced mandatory human rights and environmental due diligence laws,8 which
   have the potential to significantly enhance corporate accountability for social and
   environmental harms like climate change.9 These laws require large companies to
   assess actual and potential adverse impacts on human rights and/or the environment
   caused or substantially contributed to by the company's activities, or which may
   be directly linked to the company's operations, products or services by its business
   relationships. Companies are required to take reasonable steps to prevent harms
   occurring, and where harms occur, to address these. These laws provide a civil remedy
   for victims of harms in some instances.10 Some of these laws are framed broadly to
   encompass company impacts on climate change11 or indeed explicitly address climate
   change harms. For example, the EU CSDD requires covered entities to take specific
   measures to address climate change impacts, including through the adoption and
   implementation of Paris-aligned transition plans, which include emissions reduction
   targets for scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions.12

                                                 KEY QUESTIONS

                      How do climate reporting requirements for EU companies differ
                        from current reporting requirements under Australian company
                        law? Do you think a double materiality approach or activity
                        reporting against a sustainable finance taxonomy would change
                        the way in which Australian companies approach climate
                        change?

                      Do you think that extending mandatory due diligence obligations
                        to climate change would influence the approach that Australian
                        company directors take to climate change?

  3.2. Novel Sustainability Duties

   The building momentum around sustainable finance reforms internationally has
   reinvigorated long-running debates about the role and purpose of the company in
   society and particularly the role that companies should play in addressing climate
   change. As discussed in part 1.1, in many ways, company law provides the structural
   foundations for growth-based capitalist market economies, which externalise and
   undervalue social and environmental problems such as climate change.13 Further,
   current formulations and interpretations of directors' duties (which focus on material
   financial risks to the company, and which tend to equate the best interests of the
   company with short-term, profit-focused interests of shareholders) can disincentivise
   company directors from taking timely steps to address climate change (see part 2.1).
   These barriers are only tempered to some degree by the stewardship activities of long-
   term, diversified investors like superannuation funds that are increasingly focused on
   systemic risks posed by climate change and aligning company-level risk management
   with Paris Agreement goals.

   Scholars of company law from a range of jurisdictions have proposed reforms to
   directors' duties to help counter the short-term focus on profit maximisation at the

       the Anthropocene (Hart Publishing, 2017) 289-309.
                                                                                                                                                                  352

   expense of inadequately regulated social and environmental externalities and longer-
   term sustainability considerations. A range of formulations for novel sustainability
   duties have been proposed that would explicitly require directors to take reasonable
   steps to prevent environmental harm and to improve environmental performance.14
   Some scholars also argue for the introduction of clear statements in company law
   that the purpose of the company is to create sustainable value by balancing the
   interests of shareholders with the interests of other stakeholders and by operating
   within agreed environmental limits that reflect global environmental goals (eg the
   Paris Agreement).15

   Some jurisdictions have taken tentative steps to implement reforms to directors' duties
   to clarify and emphasise the relevance of environmental and social considerations
   and stakeholder interests to the best interests of the company. For example, directors'
   duties under the Companies Act 2006 (UK) were reformed in the early 2000s with
   the aim of shifting corporate governance beyond a shareholder primacy approach.
   The directors' duty to promote the success of the company now explicitly adopts an
   enlightened shareholder value approach, requiring directors to act in the way that they
   consider, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the company
   for the benefit of its members as a whole, and in doing so have regard to a range of
   stakeholder considerations, including the impact of the company's operations on the
   community and the environment.16 However, there is some evidence that the practical
   impact of these reforms has been minimal and that UK directors still consider their
   overriding objective is to maximise shareholder profits.17

   Similarly, in 2023, the New Zealand Companies Act 1993 was amended to expressly
   state that in acting in the best interests of the company, directors `may consider
   matters other than the maximisation of profit (eg environmental, social and governance
   matters)'.18 This amendment attracted considerable opposition, including arguments
   that the amendment was unnecessary given that prudent directors would already be
   considering environmental and social matters when determining the best interests
   of the company, and arguments that the weak phrasing of the amendment (`may'
   instead of `must') would be of little practical impact.19 As part of the sustainable
   finance reform process, the EU also explored reform options that would explicitly
   require company directors to balance stakeholder interests and identify and mitigate
   sustainability risks and impacts.20 At this stage, these reforms have not been pursued.
   While expansion of the `best interests of the company' concept offers certain
   advantages, it also creates a potential loophole, allowing directors to justify a decision
   with harmful environmental consequences by arguing that it advances other interests
   encompassed within the broader best interests test.

                                                 KEY QUESTIONS

           After reading some of the above proposals for and recent examples of
           reform to directors' duties:

                      Do you think that introducing a sustainability duty for company
                        directors in company law would be useful in society's response to
                        climate change and other sustainability challenges?

18. Companies Act 1993 (NZ) s 131 (as amended by the Companies (Directors Duties) Amendment Bill 2021). This
       amendment initially included a list of five non-exhaustive environmental and social governance factors that directors
       could consider in decision-making, including the Treaty of Waitangi, environmental impacts, good ethical behaviour,
       being a good employer and the interests of the wider community.

                      What would be some of the important considerations in
                        formulating this duty so that is workable and enforceable?

  3.3. Alternative Business Structures

   Given the role that the modern investor-owned company has played in creating the
   conditions for catastrophic climate change, it is useful to conclude this chapter by
   considering alternative business structures that are less focused on short-term profit
   generation for shareholders and more focused on societal contribution. Here we
   consider the cooperative and the benefit corporation and explore whether these may
   be better suited to addressing climate change in a timely and effective way.

   As a business structure, the cooperative has a long history, including in Australia,
   where it has been used in different sectors, including agriculture and finance, and
   remains a small but important part of the economy.21 A cooperative is a registered
   legal entity (governed by specific cooperative legislation),22 which differs from a
   for-profit company in several ways. A cooperative is owned and controlled by its
   members, who must commit to active membership. Unlike companies, all members
   have an equal vote at GMs, irrespective of their level of investment. Members can
   be customers, staff, suppliers, producers or residents, or a combination of these. A
   cooperative can be for profit or not for profit,23 and members choose what to do
   with any profits (eg distribute among members, reinvest in the business or give
   to the community). The main purpose of a cooperative is not to maximise profits
   but to maximise benefits through provision of goods or services to members. Many
   cooperatives provide employment, goods or services that would not otherwise be
   available or affordable to members.

22. For a discussion of the national cooperatives law, see Ann Apps, `Legislating for Co-operative Identity: The New Co-
       operatives National Law in Australia' (2016) 34 Company and Securities Law Journal 6.

23. Cooperatives are therefore distinct from incorporated associations, which must be non-profit (and cannot distribute
       surplus to members). Cooperatives are often compared to mutuals, which are member owned but not necessarily
       member governed.

                                                 KEY QUESTIONS
           Consider the example of Hepburn Energy,24 a member-owned cooperative
           that owns the Hepburn Community Wind Farm in central Victoria and that
           is now expanding into local solar and battery storage projects.

                      Why do you think a cooperative business structure has been
                        used in this case? What are the benefits for members and for the
                        community?

                      How might the decisions and behaviour of this cooperative differ
                        from a shareholder-owned company providing renewable energy
                        services in Australia?

                      Can you find other examples of cooperatives that have been
                        established to help address climate change?

   In the early 2000s, several jurisdictions, including the US, Canada and the UK,
   legislated to allow for voluntary adoption of the benefit corporation as an alternative
   business structure.25 Benefit corporations are for-profit entities, but they differ from
   ordinary companies in the way in which they address corporate purpose and the
   associated duties of company directors. The purpose of the benefit corporation is not
   solely to make a profit but also to pursue a social benefit. Directors and company
   officers are subject to legal duties to consider not only the financial interests of
   shareholders but also the interests of a wide range of stakeholders. Benefit
   corporations must also report on actions taken in pursuit of their social purpose.26

   In Australia, legislation to provide for benefit corporations was advocated but never
   introduced. However, a growing number of ordinary companies have been certified

   as benefit corporations by the international B Lab Global third-party certification
   network.27 To be certified, Australian companies must meet a number of requirements,
   including amending the company constitution to include a purpose statement (which
   clearly states that the purpose of the company is to deliver returns to shareholders
   while having an overall positive impact on society and the environment) and a
   stakeholder clause (which provides that, in discharging their duties, company directors
   must consider the long-term interest of the company; the interests of company
   employees, suppliers and customers; the impact of the company's operations on the
   community and the environment; the desirability of maintaining a reputation for high
   standards of business conduct; the interests of shareholders; and the ability of the
   company to create an overall positive impact on society and the environment, with
   no priority given to any of the above).28 There has however been substantial critique
   of the benefit corporation model, with some arguing, for example, that `directors'
   duties owed to the traditional corporation do not preclude the consideration of other
   stakeholders and that the arguments in favour of the hybrids skew our understanding
   of the traditional corporation and obscure the need for socially responsible conduct on
   the part of traditional corporations'.29

                        the approach of these companies to climate change?

                      Should all companies be benefit corporations? Is there a case for
                        law reform to introduce purpose statements and stakeholder
                        clauses for all Australian companies? Would this help to address

4. Conclusion

This chapter has explored the various ways in which climate change is relevant to
company law and the way in which company law is relevant to society's response to
climate change. While recent developments in company law have certainly increased
the consideration of climate change by company directors and underlined its
importance as a source of financial risk, there are also persistent barriers within
company law which disincentivise companies from taking timely and ambitious steps
to address climate change where these would conflict with the (short-term) interests of
shareholders. The chapter discussed the ways in which strategic litigation and investor
engagement and advocacy is seeking to shift company responses to climate change
beyond a narrow focus on near-term financial risks to company interests towards
a broader, longer-term focus on aligning risk management with the international
goals of the Paris Agreement. This shift is also evident in recent sustainable finance
reforms, which are further advanced in jurisdictions like Europe but also developing in
Australia. The discussion also canvassed a range of more radical reforms to company
law which would more explicitly require companies to consider and address the risks
and impacts of their activities on the climate.

This chapter explores the interplay between civil procedure and climate litigation.
Looking to several elements of civil procedure, this chapter considers the ways in
which the rules, regulations and processes of our legal system can enable and hinder
climate litigation. Moreover, this chapter invites you to consider what experiences of
civil procedure in the context of climate litigation show about the values that underpin
our legal system and the extent to which that system is individually and socially just.
Fundamental to this issue is the concept of access to justice and, in the context of
climate litigation, climate justice.
Five core elements of civil procedure are addressed here:

                                                                 361

These different aspects intersect and should be considered together. This chapter
does not exhaustively address all elements of civil procedure but looks to raise some
of the key dynamics between civil procedure and climate litigation that have been
of significant influence in Australia and in overseas jurisdictions. We encourage
you to also consider how the dynamics discussed here play out in relation to other
components of civil procedure beyond the scope of this chapter, such as pleadings,
service, interlocutory procedures, trial, appeal and enforcement.

                  What does civil procedure tell us about the values that underpin

                    our legal system? To what extent do these values align with what
                    is required to address climate change?
                  How might civil procedure enable greater access to justice in
                    relation to climate change?

 1. Introduction

  The Honourable Chief Justice Brian Preston has observed that `imagination is needed
  to tackle the climate emergency'.1 Alongside policy and regulatory imagination, legal
  imagination `is needed to see, and to see beyond, the traditional taxonomies of law and
  litigation'.2

  The identification of intersections between the law and climate, which provide the
  inspiration and opportunity for climate litigation, demands an understanding of civil
  procedure.

  Civil procedure is the body of law that sets out the rules, regulations and processes the
  courts must follow when adjudicating civil lawsuits. Moreover, civil procedure and
  its associated processes are the means of delivering the rights and remedies that the
  substantive law mandates.3

  As there is no climate law as such, climate litigation -- litigation involving climate
  change as a direct or indirect issue4 -- encompasses wide-ranging causes of action,
  plaintiffs (applicants), defendants (respondents), jurisdictions and remedies. Thus,
  procedural issues have manifested in different ways as both enabling factors and
  hurdles. As a substantial portion of climate litigation to date has been public interest
  litigation, specific procedural considerations have also applied.

  This chapter discusses the following elements of civil procedure:

          3. Joinder and representative proceedings
          4. Costs
          5. Remedies

  These elements reflect key questions litigators and plaintiffs grapple with when
  formulating a claim:

            Where? (jurisdiction)
            Who? (standing, joinder and representative proceedings)
            How? (costs)
            What? (remedies)

  The motivations, processes and results of climate litigation differ significantly
  between countries. The focus here is on the Australian experience.

  Evidence is another core element of civil procedure. In climate litigation, scientific
  developments have facilitated expert evidence essential to individual cases and to
  the emergence of new types of claims. The development of attribution science,
  for example, has enabled loss and damage claims, including the transboundary
  harm cases discussed at section 3.2 below. Lay evidence has also been essential. For
  example, in Waratah Coal Pty Ltd v Youth Verdict Ltd & Ors (No 6),5 the only climate-
  related human rights case in Australia to date, the Land Court of Queensland heard
  on-country evidence for the first time from First Nations witnesses in Gimuy (Cairns)
  and the Erub and Poruma Islands of the Torres Strait. As evidence is the subject of a
  separate chapter in this text, it is not discussed in detail here.

  Civil litigation must also comply with various other procedural factors, including
  limitation of actions, requirements for the commencement of proceedings and case
  management, service, pleading, affidavits, interlocutory procedures, settlement, trial
  and appeal, enforcement and practical directions.6 While detailed consideration of all
  aspects of civil procedure is outside the scope of this chapter, we encourage you to

   reflect on how the dynamics of climate litigation and civil procedure discussed here
   may also apply in other areas.

  1.1 Access to Justice

   The overarching civil justice objective in all Australian jurisdictions is that civil
   litigation is conducted to achieve a just result through efficient and cost-effective
   processes.7 This is inextricably linked to the concept of access to justice, which may
   be thought of as twofold: the system must be equally accessible to all, with access
   not contingent on financial means or expertise, and must lead to results that are
   `individually and socially just'.8

   While not always insurmountable -- as successful climate litigation has shown --
   procedural hurdles are experienced unevenly, reflecting and reproducing existing
   inequalities and vulnerabilities. Yeo points out that `assertions such as the need for
   equality before the law and equal protection before the law are highly suspect once we
   pose the question `Whose law?',9 to which we can add the further questions `Whose
   courts?'10 as well as `Whose justice?'

   In the context of climate litigation, access to justice is also tied to the concept of
   climate justice. Climate justice concerns the uneven and unjust distribution of climate
   change vulnerabilities and impacts, and the underlying causes of such maldistribution.

                  Are requirements of justice and efficiency consistent or

                    conflicting? How are they achieved in climate litigation?
                  What characterises an individually and socially just outcome in

                    the context of climate change issues? To what extent have and/
                    or can such outcomes be achieved through the legal system?

 2. Waves of Climate Litigation

  Climate litigation has been described through various `waves'1 or `generations'.2

  Early climate litigation in Australia largely involved discrete, project-based challenges
  under environmental laws, seeking to have climate change impacts taken into account
  in standard decision-making processes. This first generation of cases was heavily
  shaped by procedural considerations such as standing, jurisdiction and costs, often
  leading to a preference for merits review cases brought under planning and
  environmental legislation before specialist environmental courts and tribunals.

  The `next generation' of cases has sought more systemic social and policy change
  through attempts to hold governments and private actors directly accountable for the
  climate change implications of their actions.3 This has involved a broader constellation
  of participants, causes of action and remedies (including damages). This next
  generation encompasses rights-based cases (the `second wave') and corporate and
  other commercial law mechanisms (the `third wave'), overlapping with first wave
  cases that continue to be brought. Procedural considerations are equally but differently
  pertinent for cases comprising the next generation, which are often outside the realm
  of environmental and planning laws.

  While the first generation of cases were more clearly delineated -- for example, by
  consistent claims and remedies provided under environmental laws -- the boundaries
  of climate litigation are now blurry.

  In the next generation of cases, the distinction between public and private interests
  has also blurred -- for example, cases claiming damages from private corporations

      Utz seminar Climate Change Litigation, 16 March 2021).

for climate harm may seek both individual compensation and greater corporate
accountability.

Thus, the procedure applicable to climate litigation will vary depending on the
circumstances of each case, including whether specific procedural or public interest
considerations are enlivened.
                                                                                                                                                                370

 3. Jurisdiction

  A fundamental requirement for any proceeding or appeal to be instituted is that the
  court in which it is proposed to be brought has the jurisdiction to determine it.

  The claims and remedies that may be available in a case are tied to the jurisdiction in
  which it is brought. Alleged breaches of certain environmental laws, for example, fall
  within the exclusive jurisdiction of specialist environment courts.1

  At times jurisdictional choices can thus enable different arguments. As human rights
  in Australia are not enshrined at a federal level and only to a limited extent in certain
  states,2 the only climate-related human rights case in Australia to date was heard by the
  Land Court of Queensland in its administrative capacity.3 Overseas, two current cases
  in German and Swiss courts are seeking to extend the application of domestic laws to
  climate-related harm experienced far outside the countries' borders.

 3.1 Specialist Environment Courts

  Specialist environment courts exist in several jurisdictions in Australia.4 The New
  South Wales Land and Environment Court (NSWLEC), established in 1980, was the
  first specialist environment court established as a superior court of record in the world.

  The advantages of specialist courts include the potential for development of expert

      Development Court Act 1993 (SA) s 7.

2. Human Rights Act 2019 (Qld); Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities Act 2006 (Vic); Human Rights Act 2004
      (ACT).

3. Waratah Coal Pty Ltd v Youth Verdict Ltd & Ors (No 6) [2022] QLC 21.
4. Land and Environment Court (NSW), Land Court (Qld) and Planning and Environment Court (Qld), and Environment,

      Resources and Development Court (SA). Certain jurisdictions also have tribunals with environmental divisions or
      streams: State Administrative Tribunal Act (WA), Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (Vic), and Tasmanian
      Civil and Administrative Tribunal (Tas).

                                                                   370
   371

  knowledge, coherent decision-making and flexible procedural rules.5 For example,
  merits appeals in the NSWLEC are to be conducted with as little formality and
  technicality as possible.6 The value of specialist environment courts and flexible
  procedure for environmental cases has been recognised widely, for example in the
  Bhurban Declaration, adopted in 2012 by various South Asian countries, in
  acknowledgement of the pivotal role of the judiciary in resolving environmental
  issues.7

  However, while the first wave of climate litigation in Australia was predominantly
  heard in specialist environmental courts, many next generation cases fall outside
  their jurisdiction. This shift complicates the development of specialist knowledge
  and procedure that may be beneficial in grappling with complex questions involving
  climate science, such as whether and to what extent a defendant's actions have caused
  particular damage from climate change.

 3.2 Transboundary Harm

  The broad and far-reaching impacts of climate change, which are not contained
  within country borders, disrupt traditional concepts of territorial jurisdiction. Outside
  international law (see International Law and Climate Change), remedies for
  transboundary harm are also being sought in domestic courts for climate impacts far
  beyond national borders. Jurisdiction in such cases is governed by private international
  law.8

  The German case of Luciano Lliuya v RWE AG,9 filed in 2015 by a Peruvian farmer
  from Huaraz, Peru, seeks declaratory judgment and damages against Germany's
  largest electricity producer for its contribution to climate change, which has caused the

   Palcaraju glacier in Peru to melt. The claim applies German nuisance law, traditionally
   applied in neighbourhood disputes, to climate change impacts. The lawsuit was
   initially dismissed but this decision was overturned by the Hamm Higher Regional
   Court, which found that climate change with its cross-border effects has brought about
   a kind of global neighbourly relationship so the relevant provisions of the German
   Civil Code apply.

   The Swiss case of Asmania et al v Holcim,10 filed in 2022 by four Indonesian plaintiffs
   from the island of Pari against Swiss-based major buildings materials company
   Holcim, seeks compensation for climate damage, a financial contribution to flood
   protection measures, and orders for the rapid reduction of Holcim's emissions. The
   plaintiffs rely on Swiss civil law provisions relating to the infringement of personal
   rights and redress for unjust harm and were granted free legal aid by the Swiss
   Cantonal Court of Zug.

   Both cases rely on attribution science arguments to claim proportional compensation
   for loss and damage and the costs of adaptation measures from the respondent
   companies against which the claims are brought. The development of this area of
   science has been critical to enabling claims for liability and compensation against
   different actors. If successful, these cases could have widespread ramifications given
   similar provisions exist in other jurisdictions. Even if the cases do not succeed, they
   will serve as an important source of inspiration for alternative avenues and forums
   for establishing accountability for transboundary climate impacts. In the Australian
   context, future climate litigation involving attribution for transboundary harm may
   build on previous environmental class actions in the Federal Court of Australia which
   the Court allowed to be brought on behalf of group members who are not resident in
   Australia.11

                  What are the arguments for and against specialist environmental

                    law courts, specialist environmental law divisions of existing
                    courts, and the absence of specialised environmental law courts/
                    divisions? How do these arguments apply in the context of
                    climate litigation?

                    court?

 4. Standing

  The issue of standing -- who is entitled to pursue remedies in court -- primarily
  arises in cases with a public element, where a wider range of people, or the public
  generally, may have an interest.1

  Standing is generally not in issue in cases concerning private rights and interests. An
  implicit principle of the Australian legal system is that the holder of a private legal
  right has the option to determine whether or not that right should be enforced through
  the courts.2

  Unless standing has been expanded under legislation, the common law `special
  interest' test applies. In the absence of standing a plaintiff cannot bring a claim and the
  court has no jurisdiction to hear it.

 4.1 Special Interest Test

  The general test for standing at common law, established in Australian Conservation
  Foundation Inc v Commonwealth (`ACF'),3 requires an applicant to have a `special
  interest' in the subject matter of the action. In finding that the applicant had no
  standing to maintain the action in ACF, Justice Gibbs (as his Honour then was)
  explained:4

              It is quite clear that an ordinary member of the public, who has no interest
              other than that which any member of the public has in upholding the law, has
              no standing to sue to prevent the violation of a public right or to enforce the
              performance of a public duty... A private citizen who has no special interest

   375

              is incapable of bringing proceedings for that purpose, unless, of course, he
              is permitted by statute to do so.

  The special interest test maintains a focus on private rights and interests, in that
  litigants must demonstrate an interest greater than the public at large, creating
  difficulty for litigants seeking to bring cases in the public interest.

  In the recent case of O'Donnell v Commonwealth of Australia (`O'Donnell'),5 two
  of the applicant's three causes of action -- relating to the Commonwealth's failure
  to disclose climate-related risks relating to certain exchange-traded Australian
  Government Bonds -- were dismissed due to lack of standing. The Court found that
  there was insufficient evidence presented by the applicant to conclude that she had
  a `special interest' in the declaratory and injunctive relief sought. Justice Murphy
  observed that while an emotional or intellectual interest in protecting the environment
  from the risks of climate change is not unworthy or illegitimate, `such an aim alone
  is insufficient to satisfy the test for standing'.6 Standing was not an issue in respect
  of the applicant's third claim of misleading or deceptive conduct under the Australian
  Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 (Cth) (`ASIC Act') as injunctive
  relief is available to any person under the relevant statutory provisions.7

 4.2 Legislative Extension of Standing

  Environmental litigation has been the site of many of the major battles in the
  development of standing rules. Various Commonwealth and state environment and
  planning laws (particularly in NSW) now extend standing to any person,8 or to
  individuals or groups that meet specified criteria.9 For example, the Environment

      Protection of the Environment Operations Act 1997 (NSW) ss 219, 252-3; Contaminated Land Management Act 1997
      (NSW) s 96.
                                                                                                                                                                  376

   Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (Cth) extends standing for judicial
   review to environmental groups.10

   However, as discussed above, recent waves of climate litigation have moved outside
   environmental laws. While some are brought under other legislation with open
   standing,11 such as the misleading or deceptive conduct claims in O'Donnell, others
   must overcome the special interest test. The interrelated concepts of jurisdiction,
   standing and remedies must therefore be carefully considered when formulating a
   claim. Whether a plaintiff has sufficient special interest depends on `the nature and
   subject matter of the litigation'12 and the closeness of the plaintiff's relationship to the
   subject matter in issue.

  4.3 Open Standing for Public Interest?

   The tension between standing criteria and public interest enforcement has been
   recognised by the courts. In Bateman's Bay Local Aboriginal Land Council v
   Aboriginal Community Benefit Fund Pty Ltd, the plurality (Gaudron, Gummow and
   Kirby JJ) said it was dangerous to attempt to define a precise formula for standing
   because the consequence `may be unduly to constrict the availability of equitable
   remedies to support that public interest in due administration which enlivens equitable
   intervention in public law'.13

   In a 1996 report, the Australian Law Reform Commission made a recommendation
   -- subsequently rejected by the government -- for a new standing test, according
   to which any person could commence public law proceedings unless the relevant

   legislation provides otherwise and/or the commencement of an action would
   unreasonably interfere with a private interest.14

   A more liberal or open public interest standing approach is taken in other jurisdictions.
   In South Africa, for example, open public interest standing is available under section
   38 of the Constitution in relation to alleged infringements of a right in the Bill of
   Rights, which includes the right to an environment not harmful to health or wellbeing.

  4.4 Legal Existence and the Rights of Nature

   Standing has been described as a `screening device'15 or `filtering mechanism',16 in
   that a denial of standing bars a plaintiff from obtaining a legal remedy without a
   conclusion having been reached on the merits of the case.

   Legal existence is a related screening device, dictating which bodies are granted legal
   personhood and the accompanying rights.

   Legal personhood has traditionally been associated with human persons and their
   representatives -- for example, corporations. However, there is growing international
   momentum for the binary framing of legal personhood to be reconceptualised,
   including through extending rights to or recognising the legal personhood of the
   natural world.17 Ecuador in 2008 provided constitutional rights and protections to the
   environment and Bolivia subsequently passed similar laws to recognise the rights
   of Mother Earth. In 2017 New Zealand granted personhood status to the Whanganui
   River, arising from the negotiations of the Treaty of Waitangi.

   The momentum of this movement is undoubtedly influenced by climate change, which
   forces an acknowledgement of our dependence and impact on nature. An expansion

centric focus of the law, which would have great impacts on climate litigation and the
underlying issues and legal structures that give rise to it.

                                             KEY QUESTIONS
                  In your view, should more relaxed or open standing apply to

                    public interest climate litigation and/or public interest cases more
                    broadly?
                  Consider possible definitions of the `public interest' in relation to
                    the environment and climate change. How might views on what is
                    in the public interest differ? Do you think this is likely to change in
                    the future?

 5. Joinder and Representative Proceedings

  Given the widespread impacts of climate change, it is unsurprising for multiple parties
  to have common or overlapping interests. In such cases, it can be more efficient
  for the court to combine multiple parties within one claim. Two mechanisms which
  accommodate this are joinder and representative proceedings.

 5.1 Joinder

  Joinder is a device whereby multiple parties or claims may be combined into a single
  lawsuit, generally granted where there is a common question of fact or law. The
  ordinary rules of procedure apply to each of the joined plaintiffs.
  In the landmark case of Gloucester Resources Limited v Minister for Planning1 a
  community group -- Gloucester Groundswell -- was successfully joined to
  proceedings instituted by a proponent of a coalmine seeking merits review of a refusal
  of its development application.

  The joinder was granted on the basis that Gloucester Groundswell would raise two
  issues that would not otherwise be sufficiently addressed in the proceedings:
  unacceptable social impacts on the community of Gloucester and the impact of the
  development on greenhouse gases. Consent for the project was refused by the Court,
  finding that it would adversely impact the visual amenity and rural and scenic
  character of the valley, the community and the existing uses of the land. His Honour
  Chief Justice Preston also found that `greenhouse gas emissions of the project and
  their likely contribution to adverse impacts on the climate system, environment and
  people adds a further reason for refusal'.2 This was the first time an Australian court
  found the greenhouse gas emissions from a proposed coalmine and their associated
  impacts was a ground for refusal.

  5.2 Representative Proceedings

   At a federal level, representative proceedings can be commenced under Part IVA
   of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1974 (Cth), which enables a representative
   applicant to commence proceedings on behalf of group members in respect of similar
   or related claims which share a substantial common issue.3 Representative proceedings
   can also be commenced under rule 9.21 of the Federal Court Rules 2011 (Cth) which
   requires persons to have `the same interest' and predates Part IVA. Both provisions
   have been used in climate cases to date.4

   Important features of Part IVA include that the representative plaintiff must have a
   personal claim,5 only the representative plaintiff is liable for adverse costs (not group
   members),6 persons who fall within the defined class are group members7 unless
   they opt out,8 the Court may order that a proceeding not continue as a representative
   proceeding where it is in the interests of justice to do so,9 proceedings cannot be settled
   or discontinued without leave of the Court,10 the Court can make any order it considers
   `appropriate or necessary to ensure that justice is done in the proceeding',11 and all

 3. Similar provisions also exist in certain states: Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW) Part 10; Civil Proceedings Act 2011

   group members are bound by the outcome of the proceeding unless they have opted

   In recent years, three climate-related class actions have been brought in Australia, all
   against the Commonwealth government. These cases follow various environmental
   class actions in Australia13 and successful climate class actions overseas, including
   in the Netherlands a landmark case against the state for orders that it pursue higher
   greenhouse gas emissions reductions targets, brought by an environmental group on
   behalf of 900 Dutch citizens.14

   Historically, a significant focus of class actions in Australia has been shareholder
   claims against companies. With the focus on private actors in the recent waves of
   climate litigation, it is likely that claims against companies -- for example, duty of
   care, consumer and shareholder claims -- will take the form of class actions. The
   possibility of substantial cumulative damages may also attract financial support for
   such claims -- for example, litigation funding (see below).

   Sharma

   In Sharma by her litigation representative Sister Marie Brigid Arthur v Minister for
   the Environment15 (`Sharma') eight Australian young people sought a declaration that
   the Commonwealth Minister for the Environment owed them and other Australian
   children a duty of care to protect them from a foreseeable risk of harm arising from
   climate change and an injunction to restrain an apprehended breach of that duty
   resulting from the approval of a coalmine extension.

   As the plaintiffs were minors, and thereby lacked capacity to conduct litigation, they
   brought their claim with the assistance of a litigation representative, Sister Brigid
   Arthur.

   Justice Bromberg of the Federal Court of Australia initially found that the Minister
   had such a duty.16 However, on appeal the decision was unanimously overturned by
   the Full Federal Court. Prior to making final orders, the parties asked the Full Federal
   Court to order that the proceeding not continue as a representative proceeding, as the
   proceedings would otherwise bind all represented children and give rise to an issue
   estoppel preventing them from bringing similar proceedings in the future.

   O'Donnell
   O'Donnell, discussed above, alleged misleading or deceptive conduct by the
   Commonwealth in relation to exchange-traded Australian Government Bonds.

   The case settled in October 2023, with the parties agreeing to the Commonwealth
   publishing a statement containing various acknowledgements, including that climate
   change is a systemic risk that may affect the value of government bonds.17

   Pabai and Kabai
   In a case currently before the Federal Court, Pabai Pabai and Guy Paul Kabai v
   Commonwealth of Australia,18 representative applicants and First Nation leaders Uncle
   Pabai Pabai and Uncle Paul Kabai are alleging on behalf of all Torres Strait Islanders
   facing the climate crisis that the Commonwealth government owes a duty of care to all
   Torres Strait Islanders to take reasonable steps to protect them, their culture and their
   environment from harms caused by climate change. They allege that the government
   has breached this duty by inter alia failing to implement adequate measures to reduce
   Australia's greenhouse gas emissions, causing Torres Strait Islanders to suffer and
   loss and damage. Whereas in Sharma and O'Donnell only declaratory and injunctive
   relief was sought, in this matter the applicants are also seeking damages.

                                              KEY QUESTION

                  What are the potential benefits and challenges associated with
                    bringing climate litigation as representative proceedings under
                    Part IVA, compared to representative actions under Division 9.2
                    of the Federal Court Rules 2011 (Cth) compared to individual
                    claims?
                                                                                                                                                                384

 6. Costs

  The costs of litigation can be a formidable barrier to commencing proceedings. This
  consideration looms particularly large in public interest cases, where there is generally
  no private benefit (such as damages) to be gained and often a substantial resource
  imbalance between the parties.

  In addition to the costs associated with running a claim, which may be mitigated by pro
  bono or reduced fee legal representation, plaintiffs face adverse costs risks. Further,
  the non-economic costs of litigation can be considerable and difficult to anticipate.

 6.1 Usual Rule as to Costs

  Australian courts have broad discretion to make orders as to costs.

  The usual rule is that costs follow the event, meaning the unsuccessful party will be
  ordered to pay some of the successful party's legal costs at the conclusion of a case.
  This reflects the notion that justice to a successful party is not achieved if it comes
  at the price of being out of pocket, so that a party who is responsible for litigation
  should bear its costs. Costs are awarded to indemnify a successful party in litigation,
  not to punish an unsuccessful party.1 Underlying both the usual rule that costs follow
  the event and the qualifications to it is the idea that costs should be paid in a way
  that is fair, having regard to the responsibility of each party for the incurring of the
  costs.2 This rule applies unless specific legislation provides otherwise, for example
  in merits review cases before the NSWLEC where instead costs orders must not be
  made unless it is `fair and reasonable' in the circumstances to do so.3 In representative
  proceedings, costs generally may not be awarded against group members other than

   385

  the representative plaintiff(s) who is a party to the proceeding.4 There is no general
  public interest exception to the usual rule. The two primary ways in which public
  interest considerations may be factored into the exercise of the court's discretion are
  no or limited costs orders and cost capping orders.

 6.2 No Costs Orders

  Courts can exercise discretion to not apply the usual rule as to costs at all, meaning
  irrespective of the outcome each party bears their own costs, or limit the amount of
  costs payable.

  The court will exercise its discretion on costs `having regard to all the circumstances
  of the case'.5 Public interest considerations are one factor, but generally the mere
  fact proceedings are brought in the public interest will not be enough alone to justify
  departure from the usual rule, and something more is required.6

  The range of outcomes in cases where a no costs order has been sought has created
  considerable uncertainty and difficulty for plaintiffs and lawyers to accurately predict
  where cases will warrant the court departing from the usual rule as to costs.

  A further difficulty is that no costs orders are made at the conclusion of the
  proceedings, meaning there is no certainty for an applicant prior to commencing or
  during the proceeding.

 6.3 Capped Costs

  Courts may also grant a capped costs order, also known as a protective costs order,
  either under general discretionary powers or specific legislative provisions.7 While a

   capped costs order does not have to apply equally to all parties, orders made have
   generally been reciprocal.

   Public interest is one factor in deciding to make such an order. However, similarly
   to no costs orders, public interest is not necessarily decisive,8 and something more is
   needed.9

   If successful, capped costs orders can provide some level of certainty as such orders
   are typically sought relatively early in a proceeding. In practice, however, maximum
   costs orders are made infrequently, and none have been made to date in climate-related
   cases.10

  6.4 Litigation Funding

   Litigation funding, usually in the form of an adverse cost indemnity, may also be
   available to public interest litigants in certain cases, however the availability and
   extent of such funding is limited. The Grata Fund, for example, is a specialist not-for-
   profit litigation funder in Australia which has supported various climate-related cases,
   including the applicants in the Pabai and Kabai class action (discussed above).11

   While commercial litigation funding is more commonly available, commercial funders
   generally pursue cases with a damages element.12 Finding willing litigation funders, as
   well as legal advocates, may be easier in the context of climate litigation that offers
   the potential for recovery of damages.

       Air Force bases close to the localities in which the group members either lived and/or operated businesses. The three
       class actions were settled for million, with ~.04 million paid in legal fees and ~.5 million paid to a litigation funder.
     387

  6.5 Alternative Funding Models

   Canada and the United Kingdom have legislative frameworks for public interest costs
   orders that are more liberal in their departure from the standard costs orders than in
   Australia.

   The Supreme Court of Canada has recognised the availability of `advance costs' or
   `interim costs' in rare public interest cases, where litigants can have their legal costs
   paid for by the respondent during the course of proceedings to ensure the proceeding
   is not discontinued for lack of resources.13
   In certain jurisdictions, such as New Zealand14 and parts of Canada,15 the state itself
   will fund some public interest cases.

  6.6 Non-Economic Costs

   In addition to the economic costs posed by litigation, potential plaintiffs face
   considerable psychological and social costs, often exacerbated where proceedings
   relate to already emotionally and politically charged climate issues. These costs are
   experienced unevenly, and the legal system does not offer mitigation for particularly
   vulnerable plaintiffs.

  6.7 Non-Party Costs Orders

   In exceptional circumstances, a costs order may be made against a third party, or non-
   party to the litigation. A non-party costs order may only be made where it is in the
   interests of justice to do so.16

   The only precondition to the exercise of power to make an order for costs against a

   non-party is that the non-party `has sufficient connection with the unsuccessful party
   and the litigation to warrant the Court exercising its jurisdiction', being a connection
   that is material to the question of costs.17 The category of cases in which a costs order
   may be made against a third party is not closed.18 Though not a precondition, the
   cases where orders for costs have been sought against non-parties mainly concern an
   unsuccessful party who is impecunious.19

   In a recent case before the Federal Court of Australia, oil and gas company Santos Ltd
   sought a non-party costs order against the Environmental Defenders Office (`EDO').
   The costs relate to a claim against Santos Ltd by three First Nations people from Tiwi
   Islands, represented by the EDO, which sought an injunction to prevent Santos Ltd
   from commencing construction of a gas export pipeline on the basis that the cultural
   heritage of the site had not been properly assessed. Simon Munkara (the first applicant)
   successfully obtained an interim injunction preventing works until judgment was
   delivered.20 While initially successful, the application was later dismissed, which
   resulted in the injunction being discharged and an order being made for the applicants
   to pay the costs of Santos Ltd.21 The applicants were not in a position to satisfy the
   costs order. Santos Ltd subsequently sought a non-party costs order against EDO,
   arguing inter alia that EDO funded part of the proceedings, that EDO's role in the
   conduct of the proceedings was unreasonable and ought to attract cost consequences,
   and that EDO had a substantial interest in the outcome of the proceedings.22 In
   November 2024, orders were made by consent of the parties for EDO to pay Santos
   Ltd's indemnity costs of over AUD$9 million, representing Santos Ltd's full legal

   lawyers to be required to pay costs in this way, the case has prompted close scrutiny
   and reflection within the profession.

                 Anjali Sharma, the representative plaintiff in Sharma, who was only 17
                   during the proceeding, has publicly spoken about the `absolutely vile
                   racism' and sexist abuse she endured over the course of the
                   proceeding.24 She has also spoken about the significance of a young
                   woman of colour being the named lead plaintiff in the proceeding, in the
                   context of under-representation of people of colour in the climate

 7. Remedies

  Despite the inherent limitations of litigation, the courts have been a crucial site for the
  fight against the climate crisis.

  In addition to the primary purpose of providing redress to a victim, remedies perform a
  secondary function from the perspective of society as a whole; they `affirm, reinforce,
  and reify the fundamental values of society'.1 In the context of climate litigation, this
  secondary goal is weighty.

 7.1 Remedial Modesty

  The remedies granted by the courts in climate litigation to date have been characterised
  as `focused and modest'.2

  The courts are of course limited by the cases that come before them and the laws
  which they must apply. For example, the remedies available in the first wave of cases
  seeking review of administrative decisions were limited to ordering that the decision
  be remade.

  The issue of justiciability -- whether a case is suitable for judicial adjudication --
  also limits the outcomes available through the courts, serving as another screening or
  filtering device. Issues of justiciability have been determinative in denying climate-
  related claims in jurisdictions such as New Zealand and the United States, where the
  principle of non-justiciability has mainly been developed.

  In Australia, the judiciary has exhibited reluctance in climate litigation to date to
  adjudicate issues that are considered to fall under the legislative or executive branches'
  mandate due to the separation of powers. In Sharma, for example, Chief Justice
  Allsop, on appeal, held inter alia that the duty involved multidisciplinary

                                                                   391
                                                                                                                                                                392

  considerations underpinning climate change policy that were not appropriate for
  judicial resolution.3

  A study of global climate litigation in 2023 found that around 55% of the 549 cases
  in which either an interim or final decision had been made had outcomes that are
  favourable to climate action.4 But it was noted that this figure only tells `part of the
  story'.5 It is important to take a long view beyond the immediate success or failure
  of individual cases and consider both the direct legal and regulatory effects and the
  indirect effects that manifest in enhanced public profile of the issues at hand or shifts
  in behaviour and attitudes.

 7.2 Evolution of Cases

  The evolution of cases can lead to incremental changes to the procedural and
  substantive rights recognised before the courts.

  For example, early environmental cases where standing was an issue influenced more
  liberal standing provisions in certain environmental legislation (discussed above).
  In Sharma, the Honourable Justice Beach found insufficient closeness between the
  Minister and the children but left open the possibility of a future claim if any of the
  children suffered damage.6

  Moreover, each case offers inspiration for new claims, as exhibited by the gradual
  expansion of the types of claims comprising climate litigation. As climate litigation is
  increasingly transnational, the sharing of ideas and intellectual and financial resources
  is also increasingly occurring across borders.7

   Influencing Policy Change
   Strategic cases also obtain interactional remedies, impacting policy and regulatory
   responses from other institutions and producing longer term systemic remedies. The
   judiciary can have `a catalytic effect' on action taken by the legislature and executive
   to mitigate or adapt to climate change.8

   Osofsky argues that successful cases and those with little hope of succeeding have
   together helped to change the regulatory landscape at multiple levels of government
   by putting legal and moral pressure on a wide range of individuals and entities to act.9

   A successful outcome for the plaintiffs in Bushfire Survivors for Climate Action
   Inc v Environment Protection Authority10 resulted in the creation of the New South
   Wales Environmental Protection Authority's Climate Change Policy and Plan for
   2023-2026.

   Despite an unsuccessful outcome in the `Living Wonders' appeal,11 the Court
   recognised the inadequacies of the regulatory regime, with the majority judgment
   (Mortimer CJ and Colvin J) observing:12

               Notwithstanding [the] conclusions on the grounds of appeal, the arguments
               on this appeal do underscore the ill-suitedness of the present legislative
               scheme of the EPBC Act to the assessment of environmental threats such as
               climate change and global warming and their impacts on [matters of national
               environmental significance] in Australia.

   Following Sharma, Senator David Pocock introduced the Climate Change Amendment
   (Duty of Care and Intergenerational Climate Equity) Bill 2023 into the Australian
   Senate, which sought to legislate a similar duty to that which was rejected by the courts
   in Sharma, drafted in partnership with the lead plaintiff, Anjali Sharma.

   Influencing Behavioural Change

   Litigation can also influence the behaviour of public and private entities and the
   attitudes of society at large.

   Climate litigation against private actors has amplified corporate climate risk, impacted
   investors and influenced decision-making.

   Behavioural change has been a factor in settlements in climate litigation, including in
   O'Donnell (discussed above). In McVeigh v Retail Employees Superannuation Trust,13
   a case alleging failure of a superannuation fund to provide information related to
   climate change business risks and any plans to address those risks, the parties reached
   settlement whereby the Australian pension fund agreed to incorporate climate change
   financial risks in its investments and implement a net-zero by 2050 carbon footprint
   goal. In a recent application for preliminary discovery from ANZ relating to concerns
   about the bank's inadequate management of climate change and biodiversity loss risks,
   the parties agreed to the proceedings being discontinued after ANZ publicly reported
   that `climate risk' be elevated as a `key material risk'.14

   The impacts of climate litigation on perceptions and behaviour are compounded by the
   broader advocacy strategies of which litigation forms a part. Public interest litigation
   has been described as an `imperfect but indispensable strategy of social change',
   the effectiveness of which can be increased by better understanding its capacities
   and constraints.15 Litigation may complement other advocacy measures and broader
   discourse and cultural shifts, with the effect of `shaping narratives'.16

  7.3 SLAPP Suits

   Another important aspect to consider is the way in which litigation can be used to

   inhibit the achievement of climate outcomes. A review of global climate litigation filed
   in 2023 found that nearly 50 of the more than 230 recorded cases were not aligned with
   climate goals,17 the overwhelming majority of which were filed in the United States.

   Non-aligned climate litigation includes strategic litigation against public participation
   (`SLAPP').18 SLAPPs have been described as `lawsuits or threats of legal action which
   use abusive litigation tactics with the aim or effect of suppressing public participation
   and critical reporting on public interest matters'.19 SLAPPs raise questions about
   the way in which the legal system is used to stifle public participation, and the
   requirements and procedures which make this possible.

   The aim of a SLAPP is not necessarily to win but to tie up the time and resources
   of those against whom they are brought -- usually non-government organisations and
   activists with opposing views -- and discourage community dissent. SLAPPs can have
   wide-reaching and chilling effects, deterring public participation and threatening the
   viability of cases brought in the public interest.

   Recently, cases have been brought against Greenpeace entities by oil and gas
   companies Shell in the United Kingdom20 and Energy Transfer in the United States
   (North Dakota),21 in relation to protests about those companies' climate impacts.

   In Australia, the well-known environmental SLAPPs brought in 2004 by Gunns Ltd,

18. The other categories of non-aligned climate litigation referred to in the abovementioned report are environmental, social
       and governance (`ESG') backlash cases, which challenge the incorporation of climate risk into financial decision-
       making; just transition cases, which challenge the distributional impacts of climate policy or the processes by which
       policies were developed, normally on human rights grounds; and green v green cases, which concern potential trade-
       offs between climate and biodiversity or other environmental aims.

   a large Australian export woodchipper, against 17 individual activists and three
   environmental groups seeking to protect Tasmania's forests -- known as `Gunns 20'
   -- spawned a campaign for anti-SLAPP legislation to protect the right of public
   participation and protest.22 In 2008, the Australian Capital Territory passed the
   Protection of Public Participation Act 2008 (ACT) and is still the only Australian
   jurisdiction with anti-SLAPP legislation (though it has been criticised for being
   `watered-down' and not going far enough23). There have been recent calls for the
   introduction of federal anti-SLAPP legislation, growing out of concern that strategic
   litigation may limit community voices on issues of public interest and freedom of
   expression.24

   Anti-SLAPP legislation has gained momentum in other jurisdictions, including in the
   United States where 34 states have anti-SLAPP laws25 and in the European Union,
   which recently adopted new anti-SLAPP rules to introduce several procedural
   safeguards and measures to apply to manifestly unfounded claims or abusive court
   proceedings in civil matters with cross-border implications.26 Following the adoption
   of this directive in April 2024, Greenpeace International in July 2024 sent a Notice
   of Liability to Energy Transfer in relation to the abovementioned case, stating its
   intention to commence a claim under the European Union's anti-SLAPP directive to
   recover all damage and costs it has suffered as a result of the case against it unless
   Energy Transfer withdraws its case and accepts responsibility for the harm Greenpeace
   International has suffered.27

  7.4 Alternative Dispute Resolution

   It is also important to consider mechanisms other than litigation and their role in
   resolving climate-related disputes. Alternative dispute resolution (`ADR') is an
   umbrella term for a variety of private and court-annexed dispute resolution options,
   including mediation, conciliation, expert referral and arbitration.28 ADR mechanisms
   have been incorporated into the formal justice system and interact with and are
   enmeshed to some extent with litigation.29

   Broadly, the benefits of ADR are that ADR procedures may be faster, cheaper, less
   adversarial and more flexible than litigation. The framework of ADR enables more
   targeted and creative approaches, which can be tailored to the individual circumstances
   of each dispute. However, ADR may not be suitable where a dispute arises from
   incompatible values, such that meaningful compromise is not possible.

   Litigation is part of the public record, develops the common law and creates precedent,
   which ADR does not. Litigation also deals with defined rules and court processes, and
   court appellate processes provide a clear pathway for resisting decisions and correcting
   potential errors. These elements can be useful in certain circumstances, including in
   climate litigation and in other public interest cases where a clear public outcome may
   be of particular importance -- for example, cases seeking recognition of a new duty of
   care such as Sharma or cases seeking review of administrative decisions.

                                                 KEY QUESTIONS

                      What are the capacities and constraints of climate litigation in
                        achieving outcomes favourable to climate action?

                      What kinds of climate litigation may be suited to resolution
                        through ADR rather than litigation?

28. Bernard Cairns, Australian Civil Procedure (Thomson Reuters, 2019), 94.

29. For example, Part 28 of the Federal Court Rules 2011 (Cth) deals with alternative dispute resolution, with r 28.01
       providing that parties must, and the Court will, consider options for alternative dispute resolution, including mediation,
       as early as is reasonably practicable and that, if appropriate, the Court will help implement those options.

8. Conclusion

Despite the challenges of litigation, it is an immensely important site for addressing
the climate crisis. While no single case will remedy climate change, the growing
momentum and range of available remedies can have profound impacts.
This chapter has invited you to consider how elements of civil procedure present both
hurdles and enabling factors for climate litigation. We encourage you to continue
to interrogate the how and why of civil procedure, to enable imagination of new
possibilities within and beyond the law.

The varied and expanding nature of climate litigation is testing the boundaries of the
rules of evidence across a range of dimensions, from understanding what evidence
is relevant to a particular dispute to conceptions of what types of witnesses hold the
relevant knowledge and expertise to be able to speak about the impacts of climate
change. In this chapter we will consider whether current evidentiary rules and trial
practices are able to satisfactorily respond or adapt to novel litigation claims about
responsibility and liability for the negative impacts of a changing climate. We will start
by considering the central role of `relevance' in climate litigation, with a case study
examining the concept of `provisional relevancy'. From relevance, the chapter moves
on to the linked issue of expert evidence: when is expert evidence needed, and who is
qualified to be an expert witness in climate litigation? The next section considers the
issue of First Nations evidence in climate litigation, the issues of who is qualified to
give such evidence and what weight that evidence can be given in the trial.

                                             KEY QUESTIONS
       As you move through the chapter, keep these questions in mind:

                1. Who gets to speak about the impact of climate change in courts,
                    and who is involved in making those decisions?

                2. How do the existing rules of evidence admissibility shape the
                    narratives that are told about climate change in courts?

 1. Introduction

  As the impacts of anthropogenic climate change have become more apparent, the
  range and types of claims that have been brought to courts for adjudication around
  the world have become more varied. Recent cases range from class and representative
  actions brought by native title holders against government for failures to address the
  risks of climate change,1 to local authorities seeking compensation for the additional
  costs associated with climate mitigation,2 to individual disputes relating to land
  valuation.3 The varied and expanding nature of climate cases are testing the boundaries
  of the rules of evidence across a range of dimensions, from understanding what
  evidence is relevant to a particular dispute, to the regulation of expert evidence, to
  conceptions of what types of witnesses hold the relevant knowledge and expertise to
  be able to speak about the impacts of climate change. This chapter reflects on how
  climate litigation raises questions about the presumptions underpinning trial practice
  and evidentiary principles, as well as the adaptability of existing evidentiary rules in
  cases raising novel claims about responsibility and liability for the negative impacts of
  a changing climate.

  Just as the boundaries of substantive law, and evidence law more generally, are
  being tested in climate litigation, cases in Australia are testing the Uniform Evidence
  Law's (`UEL') claim to facilitate the admission of relevant evidence.4 This is because
  `relevant' evidence must speak to the `facts in issue' in the case, meaning facts over
  which the parties disagree, or which one party is expected to prove to the court.5
  In climate litigation across Australia, the facts in issue vary widely, encompassing
  administrative law and civil enforcement, matters of tort, consumer protection and

  climate risk disclosures, human rights claims and even criminal prosecutions.6 As
  such, what is ultimately considered `relevant' to a particular dispute can also vary
  widely. Different cases will circumscribe the boundaries of a dispute in different ways,
  but an overall trend we have observed is that courts are becoming more willing to
  accept, or even assume, evidence supporting the impacts of climate change.

  At the same time, in many cases the court will be constrained in terms of how much
  account it can take of those impacts within the boundaries of the particular dispute.7
  In practice this means that climate cases often recognise and incorporate discussion
  of a range of scientific reports and will hear evidence from traditionally qualified
  expert witnesses, but it will only be in certain types of cases that this evidence
  will end up having an actual bearing on the reasoning or outcome of the case. This
  evidence might be used to establish the existence of anthropogenic climate change
  itself, it might be attribution evidence led to establish causation for specific impacts of
  increased greenhouse gases or it might relate to flood risks in quotidian land valuation
  challenges. Where courts have accepted expert evidence in relation to the potential
  relevance or impacts of climate change,8 the focus has tended to be on formal questions
  of whether risks have been considered adequately. However, in a small number of
  cases, additional evidential issues have also arisen, including questions concerning
  when expert evidence will be needed, how that expert evidence is to be assessed and
  who can be recognised as an expert.

  In Australian climate cases, the inclusion of First Nations custodians as experts in
  relation to the effects of climate change on their traditional lands poses new challenges
  for the law of evidence. This is notwithstanding the inclusion within the UEL of
  specific sections designed to facilitate the admission of evidence from Aboriginal and
  Torres Strait Islander witnesses. To the extent that traditional cultural knowledge
  exists outside the parameters of the types of conventional `science' or forms of

      been charged with offences relating to climate protests have been prevented by the trial judge from even raising

expertise that courts have become familiar with, the legal system is having to adapt to
new ways of conducting court business.

We unpack these themes in this chapter, exploring how climate change may require
new ways of thinking about the application and limits of core evidential concepts,
including the rules governing relevance, expert witness evidence and the evidence of
First Nations traditional owners.

 2. What are the `Facts in Issue'? The Central Role of
 Relevance in Climate Litigation in Australia

  The rule of relevance is a threshold issue in evidence law. If evidence is not relevant,
  it is not admissible in a proceeding. No further questions arise about its admissibility.
  On the face of it, this is common sense -- if evidence has no logical bearing on
  the proceedings, why should it be admitted? However, behind the straightforward
  assertion that `irrelevant evidence is inadmissible' lies a complex legal framework.
  Case law demonstrates that the question of whether evidence has relevance or not can
  be hotly contested and may lead to significant differences of judicial opinion. This is
  in part because relevance is `highly fact-specific'.1 As a result, substantial discretion is
  given to judges to make assessments regarding relevance.

  In most Australian cases involving climate science or evidence of the impact of
  climate change, the challenges to the inclusion of evidence tend to occur at this early
  stage. That is, the challenges are not, as might be assumed, to the validity of the
  science, or even whether certain impacts can be attributed to the changing climate,
  but rather whether the decision-maker is able to take these impacts into account at
  all. A key example of this is the question that has been litigated in cases such as
  Gloucester Resources, where the appellants sought to exclude consideration of `Scope
  3 emissions' in the context of an application for a development consent to establish a
  new open cut coalmine in New South Wales.2 In Gloucester Resources, the Minister
  (through a delegate) had refused consent to open the new mine. The appellants
  accepted the causal link between greenhouse gas (`GHG') emissions (both generally
  and in relation to the specific project) and climate change but sought to both minimise
  the impact of the project emissions within the wider global context and to limit the
  scope of the Court's decision-making. In essence, they sought to put these facts outside

  what could be considered `in issue' in the litigation. Thus, questions of relevance
  are also questions about what and how much information a court can consider when
  making decisions, and to what extent broader contexts should be permitted to inform
  the determination of specific disputes between parties.

        CASE EXAMPLE: PROVISIONAL RELEVANCY, EXPERTS AND JUDICIAL REVIEW

     The decision in Environment Council of Central Queensland Inc v Minister for the
     Environment and Water3 (the `Living Wonders' case) provides reasons for three
     evidential rulings made in the context of two judicial review proceedings brought
     against the Minister for the Environment and Water. For context,4 and for those
     with limited knowledge regarding the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity
     Conservation Act 1999 (Cth), Jacqueline Peel's case analysis offers a short but
     comprehensive overview of the judicial review proceedings.5
     One ground of the review was that the Minister's decision not to revoke decisions
     enabling the expansion of coalmines in New South Wales was `affected by
     irrationality, was not logical or was unsupportable on the material before her'
     (Living Wonders case, para. 3). The applicants challenged the Minister's
     conclusion that she was not satisfied that the proposed action `will cause' any net
     increase in global greenhouse gas emissions, and that if they did so, the increase
     would not be a substantial cause of adverse impacts on protected, World Heritage
     listed areas such as the Great Barrier Reef. The applicants argued that the
     `complexity of the variables, and the improbability of reasoning in this way'
     undermined the Minister's approach.
     The applicants sought to support their arguments by reference to expert
     evidence, including an expert in modelling global scenarios to address the
     impacts of climate change. Importantly, this evidence had not been available to
     the Minister for the Environment when she made her decision. The respondent

     therefore objected, arguing that `the receipt of evidence that was not before a
     decision-maker in a judicial review proceeding is irrelevant and therefore
     inadmissible'.6 As the cited Waterford v Commonwealth case articulates, there is
     no error of law simply in making a wrong finding of fact. Therefore, an appellant
     cannot adduce new evidence to demonstrate an error of fact. However,
     McElwaine J noted that irrationality (as argued in the present case) presents an
     exception to this rule.7
     From [31]-[36], McElwaine J discusses whether it is open to him to receive the
     evidence as relevant. The following extracts contain interesting reflections on
     provisional relevance, expert evidence and judicial reviews:

                 [31] On the authorities that I have referred to, it is open to me to
                 receive the evidence as relevant evidence pursuant to s 55 of the
                 Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) if it could rationally affect, directly or
                 indirectly, the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in
                 issue in this proceeding. Conceptually, that gives rise to a difficulty:
                 what is the fact in issue? This is not a case where I am required to
                 find whether the Minister was or was not correct in forming the view
                 that she did as the correct or preferable conclusion on the material
                 before her: indeed it would be quite impermissible for me to do so as it
                 would involve an excursion into the merits. The issue is whether the
                 Minister's reasoning is affected by legal unreasonableness or
                 irrationality. That requires me to form a view about whether the
                 Minister made a decision that no reasonable Minister would have
                 made, if properly instructed as to the facts and the law.

                 ...

                 [32] It seems to me that this is the most significant hurdle faced by the
                 applicant on the admissibility question. When I raised this in argument,
                 an answer provided by Mr Nekvapil is that a rational Minister, in
                 making a decision that turns upon a substantial body of scientific
                 material, cannot ignore the fact that this material does not allow for

            probabilistic assessments of outcomes in modelling the likely impacts
            of climate change, because there are simply far too many variables.
            [33] I have concluded that the evidence of Dr Gidden should be
            received as provisionally relevant pursuant to s 57 of the Evidence
            Act because its relevance depends on my conclusion about the
            applicant's argument that as a matter of construction, the Act did not
            permit the Minister to reason in the way that is impugned by ground 6
            [the ground of review alleging irrationality]. In the event that the
            applicant's contention is accepted, the evidence may rationally affect
            my assessment of legal unreasonableness or irrationality. [emphasis
            added]

Notably, at [34] McElwaine J rejected one expert, Ms Rachel Wilson, on
relevance grounds, finding that her disagreement with a report that was before
the Minister was not relevant to determining whether the Minister proceeded or
concluded irrationally. As the judge noted, engaging in a resolution of competing
opinions, which concerned energy market models, would risk sliding into an
impermissible merits review.
This climate litigation case makes a key point about evidence law. It combines
interesting reflections about the role of judicial review in climate cases, while at
the same time offering a concise overview of the type of situation in which a judge
might make a provisional finding of relevancy. The exclusion of Ms Wilson's
expert evidence is a further example of the links between relevancy and the facts
in issue, with the judge's determination of the nature of the dispute shaping his
willingness to accept expert evidence.

                                          KEY QUESTIONS

               How does the exception for irrationality affect the usual
                 limitations on admitting post-decision expert evidence?

               How did McElwaine J apply the concepts of `relevance' and
                 `provisional relevance' under ss 55 and 57 of the Evidence Act
411

                    1995 (Cth) to determine whether expert climate modelling
                    evidence should be admitted? What does this suggest about
                    evidentiary thresholds in judicial review cases involving
                    environmental decisions?

 3. Expertise, Reliability and Assessing the Probative
 Value of Evidence

  In this section we look at when expert opinion evidence is needed, how expert
  opinion evidence is and can be evaluated, and as we move into the final section of this
  chapter, raise questions about who will be recognised as an expert in climate litigation
  cases. A fundamental principle of the adversarial trial (whether criminal or civil) is
  that witnesses offer their evidence by way of a narrative of fact(s) and refrain from
  offering their opinion or interpretation of those facts. This principle is codified under
  the UEL in s 76, which prohibits witnesses from offering their opinion if the purpose
  of adducing that opinion is proving the truth of the facts asserted in that opinion.1
  However, s 79 offers an exception to this exclusionary rule, allowing courts to hear
  from a witness whose opinion is considered relevant and where that opinion is based
  on the witness's specialised knowledge, which in turn must be based on their `training,
  study or experience'. Australian appellate courts, when interpreting the sections of
  the UEL dealing with the admissibility of expert opinion evidence, have tended to
  emphasise or prioritise the autonomy of the fact finder by limiting the role of the
  trial judge to that of `gatekeeper'. In line with the approach in IMM v The Queen,2
  courts have clarified that the UEL does not contain any expectation or requirement
  that the evidence led from an expert must be shown to be valid or reliable to be
  admissible. This is in contrast to the approach in the United States and Canada, which
  do incorporate an expectation that expert testimony and evidence should be shown
  to be reliable before it is admitted.3 Consequently, for judges in Australia, the key

1. In this sense, s 76 is a `functional' prohibition. As s 77 makes clear, if the expression of the opinion is relevant for some
      other purpose then it will not be excluded by s 76. However, the opinion will not be able to be relied on by the fact
      finder as proof its content or the asserted facts to which the opinion relates.

  question, once the expert opinion evidence has been shown to be relevant, will be how
  to weigh or assess the evidence, rather than whether it is admissible per se.

  Expert evidence sits somewhat awkwardly within the conventional adversarial fact-
  resolution process.4 The underlying rationale of the exception allowing experts to give
  evidence in the form of an opinion acknowledges that there will be matters which
  will sit outside of the capacity of the fact finder (whether this is a jury or a judge) to
  resolve without the assistance of an expert. So, for example, in Nature Conservation
  Council, the court explored a similar question in the context of the requirements of the
  Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005, which state that expert opinion evidence needs
  to be shown to be `reasonably necessary'.5

  Notwithstanding the underlying justification for the admission of expert opinion
  evidence, the fact finder remains at liberty to reject such evidence and indeed in
  some situations will be expressly permitted to substitute their own interpretation of the
  evidence for that of the expert's. Even where the evidence is complex or of a technical
  nature, a specialist court may be more readily inclined to reject the conclusions of
  an expert witness based on their own views as to the state of the science or accepted
  facts.6 For example, in a Land and Environment Court case David Kettle Consulting
  Pty Limited v Gosford City Council (`David Kettle')7 the judge made the following
  observation when evaluating an expert's evidence about the likely environmental
  impact of increasing the rate of groundwater extraction for commercial bottling:

              32 In response to a question in relation to ground water recovery rates, Mr
              Lane [expert witness for the applicant] confirmed that he had assumed a
              continuation of past rainfall and aquifer recharge patterns.

               on Climate Change makes it clear that the validity of such an assumption is
               improbable. Recent observational data show that relative to the worst-case
               scenario model developed by the IPCC, climate change is occurring more
               rapidly and at a greater magnitude than anticipated. These recent significant
               upwards increases in climate change rates coupled with an inherent
               uncertainty associated with the limited temporal data elucidating the ground
               water-extraction relationship, direct us to consider the matter with caution.

   The approach of the judge in this case, in relying on the IPCC report apparently
   independent of the evidence presented by the parties, implies that in that court at least,
   the existence and impacts of climate change have reached the status of information
   available to the court in a manner akin to a court taking `judicial notice' of climate
   change and its impacts.8 The principle of judicial notice, which allows a court to take
   into account facts without the need to hear evidence to support those facts, is expressed
   in s 144 of the UEL .

   The approach in David Kettle offers a contrast to the far narrower approach to
   the question of whether it is acceptable for a judge to rely on external published
   research as expressed in the case of Aytugrul v The Queen.9 In Aytugrul, the High
   Court was highly critical of an appellate court judge who incorporated reference to
   well-established psychological research and stressed that this was an unacceptable
   departure from the traditional role of the judge in an adversarial system. This variation
   points to some differences between specialist courts (where judges may develop their
   own subject matter expertise) and courts of general jurisdiction, when it comes to
   assessing expert evidence. These differences may be more apparent where there is
   variation in the application of the rules of evidence in different cases heard in the
   same court; a judge working on a court that can `inform itself on any matter in such
   manner as it thinks appropriate' in some matters will necessarily carry that experience
   and knowledge into other cases where the rules of evidence are applied. It may also
   promote more holistic or multidisciplinary decision-making.10

       Court. See Land and Environment Court Act 1979 (NSW) s 38.

10. The Hon. Justice Brian Preston points to the development of subject matter expertise amongst the judges and lawyers
       working in a specialist court as a significant benefit, with implications in terms of building judicial capacity and
     415

   One of the consequences of the restrictions placed on the capacity of the judge to
   exclude evidence that is unreliable, or of unknown reliability, is that this can facilitate
   the admission of weak or speculative evidence. Potentially this could extend to the
   admission of expert evidence denying the existence of anthropogenic climate change
   itself. Though this does not seem to have arisen so far in the Australian context, related
   strategies such as exaggerating levels of `uncertainty' or the social and economic
   benefits for particular projects, are very much apparent.11 So, while it may not be
   possible to challenge the admissibility of weak, speculative or unreliable evidence
   (especially noting the variable application of the formal rules of evidence), lawyers
   working in this area should none the less be attentive to the underlying assumptions
   utilised by experts, as well as how to understand the strengths and weakness of expert
   evidence as adduced. Even if there is a limited scope for the exclusion of evidence,
   there is still an expectation that the underlying facts or assumptions upon which the
   opinion is based have been established as sound. At the very least, the underlying
   facts or assumptions should be exposed to the judge making the decision about
   admissibility.12 These principles, even if not explicitly expressed into s 79, create
   space for the court to consider the basis of the evidence when deciding which expert
   evidence to accept. This approach can inform decisions made in the `shadow of the
   law' even in cases where the formal rules of evidence may not apply. An example of
   this approach can be seen in the David Kettle decision discussed earlier, and even more
   clearly in the detailed consideration of the expert evidence in Gloucester Resources.
   For example, in rejecting expert evidence proffered by the appellant (GRL), Preston
   CJ found that the underlying assumptions relating to `market substitution' and `carbon
   leakage' upon which the expert had based their opinion were `unproven', and
   consequently, that they were `unreliable and unhelpful'.13

   as specialist courts will increasingly be called upon to assess complex and contested
   technical evidence. This will especially be so if the types of cases brought in Australia
   increase in line with trends overseas, including cases seeking compensation for the
   negative impacts of climate change. The implications of the removal of a requirement
   for `reliability' as a condition of admissibility under the UEL have predominantly
   been explored in the context of criminal trials.14 Correspondingly, there is limited
   jurisprudence in Australia that has addressed this question directly in the context of
   climate change litigation, but this may shift as more cases come before the courts
   where the relevance, accuracy and reliability of attribution evidence linking a specific
   negative impact to a specific GHG emitter is at issue.15 As noted, the key questions
   that are likely to arise will relate not to the existence of anthropogenic climate change
   itself, but rather to the scope of the impacts in a particular case, or whether the expert
   evidence is sufficient to link, or attribute, a specific impact to a particular project
   and its associated emissions. These will raise complex questions for the courts around
   how to frame the substantive question of causation, as well as how to assess whether
   evidence can meet the relevant tests.16

   Climate litigation is, of course, not the first context in which courts have been called on
   to address complex questions of causation drawing on (competing) scientific evidence,
   especially when we look at the history of representative or class actions in what
   became known as `toxic tort' litigation.17 These tort claims relied on novel medical
   and scientific evidence and on epidemiological, probabilistic reasoning to establish
   a causal link between, for example, exposure to a carcinogen and the illness(es)

       Uniform Evidence Law' (2022) 50(1) Federal Law Review 104-27.

16. So far, questions of `attribution' have arisen but at a general level. For example, in the Gloucester Resources case, it was
       accepted that the proposed mine would add to global emissions and thus exacerbate the impacts of climate change. See
       discussion in Thomas L Muinzer, Major Cases in Climate Law: A Critical Introduction (Hart, 2025) 156-7.

       link maternal consumption of a pharmaceutical to birth defects that established the role of the judge as `gatekeeper' in
       relation to expert scientific evidence. See Daubert v Merrel Dow Pharmaceuticals Inc 509 US 579 (1993).

   experienced by the claimants.18 Similarly, the attribution evidence being proffered in
   cases in other jurisdictions, where claims are being made that specific effects can be
   attributed to the actions of a specific polluter (or government), means that plaintiffs
   must rely on complex modelling and attribution science evidence to establish a causal
   connection between specific conduct (or omission) of the defendant and the plaintiff's
   loss or damage. For many of these cases to date, Stuart-Smith et al argue that the
   evidence presented was not the strongest available, often lagging behind the `state of
   the art' of climate science.19 Further, Stuart-Smith et al argue that this was in many
   respects a function of the ways that cases were framed and of the existing legal tests
   rather than a limitation in the evidence available.20 In this sense, the ways that expert
   evidence is being introduced and managed in climate litigation shows strong parallels
   with the history and experiences of plaintiffs in toxic tort class actions, and is similarly
   consistent with critical insights that scientific evidence generated for courts will in
   many respects be shaped or `co-produced' by and through that court process.21 This
   has implications for the way(s) that courts receive and assess expert opinion evidence
   adduced in climate litigation, as well as related environmental law actions.

   While courts rarely appreciate the complex role that law, legal processes and legal
   systems play in co-producing scientific evidence and knowledge, they are attuned to
   the problem of `partisanship' in the production and presentation of expert evidence.
   Concerns about partisan experts underpin many of the more recent procedural reforms
   in this area, including the development of expert codes of conduct,22 the rise of single

       of co-production does not simply replicate concerns about `partisanship' of expert-led evidence in climate cases.
       Emerging from science and technology studies, co-production recognises the ways that judicial conceptions of what
       qualifies as `good' or `reliable' science have shaped both the application of the rules and the types of scientific or
       expert evidence that will be produced to meet these legal standards.

   or court-appointed experts, and the use of concurrent evidence.23 Dealing with the
   reality and the perceptions of expert partisanship will be an ongoing challenge for
   lawyers working in this area, especially those acting for clients seeking remedies
   for the negative impacts of climate change or to prevent developments that will
   increase GHG emissions. Attention also needs to be paid to whether certain parties,
   or witnesses, are more likely to be found to have engaged in deliberate partisanship
   or could be accused of advocacy (or activism) over others.24 At the same time, while
   the capacity of the substantive law to recognise novel claims may in the end be both
   limiting and determinative, the strength and independence of the expert evidence,
   including that relying on attribution science, being adduced in these cases will also be
   critical.

      In Munkarra v Santos NA Barossa Pty Ltd (No 3) [2024] FCA the applicants
      (traditional custodians of sea country located around the Tiwi Islands) sought to
      prevent the construction of a gas pipeline close to the Tiwi Islands, on the basis
      that the construction would harm sites of cultural and spiritual significance. An
      additional layer of complexity in this case was that the application (to prevent the
      construction of the pipeline) was also opposed by traditional custodians of the
      area (from different clan groups), and this raised difficult questions for the court to
      resolve in terms of which witnesses possessed the appropriate `cultural authority'

23. See Gary Edmond and Mehera San Roque, `Just(,) Quick and Cheap? Contemporary Approaches to the Management of
       Expert Evidence' in Michael Legg (ed), The Future of Dispute Resolution (LexisNexis Butterworths, 2016).

24. Hasani (n 3, 101) points to expert bias as a reason to exclude opinion evidence based on climate models. This would be
       consistent with trends in the toxic tort cases, as well as other areas, where the evidence of plaintiffs (in civil cases)
       or defendants (in criminal cases) is more likely to be subjected to higher evidentiary thresholds or expectations. See
       for example, discussion in Rachel Dioso-Villa, `Is the Expert Admissibility Game Fixed?: Judicial Gatekeeping of
       Fire and Arson Evidence' (2016) 38(1) Law and Policy 54 - 80. It may be that examples of this type of differential
       treatment are apparent in the critical reception of the expert evidence in Munkarra v Santos (No. 3) [2024] FCA 9.
       While legitimate criticism may be made of some of the expert witness conduct (for example the lack of disclosure) the
       approach of Charlesworth J to the interactions between the lawyers, applicants and experts can be contrasted with the
       rather more relaxed attitude of the full Federal Court in New Aim Pty Ltd v Leung [2023] FCAFC 67 towards lawyers'
       involvement in the drafting of an expert witness's report.

   to speak for and about the country through which the pipeline was to be built.
   Notable for this chapter were the concerns raised about the lack of independence
   or `partisanship' of expert witnesses, as well as concerns that Indigenous
   witnesses (and potentially some expert witnesses) had been improperly coached
   by the legal representatives acting for the applicants (the Environmental
   Defenders Office). On the former issue, the court was highly critical of the
   evidence of two of the applicant's expert witnesses, both anthropologists. The
   court noted that one had failed to disclose co-authorship of a report containing
   recommendations relating to risks of harm to cultural heritage on the seabed
   [896], and that another's report was compromised by his presence and
   involvement in a meeting between the applicants and their EDO lawyers [1134],
   finding that the independence of both experts had been compromised. On the
   latter issue, the court noted that `the involvement of lawyers in the preparation of
   witness statements in not of itself unusual' [246]. However, when comparing the
   written statements with the oral evidence of those witnesses in cross-
   examination, the court held that in this case the written witness statements
   proffered by the applicants were not an accurate record of `words actually spoken
   by the witnesses and recorded verbatim.' [246].

                                             KEY QUESTIONS

                  In light of cases like David Kettle, to what extent can courts rely
                    on external scientific sources (such as IPCC reports) when
                    assessing expert evidence? How does this intersect with the
                    principles of `judicial notice' under s 144 of the UEL, and what
                    risks or benefits does this pose in climate litigation?

                  Given that Australian evidence law does not require expert
                    evidence to be shown as reliable to be admissible, should courts
                    adopt a more rigorous approach -- especially in climate cases
                    where attribution science is central to causation? What are the
                    implications of the current approach for the admissibility of both
                    robust and potentially weak or partisan expert testimony?

                  Are the existing Codes of Conduct for Expert Witnesses
                    appropriately adapted to the nature and complexity of
                                                                                                                                420

environmental and climate change cases? Should these Codes
be reformed to include or cover Indigenous witnesses who are
providing (expert) opinion testimony about the content of their
traditional laws and customs?
   421

 4. Witnessing Climate Justice, First Nations Experts
 and `Cultural Evidence'

  The inclusion of First Nations custodians as experts in relation to the effects of
  climate change on their traditional lands poses new and important challenges for the
  law of evidence in Australia.

  While the UEL incorporates a specific exception that allows members of an
  Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander group to offer opinions about the existence
  or content of their own traditional laws and customs (s 78A), it has not been
  unproblematic in its application. This demarcation within the UEL sets up a boundary
  between witnesses offering expert opinion and other witnesses who may also be
  drawing on different forms of `specialised knowledge'. And, despite a broadening of
  the scope of what constitutes `specialised knowledge' in other contexts,1 we have not
  yet seen s 79 used to allow an Indigenous witness to give evidence as an `expert'. At
  the same time, s 78A seems also to be underutilised. This exception was explicitly
  intended to address the anomaly that arose when those who held the relevant
  knowledge of the law or custom in question could not offer an opinion about the
  content and nature of those laws and instead had to rely on anthropologists or linguists
  to speak for them. Notwithstanding the scope of s 78A, we continue to see Aboriginal
  or Torres Strait Islanders characterised as lay witnesses rather than witnesses
  possessing a cultural expertise.2

  As custodians of an oral cultural tradition without documentary evidence in support,
  one of the most significant issues in relation to the admissibility of First Nations
  expertise is the rule relating to hearsay. Indeed, the Australian Law Reform
  Commission (`ALRC') has noted that the central problem continues to be `the discord

1. For example, the recognition of investigators with no training, qualifications or demonstrated proficiency as `ad hoc'
      experts allowed to offer their opinions about the identity of a person in CCTV footage, or a speaker in a surveillance
      recording.

2. See, eg, Munkarra v Santos (No. 3) [2024] FCA 9. See also Gloucester Resources Limited v Minister for Planning
      [2019] NSWLEC 7 (`Gloucester Resources'). The social impact assessment was found by the court to be substantially
      deficient because of its failure to incorporate First Nations firsthand opinions about impacts of the project on First
      Nations culture and wellbeing (see paras 340-52).

                                                                   421
                                                                                                                                                                422

  between the rationale underpinning the hearsay and opinion rules in the common law
  system and the [First Nations] oral tradition of knowledge'.3 In Mabo and Others v
  Queensland (No. 2) (`Mabo No. 2'),4 Eddie Mabo's testimony about the laws and
  customs of the Meriam people resulted in over 300 `hearsay' objections, based on
  the fact that the source of his knowledge was information passed on to him by his
  grandfather.5

  The native title case of De Rose v State of South Australia (`De Rose'),6 heard in
  the Federal Court in 2013, provides another example of the evidentiary problems
  associated with oral histories. In De Rose, O'Loughlin J had to consider whether the
  statement `this is your grandmother's country', told to a witness by a now deceased
  First Nations person, was admissible under the UEL as evidence that the grandmother
  was in fact from that particular country. Deciding that the statement was inadmissible
  under the hearsay rule, O'Loughlin J went on to explain that official birth certificates
  exist as proof of place of birth and that as such, oral evidence would not suffice. The
  problem is that for many First Nations people from remote areas there are no written
  records of their birth, and oral evidence is the only evidence that exists. Almost every
  aspect of First Nations history and culture faces this same problem, magnified by the
  centuries and even millennia through which cultural knowledge and practices have
  been transmitted.

  The FCA considered the problems of hearsay evidence in relation to historical claims
  of First Nations witnesses in Mary Yarmirr and Others v The Northern Territory of
  Australia and Others.7 In his decision, Olney J confirmed that ss 73(1)(d) and 74(1) of
  the UEL relating to evidence of reputation concerning history and family relationships,
  and of reputation concerning the existence, nature or extent of a public or general right,
  enable a court to have regard both to the evidence of witnesses who have recounted

5. On the other hand, in Milirrpum v Nabalco Pty Ltd (1971) 17 FLR 141, where a major objection to the expert evidence
      was its hearsay basis, Blackburn J argued that as long as the opinion evidence was based on expertise and not purely
      on hearsay statements made to the expert by First Nations people, it was admissible.

   details concerning relationships and to traditional practices that have been passed
   down to them by way of oral history, as well as to matters recorded by ethnographers
   and other observers.

   However, the ALRC points out that these provisions may not always be sufficient to
   allow the admission into evidence of oral histories and accounts, because this type of
   evidence may not readily fit within the categories of admissible hearsay in the UEL.8
   For example, there may be disputes about whether particular evidence is of `reputation
   concerning' a `general right', in the terms of s 74(1), if it is only a building block in
   showing the rights of a group of First Nations people in respect of certain land.

   Other countries (eg Papua New Guinea) have dispensed with the need for strict legal
   proof when it comes to matters of custom,9 and the ALRC has suggested that allowing
   for flexibility and informality might be the best way to ensure that evidence law fulfils
   its mission of enabling relevant information into the trial.10

   An interesting recent example of this flexibility is demonstrated by the 2022 decision,
   in Waratah Coal Pty Ltd v Youth Verdict Ltd & Ors,11 for the Queensland Land Court
   to hear, for the first time, from First Nations witnesses `on Country', and further,
   also for the first time, to follow First Nations protocols when doing so. The Court
   travelled to remote areas in Queensland to hear directly from traditional custodians
   of the land regarding the impacts that climate change is having on the lives and
   futures of First Nations peoples.12 Ultimately the court rejected the application to build
   a new coalmine on the basis that the mine's contribution to climate change would
   amount to an unjustified limit on a number of human rights, including the right of
   First Nations peoples in respect of their culture and traditional lands. Another sign of
   change is found in Gloucester Resources, where the court found that the social impact
   assessment at the centre of the Minister's decision-making process was substantially

                                                 KEY QUESTIONS
                      Could Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander ecological knowledge

                        -- for example, observations of long-term environmental changes
                        -- be considered a form of `specialised knowledge' under s 79? If
                        not, what are the consequences of excluding this perspective
                        from expert evidence?
                      Given the centrality of oral transmission in First Nations cultures,
                        should the hearsay rules in the UEL be amended or interpreted
                        more flexibly to accommodate oral histories as reliable evidence?
                        How do decisions like Mabo (No. 2) and De Rose illustrate the
                        shortcomings of current hearsay exceptions in this context?
                      In Munkarra v Santos NA Barossa, the applicants sought to
                        present some of their evidence by way of song and dance
                        evidence (this is referred to as a demonstration in the judgment
                        (see s 53, UEL). This application was refused (though the
                        applicants were permitted to tender video evidence). Do you
                        think that the rules of evidence should be amended to encourage
                        courts to permit evidence from Indigenous witnesses to be
                        adduced in alternative forms and modes?

 5. Conclusion

  In this chapter we have explored some of the ways in which concepts, principles
  and rules from evidence law are engaged and discussed in climate litigation. At the
  same time, some recent cases demonstrate that evidentiary rules and categories could
  be expanded and developed in productive ways. The increasing number and breadth
  of climate cases also presents an opportunity to reflect on some of the fundamental
  concepts that underpin evidence law, including relevance, reliability and the nature
  of `knowledge'. If the goal of the UEL has been to ensure that all relevant and
  admissible evidence is before the fact finder, the complex, and sometimes novel,
  claims raised in climate litigation offer a lens through which to understand how some
  of the traditional rules of evidence have worked to narrow the role of courts, as well
  as creating hierarchies when it comes to witnessing and accounting for the impacts of
  climate change. For example, an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander witness may be
  more likely to be characterised as a `lay' witness even when they, arguably, possess
  specialised knowledge about relevant laws and customs. A further challenge has been
  posed by the potential role in climate cases for `civic evidence' or `citizen science',
  as some commentators argue for the development of frameworks that will enable
  those affected by climate change to offer evidence of their direct experience of the
  negative impacts of climate change.1 Traditional frameworks and divisions between
  `expert' and `lay' witnesses do not easily accommodate this category of knowledge.
  The challenge for lawyers working in this growing area of practice will be to find the
  gaps and opportunities to develop and expand the law to better accommodate these
  new forms of knowledge.

  Lawyers have a unique role to play in the transition to a low-carbon, sustainable
  economy. The International Bar Association1 (`IBA') has recognised the severity of
  the threats posed by the climate crisis to human society and the importance of legal
  professionals' work in bringing about a just transition. Its Climate Crisis Statement

      societies.' It was established in 1947 `with the aim of protecting and advancing the rule of law globally ... [and to

  practice' and `to engage with current and future legislative policy making efforts to
  address the climate crisis.'2 Likewise, the Law Council of Australia's Climate Change
  Policy states that `[l]awyers should be alive to the unfolding legal implications of
  climate change and its consequences, and they should be informed, skilled and ready
  to assist clients on climate change-related legal matters, within their areas of skill and
  competence.'3

  Lawyers work on all sides of the climate crisis. A `climate conscious' approach, which
  `requires an active awareness of the reality of climate change and how it interacts with
  daily legal problems,'4 is increasingly relevant to all areas of practice. Some examples
  of `climate conscious' legal work are:

            Lawyers are important architects of regulatory frameworks for clean
              energy, sustainable economies, environmental protection, etc. Lawyers
              have developed legal resources to support the transition to clean energy --
              eg The Chancery Lane Project; Legal Pathways to Deep Decarbonisation in
              Australia.

            Lawyers advise business clients about compliance with existing regulatory
              frameworks and how those frameworks are likely to change to take account
              of climate responsibilities; in this role they can support and encourage
              clients to be good climate actors.

            Lawyers prosecute breaches of environmental standards.

            Lawyers educate communities about their rights to engage in legal
              processes on climate change grounds.

            Lawyers act for claimants in public interest cases that aim to hold
              governments and the corporate sector to account for climate damage.5

  This chapter first examines the idea that lawyers have a special role to play in
  addressing the climate crisis. It then discusses the regulation of lawyers in Australia,
  including the conduct rules, and whether the current regulatory framework facilitates
  or impedes lawyers acting as `climate conscious' lawyers. Finally, it considers gaps in
  the rules -- that is, where the rules provide little or no guidance for a climate conscious
  lawyer -- before discussing current developments and future trends.

                    lawyers do in fact have a special role to play in addressing
                      climate change.

                    you think the conduct rules need reform to better enable lawyers
                      to work in a `climate conscious' way.

 1. Professional Ethics and Climate Change

 1.1 A `Special Role'?

  Chief Judge Brian Preston reminds us that a profession is more than an occupation
  or a business, and that the legal profession's claim to its special status in our society
  involves an obligation to abide by moral and ethical principles',1 not just the conduct
  rules. Preston quotes Justice Spigelman, who emphasises that the profession `has
  an ethical dimension and values justice, truth and fairness'.2 These professional
  obligations lead some lawyers, including Preston, to argue that lawyers have a
  particular responsibility to address climate change in their work. Dr David Boyd,
  UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights and the Environment, reminds us that
  climate change raises issues of justice, and consequently `the legal profession has a
  moral obligation to stand up and join the movement for a cleaner, greener, healthier
  future'.3 John Dernbach, an authority on sustainable development, climate change
  and environmental law, likewise contends that all lawyers `have a unique and
  important role to play in protecting life on earth'.4 He argues that

              [l]awyers matter here because of the special role they play in advocating,
              drafting, implementing, and litigating over the meaning of laws. Law is a
              necessary means of addressing climate change, although certainly not the
              only one. And because climate change is also about justice, it is particularly
              within the purview of lawyers.5

  So how does the regulation of lawyers facilitate or impede lawyers playing this
  `special role'?

1.2 Regulation of Lawyers in Australia

Australian lawyers are regulated by state and territory legislation. The Legal
Profession Uniform Law (in NSW, Victoria and WA) and the Legal Profession Acts
(Qld, SA, NT, ACT, Tasmania) set up the legislative framework that governs legal
practice in each jurisdiction. While there are jurisdictional differences, the framework
is similar enough for present purposes to discuss as one. We reference the Legal
Profession Uniform Law (`LPUL') and the Legal Profession Uniform Law Australian
Solicitors' Conduct Rules (`LPUL ASCR') because they cover the majority of lawyers
in Australia (about 80%).

The head legislation (the LPUL) regulates admission as a lawyer. As well as gaining
the appropriate educational qualifications, an applicant for admission must be a `fit
and proper' person to be a lawyer (s 17, LPUL). A myriad of factors are relevant to
whether a person is `fit and proper', including whether they have a criminal conviction.
We suggest you have a look at the Victorian Guidelines for Applicants for Admission.
The onus is on the applicant to disclose all relevant matters to the admitting authorities.
Once a person has been admitted as a lawyer, they become an officer of the Supreme
Court of the jurisdiction in which they are admitted (s 25 LPUL) and as such subject
to professional disciplinary standards and potential sanctions.

The conduct rules (LPUL ASCR) provide a guide as to the conduct expected of
lawyers. The rules are detailed in places (eg concerning duties in relation to litigation)
but provide limited guidance in relation to many aspects of legal practice. We turn to
discuss those rules now.

1.3 LPUL ASCR

It is very clear in Australia that a lawyer's paramount duty is to the court and the
administration of justice (rule 3.1). In a litigious context, the rules and case law flesh
out what this duty means; see rules 17-29. Outside of litigation (90% of lawyers are
not litigators), the duty is just as important, but more amorphous. Some legal ethicists
use terms such as `fidelity to the law' or `duty to the law' rather than duty to the
administration of justice. In the United Kingdom, the wording of the duty requires
lawyers to act `in a way that upholds the constitutional principle of the rule of law and
   431

  the proper administration of justice'.6 There is general agreement among legal ethicists
  that this duty includes both obeying the law and counselling clients to comply with
  the law, and contributing to the proper and efficient administration of justice by the
  courts and the legal system generally.7 Rules 4 and 5 add some detail to the duty. For
  example, rule 4 requires a solicitor to `avoid any compromise to their integrity and
  professional independence', and to comply with the rules and the law. Rule 5 provides
  that a lawyer must not engage in conduct that is likely to either (i) be prejudicial to,
  or diminish the public confidence in, the administration of justice, or (ii) bring the
  legal profession into disrepute. In sum, lawyers have an overriding duty to uphold and
  maintain our legal system, the administration of justice and the rule of law.

  Climate change threatens the administration of justice in a myriad of ways. More
  frequent and severe weather events disrupt the day-to-day administration of justice.
  More significantly, as chapter 2 explains, climate change causes irreparable harm to
  natural systems, which leads to food, water and energy insecurity, widespread poverty
  and increased volume and intensity of disputes, which in turn presents fundamental
  challenges to economic, governmental and legal systems.8 Justice Francois Kunc
  warns that `[i]nadequately mitigated climate change could undo our social order and
  the rule of law itself'.9 Thus, there is a clear link between lawyers taking a climate
  conscious approach in their businesses and in advising clients, and support for the
  administration of justice and the rule of law.

  Lawyers' duties to their clients are also relevant here. Subject always to the paramount
  duty (rule 3), a lawyer must act in the best interests of their client. This principle is
  captured in rule 4.1.1 and the lawyer's related duty to provide competent advice under
  rule 4.1.3.

   A client's best interests are determined by the client, not the lawyer: rule 8 provides
   that `a solicitor must follow a client's lawful, proper and competent instructions'.
   However, rule 7 requires a lawyer to advise the client about the risks and benefits of
   their proposed course of action and any alternatives the lawyer considers appropriate
   to the client's situation. Looking out for the best interests of a client in the context
   of climate change means being alert to the many ways climate change may affect a
   client's situation. Climate change is affecting almost every area of practice -- it is
   as much `a small scale, local and immediate issue as it is a global issue.'10 It affects
   individual clients looking to purchase a house (flood zones, bushfire risk, sea level
   rise, insurance) through to global corporate clients required to comply with increasing
   regulation of carbon emissions. The populations served by Legal Aid and community
   legal centres are particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change because they
   may not have the financial capacity to relocate or adapt their day-to-day practices. 11

   Competence is a fundamental professional duty,12 and an aspect of a lawyer's
   contractual obligations and tortious duty of care to a client. Dernbach argues that
   competence requires lawyers to have a basic understanding of climate change science
   and how climate change will affect their clients in the short and longer term.13 As well
   as understanding the impact of climate change on a client's activities, competence also
   requires a lawyer to be across climate-related legal changes in the areas in which they
   practise. Guidance from the Law Society of NSW (`NSW Guidance') recognises that
   competence now incorporates:

             a duty to warn a client of potential legal risks; and

             a duty to disclose any climate legal risks of which the lawyer is aware.

     433

   The NSW Guidance contains a useful table of climate-related legal risks in specific
   areas of practice. For example, corporate clients require advice on the `rapidly
   evolving international and national policy and regulatory regimes' which require
   disclosure of carbon emissions etc. We would add that a corporation's social licence
   is likely to be increasingly linked to its environmental credentials, so reputational
   risk is something lawyers should consider when giving advice. The NSW Guidance
   also notes the increase in climate-related litigation and the need to advise clients
   on `developing appropriate mitigation and oversight mechanisms and avoiding
   misrepresentation' (ie climate greenwashing).

  1.4 Choice of Client

   Choice of client is also addressed in the NSW Guidance. Solicitors are not required
   to act for any person/corporation seeking their services and the Guidance notes that
   `climate-related issues may be valid considerations in determining whether to act'.
   Those considerations include:

             the client's willingness to engage on climate-related issues;

             any potential impact on the firm's reputation; and

             any apparent conflict with the client organisation's stated values.

   The NSW Guidance treats client choice as `a matter for individual solicitors and
   law firms, recognising solicitors' professional obligations'. Some lawyers acting for
   fossil fuel interests argue that those `professional obligations' translate to `everyone
   deserves legal advice' and there is consequently a professional obligation to act for
   such clients. In contrast, Steven Vaughan wonders `whether, or how often, we see the
   vice of environmental harms and associated law firm profits dressed up by lawyers
   in large firms as the professional virtue of providing neutral legal advice'.14 With this
   concern in mind, the group Lawyers Are Responsible invites lawyers to sign a pledge
   (Declaration of Conscience) not to act on any new fossil fuel projects (nor to prosecute
   environmental protestors).

                                                 KEY QUESTIONS

                      Do you think the decision to take on a fossil fuel client is a
                        question of professional responsibility or a business decision, or
                        a mix of both?

                      Would you consider acting for a fossil fuel client? Why or why
                        not?

  1.5 Litigation Ethics

   It is important to keep in mind that if you are a litigator, common law and civil
   procedural rules impose what might be considered ethically inspired obligations on
   parties, witnesses (especially expert witnesses) and lawyers to conduct the litigation
   in ways that enable the just, efficient and timely resolution of disputes.15 Bringing
   claims for collateral or improper purposes, or without a proper basis in law, or using
   tactics that cause undue cost or delay such as misuse of the discovery process, are
   all behaviours that can be sanctioned by the court and may leave lawyers open to
   disciplinary charges, particularly if the lawyer's behaviour is inconsistent with the
   duty to the court, or otherwise constitutes disreputable conduct. (Remember that rule
   5 proscribes conduct that is likely to `bring the profession into disrepute'.) We look at
   litigation conduct further in Case Study 1 at the end of this chapter. If you have already
   studied or are currently studying civil procedural law, you might want to consider
   whether tactics such as writing letters with the express intention of intimidating
   recipients in circumstances where any subsequent action would be `doomed to fail'
   or pursuing security for costs against representatives of the Indigenous community or
   other public interest groups are also procedurally appropriate.

  1.6 Gaps

   While it is unlikely that climate change creates unique legal ethical challenges, issues
   may arise for the climate conscious lawyer in terms of scoping their duty to advise,

15. See, eg, Adrian Zuckerman et al, Zuckerman on Australian Civil Procedure [1.40]-[1.63]
     435

   disclosing to authorities any significant climate harms by the client, and withdrawing
   from the retainer.

   Rule 7 requires a solicitor `to provide clear and timely advice to assist a client to
   understand relevant legal issues and to make informed choices about action to be taken
   during the course of a matter ...' When an existing client proposes action that would
   harm the environment, it is open to the lawyer to advise against such action, citing the
   various risks that may arise.16 But if a client does not accept advice, and the client's
   instructions are lawful, neither the conduct rules nor the NSW Guidance provide
   practical guidelines for the lawyer who does not want to facilitate environmental harm.

   Unless the lawyer is expressly under a `gatekeeper' obligation to disclose client
   wrongdoing (see rule 9.2.2),17 rule 9's requirement that lawyers maintain strict
   confidence in client matters leaves lawyers with little discretion to disclose actual or
   anticipated client-caused or client-facilitated climate harms. Rule 9.2 permits lawyers
   to disclose confidential information `for the sole purpose of avoiding the probable
   commission of a serious criminal offence' or `for the purpose of preventing imminent
   serious physical harm to [a] person', but if the environmental damage caused by the
   client's actions is not caught by these (discretionary) exceptions, the lawyer must
   remain silent.

   It follows that a lawyer who is personally conflicted about acting for a client who
   engages in environmentally harmful activity should carefully consider whether or not
   to accept the client in the first place. While it is acceptable as a solicitor to decline
   representation (as we have discussed), it is likely more difficult to withdraw from
   the retainer once established. While the solicitor might arguably have a `just cause'
   to terminate the retainer, with notice, under rule 13, the scope of `just cause' is
   imprecise. It clearly permits withdrawal in some circumstances -- for example, where
   a solicitor cannot act without breaching other professional obligations, or possibly
   where the client refuses to follow advice -- but the scope of conscientious objection
   as a ground for withdrawal has not been tested. The lawyer might argue that there is a

16. Vaughan seems to go further, arguing that the requirement that lawyers act with integrity, independence and in the client's
       best interests equates to an obligation to actively advise against environmentally harmful actions: ibid 33.

17. See further Dal Pont [10.70]-[10.80].
                                                                                                                                                                  436

   breakdown in the relationship between the solicitor and client in these circumstances,18
   but if the personal conflict was foreseeable at the point of entering into the retainer,
   then withdrawing later could be problematic, unless the client's conduct crosses some
   unanticipated boundary.
   Similar issues in relation to the American Bar Association Model Rules have led
   United States lawyer and scholar Tom Lininger to argue that lawyers' positive ethical
   duties should include environmental protection. In his view, the purpose of a
   professional ethics code `is to ensure that practitioners attend to issues of transcendent
   importance',19 and environmental protection is one such issue. Lininger proposes
   several options for reforming the rules, ranging from a new discretion to breach
   confidentiality `to prevent imminent, substantial and irremediable environmental
   harm'20 through to a new duty to inform the court of environmental risks (if a witness
   gives contrary evidence).21

 2. Developments in Professional Ethics in Response
 to Climate Change

 2.1 Climate Conscious Lawyering

  This book invites you to become a `climate conscious lawyer', and chapter 1 briefly
  introduces the term `climate conscious lawyering'. Chief Judge Preston1 discusses five
  elements of a climate conscious approach, some of which we have touched on above,
  and the others we turn to now.

  2.1.1 Holistic Legal Advice
  As discussed above, the Law Council of Australia (`LCA') and the NSW Guidelines
  now acknowledge the importance of advice that considers potential climate risks,
  liabilities and reputational damage that may flow from a client's proposed actions.

  2.1.2 Identification, Interpretation and Application of Legal Rules
  Legislation and other legal rules require interpretation. Preston suggests that lawyers
  adopt an interpretation that promotes climate change goals, `provided that doing so
  is consonant with and required by the principles of genuine interpretation'.2 Further,
  given that the law in many areas is developing rapidly in the face of climate change,
  lawyers should advise with a view to how courts of the future are likely to rule on
  liabilities and responsibilities for climate-related harms.

  2.1.3. Ethical Duties of Lawyers
  In Preston's view, `ethical thinking about climate change and its consequences should
  pervade all aspects of legal practice'.3 As discussed above, climate change is

2. Preston (n 1) 56.
3. Ibid 61. See also Vaughan's argument (n 16).

                                                                   437
                                                                                                                                                                438

  increasingly relevant to all areas of legal practice, so this exhortation applies to all
  lawyers.

  2.1.4. Overriding Duty to the Court
  We have discussed this aspect of lawyers' duties above, but it is worth quoting Preston
  on this, because he considers this duty includes upholding the values of the law, one
  of which is justice (broadly defined and including climate justice):

              Climate conscious lawyers should advise and act in ways that uphold and
              advance the fundamental values and integrity of the legal system, including
              climate change justice. These are moralistic standards which lawyers should
              strive to achieve and against which their advice and actions can be assessed.
              For example, their advice and actions should be consonant with the ...
              [promotion of] peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development,
              including a just transition to carbon neutrality, and promoting access to
              justice for all, including people who have suffered and will suffer harm due
              to climate change.4

  2.1.5. Personal Ethics Approach
  Preston outlines several ways that lawyers can align their daily legal practice with
  their personal moral convictions. He suggests that lawyers discuss the moral aspects of
  client projects with their clients, noting that, in his experience, clients are prepared to
  modify their actions to lessen the social and environmental impacts of their activities.5
  One aspect of such counselling is to promote human rights in corporate practice (see
  further below). Another aspect is to encourage corporate clients to adopt sustainable
  business models. Preston also encourages lawyers to be active in areas of law reform,
  pro bono work and `intellectual activism' to address the climate crisis. As noted
  above, some lawyers are already involved in such action -- for example, acting
  in climate change litigation, reconceptualising how law might regulate corporate

  activities toward sustainability or, more radically, re-imagining law as part of an earth-
  centred system of governance.6

         While the term `climate conscious lawyering' is new, some lawyers have
         been adopting such an approach for years, if not decades.7 Do you agree
         with the argument that, as the planet warms, a climate conscious approach
         is the appropriate ethical path for all lawyers?

 2.2 Human Rights and Climate: How Will This Impact
 Lawyers' Duties?

  Developments in human rights law are material insofar as they may extend clients'
  obligations to consider and address climate harms, and so shape the legal and `ethical
  counselling' landscape identified by Preston. Since international human rights
  standards are not embedded significantly in either the Constitution or Australian
  federal law, human rights law has played a more limited role in strategic climate
  litigation in Australia than it has in more rights-based constitutional
  regimes. Nonetheless, as the UN Human Rights Commission decision in the Torres
  Strait Eight claim shows, this does not reduce the federal government's responsibility
  under international law.8 Moreover, a number of jurisdictions -- the ACT, Victoria
  and Queensland -- have passed human rights legislation (we refer to these as the
  `human rights jurisdictions'), which is having direct effects on climate-related legal
  work. This evolving framework plays at least a potential role in climate change
  lawyering in four ways.

   (1) As an interpretative aid: courts in the human rights jurisdictions are under an
   interpretative duty to seek compatibility with human rights (so far as possible) when
   construing legislation.9 Outside of those jurisdictions, human rights principles play
   a more restricted role, insofar as the presumption that legislatures do not legislate
   contrary to `fundamental rights' extends only to established common law rights under
   Australian law.10

   (2) As a formal basis for challenging federal or state government decision-making:
   again, the scope for action is limited. Petitioners may invoke the jurisdiction of the
   UN Human Rights Committee, which has the power to make declarations that the
   government has breached the petitioners' fundamental rights under the International
   Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (`ICCPR').11 In the human rights jurisdictions,
   state courts are empowered to address breaches of human rights obligations by
   governmental and some quasi-governmental bodies.12 Enforcement of rights under the
   Acts is thus only `horizontal', between citizen and state; there is no `vertical' right of
   action as between citizens.

   (3) Courts are also obliged in the human rights jurisdictions, when acting as
   administrative decision-makers,13 to give proper consideration to any relevant human
   rights engaged by an application to them. This has particular significance in
   environmental and planning matters, where human rights norms are being referenced
   to challenge the extension or development of fossil fuel extraction activities. Thus,
   in Waratah Coal, the Queensland Land Court determined that, when making mining
   application and environmental authority decisions, its administrative function is
   enlivened, and ss 16 (right to life), 28 (cultural rights of First Nations peoples), 26

   equality) of the Human Rights Act 2019 may be engaged.14 At the same time, it has
   also been recognised that climate change and its human rights impacts are not the
   only factors that have to be taken into account by decision-makers in such matters.15
   Applications must be determined on their individual merits, and that involves a
   complex balancing of `competing needs and considerations'.16 In sum, this remains a
   fast-moving area of law, and human rights, while of acknowledged importance, are by
   no means a magical `trump card'.

   (4) As part of a growing `human rights due diligence' (`HRDD') regime for
   companies, both voluntary and mandatory HRDD obligations are an important feature
   of the transnational business environment. The UN's Guiding Principles on Business
   and Human Rights (`UNGP')17 have become the `authoritative global standard' on
   corporate human rights performance.18 `They create expectations that all business
   enterprises should respect human rights in their governance arrangements and systems,
   business operations, and across their value chain' (UNGP 14). Moreover, the UNGPs
   also expect that states should regulate corporations in their jurisdiction in a way
   that encourages compliance with human rights, and HRDD is a way to achieve
   that. The approach in Australia to HRDD has so far been voluntarist, but informal
   commercial and reputational pressure on businesses to develop HRDD mechanisms
   appears significant (see part 3).

   It should also be noted that although private entities such as business corporations
   are not ordinarily within the scope of the states' human rights legislation, they are
   permitted by the ACT and Queensland Acts (but not the Victorian Charter) to `opt

 3. Future Trajectories for Professional Ethics

  The environmental regulatory framework significantly influences the extent to which
  businesses take responsibility and are held accountable for their contribution to climate
  harms, and consequently shapes lawyers' advice. As other chapters in this book
  demonstrate, climate change law in Australia remains underdeveloped relative to
  other, climate-leading, jurisdictions. Whether and when there will be an appetite for
  increased and more effective regulation of greenhouse gas emitting activities is a
  political question that is beyond the scope of the book, but any such changes would
  strengthen lawyers' duties to the law and would make advising clients against climate
  harms more straightforward.

  It is uncertain as to how far the courts in Australia will permit the common law on
  negligence and public nuisance to evolve to better address large-scale climate harms.1
  Any such changes to the common law would obviously be important in shaping
  lawyers' duties of competence and care, and also their duty to the law.

  The passing of a federal human rights act, and of additional state human rights
  legislation, would likewise be significant, imposing specific obligations on a broader
  range of Australian governments and their lawyers to (re)assess the risks represented
  by their climate mitigation policies, or lack thereof. For private and in-house legal
  practice, however, the likely continuing constraints on human rights enforcement by
  private citizens limit, but do not wholly obviate, the need to engage substantively with
  human rights. Indeed, it is likely that the burden on lawyers to advise on the human
  rights impacts of climate change will grow, rather than diminish.

  One reason for this may be an increasing emphasis on `human rights due diligence'
  in corporate regulation. National compliance regimes are at very different stages on
  the HRDD journey; much corporate compliance remains voluntary or only partially
  mandated -- for example, in the context of modern slavery laws, but not climate

  harms. Where broad mandatory standards (`mHRDD') exist under national legislation,
  these impose enforceable obligations on businesses to identify, assess and manage
  a range of human rights risks and impacts, including those arising from climate
  harm. Such mHRDD regimes are in place in several major trading nations, including
  France, Germany and South Korea, and are under development in others, most notably
  the United Kingdom and the European Union, where the Corporate Sustainability
  Due Diligence Directive has been signed into law. Compliance under the latter will
  be required from 2027, and will impose duties on large businesses formed in, or
  generating significant revenue within, the EU to address actual and potential human
  rights and environmental impacts, and to have in place a Paris Agreement-aligned
  climate transition plan. Although this will directly affect only the largest commercial
  entities, law firms are advising out-of-scope clients to consider ways to enhance their
  processes in anticipation of heightened stakeholder expectations and future regulatory
  extension.2 As the IBA's guidelines affirm, lawyers need to take a proactive approach
  in advising clients about the strategic, reputational and ultimately legal risks they may
  face if they do not address their HRDD:

              The law is dynamic; what is considered merely unethical today may be
              unlawful tomorrow. This is particularly true in the business and human
              rights context. As companies increasingly see the identification and
              management of human rights risk as a key strategic goal, they expect that
              their lawyers will act not only as technical legal experts, but also as wise
              counsellors in identifying and advising on human rights impacts, based on
              the hard and soft law of human rights.3

  Even though Australia currently lacks mHRDD obligations, the UNGPs are still
  relevant to Australian businesses. Moreover, the trend towards HRDD means not only
  that law firms operating in the corporate sector must stay abreast of their clients'
  human rights risks and responsibilities but also that the firms themselves, and

   445

  particularly those operating in a transnational context, may need to ensure that they
  have their own HRDD processes in place, if they are to satisfy potential clients'
  expectations.

  By contrast to this dynamic picture, in terms of the substantive law on lawyering,
  significant change seems unlikely in the short term. The Law Council of Australia, in
  its Climate Change Policy, has clearly expressed the view that the ASCR are adequate
  to deal with the demands climate change imposes on lawyers' ethics. The preference
  in the ASCR for broad, generic principles also makes it less likely that climate-specific
  regulations would be considered necessary or desirable as part of the conduct rules. It
  is conceivable, however, that other state and territory regulators will follow the lead
  of New South Wales, either adopting or referencing the NSW Guidance, or issuing
  guidance of their own. It is likely that any such guidance will need ongoing updating as
  the scope of a solicitor's duty to provide advice on climate change continues to evolve.

  This chapter has focused on solicitors' duties, as these are `at the sharp end' of
  most climate advisory work. Australian federal and state bar associations have not
  yet weighed in with any specific advice or guidance to member barristers engaging
  in climate-related advice or litigation. There is a separate challenge for barristers
  in Australia insofar as the so-called cab rank principle4 seems to restrict them from
  denying representation to specific clients on the basis of a perceived risk of climate
  harm. The Declaration of Conscience provoked significant debate about the ambit of
  this rule in the United Kingdom, and it is conceivable that the issue could arise here.
  Interestingly, the Chair of the English Bar Council's Ethics Committee has reportedly
  opined that another rule permitting barristers to refuse instructions where `there is a
  real prospect that you are not going to be able to maintain your independence'5 could
  allow those genuinely objecting to representation on conscience grounds to refuse a
  brief.6 However, there is no clearly equivalent provision in the Uniform Bar Rules.

4. Conclusion

This chapter considers the role that lawyers can play in addressing the climate crisis.
The responsibilities attending this role arise from both general ethical and moral
obligations inherent in being a profession and also from the conduct rules, in
particular lawyers' duties to the administration of justice. How lawyers exercise their
role in day-to-day practice is an open question, and we note particularly:

          the recent NSW Guidance that directly addresses how lawyers might
            approach their professional duties in the context of climate change;

          the ongoing debate about the professional `ethics' of representing fossil
            fuel interests; and

          the obligation on lawyers, as a matter of competence, to be informed about
            developments in their practice area in response to climate change as well as
            the likely impact of climate change on their clients' present and future
            activities.

To conclude, consider the following case studies, which directly raise some of the
issues discussed in this chapter.

                                                     CASE STUDY 1

   Read this article concerning the tactics adopted by the lawyers acting for the
   mining company Adani. At the time the article was written, Adani was proceeding,
   against a lot of opposition, to develop the Carmichael coalmine.

                                                                 446

   Consider the following questions:
           1. Mr Moriarty is quoted as believing that aspects of the firm's strategy
               `tend to bring the legal profession into disrepute'. Do you agree? If so,
               what specific aspect(s) of the strategy do you think might have that
               effect? Alternatively, if you disagree, can you explain why?
               In examining the scope of `disrepute', you might find it helpful to read
               the following cases:
                          Griffin v The Council of the Law Society of New South Wales
                            [2016] NSWCA 364 [101]-[105]
                          Clyne v NSW Bar Association [1960] HCA 40 [1]-[25]
           2. If you were to adopt the stance of Chief Judge Brian Preston's `climate
               conscious' lawyer, how would you advise changing the firm's proposed
               litigation strategy, without undermining your duty to act in the best
               interests of the client?
           3. If the law firm was to align its presentation to Adani more closely with
               the NSW Guidance, part 5.1, what changes would you advise them to
               make?

                                                     CASE STUDY 2

   In 2020, law student Katta O'Donnell sued the Australian government for failing to
   disclose the climate risk associated with government bonds. The action was
   successful in the sense that the government agreed to publish a disclosure about
                                                                                                                                                                448

     climate risk on the Treasury website. However, in O'Donnell's view, the
     government has not taken take any further action to address those risks. So, in
     2024, as a recent graduate, she turned to direct action, joining `Blockade
     Australia' and attaching herself to a structure over the railway line used by trains
     taking coal to the Newcastle coal port. She was arrested and sentenced with two
     convictions, which she is appealing. In an article explaining her actions, O'Donnell
     says:

                 I have a law degree. I studied law because I wanted to make a positive
                 difference in the world, but the closer I get to the legal system, the
                 more I understand why my grandfather, who was also a lawyer, used to
                 say `there is no justice within the law' ...

                 ... In some ways, moving from legal action to direct action is a big
                 decision, but in others it seems like a natural evolution. The time for
                 indirectness is over. I have come to realise that the current political and
                 legal systems do not have the ability to make the changes necessary.
                 And I have found no space within the legal system to talk about the
                 climate crisis. There is no space to say that I am protesting to make the
                 world a healthier place to stop the harm occurring so that we can create
                 sustainable systems and actually think about a future without dread.'1

     Having read this chapter, and O'Donnell's statement, critically reflect on these
     questions:

             1. Is Katta O'Donnell right to suggest that there is little or no scope to
                  engage in direct action from within the legal profession/system? Could
                  engaging in direct action or civil disobedience in relation to climate
                  change mean that a person is not `fit and proper' to be a lawyer, and so
                  should be denied admission (or, if already admitted, struck off the roll)?
                  You might want to consider the court's observations on suitability for
                  admission and political activism in Re B [1981] 2 NSWLR 372.

             2. In light of Katta O'Donnell's views, do you consider that Chief Judge
                  Preston's proposals offer a sufficiently strong blueprint for `climate
                  conscious lawyering'? If yes, explain why. If not, what else do you think

               is required?
           3. Should individual lawyers be permitted on conscience grounds to refuse

               to work for (i) new or (ii) established clients on matters which they
               consider insufficiently mitigate or exacerbate climate harms? Could/
               would you argue that such refusal is (i) inconsistent with the lawyer's
               paramount duties to the law and the administration of justice and/or (ii)
               an abnegation of professional responsibility to work with clients to
               reduce climate harms?

Legal Theory and Climate
Consciousness

In this chapter we consider aspects of legal theory and legal change. The term `legal
theory' is quite broad, and includes what is sometimes called `jurisprudence', `legal
philosophy' and forms of critical legal theory. Legal theory poses questions about law:

          What is law?

          How does law relate to society?
          How does law relate to the natural world?

The chapter is organised by a series of questions and responses, but these are not
exhaustive or definitive. Instead, they are intended to provoke further questions and
thinking. More issues for consideration are identified at the end of each main section.
In this way, legal theory can seem endless and unsettling. But by engaging with legal
theory, you can begin to reflect on law at a deeper level. This reflection is critical to
the relationship between law and climate consciousness.

The introduction to the chapter considers legal theory as a practice of thinking,
critiquing and (re)imagining. The second section looks at how law has been defined by
legal theory, accounts of law's authority, and whether we always have a duty to obey
the law. The third section considers the wider social and cultural factors that surround
and inform how law is understood: imaginaries, storytelling, representations and
abstractions. This leads into our conclusion, which asks how law might be reimagined
in a way that is more conscious of Earth and its changing climate.

         In this section:
                    What is theory?
                    Why does theory matter?
                    What is legal theory?
                    What does legal theory do?
                    What is the relationship between theoretical consciousness and
                      climate consciousness?

 1.1 What is Theory?

  Theory is a practice of thinking.
  It is directed toward uncovering how we understand and account for our engagements
  with the world -- our world view. These engagements depend on the ideas, stories and
  values we use to represent the world to ourselves, both individually and collectively.
  These representations are shaped by the variables that define human experience and
  perspective, including culture, language, location and historical context.
  Theory is the practice of reflecting on our ideas and stories: `Theory is thinking
  about thinking, [an] enquiry into the categories we use to make sense of things.'1
  This involves taking our representations of the world -- ideas, stories and values --
  as objects of knowledge. These objects are mental tools, which are used to form a
  world view. Since ideas are not universal or unchanging, these objects are necessarily
  contextual and dynamic. A consciousness of these objects of knowledge -- concepts
  -- and reflection on them -- theorising -- is an action, in and of itself.

                                                                                                                                                                454

  This action -- theorisation -- could be said to involve three steps: identifying
  significant concepts, critiquing these concepts and reimagining these concepts. The
  many forms of theory emphasise one or other of these steps more than the others; our
  chapter will draw on them all in different contexts.

 1.2 Why does Theory Matter?

  Theory can be used to describe the world, but also to change it.

  We are constantly engaging in theory -- theorising -- insofar as we reflect on the
  concepts we use. Many of the concepts used in daily life are taken for granted; they
  form our common sense. Paying attention to how we develop ideas and values enables
  a broader consciousness of how these concepts contribute to the formation of a shared
  world view.

  A first step in theorising something is to identify specific significant concepts. We
  might consider examples from the dominant western perspective, which form aspects
  of a shared common sense. Reflecting on these concepts -- how and why they
  represent this particular perspective -- helps us to see that these ideas or stories
  are the building blocks of knowledge in this context, but not in every context. The
  following examples draw attention to this particularity. Reflection on the concept of
  democracy -- as the authority of the demos or the people -- prompts an attention to
  and questioning of the meaning and significance of democratic values and political
  community. Alternatively, reflection on the concept of nature -- as the world apart
  from humans -- prompts an attention to and questioning of this conventional
  separation and its consequences.

  Concepts, as representations of ideas and values, are not neutral but particular. Which
  ideas and values are crystallised into concepts, and how they are parsed as facts or
  narrated as stories, have bearing on the significance and authority attached to them.
  This is why theory matters: `It matters ... what thoughts think thoughts.'2

      to think other ideas (with)'.

1.3 What is Legal Theory?

Legal theory is thinking about legal thinking.

Theorising about law means reflecting on the concept of law -- as a representation
and exercise of authority. This prompts an attention to and questioning of the ideas
and values that underpin law, the stories that shape law, and how law has developed as
an idea. For example, we might reflect on the meaning of rights, which conventionally
turns on dominant ideas of freedom and autonomy. What is a right? Who or what has
rights? Why are some rights prioritised over others?

We are constantly engaging in theory, including legal theory, insofar as we reflect on
the concepts we use. Theory is not descriptive of law; rather, it helps us to understand,
make and change the way law is understood.

As an intellectual discipline, `legal theory' (also called jurisprudence or legal
philosophy) does this intentionally and systematically. This discipline adopts a variety
of methods and forms, and it is shaped by different intellectual traditions. In Australia,
legal theory has been predominantly drawn from a tradition of legal ideas and values
associated with European and British law, exported via colonisation across the world.
A more expansive field is now acknowledged, encompassing different sources and
forms of law, including First Nations legal traditions and jurisprudences.

1.4 What Does Legal Theory Do?

Legal theory is a reflective practice, with value and meaning.

To engage in theorisation is to step back from common sense assumptions and to
reflect on the meaning and value attributed to the concepts that organise our daily
lives. This reflective practice is often counterintuitive, as in the well-cited quip:
`Don't just do something, stand there!' To pause and reflect may be discomforting,
disorientating and disarming. Acknowledging the contingency of our world view
prompts a perspectival shift, with consequences for ourselves and others.

Once we acknowledge that concepts are not universal but particular, emerging in
different contexts and places, we can begin to question and challenge -- to critique
                                                                                                                                                                456

  -- these concepts. Critique is reflection on ideas: their foundations, limitations and
  political consequences. For example, we might critically reflect on the concept of
  property within the western legal tradition, which turns on the claim to and defence of
  an exclusive right to a place or resource. This critical reflection enables us to perceive
  the contingency of this idea -- in time and space, and in how it reflects the shared
  ideas and values of a particular community.

 1.5 What is the Relationship Between Theoretical
 Consciousness and Climate Consciousness?

  Theoretical consciousness is critical to climate consciousness.

  Theory -- as a reflective practice -- engenders an awareness of the ideas and values
  that define our world view and lived experience. We can perceive the limits of our
  descriptions and representations of the world and begin to imagine other possibilities.
  Becoming conscious of how and why we think what we do matters.

  Becoming a climate conscious lawyer is both a pathway to awareness and a call to
  action. Legal theory prompts an awareness of the contingency and flexibility of ideas
  and values, which often appear as solid organising concepts but are revealed to be
  contestable. This does not mean we can avoid or ignore doctrinal law and the limited
  available means of changing it; rather, its political power and exercise of authority
  shape our lives. But developing an awareness of how ideas and values are represented
  and authorised in law enables us to embark on a third step -- reimagining.

  Theory is an activity -- interpreting, experimenting and imagining -- all of which
  offer the opportunity to take action for change. The famous `Thesis Eleven' of Karl
  Marx, inscribed on his tomb in London, reads `Philosophers have only interpreted the
  world in various ways -- the point however is to change it'.3 Marx was instrumental
  in redirecting philosophy so that it could be used to help change the world; in the 21st
  century much theory and philosophy aims at promoting change in politics, economics,
  law, society and other fields of human endeavour. Reimagining law is therefore a
  mode of reform, not only of law itself but also of the perspectives that inform and

shape law. A theoretical consciousness offers strategies with which to question and
challenge the nature and authority of law, including its common sense assumptions,
sources and values. This reflective practice is critical to becoming a climate conscious
lawyer.

2. What is Law and Why Should We Obey It?

       In this section:
                  What is law?
                  What is law for?
                  Where does law's authority come from?
                  Must we obey the law?

A widespread and `common sense' understanding of law is that it consists of rules to
guide behaviour that have been laid down by parliament and courts. Law is created,
enforced and revised by these legal institutions and supporting state-based
mechanisms. Change to the law occurs in accordance with well-established
institutional procedures. But the common sense understanding of law leaves many
unresolved questions:

          By what authority is this `law'?
          Is it moral, just and/or legitimate?
          Does it reflect social values?
          Is law neutral in its operation?
          Do we have an obligation to obey the law?
          Why does the common sense idea about law exclude the First Laws of

            Australia's Indigenous peoples?
          Is it possible to reimagine law in a way that is more attentive to Earth --

            that places humans within, rather than against, nature?

We consider some of these questions briefly below, but much more could be said about
each of them.

                                                                 459
                                                                                                                                                                460

 2.1 What is Law?

  The question of `what is law' can be understood as a question of representation and
  authority -- that is, an enquiry into how law is understood and what its source is. We
  will step through each of these.

  Legal positivism has been the dominant approach to legal theory over the past 200
  years: it is the basis for the common sense view mentioned above. In simple terms,
  legal positivism is the view that law is laid down (posited) by a political superior
  (such as a sovereign or parliament), that it is therefore objectively identifiable and
  limited in the sense that it is different from more vague and contestable social norms,
  and that it does not necessarily reflect any morality or justice (though it can).1 The
  advantage of legal positivism is said to be its clarity about what law is (and what it is
  not) and therefore about what laws need to change. Its downside is that it limits the
  understanding of law to an image that has emanated from a very particular place and
  history: Britain and Europe of the past few centuries. A theory of law that is often
  contrasted with positivism is `natural law theory'.

  Natural law theory has an older and more complex heritage, but it is essentially the
  view that law either must or ideally ought to reflect an objective morality or set of
  universally held values.2 One rather obvious difficulty with this is that there is little if
  any agreement beyond some basics about the `objective' values upon which law is or
  ought to be based. The description of so-called objective and universal standards also
  obscures some European and Anglo biases.

  Throughout the 20th century these theoretical approaches to law were challenged by
  many intersecting social and critical approaches to law. Broadly speaking, social
  and critical approaches challenged the ideas of neutrality, objectivity and universality
  that the mainstream approaches tended to assume. They pointed out that law in its
  dominant form is based on social mythologies (individualism, human exceptionalism,
  centralised power, eurocentrism, anthropocentrism) that are not universally shared.

      positivism.

  For instance, ideas about the legal person have been based on a specific concept of
  what a legal subject or person is -- usually associated with characteristics that are
  socially masculine, white, able-bodied and heterosexual. Feminist and critical race
  theorists have argued that law is based on and reproduces systemic forms of social
  power, for instance patriarchal and racial power. Indigenous legal philosophers have
  pointed out that the dominant state-based model of law remains an artefact of a
  colonial system that continues to destroy the land and separate people from Earth.

 2.2 What is Law For?3

  Until recently, western legal theory was characterised as anthropocentric (human
  centred): it focused on human nature, institutions and relationships. Despite its name,
  the natural law tradition has not been about or for nature at large but about an imagined
  universal and unchanging human nature. However, in an unexpected way the very idea
  of a `natural law' might be helpful for climate-conscious legal theory: is it possible to
  reimagine natural law in a much more expansive ecological way? A nature-oriented
  theory of law would (in keeping with many Indigenous understandings of law) identify
  law as being of Earth and emerging from the natural world in all of its incredible
  diversity, dynamism, fragility and locational specificity.4 Such a law would include
  humans and our laws but not be limited to it.

  The anthropocentrism of western law has been challenged by the idea that we are
  living in the `Anthropocene'. This idea began as a scientific thesis, proposing the
  naming of a new geological epoch prompted by human activity and excess.5 It has now
  been taken up more broadly, in the social sciences (including law) and the humanities.
  While contested, the Anthropocene arguably prompts an important perspectival shift.
  Given humans are now understood to have geomorphic (earth changing) force, the

3. This question is a derivation of those posed in Ngaire Naffine, Law's Meaning of Life: Philosophy, Religion, Darwin
      and the Legal Person (Bloomsbury, 2009). While engaged with the question of legal personhood, Naffine asks: `Who
      should law be "for"?' (1); `Who should count or matter in law?' (14); `Who is worthy of law's concern?' (20).

  conventional separation between `human' and `nature' is no longer stable and distinct.
  This has prompted a greater engagement with ecocentrism (ecologically centred),
  which values nature for its own sake and places humans on the same level as other
  dimensions of the environment, stressing the interdependence of all living and non-
  living things.

  This ecocentric turn has also galvanised different legal approaches to the protection
  and governance of the environment. This includes the emergence of earth and
  ecological jurisprudence, which is focused on the extension of rights to nature, such
  as rivers, forests and mountains. This approach is deeply informed by ecocentrism.
  Some scholars have drawn attention to the limits of rights and the presumptions of
  legal personhood (white, male, able-bodied, propertied), advocating a turn toward
  obligations, which arguably ground rights while also extending our understanding
  of the legal relationships between humans and nature.6 Nonetheless, various forms
  of legal recognition, including rights, have now been granted to non-human entities
  throughout the world as rights for nature, and advocates of this approach often act in
  partnership and solidarity with First Nations custodians.

  Indigenous peoples offer extensive and much more ancient philosophical (and
  practical) guidance about the ways in which an Earth-centred law is possible and
  necessary for our survival. This has extended to a critique of western ethics and a
  scholarly engagement with obligations in accordance with an Aboriginal ethics.7 The
  challenge for theoretical approaches grounded in the western (European philosophical)
  tradition is to centre First Nations knowledge and jurisprudence, and not to appropriate
  but instead to engage with these traditions on their own terms. This engagement has
  prompted a reimagining of theories about law, attending more closely to nature in and
  around human life and across Earth.

 2.3 Where Does Law's Authority Come From?

  One of the central questions of legal theory concerns authority: what precisely is
  the source of law's authority? Is law justified in some way that can be generally
  agreed upon or does law have authority only because it is backed up by force in
  different forms? This question has been extensively studied within political theory, but
  it is equally important for legal theory. Law's authority is often said to be based in
  sovereign power (originally in the form of a monarch), a social contract in which the
  people consent to being governed for the security of living in a state, or in deference
  to religious, social and moral values, or some combination of these factors.

  For influential legal positivist, HLA Hart, who built on the work of others in this
  tradition, the law (of the state) is grounded in social rules (norms), which turn on the
  idea of obligation. According to this theory, legal authority does not emerge (solely)
  from the threat and exercise of force but rather from an understanding of its validity.
  That is, legal authority arises when social rules are obeyed in the fulfilment of a
  perceived obligation, rather than in the avoidance of punishment. Adherence to rules
  requires the application of `social pressure', which signals a standard of behaviour that
  is accepted as a guide for the conduct of social life.8

  Those who approach legal theory from a critical perspective are more focused on the
  practices and consequences of authority than its sources -- that is, how legal authority
  is carried out and whether it achieves its desired outcomes. This approach includes a
  questioning of the imaginaries and knowledges that are reflected in practices of legal
  authority, such as the attribution of rights to legal persons, which we mentioned earlier.
  Accordingly, the exercise of legal authority is not neutral but instead reflects particular
  social imaginaries and power structures, which are entrenched and institutionalised in
  their articulation and repetition -- in their telling. We will return to this in section 3.

  Ultimately ideas about the authority of state law are convenient fictions (or myth,
  as we discuss below), since the reality of law's existence and authority is much
  more complex than any one abstraction: the state law that governs our lives is an
  artefact produced by centuries of social and political conflict and change. Critical
  theories of law add more sociopolitical and cultural dimensions into the mix of factors

8. See generally HLA Hart, The Concept of Law (Oxford University Press, 1st or 2nd ed, 1961, 1994, 2012).
                                                                                                                                                                  464

   upon which law is said to be based: law is ultimately grounded in multiple forms
   and practices of power, and law's authority is therefore inseparable from patriarchal
   power, European supremacy (colonial power), economic power (in particular
   capitalism) and so forth. The `social' contract has been renamed a `sexual contract'
   and a `racial contract'9 because modern nation states in colonised parts of the world
   were imagined and constituted exclusively by men of British and European origin.

   In Australia, the `authority' of law can be regarded as tenuous, given the obvious
   falsity of the narrative of the terra nullius justification of `settlement' and the lack
   of any cession of authority by First Nations. This is made clear by Tanganekald
   and Meintangk legal philosopher Irene Watson, speaking of various `development'
   proposals on her ancestral lands (fracking, golf courses, drainage construction): `The
   state has power derived from its original violent colonial foundation to go ahead but
   it does not have the law-full authority. The state does not have the consent of First
   Nations and even if consent was given by individuals, it is important to note that
   there are situations where consent would be against law.'10 First Nations knowledges
   challenge the abstract and centralised sovereign authority of European-style legal
   systems with understandings of law based in reciprocal relations with country that
   cannot be erased. As Kombumerri / Wakka Wakka scholar Mary Graham explains,
   `Aboriginal Law / Aboriginal civilisation could be said to be both an action guide to
   living and a guide to understanding reality itself, especially in relation to Land as the
   basis for all meaning.'11

   Centring First Nations knowledge in legal thinking means, in the first instance, putting
   the authority of Indigenous peoples at the heart of law and challenging colonial
   assumptions about human supremacy over the land and nature. There are
   complementary ways to think of the authority of law, even within the limited options
   offered by our present positivist framework. For instance, it is possible to expand the
   beings imagined by any `social contract' to global communities and future generations.

   Looking further, to the relationships that make human life possible in the first place,
   we could expand the contract that frames an imaginary of law to a `natural contract'12
   inclusive of all living and non-living beings. We will return in section 3 to how law
   might be reimagined so that it is responsive to nature, which includes both human and
   non-human beings.

  2.4 Must We Obey the Law?

   Contesting the authority that law is said to be based on raises significant questions for
   legal theory:

             What is the nature of our obligation to obey the law?
             Is obligation merely a practical matter of avoiding penalties?
             If aspects of law are extremely unfair, discriminatory or otherwise

               unjustified in some way, do we nonetheless have a social or moral duty to
               obey it?
             Do we have a social duty to disobey in pursuit of a higher purpose?
             Is it necessary to disobey law in order to prevent the extreme dangers of
               climate change, thus potentially justifying a defence of necessity under
               criminal law?

   There are many variations to such questions and even more possible answers.

   `Civil disobedience' (or `civil resistance') encapsulates different forms of refusal
   to obey law, undertaken in order to resist law or at least draw attention to wider
   political issues, often connected in some way to the protest itself (eg protesting fossil
   fuel by drawing attention to sponsorship used to greenwash a brand -- see Figure
   2). In relation to environmental damage, activists sometimes claim that state law has
   lost its authority, insofar as it actively promotes environmental destruction, and that
   traditional methods of change do not work because law reform processes are captured
   by those who profit from damage (`we tried polite', as the sign succinctly puts it).

   The concept of civil disobedience is often understood as broadly occurring within the
   framework of a liberal democracy where the parameters of the state and punishments
   given are public and accepted by protesters.13 But the line between civil disobedience
   (in progressive circles often now practiced as non-violent direct action) and forms
   of activism that are more extreme or aimed at radical change to state-law systems is
   not always easy to draw. A protest against fossil fuel and extractivism at some point
   might contest an entire matrix of social-legal-political forms, including colonialism,
   individualism, corporatism, private property and attempted control of nature. Such
   a protest generates difficult questions. For instance, is it morally worse to destroy
   ecosystems and country by clearing land (for human housing or mining or cattle
   raising) or to blow up a pipeline because conventional methods of protest do not
   work?14 Both `civil' disobedience and more extreme forms of political violence have
   preceded a number of high-profile legal changes, such as the extension of voting rights

   to women in the UK.15 Who is on the right side of history -- those who always obey
   the law and maybe even use it for their financial gain, or those who break it to promote
   a longer term goal? Legal theory does not provide definite answers to such questions,
   but it can provide strategies and tools that may help protesters (and their lawyers) to
   think broadly about them.
   Disobedience, civil or otherwise, therefore goes to the heart of what law is, what
   it should be and the politics of changing the law. In its more moderate forms, it
   challenges mainstream law while also prompting reform using methods that
   consciously and publicly break the law.

 3. How is Law Imagined and How Can It Be
 Reimagined?

         In this section:
                    How is law imagined?
                    What stories does law tell about itself and the world?
                    Is modern law a mythology?
                    What would law be if Earth really mattered?

  The ideas and values that represent authority, and thereby shape and organise law,
  emerge from a broader social imaginary. Surrounding and informing the `common
  sense' idea of law mentioned above is a western (Anglo-European) social imaginary or
  `world view'. Western legal thought has conventionally been understood to be based
  on reason rather than on stories or myths, but perhaps this itself is a myth.

 3.1 How is Law Imagined?

  Law and legal thinking have traditionally left no room for `reimagin[ing] another
  law'.1 Instead, law is conventionally defined by what it excludes, conjuring its own
  (fictitious) grounds and institutions.2 Accordingly, law is conventionally understood as
  self-creating and self-authorising -- that is, autonomous. The ways that the stories and
  myths of western law are represented, for instance in language and in images, reinforce
  the world view within which they are situated. Stepping back from the world view,
  myths and representations of western law allows us to begin to develop an awareness

  of how law is embedded in culture, how non-western traditions operate with different
  world views, stories and representations, and how the western view of law might be
  reimagined in a different way.

  Imaginaries can be understood as the gathering of different relations with the world,
  forged through normative practices of knowledge and labour, which constitute realities
  and sustain authority. Law is one (dominant) representation of social imaginaries,
  which is not a thing but a relationship understood to exist between humans
  (subject-subject relation) or between humans and nature (subject-object relation).
  Lawful relations -- or `ways of belonging to law'3 -- represent a particular coalescing
  of social imaginaries, which are articulated and practised in the context of inherited
  traditions of being and knowing. Philosophers in the western tradition distinguish
  these as ontology (ways of being) and epistemology (ways of knowing).

  Ontology concerns what is and what exists, and an understanding of the relations
  between these. For example, we can say that the distinction between life and non-
  life is an ontological division in western philosophy.4 Epistemology concerns how
  we know what we know, or the frame of reference for knowing. The relationship
  between epistemology and ontology is not necessarily straightforward. Epistemology
  has often been understood as reliant on a human who constructs and `knows' the
  world with a distinctively human and cultural orientation -- but which comes first,
  human knowledge or the things that are known? For example, western epistemology
  defines its ontological world view in accordance with a particular binary way of
  knowing: human and inhuman, culture and nature, masculine and feminine, inside
  and outside. Because it is difficult to untangle ontology and epistemology, several
  writers have argued that ways of knowing and ways of being can be understood as co-
  constituted. Introducing the term `onto-epistemology', Karen Barad says `We do not
  obtain knowledge by standing outside of the world; we know because "we" are of the
  world.'5

  The concepts and principles that constitute Australian law are drawn from and remain

  a part of the dominant social imaginary and its colonial legacies. The authority of law,
  as law, is generated by and circulated within its social imaginary, assuming authority
  in its representation and articulation.6

 3.2 What Stories Does Law Tell About Itself and the World?

  Another word for the creation of social imaginaries, and their representation and
  practice in legal authority and lawful relations, is storytelling. Storytelling practices
  -- imagining, articulating, listening -- create social imaginaries and enable their
  manifestation in law. As we have discussed, law is more than a system of rules and
  their enforcement; rather, understood as a mode of storytelling, law is a method of
  creating the meaningful relations that constitute a world view. The story of law and the
  site of its telling -- that is, `juris-diction'7 -- combines ontology and epistemology,
  which coalesce in the exercise and reception of authority. This dominant story
  entrenches an idea of a singular and unified `sovereign will',8 its authority epitomised
  by its central protagonist, the sovereign legal subject.

  Storytelling about the origin and meaning of the world, exemplified in theology and
  politics as well as law, is often described as cosmology. Cosmology describes both
  ontology and epistemology and refers to a particular understanding of (or storytelling
  about) normative relations. The term is taken up in scholarly literature to refer to
  different ways of being and knowing, including Indigenous and First Nations
  cosmologies, which exist alongside and in relationship with the dominant (western
  Christian) cosmology.9 While each cosmology exists among and in relationship with

      Press, 2018) 135.
     471

   others, in what has been called a `pluriverse',10 some cosmologies make claims to
   universality.11

   Among other things, decoloniality is concerned with the contextualisation and
   historicisation of ontologies and epistemologies, and an acknowledgement of plural
   ways of being and knowing. This includes ways of being a legal person, and ways
   of knowing what law is and what it is for. For critical legal theorists, the social
   imaginaries that reflect and reinforce ways of being and knowing -- ontologies and
   epistemologies -- are reflected in the ways that legal authority is practiced. In turn, the
   forms and institutions of western law are shaped by a denial of plural ways of being
   and knowing and the oversimplification of complexity.

   This is exemplified in the universalising binaries and abstract reasoning of law. In
   order to maintain this autonomy, the authority and mechanisms of law -- its workings
   -- rely on abstract concepts: for example, the sovereign state, the people, legal
   personhood, private property and so on. These abstractions presume a distinction and
   hierarchy between the subjects and objects of law's authority, and between law itself
   and the society it governs.

  3.3 Is Modern Law a Mythology?

   The set of manoeuvres that frames western law has been described by Peter Fitzpatrick
   as the creation of a `mythology', which is necessary to a world defined by its
   exclusions.12 Fitzpatrick explains that one of the central aspects of the mythology of
   western law is that it is not seen as myth but is rather understood to be based on reason.
   Another way of thinking about this would be to say that the myths associated with law
   are so powerful that we cannot see them as myth. We have so thoroughly accepted
   them as truth that their basis in the stories and representations of western knowledge
   are invisible to us. Some elements of the western mythology of law (including some
   discussed by Fitzpatrick) are:

10. Arturo Escobar, `Transition Discourses and the Politics of Relationality: Toward Designs for the Pluriverse' in Bernd
       Reiter (ed), Constructing the Pluriverse: The Geopolitics of Knowledge (Duke University Press, 2018).

11. For example, Mignolo and Walsh argue that `Western Christian philosophers of the European Middle Ages formulated
       their own local totality in terms of universals': Mignolo and Walsh (n 9) 164.

             Law is not myth but based on reason

             Law, based on reason, is `progressive' rather than `primitive' or
               `customary'

             Legal authority, as parliament or sovereign, is elevated above those it
               governs

             Law is singular and coherent

             Law governs humans, according to human values and for human purposes

             Law is abstract: it affects but is separate from the physical world

   For Fitzpatrick, this mythology and its political manifestations -- universalism,
   liberalism, humanism, anthropocentrism -- underpin the authority of law and generate
   the story of its origin. For critical legal theorists, the representation and articulation of
   law -- as storytelling -- might be further expressed as the question of `who speaks'
   and `who listens'.13 The power to speak the law, its `juris-diction', assumes authority
   in its very articulation. Speaking or declaring law as law arguably brings it into being,
   which means that the question of who can speak and who listens is important.

   In contrast, Indigenous legal scholars have described the authority of Indigenous law
   as more diffuse but also more grounded. For Kombumerri / Wakka Wakka scholar
   Mary Graham, authority to speak the law in Indigenous Australian legal traditions is
   not self-supporting; it is instead embedded in Earth and its multiple relations rather
   than a single location or articulation.14 In the western legal tradition, the circularity of
   authority -- how authority is authorised -- is conventionally reduced to the question
   of source. As we have discussed, this may include multiple sources and each might
   be best understood as a cultural artefact produced over time. Accordingly, the idea of
   a single source or origin of authority is contested, where the speaking and practice of
   law can be considered as `its own source of authority'.15

   One way to approach this conundrum is to consider certain cultural artefacts -- such

     473

   as the monarch, the sovereign state, the social contract and societal values -- as
   representations of authority. The construction of law turns on its representation.16 It is
   the circulation of ideas, and their consolidation as values, which enable them to come
   to represent authority and to constitute relations of power.
   Consider the well-known depiction of sovereign authority (Figure 3), which appeared
   on the cover of a famous book about the social contract and sovereign rule entitled
   Leviathan, by Thomas Hobbes (1651). The torso and arms of the central figure are
   composed of `the people' of the state, over which the sovereign assumes authority.
   You might consider how authority is represented in this image, and how it might be
   represented differently. You might also consider the representation of nature in this
   image, and its relationship to human authority.

We might compare this image of sovereign authority -- the biblical and mythical
image of the sea serpent, Leviathan, reimagined as the secular sovereign -- to the
475

anthropos of the Anthropocene. That is, to the human set apart from all that is
presumed to surround them, in a hierarchical relationship between the human (subject)
and the non-human (object). This relationship defines the key building blocks of
western law, including sovereignty, territory, property and rights. Accordingly, Earth
is reduced to being a mere `natural resource' or, alternatively, a `pristine wilderness'.
Consider the depiction of this relationship in Figure 4. How is Earth depicted? What
burden is borne by humanity? How might this idea of nature be imagined otherwise?

                Beatus (1613). Source: Deutsche Fotothek from Wikimedia Commons.

Although these images are very different, they both represent human beings and
human power as separate from Earth. In contrast, consider the relationality and
`democracy of feeling' in Indigenous jurisprudence described by Kombumerri/
Munaljahlai scholar Christine Black. In the Yugambeh tradition, the land is the source
                                                                                                                                                                  476

   of the law, which is experienced in the movement of knowledge through storytelling
   rather than the consequences arising from the exercise of authority.17
   Indigenous activists and allies have also advocated for Aboriginal land rights through
   representations of Aboriginal legal authority in public spaces. The Aboriginal Tent
   Embassy, first established opposite Parliament House in 1972 and subsequently
   established in multiple locations, exemplifies this rival representation. Similarly,
   public protest against the grant and exercise of private property rights on Aboriginal
   country offers an alternative representation of Aboriginal legal authority.

  3.4 What Would Law Be If Earth Really Mattered?18

   Is it possible to imagine law in a way that values the healthy continuation of Earth as
   a precondition (rather than an afterthought) for flourishing human existence?
   As we have discussed, western law has been conventionally understood as a closed
   system, which is both self-generating and self-authorising.19 This idea of autonomy
   emerges from a broader intellectual tradition of liberalism and humanism, which
   privileges the idea of the autonomous (liberal) subject (human). The rights-bearing
   liberal subject, which organises western law, is distinguished from its objects,

   including nature. In the context of escalating ecological degradation, some legal
   scholars have called for a `rethink' of the traditional role and objectives of rights.20
   While human rights serve an important practical and ethical function, providing
   minimum standards and fostering accountability, they are also criticised for being
   anthropocentric, gendered and individualistic, and for `creating a false sense of
   hope'.21

   Some scholars have advocated an approach that foregrounds `earth systems' in an
   attempt to reimagine law in `planetary terms' and regulatory spaces as global rather
   than as sovereign territories.22 Others have focused on the pursuit of environmental
   justice, which is principally concerned with equity and distributive fairness.23
   Proponents of this movement have embraced rights, including the right to a healthy
   environment, as well as rights for nature as discussed previously. One way to approach
   this conundrum is to think outside of our habitual reliance on rights and to reimagine
   law as if Earth really mattered.24 Approaching rights from a theoretical and practical
   perspective allows us to acknowledge the social imaginaries, or stories, that inform
   rights and to perceive the limits and possibilities of rights as a tool.

   This proposition can be understood as a mode of prefigurative politics -- that is, an
   understanding and enactment of legal and political norms as if a different state of
   affairs were in fact reality. How might our understanding of legal authority, which
   is conventionally grounded in the state, change if we accounted for legal norms and
   authority sourced in nature? How might the privilege attached to rights be understood
   if our point of departure was instead obligations owed to the non-human world? How
   might the human protagonist of western law be contextualised by an acknowledgement

   if they were grounded in an idea of law in and as a part of nature?26 What would
   it mean to think about law with a consciousness of the limits of human mastery in
   a changing climate? Becoming a climate conscious lawyer can be understood as an
   invitation to approach these questions with curiosity and courage, and the knowledge
   that the law we have imagined can be reimagined.

                        would it mean to hear it or touch it?)
                      Can you imagine a law where Earth really matters?

Of all areas of law relevant to and affected by climate change it is public international
law that is most central given climate change is a global crisis. In an effort to
address climate change the international community adopted the 1992 United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change and subsequent treaties under this
framework, most notably the 2015 Paris Agreement on Climate Change.
This chapter considers how the climate treaties are essential for addressing the climate
crisis, but how they are also beset by limitations, some of which are a product of
the nature of the international legal order. The climate treaties are not the only body

change. Multiple other areas of the law have some application, especially those dealing
with other environmental issues such as the 1992 Convention on Biological Diversity.
The chapter begins with an overview of the structure and organising principles
underlying international law and its relevance for Australian law, before turning to
assess the content of the climate treaties and other complementary rules and principles
of international law. The chapter then considers future potential trajectories for this

 1. Introduction

  Of all areas of law relevant to and affected by climate change it is public international
  law that has historically been the most important. It is primarily through public
  international law, also known simply as `international law', the law that regulates
  relationships between sovereign states, that governments have sought to address
  climate change. This is seen primarily in the adoption of the 1992 United Nations
  Framework Convention on Climate Change (`UNFCCC')1 and subsequent treaties
  under this framework, most notably the 2015 Paris Agreement on Climate Change
  (`Paris Agreement').2 Collectively we can refer to this area of international law as the
  `climate regime' or `international climate law'.

  The climate treaties are essential for addressing climate change, but they are also
  beset by fundamental limitations, some of which are a product of the nature of
  the international legal order. However, the climate regime is not the only field of
  international law relevant to climate change. Indeed, one of the key lessons of climate
  change, along with other global changes to the Earth's systems, is that it touches
  upon multiple areas of international law, especially those dealing with cross-cutting
  environmental issues such as the 1992 Convention on Biological Diversity (`CBD').3

  The chapter begins with an overview of the structure and organising principles
  underlying international law and its relevance for Australian law, before turning to
  assess the content of the climate regime and other complementary rules and principles
  of international law. The chapter then considers future potential trajectories for this
  area of the law and highlights some key issues that need to be addressed. The chapter
  invites readers to question the ways in which international law could more effectively
  address the climate crisis.

 2. Public International Law

 2.1. Sources of International Law

  Public international law is the body of law that addresses the interactions between
  states and other relevant actors.1 It is a relatively primitive legal system compared
  with most domestic legal orders. In formal terms, the law is made by states, the
  primary actors in the international legal system. A convenient summary of the content
  of international law is found in Article 38 of Statute of the International Court of
  Justice (`ICJ Statute'), which directs the Court to apply the following sources when
  addressing cases brought before it: (a) treaties, (b) customary international law, (c)
  general principles of law, and (d) judicial decisions and academic writings.

  Treaties are binding agreements entered into between two or more states, and there are
  now thousands of treaties on a range of topics, including climate change. Customary
  international law refers to legal rules that develop out of the practice of states where
  states regard that practice as being required as a matter of law. This means that
  constant and uniform practice over a period of time can give rise to new rules of
  law. There are a number of customary rules relevant to climate change, including the
  obligation to prevent transboundary environmental harm.2 A third source of law is
  general principles of law. These primarily concern norms that are shared across legal
  systems that relate to matters such as due process, and they are of limited relevance to
  climate issues.

  The final sources of international law referred to in the ICJ Statute are decisions
  of national or international courts and the writings of distinguished scholars. While
  there is no system of binding precedent in international law, decisions of international
  courts have been influential in the development of the law, including in relation to

  environmental issues.3 The most important such decision to date is the 2025 advisory
  opinion of the International Court of Justice (`ICJ') on the Obligations of States in
  Respect of Climate Change,4 which is considered later in this chapter.

 2.2. Incorporation into Australian Law

  International law imposes obligations on states on the international plane, but in
  performing those duties it will often be necessary for states to pass new laws or amend
  existing laws within their own domestic legal systems. International climate law is no
  exception, and a domestic legal response is needed, even if states have some flexibility
  in choosing what form their domestic law will take.5

  In Australia there are various Acts and Regulations at a national and state/territory
  level that give effect to Australia's obligations under the UNFCCC and subsequent
  treaties. These include the Climate Change Act 2022 (Cth), which sets out Australia's
  greenhouse gas (`GHG') emissions reduction targets, provides that the
  Commonwealth government must make annual climate change statements, and
  confers advisory functions on the Climate Change Authority. In addition to
  Commonwealth law, there is also legislation in the states and territories that address
  climate change.6

  There are potential opportunities for using international climate law in domestic
  climate litigation in many jurisdictions,7 although the extent to which these are
  available in Australia is very limited. For instance, litigants in proceedings in Australia
  challenging approval of a new coalmine cannot simply rely on the Paris Agreement,
  or any other international law, as directly enforceable law, and must mount their case

  on the basis of the relevant legislative framework which may, or may not, allow the
  courts to consider international law.
  Notably, Australia's national environmental law, the Environment Protection and
  Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (Cth) (`EPBC Act'), does not require detailed
  consideration of the climate impacts of fossil fuel projects. As Peel observes, the
  EPBC Act `is not fit-for-purpose as a measure for evaluating how domestic fossil
  fuel projects contribute to global GHG emissions levels and climate change'.8 This
  situation has not changed following the 2025 reforms to the EPBC Act by the
  Environment Protection Reform Act 2025 and related legislation.

 3. The International Climate Regime

 3.1. The Collective Action Problem

  Climate change is a classic collective action problem as the atmosphere is open
  to carbon wastes from all humanity, and therefore it can only be addressed by an
  international legal regime binding on roughly 200 countries.1 In the absence of such
  a regime, individual countries will have an incentive to increase their emissions and
  `free ride' on the efforts of others.

  The need for a collective and coordinated action to address climate change through
  binding international law is a major but not insurmountable challenge. There are
  previous and existing examples of such successful coordination in relation to other
  global environmental issues, most notably ozone depletion from the emission of
  ozone-depleting substances to the atmosphere.

  Climate change is also caused by the emission of atmospheric pollutants, but it is
  a more difficult problem to address because of the range of human activities that
  generate greenhouse gases. From the use of fossil fuels to generate energy, to land
  use changes (eg deforestation) and food production, GHG emissions are a ubiquitous
  part of many aspects of human life. While there are cost-effective options to reduce
  or eliminate emissions, in the absence of rules that incentivise or mandate their use it
  is difficult to change human behaviour at the necessary scale and pace. This is where
  the law comes in, as it can be an instrument for effective regulation under the right
  conditions.

 3.2. The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change

  The origins of international climate law lie in a 1988 UN General Assembly
  Resolution which recognised climate change as the `common concern of humankind',2

1. On the governance of commons see generally Elinor Ostrom, Governing the Commons. The Evolution of Institutions for
      Collective Action (Cambridge University Press, 1990).

   489

  and the creation of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (`IPCC')
  in the same year.3 Shortly afterwards negotiations began on the UNFCCC, which
  was adopted at the Rio Earth Summit in 1992. Unlike the 1987 Montreal Protocol
  on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer4 (`Montreal Protocol'), the UNFCCC
  did not include targets and timetables for reducing emissions. Instead, it sets out an
  overarching framework for more specific implementing agreements to follow later. It
  is a widely adopted agreement, with 198 states parties.

  The central objective of the UNFCCC is found in Article 2: the `stabilization of
  greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent
  dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system'. It goes on to provide
  that this level should be achieved within a timeframe that will permit ecosystems
  to adapt naturally, prevent threats to food production and ensure that economic
  development can proceed sustainably. In pursuing this objective, the parties are to be
  guided by several fundamental principles. First, the climate system is to be protected
  for the benefit of present and future generations, on the basis of equity and according
  to common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities (Article 3(1)).
  This means that developed countries must take the lead in reducing emissions. Second,
  special attention must be paid to the needs and special circumstances of developing
  countries, especially those states vulnerable to climate change, such as small island
  states (Article 3(2)). Third, the UNFCCC incorporates the precautionary principle,
  which provides that full scientific certainty should not be used as an excuse for failing
  to take measures to anticipate, prevent or minimise the causes of climate change
  (Article 3(3)).

  A core feature of the UNFCCC is its division of countries into two categories: Annex
  I (industrialised) and non-Annex I (non-industrialised) states. The UNFCCC imposes
  some obligations on all parties, including to report their GHG emissions and develop
  programs to reduce emissions, but it is the industrialised countries that have special
  duties, on the basis of equity, to take the lead in combating climate change and its
  adverse effects.

 3.3. The Kyoto Protocol

  The distinction between industrialised and non-industrialised states was carried into
  the 1997 Kyoto Protocol to the UNFCCC.5 The Kyoto Protocol was modelled on the
  ozone regime, set out emissions reduction targets for industrialised states, and required
  these countries to provide technical and other assistance to developing countries. It
  was anticipated that there would be successive `commitment periods' -- that is, five-
  year periods under which the parties progressively adopted stricter targets.

  The fundamental objective of the Kyoto Protocol was set out in Article 3, and provided
  that industrialised states must individually or jointly ensure that their total GHG
  emissions do not exceed their assigned amounts. To achieve its objectives the Kyoto
  Protocol also created market-based mechanisms, including emissions trading that
  allows states to exchange carbon reduction units. The theory behind this is that it
  allows emissions to be reduced at the lowest cost. Another innovative feature of the
  Kyoto Protocol was its compliance procedure, which was designed to ensure that states
  accurately reported their emissions and met their reduction targets.

  The Kyoto Protocol turned out to be a very modest addition to the climate regime. It
  was only able to deliver a small decrease in global GHG emissions. One of the reasons
  for this is that it did not apply binding emissions targets to emerging economies,
  including China, which became the world's largest emitter in 2006. The United States
  also never became a party to the agreement. It became clear that a more comprehensive
  response was needed. Discussion on a successor to the Kyoto Protocol came to a head
  at the UNFCCC Conference of the Parties in Denmark in 2009 (`COP15') where a
  political declaration known as the Copenhagen Accord was agreed following difficult
  negotiations.6

  Although it was not a treaty, the Copenhagen Accord was significant in several
  respects. For the first time it included specific temperature goals (staying below 1.5/
  2.0 캜 above pre-industrial temperatures) and it required developed country parties to
  submit economy-wide emissions targets to the UNFCCC Secretariat. Moreover, the

Copenhagen Accord was more inclusive than the Kyoto Protocol in bringing together
developed and developing states in emissions mitigation commitments.

3.4. The Paris Agreement on Climate Change

As it was not legally binding, the Copenhagen Accord was not able to provide a clear
legal basis for responding to the climate crisis, and the climate regime remained in a
hiatus until December 2015 when the Paris Agreement was adopted.

The Paris Agreement has since become one of the most widely ratified treaties in
history, with 195 states parties. Building on aspects of the Copenhagen Accord, and
abandoning the targets and timetables of the Kyoto Protocol, the Paris Agreement
seeks to address climate change by a `bottom up' approach. All states, both developed
and developing, are legally bound to take ambitious steps to address climate change.
The key elements of the Paris Agreement include:

          the goal of limiting global temperature increase to well below 2 캜, and
            pursuing efforts to limit the increase to 1.5 캜;

          the goal of peaking GHG emissions as soon as possible, and reaching net
            zero by the second half of this century;

          binding obligations on all parties to submit nationally determined
            contributions (`NDCs') every five years on their emissions pledges and the
            steps taken to achieve them;

          a global stocktake to occur every five years, based on the best available
            science, to assess collective progress towards achieving the goals of the
            Paris Agreement;

          a global goal of enhancing the capacity of states to adapt to climate change,
            especially developing countries;

          reaffirming the obligations of developing states to provide developing
            countries with financial and other support to reduce emissions and adapt to
            climate change; and

          a transparency and accounting system to monitor compliance with the Paris
            Agreement.
                                                                                                                                                                  492

   Unlike the Kyoto Protocol, which prescribed quantified emissions targets for
   industrialised countries, the Paris Agreement takes a pledge-and-review approach.
   Rajamani and Werksman note that in this way the agreement `rel[ies] less on its legal
   character than on its collective goals, reporting and review mechanisms, and regular
   stock-takes to shape state behaviour and public attitudes'.7

   The NDC process is arguably its most important feature. Parties are required to
   prepare successive NDCs every five years showing the steps they are taking to
   address climate change.8 Each new NDC is to `represent a progression beyond' the
   party's then current NDC and `reflect its highest possible ambition'.9 Developed
   countries must take the lead and pledge absolute and economy-wide reduction targets,
   while developing countries are encouraged to move towards these depending on their
   national circumstances. NDCs are to be aimed at achieving the temperature goals
   of the Paris Agreement.10 NDCs are also to be informed by the global stocktake on
   collective progress, the first of which was completed in 2023.11

   Some 180 of the 195 parties to the Paris Agreement have submitted NDCs, covering
   around 95 per cent of global GHG emissions.12 Despite widespread support for and
   participation in the NDC process, questions surround the capacity of NDCs to prevent
   dangerous climate change. The adequacy of NDCs, both individually and collectively,
   has been the subject of a growing body of analysis, and questions raised as to whether
   the NDC `show and tell' or `ambition cycle'13 system can deliver the Paris Agreement
   objectives.14

     493

   The NDC system was designed to be an open and flexible mechanism to encourage
   all parties to take steps to reduce emissions and adapt to climate change. However,
   as there is no prescribed content for NDCs they vary significantly and address a wide
   range of commitments and policies. One apparent flaw in this approach is that it has
   encouraged some governments to overstate the significance of their pledges and the
   efficacy of their policies, leading to the criticism that NDCs can involve a type of
   `greenwashing'. Without detailed knowledge of country context and the nature of
   the pledge or promise, these documents may appear more impressive at face value
   than they are in reality.15 Central to improving this aspect of the NDC system will
   be the `enhanced transparency framework' that is being developed under Article 13
   of the Paris Agreement. Through this process parties will need to submit biennial
   transparency reports on progress towards NDCs, which are subject to a technical
   review and a peer review by other parties.

   Some of the concerns relating to the NDC system are borne out in the outcomes of the
   first global stocktake in 2023, which reached very sobering conclusions.16 It noted that
   progress has been made towards the Paris Agreement temperature goals, from a likely
   increase of 4 캜 prior to the adoption of the treaty, to an increase of between 2.1 캜
   and 2.8 캜 if NDCs are fully implemented.17 Almost 90 per cent of the global economy
   is now covered by targets for climate neutrality, and this keeps open the possibility
   of maintaining temperature increases below 2 캜 if these targets are met. However,
   the global stocktake found that implementing current NDCs would only reduce global
   emissions by 2 per cent by 2030 compared with 2019 levels,18 and that there is a major
   `implementation gap' between what is promised in NDCs and what is actually being
   delivered.19 This means that `deep, rapid and sustained reductions' of 43 per cent by

   In its decision on the global stocktake at the UNFCCC Conference of the Parties
   in Dubai in 2023 (`COP28'), the conference called on parties to implement specific
   policies to achieve the necessary reductions in greenhouse gases. This included not
   only increased deployment of renewable energy but also the phase-out of coal power.21
   The call to transition away from fossil fuels was heralded as signalling `the beginning
   of the end' for the fossil fuel era.22
   Among several elements of the Paris Agreement still under development is the `loss
   and damage' mechanism, which seeks to provide financial support for countries
   that suffer impacts from climate change that cannot be averted either by reducing
   emissions or by adaptation policies.

 4. Climate Change and Other Areas of International
 Law

  International law has expanded substantially in the range of topics it addresses.
  Obviously, it is the climate regime that is of primary significance to the climate crisis,
  however other aspects of international law are also relevant, particularly those dealing
  with environmental issues. All areas of international law are implicated in some way
  and can assist in small or larger ways in addressing the problem.1

  There is also the potential for some areas of international law to operate as handbrakes
  on action. For instance, international trade law, which seeks to liberalise global trade,
  may prevent states from adopting progressive climate policies if it involves
  unjustifiable trade restrictions. Furthermore, international investment law, which is
  designed to protect foreign investments in host countries, can come into tension with
  the rights of states to address climate change in the public interest.2 Investor-state
  dispute settlement under investment treaties can, for instance, enable foreign fossil
  fuel companies to challenge climate policies.

 4.1. Other Relevant International Environmental Regimes

  4.1.1. Ozone Depletion Regime
  An important precursor to the climate regime were several treaties dealing with
  another atmospheric pollution problem -- the depletion of the ozone layer. As ozone-
  depleting substances are greenhouse gases the ozone regime has also played an
  important role in mitigating climate change.

  Following the discovery in the 1980s of a substantial hole in ozone layer, a region

  of the stratosphere that protects the Earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation, the
  international community responded promptly through the adoption of the 1985 Vienna
  Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer and the 1987 Montreal Protocol
  to phase out the production, trade and use of ozone depleting substances such as
  chlorofluorocarbons. This response, which has become more stringent over time
  through amendments to the Montreal Protocol, has had significant success, with
  global emissions of ozone-depleting substances falling by more than 99 per cent.3 The
  ozone hole is now closing.

  The ozone regime has substantial co-benefits for mitigating climate change given that
  ozone-depleting substances are powerful greenhouse gases. The Kigali Amendments
  to the Montreal Protocol to limit the use of hydrofluorocarbons are expected to
  prevent the emissions of up to 105 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent of
  greenhouse gases.4

  4.1.2. Convention on Biological Diversity
  Another example of a regime with clear relevance to the climate crisis is the CBD.
  The CBD seeks to conserve biological diversity, and promote the sustainable use
  of its components, and recognises the close connection between safeguarding nature
  and addressing climate change. This is seen in the CBD's Kunming-Montreal Global
  Biodiversity Framework, adopted in 2022.5 The framework succeeds and replaces the
  Aichi Targets. It includes four overarching goals and 23 accompanying targets to
  be achieved by 2030. These include Target 8, which is to `[m]inimize the impact
  of climate change and ocean acidification on biodiversity and increase its resilience
  through mitigation, adaptation, and disaster risk reduction actions'.

 4.2. The Law of the Sea

  An area of international law that has had increasing engagement with climate issues
  is the law of the sea, the main content of which is found in the 1982 United Nations
  Convention on the Law of the Sea (`UNCLOS').6

  UNCLOS includes detailed provisions relating to the protection of the marine
  environment from all sources of pollution, including the atmosphere. In an advisory
  opinion issued in 2024, the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (`ITLOS')
  found that parties to UNCLOS have the specific obligation under Article 194 of
  UNCLOS to take all necessary measures to prevent, reduce and control marine
  pollution from anthropogenic GHG emissions.7 Importantly, ITLOS found that this
  obligation will not be satisfied simply by complying with the obligations and
  commitments under the Paris Agreement.8

  ITLOS has elaborated in detail what parties to UNCLOS, which include most states,
  must do to protect the ocean, which is the most important component of the climate
  system. The ocean has absorbed around 30 per cent of the carbon dioxide emitted by
  human activities, and 90 per cent of the extra warmth added to the climate system by
  heat-trapping gases.9 ITLOS found that governments have a due diligence obligation
  to take all necessary measures to prevent, reduce and control marine pollution from
  GHG emissions. These measures are to be determined objectively, taking into account
  the best available science and the relevant international rules set out in the UNFCCC
  and the Paris Agreement, including the 1.5 C temperature goal. ITLOS also observed
  that this standard of due diligence is stringent, given the high risks of serious and
  irreversible harm posed to the marine environment from GHG emissions, and that

   states must adopt and implement national laws to give effect to the due diligence
   obligation.

  4.3. General Principles of International Law

   Climate change raises a number of questions for general principles of international
   law. These include whether states can be held responsible for climate change induced
   damage to other states, and whether states can continue to exist if their territories are
   submerged or become uninhabitable.

   The state responsibility question has been challenging for several reasons, including
   the difficulty in establishing causation given that climate change is a global problem
   and different from the `classic' case of transboundary harm (such as the celebrated
   Trail Smelter Case10 involving air pollution from a metals smelter in Canada damaging
   farmland across the border in the United States).

   In relation to statehood, there are four key criteria under international law. These are
   territory, a permanent population, effective government and the capacity to enter into
   international relations. The first two of these, territory and population, are considered
   the most vital requirements. The loss of these, certainly if permanent, would appear
   to deprive an existing state of its status as such.11 The International Law Commission,
   a United Nations body of international legal experts tasked with codifying and
   progressively developing the law, examined the issue in a Study Group on Sea Level
   Rise in International Law.12 The co-chairs of the study group concluded that there is
   a strong presumption of the continuity of statehood, and that this position has been
   endorsed by a range of states including the United States (which in 2023 declared that
   human-induced sea level rise should not cause any country to lose its statehood or
   membership of the United Nations).13

   Pacific Island states have been at the forefront of state practice on this issue. In
   November 2023, the Pacific Islands Forum (`PIF') adopted a Declaration on the
   Continuity of Statehood and the Protection of Persons in the Face of Climate Change-
   Related Sea-Level Rise.14 PIF members recognised that under international law there
   is a general presumption that a state, once established, will continue to exist and
   endure, and maintain its status and effectiveness, and that international law does not
   contemplate the demise of statehood in the context of climate change related sea level
   rise.

   This position was endorsed by the ICJ in its 2025 advisory opinion on the Obligations
   of States in Relation to Climate Change.15 The Court concluded that once a state is
   established, the disappearance of one of its constituent elements would not necessarily
   entail the loss of its statehood.16 The Court also endorsed the PIF's position17 that
   baselines and maritime zones do not need to be changed as a result of climate change
   induced sea level rise.18 This largely puts to rest two fundamental questions that had
   generated extensive academic commentary.

   To address the consequences of climate change for a vulnerable state, two members of
   the PIF, Australia and Tuvalu, adopted the Falepili Union Treaty, which entered into
   force in 2024.19 Under the treaty, Australia recognises Tuvalu's continuing statehood
   and sovereignty, notwithstanding the impact of sea-level rise, has committed to assist
   Tuvalu in response to a major natural disaster, health pandemic or military aggression,

 5. The ICJ's Advisory Opinion on the Obligations of
 States in Relation to Climate Change

  In 2025 the ICJ handed down its comprehensive advisory opinion on the obligations
  of states in relation to climate change. The questions put to ICJ by the UN General
  Assembly were as follows:1

              Having particular regard to the Charter of the United Nations, the
              International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International
              Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the United Nations
              Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Paris Agreement, the
              United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, the duty of due diligence,
              the rights recognized in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the
              principle of prevention of significant harm to the environment and the duty
              to protect and preserve the marine environment,

                      a. What are the obligations of States under international law to
                          ensure the protection of the climate system and other parts of the
                          environment from anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases
                          for States and for present and future generations?

                      b. What are the legal consequences under these obligations for States
                          where they, by their acts and omissions, have caused significant
                          harm to the climate system and other parts of the environment,
                          with respect to:
                                   i. States, including, in particular, small island developing
                                      States, which due to their geographical circumstances
                                      and level of development, are injured or specially
                                      affected by or are particularly vulnerable to the adverse
                                      effects of climate change?
                                  ii. Peoples and individuals of the present and future

                                                                                                                                                                502

                                      generations affected by the adverse effects of climate
                                      change?

  While the advisory opinion is not itself binding on states2 (in contrast to judgments
  rendered in contentious proceedings3) it nonetheless carries legal significance.
  Advisory opinions are usually accepted by states as final and conclusive. Accordingly,
  the Court's advisory opinion on climate change should be regarded as an authoritative
  statement of the relevant law, particularly given that the opinion was adopted
  unanimously.

  The ICJ considered that in ascertaining the obligations of states in respect of climate
  change a wide range of international law was relevant, including the climate treaties
  (UNFCCC, Kyoto Protocol and Paris Agreement), UNCLOS, environmental treaties,
  customary international law, international human rights law and other principles of
  international law.4

  The ICJ did not accept the argument made by Australia and some other governments
  that the climate treaties constituted the `principal source of States' obligations to
  protect the climate system' and that other international treaties or customary rules
  should not be interpreted `as going beyond' the climate treaties.5 The following
  discussion will focus on the Court's treatment of the Paris Agreement and customary
  international law, but the advisory opinion is of much broader scope and now stands as
  the most wide ranging and influential summary of the international legal obligations
  of states to address the climate crisis.

  In relation to the climate regime, the Court found that the parties to the Paris
  Agreement have agreed through a decision adopted at COP26, and subsequently
  reaffirmed, that the 1.5 캜 threshold is the parties agreed primary temperature goal for

   limiting the global average temperature increase under the Paris Agreement.6 This is
   an important conclusion, not only for the interpretation of the Paris Agreement but also
   for understanding the operation of other obligations under international law to protect
   the climate system.

   Under Article 4(2) of the Paris Agreement, parties must prepare, communicate and
   maintain successive NDCs that they intend to achieve and pursue domestic mitigation
   measures to achieve these contributions. The Court found that these are legally binding
   obligations. The Court considered that the discretion of parties in preparing NDCs
   is `limited' and that parties must meet a stringent duty of due diligence to ensure
   that their NDCs meet their obligations under the Paris Agreement and, together, are
   capable of achieving the temperature goal.7 NDCs must become progressively more
   demanding over time and must reflect a state's `highest possible ambition'. The Court
   interpreted the latter requirement to mean that a party's NDC must be capable of
   making an adequate contribution to the achievement of the temperature goal.8 This
   means that the ambition in a party's NDC must be referable to the overarching
   objective of the Paris Agreement under Article 2 to hold the increase in global
   average temperature to below 1.5 캜, which the Court interpreted to be the primary
   temperature goal.9

   In addition, Article 4(2) of the Paris Agreement `establish[es] an obligation of
   conduct' such that `parties are required to act with due diligence in taking necessary
   measures to achieve the objectives set out in their successive NDCs'.10 The Court
   explained that what is required `is not a guarantee that communicated NDCs will be
   achieved, but rather that they will make best efforts to obtain such a result'.11 The
   Court found that parties must proactively pursue domestic mitigation measures that
   are `reasonably capable of achieving the NDCs set by them' and explained that these

   may include `putting in place a national system, including legislation, administrative
   procedures and an enforcement mechanism, and exercising adequate vigilance to make
   such a system function effective'.12

   Turning from the climate treaties, the Court considered the relevance of the duty to
   prevent transboundary harm, a longstanding rule of customary international law. The
   Court found that this duty also applies to the climate system,13 concluding that the
   `most significant primary obligation' for states in relation to climate change under
   customary international law is the obligation to prevent significant harm to the climate
   system and other parts of the environment.14 The Court noted that the duty arises only
   where there is risk of significant harm to the environment. Importantly, the Court
   accepted that the risk of significant harm may be present in situations where the harm
   results from the cumulative effects of various acts undertaken by states and private
   actors under their jurisdiction or control, even if it is difficult to identify a specific
   share of responsibility for any particular state.15

   The Court also observed that `States must assess the possible cumulative effects of
   their acts and the planned activities under their jurisdiction or control'16 and that while
   climate change is the consequence of all activities that contribute to GHG emissions
   it `does not mean that individual conduct leading to emissions cannot give rise to
   the obligation to prevent significant transboundary harm even if such activity is
   environmentally insignificant in isolation'.17

   Having found that climate change entailed a risk of significant harm, the Court then
   turned to consider the required standard of conduct. The Court reaffirmed that to
   comply with the obligation to prevent significant harm to the environment, states must
   act with due diligence. The Court identified several elements which it considered to

     505

   be particularly relevant for determining what due diligence requires in the context of
   climate change. These elements include:

             implementing appropriate regulatory measures to prevent significant harm
               to the climate system;18

             considering relevant scientific information (which may entail the standard
               of due diligence becoming more demanding over time);19

             taking into account relevant international rules and standards (including
               certain COP decisions, such as those relating to the 1.5 캜 temperature
               threshold);20

             having regard to the differing capabilities and national circumstances of
               states (with developed states required to satisfy a more demanding standard
               of conduct);21

             considering the precautionary approach or principle to guide the
               determination of the required standard of conduct;22 and

             the obligation to undertake certain procedural steps, including the
               requirement to undertake an environmental impact assessment (`EIA') (the
               Court `considers it important that all States provide for and conduct EIAs
               with respect to particularly significant proposed industrial activities
               contributing to GHG emissions').23

   The Court specifically observed that the failure

               to take appropriate action to protect the climate system from GHG emissions
               -- including through fossil fuel production, fossil fuel consumption, the
               granting of fossil fuel exploration licences or the provision of fossil fuel

               subsidies -- may constitute an internationally wrongful act which is
               attributable to that State.24

   The Court also considered the potential consequences of a breach of the obligation to
   protect the climate system. The Court affirmed the accepted view that international
   legal obligations relating to the climate system as a global environmental commons
   establish obligations erga omnes (ie owed to all states) such that `responsibility for
   breaches of such obligations, such as climate change mitigation obligations, may be
   invoked by any State'.25 However, while this means that any state may have standing
   to invoke a breach of another state's international legal obligations in relation to
   climate change, only states that establish that they have been injured may make a claim
   for reparation.26

   In order for an applicant state to obtain reparation, it would be necessary to establish
   that it suffered damage caused by a wrongful act of another state. The Court explained
   that the general legal standard for causation in international law (`a sufficiently direct
   and certain causal nexus between the wrongful act ... and the injury suffered by the
   Applicant'27) can be applied to the climate context and involves two distinct elements:
   first, establishing whether a certain event or trend can be attributed to climate change;
   and second, whether damage caused by climate change can be attributed to a state or a
   group of states.28 The Court emphasised that establishing a causal link would need to
   occur in each specific case based on the evidence raised in those proceedings.29

 6. Future Trajectories in International Climate Law

  There are significant weaknesses with the Paris Agreement. Its architecture assumes
  that states working together over time will increase their ambition and put pressure on
  laggards. There is no guarantee that this will occur, and it is possible that there will
  be `backsliding', with states such as the United States breaking their commitments or
  even walking away entirely from the agreement.1

  Not all criticism of the Paris Agreement is merited, insofar as it focuses weaknesses
  that all areas of international law have. It is an inherently consensual system, reliant
  on the cooperation of states, and as a consequence there is a tendency towards the
  `lowest common denominator'. Moreover, the ICJ's advisory opinion in Obligations
  of States in Relation to Climate Change has dramatically changed the legal landscape,
  highlighting the wide range of international legal obligations that can be invoked to
  address the climate crisis, from human rights to the law of the sea. It is possible that we
  will now see a number of contentious proceedings, with applicant states commencing
  proceedings on the basis of the Court's findings in its advisory opinion.

  Nonetheless, because of the climate regime's limitations, arguments have been
  building for approaches that would complement or take an alternative approach to the
  Paris Agreement and address the central cause of the problem at its source -- the
  extraction of fossil fuels. Led by Vanuatu and Tuvalu, 13, mostly Pacific, nations have
  called on other governments to join them in developing a fossil fuel non-proliferation
  treaty.2 Drawing on the experience with other regimes on ozone-depleting substances,
  landmines, tobacco and nuclear weapons, the proposal is for a treaty founded on three
  pillars: first, an immediate end to the expansion of new coal, oil and gas production
  (`non-proliferation'); second, winding down existing production in line with the Paris
  Agreement 1.5 캜 temperature target in a manner that is `fast and fair' (a `fair
  phase-out'); and third, global financial support so that no country, community or

  citizen is left behind (a `just transition'). There are similar arguments in favour of a
  comprehensive treaty to protect the world's tropical forests given the contribution of
  deforestation to global emissions. Anthony Burke, who with Stefanie Fishel developed
  a detailed proposal for a coal ban treaty,3 argues that

              states cannot depend on voluntarist governance models and disregard of
              climate science, but should take the new initiatives on coal, forests, and
              fossil fuels to the [UN] General Assembly and negotiate them as binding
              agreements that can spur faster reductions and pressure laggard states.4
  Burke contends that this could `force systemic and cascading change across energy,
  technology and commodity markets as much as in government policy making'.5

 7. Conclusion

  It can be argued that public international law, as traditionally configured, has enabled
  the climate crisis. This is because it has facilitated the extractivism at the heart of the
  global industrial-capitalist system that has driven global environmental decline. As has
  been seen in this chapter, there have been some steps away from this paradigm in
  international law, but to date these have not matched the scale of the challenge faced
  by humanity in the Anthropocene, the era in which human activities have become the
  dominant force of planetary environmental change.
  The ICJ's landmark advisory opinion in Obligations of States in Relation to Climate
  Change indicates that alternative visions are available, that reimaginings of public
  international law that take seriously the reality of global environmental crises are
  possible. However, for these to be realised in practice there is an urgent need for
  creative and intentional climate-conscious lawyering, to bring to the mechanisms
  of international lawmaking (treaty-making, state practice and court proceedings) an
  Earth-centred agenda that can safeguard, to use the words of the ICJ in its Nuclear
  Weapons Advisory Opinion, the `living space, the quality of life and the very health of
  human beings, including generations unborn'.1

While the primary purpose of taxation is to raise revenue, governments have long
understood that tax design can influence behaviour -- either by discouraging certain
activities through taxation or encouraging others through concessions such as
deductions or discounts. As a result, taxation can play a significant role in a state's
climate policy mix.
This chapter first examines the role of carbon taxes, widely regarded as one of the most
effective climate policy tools, and compares them with emissions trading schemes,
which impose a price on greenhouse gas (`GHG') emissions in a less direct way. We
also explore how existing taxes can be redesigned to support climate goals.

                                                                 511
                                                                                                                                                             512

Building on the traditional principles used to evaluate tax systems, we propose an
additional criterion: climate impact. As a case study, we focus on three Australian
taxes that affect emissions from road transport -- a major source of the country's GHG
emissions. These are the fuel tax, the fringe benefits tax on car benefits, and the luxury
car tax.

 1. Introduction: Tax as a Driver of Behaviour

  Although the primary purpose of taxation is to raise revenue to fund government
  functions and for redistribution purposes, governments have long recognised that
  taxes influence behaviour and therefore can be used to achieve policy objectives, in
  addition or alternatively to other policy instruments such as direct regulation.1 Taxes
  can directly and indirectly drive taxpayers to adopt, limit or abstain from certain
  behaviours and therefore can be used by governments as a tool in pursuing climate
  policy objectives. A recent systematic review by the Organisation for Economic
  Co-operation and Development (`OECD') of empirical studies measuring the
  effectiveness of taxes and other policy instruments in achieving climate policy
  objectives confirmed that carbon taxes and other taxes are effective in reducing
  emissions.2 However, that same review revealed that there are still large evidence gaps
  in relation to many regions and sectors, meaning that the effectiveness of such policies
  is often not formally evaluated. In this chapter, we will examine some examples of
  how the tax system can and is used in Australia to influence both corporate and
  individual taxpayers in relation to climate change issues. Although many alternatives
  are available, to date the Australian tax system has only adopted quite narrowly
  targeted measures, and ex post evidence of their effectiveness is often not available.3

  Edward Ross, writing in 1892, explained the role of tax, in particular a `prohibitive
  tax', as a desirable and more precise or delicate tool for the state to shape societal
  outcomes than criminalising an undesirable phenomenon.4 Ross used the term

      focusing on GHG emissions -- the carbon sink forests tax incentive found in sub-div 40-J of the Income Tax
      Assessment Act 1997 (Cth) -- was evaluated by government as falling short of expectations in its early years of
      operation, and no estimates have been done since 2012. See Natalie Stoianoff, Michael Walpole and Binh Tran-
      Nam, `A Preliminary Analysis of Australian Income Tax Measures Relating to Environmental Protection' (2024) 53

  `phenomenon' as the general term for the tax base--that is, the act, person, thing or
  condition that gives rise to the obligation to pay tax (referred to as the `contribution').5
  Ross identified that from the individual taxpayer perspective the payment of tax is an
  evil, and the taxpayer will seek to reduce taxation by minimising the occasion of the
  contribution, thereby suppressing some of the phenomena. He noted that `scarcely any
  tax will be so light as to suppress none of the taxed phenomena or so heavy as to
  suppress all.'6 Thus tax can be seen as tool to suppress certain behaviours to address a
  societal need or goal, such as taxes on tobacco and alcohol, which by raising the prices
  of these products serve to discourage consumption and thereby reduce the harmful
  impacts on individual health and the burden on the public health system. This approach
  is intuitively useful in thinking about the role of taxation in addressing climate change.
  To stop certain behaviours -- for example, emitting GHGs -- one can impose a tax on
  them.

  The concept of imposing a tax on certain undesirable activities is often called a
  Pigouvian tax, after the British economist Arthur Pigou and drawing on his influential
  work The Economics of Welfare.7 Pigouvian taxes are designed to internalise the
  external costs of an activity that causes negative side effects, known as externalities,
  which the market does not otherwise recognise. Pigouvian taxes or pricing can form
  part of environmental policy mixes where `large market failures remain unaddressed
  -- among them the adverse effects of greenhouse gas emissions, [and] the loss of
  biodiversity.'8 A true Pigouvian tax is one where the actual cost of the externality is
  recouped by the tax, providing revenue that may then be directed to ameliorate the
  damage. A carbon tax is the oft-cited example of this and is discussed in more detail
  below.

  Tax systems can similarly be used to encourage certain activities that have societal
  benefits or to meet societal goals. These are sometimes referred to as Pigouvian

   subsidies. Each year Federal Treasury produces a report measuring the value of the
   major subsidies that are part of the tax system, which are referred to in the report
   as `tax expenditures'.9 A tax expenditure represents a variation from the standard
   tax treatment and can be by way of a tax exemption or concessional taxation, or
   the provision of deductions or rebates that would not otherwise be available.10 Tax
   expenditures can be a substitute for more direct government spending. Some examples
   of the use of tax expenditures in Australia to support climate policy are considered in
   this chapter.

   This chapter focuses on features of the federal tax system, with reference to provisions
   of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (Cth) (`ITAA 1997') and the Income Tax
   Assessment Act 1936 (Cth) (`ITAA 1936') and other relevant Commonwealth tax
   legislation. There is firstly a discussion of the tax issues related to carbon pricing.
   Although the federal tax system contains a variety of measures that could be
   considered to have a climate impact, by way of example, this chapter focuses on tax
   rules related to motor vehicles, which can impact transport emissions. The revenue
   systems of the states and territories can also play a part in addressing climate change.

                                                 KEY QUESTIONS
                      Given that taxes and tax concessions can be used to indirectly

                        influence behaviour, what sort of activities could be targeted by
                        such measures in Australia?
                      Taxes have the primary purpose of generating revenue for
                        governments that can then be used to support climate initiatives.
                        Why, then, do you think that environmentally related taxes have
                        been so politically unpopular?

 2. Evaluating Australian Taxes and the Environment

  Australian governments use tax measures to effect social change. This is so prevalent
  that it is considered a contributory factor to the notable complexity of the federal
  income tax system.1 This social engineering aspect of taxation is driven by a multitude
  of factors, including `to correct perceived market failures' or to reward friends and win
  votes in marginal seats (consider the Albanese Government's 2024 `cost-of-living tax
  cuts').2 The tax system is sometimes used to prevent rewarding unlawful behaviour
  (such as ITAA 1997 s 26-5 denying deductions for fines and penalties) or to improve
  the integrity of the system (such as the introduction in 2017 of ITAA 1997 s 26-31
  limiting deductions available for travel related to residential rental properties). Tax can
  be used to encourage a particular type of activity, like the build-to-rent tax concessions
  (income tax concessions introduced by the federal government in 2024 work alongside
  land tax concessions provided by several states).3

  Government decisions to impose, exempt or provide concessional treatment for taxes
  on various activities to achieve specific socio-economic outcomes are frequently
  subject to political, academic and public critique. This dynamic is particularly evident
  in discussions surrounding proposed tax policies during the lead-up to federal
  elections. Climate conscious lawyering involves critically evaluating these decisions
  through the lens of their potential climate impact. We can evaluate the merits of
  imposing specific tax new measures, such as a Pigouvian or environmental tax, and we
  can consider existing tax laws and ask whether they help to meet Australia's obligation
  under the Paris Agreement to reach net zero.

  More broadly, it may be useful to rethink how we evaluate whether a tax is a `good
  tax'. Taxes are traditionally evaluated against the three broad principles of equity (or

  fairness), efficiency and simplicity.4 In the Australian tax policy context, the most
  recent comprehensive review of the Australian tax and transfer system was the Henry
  Review (named after the review's chair, Mr Ken Henry).5 The Henry Review sets out
  these three principles:6

            `Equity: The tax and transfer system should treat individuals with similar
              economic capacity in the same way, while those with greater capacity
              should bear a greater net burden.'7 This principle explains why Australia
              has a progressive tax system with marginal rate of tax increasing as the
              taxpayer has more taxable income.

            `Efficiency: The tax and transfer system should raise and redistribute
              revenue at the least possible cost to economic efficiency and with minimal
              administration and compliance costs.'8 The principle of efficiency
              recognises the behaviour-modifying effect taxes can have on the choices of
              businesses and individuals. Because taxes can move investment and
              business decisions away from those that are the most economically
              efficient, taxes are often described as distortionary. Efficiency also
              considers the administrative burden both on the taxpayer in complying (a
              common criticism of the Fringe Benefits Tax system) and on the revenue
              authority in the collection of tax.

            `Simplicity: The tax and transfer system should be easy to understand and
              simple to comply with.'9 In Australia, our federal income tax is self-
              assessed (ITAA 1936 s 161AA) and taxpayers ought to be able to easily
              determine the likely tax effects of courses of action both at the time of
              lodgement of their tax return and when making decisions about their future

   The Henry Report also added the criteria of tax system sustainability and policy
   consistency.10
   The Henry Report recognised that the tax system must be designed with growing
   environmental pressures in mind,11 and these have only become more urgent since the
   report. Climate conscious lawyering would adopt another principle: climate impact --
   does the tax measure increase or decrease harm to the climate.12

 3. Using the Tax System Directly to Reduce Harmful
 Emissions by Pricing Carbon

 3.1 Carbon Taxes and Carbon Trading

  Following the widespread adoption of the Paris Agreement1 by 196 parties, countries
  have committed to national actions known as `nationally determined contributions',2
  which represent each country's plan for reduce GHG emissions. Many parties,
  Australia included, have committed to net zero by 2050. As recognised in the OECD's
  report Pricing Greenhouse Gas Emissions,3 there are a variety of policy tools in
  the `net-zero toolbox',4 and a key instrument is explicit carbon pricing, by way of
  either carbon taxes or emissions trading systems, or a combination of the two.5 A
  government's choice of instrument is determined by a number of factors, political
  feasibility being critical.6

  The negative effects of pollution are not properly priced by the market, giving rise to
  what is known as an externality or spillover effect. The market does not charge entities
  for the act of emitting GHGs. Rather, the harm is absorbed and born by all. Correcting
  this market failure requires government intervention, the main alternatives being
  direct regulation and Pigouvian taxes. In 2008, the Garnaut Climate Change Review

   undertook detailed analysis and made recommendations to the federal government
   regarding potential responses to the challenge of climate change.7 In the resulting 2011
   policy document Securing a Clean Energy Future, the government recognised that `a
   carbon price is the most environmentally effective and economically efficient way to
   reduce pollution'.8

   The rationale for imposing a charge on emissions includes that the carbon price
   (representing the harm to the environment and the flow-on consequences) is thereby
   internalised so that firms will take this into account in making decisions, such as
   setting output levels and deciding whether to invest in cleaner technologies and fuels.
   By pricing the pollution, there is an incentive to reduce it. Another rationale is that the
   carbon price may also flow through to the price to consumers for the resulting product
   or service, making low-emissions options relatively less expensive.

   Carbon pricing mechanisms ordinarily operate by placing a cost on the emission of
   one tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent (`CO2-e') gas. By using this CO2-e measure,
   the level of intensity of the effect of a particular GHG on the environment can be taken
   into account.9

   Carbon pricing can take the form of a carbon tax or an emissions trading scheme,
   where each places a cost on the emission of each tonne of CO2-e but through different
   mechanisms. A carbon tax levies a fixed amount per tonne of covered emissions
   whereas a carbon trading system requires emitters to surrender one permit for each
   tonne of emissions. Both systems rely on a legal requirement for covered entities
   (usually facilities that emit above a specified minimum threshold) to report their
   emissions annually. The World Bank has estimated that in 2024, around 24% of
   global emissions were covered by either carbon taxes or emissions trading systems.10

   A carbon tax can be applied upstream on the supply of fuels, where the tax payable is

   based on the emissions that will be produced when that fuel is used, or downstream
   based on the actual emissions from the covered activity. One benefit of a carbon tax
   is that the carbon price is predictable, since it is a fixed rate set by the government.
   On the other hand, since a carbon tax does not directly limit the level of emissions
   but rather imposes a cost on them, the government may need to adjust the tax rate to
   achieve the desired level of emissions.

   The alternative of emissions trading is based on the government issuing a fixed
   number of permits per year equal to the emissions cap, where these permits are then
   traded between market participants, thereby producing a carbon price. A covered
   entity must surrender the number of permits to cover their reported emissions for the
   year. In this way emissions trading systems control or cap emissions but the carbon
   price is determined by the market.

   Emissions trading systems often also allow for a proportion of emissions to be met by
   the surrender of carbon credits or offsets, being units that each represent one tonne of
   carbon emissions that have been avoided, reduced or removed from the atmosphere
   (such as carbon stored in soil and forests).11 Such offsets are also traded, both privately
   and on markets. Recent work by the United Nations Framework Convention on
   Climate Change (`UNFCCC') under article 6 of the Paris Agreement aims to establish
   mechanisms for such offsets to be traded internationally.12

   Australia has not adopted a broad-based carbon tax. Instead, an emissions trading
   scheme known as the Carbon Pricing Mechanism operated briefly from 1 July 2012
   until its repeal with a change of government, effective 1 July 2014. The Government
   has since then relied on a variety of incentives to encourage emissions reductions but
   moved more recently to restructure existing policy mechanisms to create a targeted
   emissions trading system called the Safeguard Mechanism.13

13. The Safeguard Mechanism was created as a new part 3H in the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act 2007
       (Cth) and the details of the scheme are provided in the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting (Safeguard
       Mechanism) Rule 2015 (Cth).
     523

   The Safeguard Mechanism was significantly reformed in 2023 such that each facility
   that is covered by the scheme (which are high-emitting large facilities in the industrial
   and mining sectors, called `Safeguard Facilities' in the rules) will have a baseline
   emissions level that will decline over time. This baseline works as an emissions cap
   for the Safeguard Facility -- if emissions fall below the baseline for the year, the
   facility will be issued with Safeguard Mechanism Credit units (`SMCs'), which can
   be retained or traded. This type of scheme is often referred to as a baseline-and-credit
   emissions trading system due to this feature. If emissions are above the baseline for
   the year, the facility must surrender SMCs to cover the excess.

   Facilities are also able to meet any excess emissions with offsets called Australian
   Carbon Credit Units (`ACCUs') issued under the ACCU Scheme (originally known
   as the Carbon Farming Initiative).14 Entities can register projects to undertake carbon
   abatement or sequestration actions that are covered by an approved scheme method.
   Once underway, the project reports the emissions avoided or sequestered, and the
   government issues ACCUs to the project operator, who can then either retain or sell
   the offsets. ACCUs are largely generated from land-based activities that sequester or
   avoid emissions, such as soil carbon and revegetation projects. Safeguard facilities
   now hold the majority of issued ACCUs.15

   SMCs and ACCUs are intangible assets that are documented on a centralised
   government register and can be held and traded between facilities and other market
   participants, thereby producing a carbon price. In order to ensure that income tax
   effects of such trading and surrendering are consistent across participants, division 420
   was inserted into the ITAA 1997, applicable to Registered Emissions Units (`REUs')
   which include SMCs and ACCUs. These rules are modelled on the tax treatment of
   trading stock and, in general, treat the various transactions as revenue in nature. In
   effect, these rules allow a tax deduction for the cost of units that are surrendered
   by Safeguard Facilities, so that the carbon cost is treated as an additional business
   expense. Taxpayers operating a project under the ACCU Scheme will effectively

   include the value of received ACCUs as part of business income. For taxpayers that
   buy and sell units, including market traders, the combined effect of the provisions
   includes the profit on sale of an REU in assessable income and allows a loss on the
   sale of an REU as a deduction. Taken as a whole, these provisions ensure that the tax
   system deals with REU transactions in the same way as other business transactions,
   and by achieving this neutrality, the tax system should not distort or interfere with the
   functioning of the Safeguard Mechanism and ACCU Scheme.

                                                 KEY QUESTIONS
                      How do carbon taxes and emissions trading systems control

                        GHG emissions?
                      What do you think are some risks of allowing the use of offsets to

                        reduce a carbon liability?
                      Is it correct to treat emissions units the same way as other

                        business assets? Consider the different perspectives of facilities
                        with a carbon price liability and carbon traders.

  3.2 The Fuel Tax System

   According to the most recent inventory of Australia's GHG emissions, the transport
   sector is the third largest contributor and produced 22.4% of total GHG emissions for
   the year to June 2024.16 Energy taxes applied to fossil fuels, such as upstream fuel
   excise taxes on fuels used in the transport sector, can be part of the climate policy mix
   and also raise government revenue. As discussed above, the increased price reflecting
   the tax will influence the users of fuel to reduce consumption, which then would
   reduce emissions. The OECD includes fuel excise tax as a climate policy instrument
   and notes that almost all countries tax gasoline and diesel used in road transportation.17

       Greenhouse Gas Inventory: June 2024 (Australian Government, 2024) 17.

     525

   In Australia, fuel excise is a simple tax that applies at a flat rate per litre upstream
   (at the point of importation or first sale of the refined product) to petroleum and
   diesel fuels.18 Although diesel emissions per litre are higher than petroleum fuel, which
   would therefore justify a higher rate of tax from a climate perspective, most countries,
   including Australia, apply the same per litre excise tax rate.19 The rate is indexed up
   every six months and passed 50 cents per litre in late 2024.

   Australia's fuel tax system combines fuel excise with a fuel credit system. This has the
   effect of excluding certain uses of transport fuels from the tax. The OECD recognises
   that these features represent `support' for fossil fuel use,20 and some have classified
   these exclusions as subsidies,21 though this characterisation is contested. The design of
   the fuel tax system makes clear that although fuel excise is an energy tax, the objective
   of the tax is not to internalise the climate cost of the use of the transport fuels.

   The fuel tax credit system operates to refund the fuel excise to business taxpayers in
   specified circumstances. The interaction of the excise and refund systems reveals that
   the laws were designed on the premise that the fuel tax is a contribution to the cost
   of maintaining the road network. In fact, fuel tax revenues were earmarked for road
   funding from 1929 until 1959.22 Although this formal connection to road funding has
   been severed, features of the credit system still reflect this connection, and the federal
   government provides grants to the states and territories to fund roads, which come
   from consolidated revenue that includes the net fuel excise.

   Fuel excise is incorporated into the cost of fuels when it is levied upstream, but certain
   business users of the fuel can claim a refund of the excise through the fuel tax credit
   system created under the Fuel Tax Act 2006 (Cth) (`FTA'). Fuel tax credits are not
   available for either the private use of vehicles (FTA s 41-5) or the business use of light
   vehicles on public roads (FTA s 41-20). In comparison, fuel tax is wholly creditable
   (and refundable) for the use of fuel in vehicles travelling on roads that are not public

roads (such as roads at a private mining site) as well as for fuel used in a vehicle that
is not related to the travelling on roads (ie fuel that runs other elements of the vehicle
such as refrigeration). Credits are also available for fuel used in non-vehicle equipment
such as generators. As the consumption of fuels in these activities creates the same
level of pollution as using the fuel in travelling on public roads, it is clear that the fuel
tax is not designed as a carbon or environmental tax. Viewed from an environmental
tax perspective, exempting certain uses of these fuels from the tax would clearly be a
subsidy.

The connection between the fuel excise and credits system to road use is also
illustrated by the special rules that apply to heavy vehicles used on public roads.
Rather than receiving a full refund of the excise, the credit to heavy vehicle users
is reduced by the `road user charge' so that only a partial credit is available (FTA s
43-10). Heavy vehicle users also contribute to road costs by way of heavy vehicle
registration charges imposed by the states and territories, which are partly based on the
size of the vehicle.

                  How could the fuel tax system be redesigned to reflect the goal of
                    reducing GHG emissions?

 4. Motor Vehicle Tax Treatment and Emissions

  As noted above, the transport sector is a significant contributor (third largest) to
  Australia's GHG emissions and `since 2005, transport sector greenhouse gas
  emissions have increased by 19%'.1 Decarbonisation of light vehicles, typically cars,
  motor bikes and light commercial vehicles, is recognised as one of the largest
  emissions reduction opportunities in Australia. At the time of writing the
  overwhelming majority of Australian motor vehicles are wholly reliant on fossil fuels,
  with less than 10% of 2023 sales being electric, representing plug-in hybrid electric
  vehicles (`PHEVs') and battery electric vehicles (`BEVs') combined. Further, just 1%
  of the national fleet is electric.2 Tax concessions that reward or encourage vehicle
  use are therefore problematic and will interfere with goals to meet net-zero targets.
  This is particularly acute in Australia, where the transport sector is such a significant
  contributor to emissions.3
  Figure 2 illustrates the recent upward trend in electric vehicle imports. Australia does
  not have a domestic motor vehicle manufacturing industry; therefore car imports
  reflect purchases.

  We will review some examples of how taxes change behaviour regarding light vehicle
  purchases and the ways light vehicles are used.

 4.1 Fringe Benefits

  The fringe benefits tax (`FBT') was introduced in 1986 to tax benefits provided to
  employees by employers that effectively replaced salary and wages. One important
  feature of the system, the concessional treatment of motor vehicles used for mixed
  private and work use, had an unintended negative impact on the environment.
  The Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986 (Cth) (`FBTAA') division 2 deals with
  car fringe benefits. Section 7 defines a car benefit (which is therefore subject to FBT)
  inter alia as when a car is provided to an employee (or associate of the employee4)

4. For the purposes of this chapter only the terms employer and employee will be referred to; however, FBT extends to
      include private use by an associate of the employee such as their spouse and also if there is an agreement between the
      employer and the provider of the car to provide the car to the employee (or associate).
   529

  by the employer (or associate of the employer) and made available for private use
  of the employee. The concessional treatment of car use by employees produced an
  unintended negative effect on the environment by encouraging vehicle uptake and use.
  This derives from the calculation of the taxable value of car fringe benefits, which
  reduces the overall tax liability and cost of providing a car to an employee and for the
  employee to use the car. There are two valuation methods available: the FBTAA s 9
  statutory formula and the s 10 cost basis. Prior to its amendment in 2011, under the
  statutory formula method, the calculated value of a fringe benefit from a provided car
  decreased as the distance travelled by the vehicle increased. This distorted employees'
  behaviour by encouraging them to drive further than they would otherwise in order to
  access the increased tax concession.5 An amendment in 2011 removed this incentive
  by introducing a single statutory rate of 20%, regardless of distance travelled.

  More recent amendments to the FBTAA in 2022 are designed to incentivise the uptake
  of electric vehicles by making them more affordable. The Treasury Laws Amendment
  (Electric Car Discount) Act 2022 (Cth) inserted a new exempt category of car benefits
  into the FBTAA for cars that are zero- or low-emissions vehicles (see s 8A). A car that
  meets the definition of a zero- or low-emissions vehicle and is provided for the private
  use of the employee by the employer is an exempt benefit, thereby attracting no fringe
  benefits tax. The exemption extends to registration, insurance and maintenance costs
  but does not extend to purchase and installation of home charging equipment. This
  measure was explicitly referred to by the Treasurer at the time of introduction as a:

              signal to this Parliament , to Australian industry and to the Australian people
              and beyond, that Australia now has a government which understands the
              economics of cleaner and cheaper and more reliable energy, and recognises
              the generational imperative that we have to act on climate change.6

  This has had a stimulatory effect on the purchase of new electric vehicles. The rate

  had been flat at less than 1% from 2011 through to 2020 but has jumped to 8.5% of all
  light motor vehicle sales in 20237 (see also Figure 2).

  The Treasury Laws Amendment (Electric Car Discount) Act 2022 (Cth) also included a
  sunset clause in schedule 2 that terminated the exemption for any PHEVs provided by
  an employer to an employee as a benefit after 1 April 2025. It will not affect any PHEV
  already concessionally treated, only new car fringe benefit arrangements after this
  date. The intended effect of this is to further drive down emissions by removing FBT
  incentives on PHEVs, which use some fossil fuels, while retaining the concessions for
  BEVs.

                                                KEY QUESTION
                    Different concessional FBT treatment for preferred engine or fuel

                      types is one approach to reducing GHG emissions from
                      transportation. Thinking about either FBT or the income tax
                      formula,8 what are some other ways to incentivise or discourage
                      behaviours that could help reduce GHG emissions from privately
                      owned vehicles such as cars?

 4.2 Luxury Car Tax

  The luxury car tax also has features that influence consumer behaviour, which has a
  flow-on effect on emissions. The luxury car tax applies an additional tax of 33% when
  a new passenger car is first imported, acquired or sold in Australia to the value of
  the car above the legislated threshold.9 The current luxury tax threshold for ordinary
  passenger vehicles for the 2024-25 year is $80,567 whereas the threshold for fuel
  efficient vehicles is $91,387, thereby making a luxury electric vehicle comparatively

   less expensive. Another feature of the federal tax system that creates a concession for
   zero- or low-emissions vehicles is a nil customs duty rate for low-emissions vehicles
   with a customs value below the luxury car tax threshold (compared to a 5% duty that
   otherwise would apply).

   The luxury car tax, paradoxically, also includes a feature that influences consumer
   behaviour in a way that results in increased emissions. The luxury car tax definition
   of a `car' excludes motor vehicles designed to carry a load of more than 2 tonnes
   or more than nine passengers,10 as well as commercial vehicles that are not designed
   for the principal purpose of carrying passengers11 (ie their principal purpose is to
   carry goods). Beyond this, there is no legislative definition of a commercial vehicle.
   The Australian Tax Office has set out a legally binding public ruling to provide a
   test to determine the principal purpose.12 Included in the ruling is an appendix that
   `sets out a compliance approach which outlines how the Commissioner [of tax] will
   allocate compliance resources with respect to this issue'.13 This is an example of the
   tax principle of efficiency applying to the administration of a tax. The test of whether
   a vehicle has a commercial purpose and is therefore exempt from the luxury car tax is
   broadly `whether it can carry twice the weight in payload that it can carry in people'.14
   When this test is applied to utility vehicles or `utes', imported or sold in Australia,
   they are most often exempt from the luxury car tax, including dual-cab utes capable
   of carrying five people. The Commissioner will not allocate compliance resources to
   determine if the vehicle ought to be subject to the tax.15 Utes are thereby comparatively
   cheaper to purchase than other vehicles that also exceed the luxury car tax threshold.
   This pricing disparity incentivises people to choose expensive and larger utes over
   smaller, more fuel-efficient or electric cars, as the latter vehicles are subject to the

   luxury car tax, albeit at a higher threshold.16 Since the introduction of the luxury car
   tax in 2000, the number of passenger vehicles has grown by half, while the number
   of light commercial vehicles, including utes, has doubled.17 As this `strong demand
   for medium/large dual-cab utes [has been for] ... large-displacement diesel and petrol
   combustion engines',18 this tax exemption plays a contributing factor to the continued
   upward trajectory of transport emissions as discussed earlier. An evaluation of the
   luxury car tax (in this instance the tax concession for commercial vehicles) based on
   our extra principle of what makes a good tax -- climate impact -- would undoubtedly
   judge this to fail that principle.

5. Conclusion

This chapter has shown that the tax system can be an important component of climate
policy, but the system has thus far been underutilised by the Australian government,
with the exception of encouraging the uptake of low-emissions vehicles. The treatment
of SMCs and ACCUs as tradeable intangible assets, generating assessable income and
deductible losses within the income tax system, normalises climate change mitigation
as part of ordinary business activity. However, there is an opportunity to use the tax
system to more broadly internalise the cost of GHG emissions, through reform of the
fuel tax system or even a broad-based carbon tax applicable to activities outside the
scope of the Safeguard Mechanism.
For professionals, incorporating a new climate conscious principle of good tax policy
-- climate impact -- into consideration can guide advice that aligns with efforts
to reduce carbon. For instance, recommending salary packaging of electric vehicles
to leverage FBT concessions is an effective way to help clients minimise their
environmental impact while benefiting from tax incentives.

Over the past two decades there has been a growing awareness of the close intersection
between climate change and human rights. However, the relationship between these
two issues is not straightforward. In this chapter we explore some of the opportunities,
as well as the tensions and trade-offs, that arise from framing climate change as a
human rights issue. After this overview, we explore the normative development of
human rights in the context of climate change through the United Nations (`UN')
human rights system and how the right to a healthy environment is emerging as an
important right in relation to climate change. Next, we consider the way that climate
litigation has been mobilised to advance human rights claims globally and in Australia.
We then consider some of the challenges and limitations in understanding climate

change as a human rights issue and how human rights frameworks might need to
change and adapt in response to these challenges.

                  How does the climate crisis give rise to human rights concerns?

                    What rights, of what subjects, and what obligations, imposed on
                    what actors, does it engage?
                  What have been the limitations of the human rights response in
                    the face of the climate crisis?
                  What might a human rights response that is adequate to the
                    scale and scope of the climate crisis look like?

 1. Climate Change and Human Rights

  At the 1972 UN Conference on the Human Environment, it was acknowledged that
  humanity `has the fundamental right to freedom, equality and adequate conditions of
  life, in an environment of a quality that permits a life of dignity and well-being'.1 Since
  then, there has been a `greening' of human rights: a growing acceptance of the fact
  that a healthy environment is a necessary enabling condition for the full enjoyment of
  human rights, that environmental degradation interferes with human rights, and that
  measures to protect the environment must be rights compliant. In a historic resolution
  in July 2022, the United Nations General Assembly (`UNGA') recognised `the right to
  a clean, healthy and sustainable environment as a human right'.2

  The protection of internationally recognised human rights is threatened in the context
  of climate change, including rights to life, culture, health, food, and an adequate
  standard of living for individuals and communities across the world, among other
  rights. As the UN Special Rapporteur on human rights and the environment has
  observed: `climate change is having a major impact on a wide range of human
  rights today and could have a cataclysmic impact in the future unless ambitious
  actions are undertaken immediately'.3 The human rights impacts of climate change
  are unequally distributed, with those that have contributed least to the greenhouse
  gas emissions that cause climate change often hit first and worst by its adverse
  impacts.4 In particular, climate change threatens the human rights of those living
  in poverty or those individuals and communities who experience vulnerability due
  to `marginalization [and] historical and ongoing patterns of inequity such as

  colonialism'.5 There are many warnings from human rights experts that `climate
  change will exacerbate existing poverty and inequality' and could lead to `climate
  apartheid' where `the wealthy pay to escape overheating, hunger and conflict, while
  the rest of the world is left to suffer'.6

  There is a risk that certain measures to respond to climate change may affect the
  protection of human rights. For example, large-scale renewable energy projects, while
  important to achieve emissions reductions, might challenge or be inconsistent with
  the rights of local communities if these rights are not respected and free prior and
  informed consent (`FPIC') is not sought.7 Similarly, measures to mitigate climate
  change by protecting forests -- whether to reduce greenhouse gas emissions involved
  with deforestation and forest degradation or to preserve the role of forests in
  sequestering carbon dioxide -- can interfere with the rights of forest communities
  and Indigenous peoples living in these forest areas.8 Another example is measures to
  adapt to climate change by relocating people from areas vulnerable to rising sea levels,
  which interfere with rights to self-determination, culture and freedom of movement
  if not implemented with proper human rights safeguards, procedural protections and
  consultation processes. A further tension between protecting the climate system and
  protecting human rights may arise when realising certain rights, especially some
  socio-economic rights, involves increasing greenhouse gas emissions. For example,
  constructing new housing to realise the right to housing of the 1.6 billion people
  globally who are homeless or lack adequate housing will generate significant
  emissions.9 Addressing climate change, therefore, involves a complex balancing of

   different rights and consideration of how to allocate financial and technical resources
   accordingly.

   There is an emerging international consensus that actions to address climate change
   should be compliant with, and should promote the protection of, human rights.
   Notably, the preamble to the 2015 Paris Agreement affirmed that states

               should, when taking action to address climate change, respect, promote and
               consider their respective obligations on human rights, the right to health,
               the rights of indigenous peoples, local communities, migrants, children,
               persons with disabilities and people in vulnerable situations and the right
               to development, as well as gender equality, empowerment of women and
               intergenerational equity.10

   Human rights provide a powerful moral language for describing harms that have been
   experienced, especially by vulnerable and marginalised groups, and for advancing
   claims. Human rights also provide a framework to articulate the obligations imposed
   on various actors, including the obligations of states (and private actors) to respect,
   protect and fulfil human rights. Under this standard, states must respect human
   rights and avoid policies and actions that would breach them; they also must protect
   human rights by ensuring that private actors, such as corporations and financial
   institutions, are not able to infringe the rights of others; and they must fulfil human
   rights by taking positive steps towards their full realisation. A human rights framework
   may also provide forums in which to complain about violations of human rights
   and mechanisms through which to seek redress. Indeed, individuals are increasingly
   initiating proceedings before courts and other complaints bodies claiming their human
   rights have been violated as a result of climate change. In the process, existing
   human rights have begun to be interpreted to take account of the way harms to the
   environment impact human rights, and the rights to a healthy environment and a safe
   climate have emerged for international recognition.

   The application of these rights to Australia occurs via our participation in international
   human rights treaties and other UN mechanisms. They are also considered through

                  The concept of climate justice is related to but arguably broader

                    than human rights and has distributive, recognitional, procedural
                    and reparative dimensions. In what ways can human rights
                    provide the language or framework to support climate justice?
                  Can you think of some other examples of potential tensions
                    between human rights and climate objectives? How could these
                    tensions be addressed or minimised?
   543

 2. Developments in Human Rights Law in Response
 to Climate Change

 2.1 Climate Change and International Human Rights

  While the links between human rights and climate change are increasingly clear, a
  full articulation of states' (and other actors') obligations in this regard is still in the
  early stages of development at the international level. This section draws out some
  of the emerging guidance from human rights bodies that is contributing towards the
  development of a framework of norms in this area. This guidance is drawn from
  reports of the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and other
  parts of the UN system, as well as from human rights treaty bodies and UN Special
  Procedures mandate holders. Notably, the UN appointed a Special Rapporteur on the
  promotion and protection of human rights in the context of climate change in 2021.1
  This section highlights some of the key insights of these bodies in relation to the major
  categories of rights: civil and political rights; social, economic and cultural rights;
  and procedural rights. It then mentions some of the vulnerable groups specifically
  impacted by climate change that require tailored human rights responses. Finally, it
  considers how the human rights framework can contribute to ensuring that non-state
  actors that are contributing so harmfully to climate change, such as big polluters, are
  held to account, including extraterritorially.

  Before exploring these issues, we should note the problem of jurisdictional reach
  and human rights. Climate change challenges the idea that human rights only create
  obligations on states towards those in their own countries, as emissions in one country
  impact the entire globe. Similarly, many of the major carbon-emitting companies
  are transnational, requiring a human rights framework that can operate beyond state
  boundaries and state actors (i.e. `extraterritorially'). There are valid concerns
  regarding the capacity of the human rights system to tackle extraterritorial and global
  issues that require imposing obligations on the international community as a whole.

      Context of Climate Change, A/HRC/RES/48/14 (13 October 2021).
                                                                   543
                                                                                                                                                                544

  However, as will be discussed in relation to business and human rights, solutions are
  emerging. Similarly, in relation to state obligations to those beyond their borders, the
  UN Committee on the Rights of the Child (`CRC') in the Sacchi et al v Argentina et al
  communication found that states are responsible for harms that affect children in other
  countries if caused by their actions.2

  2.1.1 Civil and Political Rights

  The civil and political rights set out in the International Covenant on Civil and
  Political Rights (`ICCPR') do not explicitly mention environmental matters but are
  affected by climate change. Human rights bodies have pointed to state obligations
  to address those civil and political rights impacted by climate change, such as the
  right to life, to vote, and to free expression, assembly and association, which are
  important in relation to environmental and climate protest.3 In 2018, the Human Rights
  Committee's General Comment on the Right to Life identified that `[e]nvironmental
  degradation, climate change and unsustainable development constitute some of the
  most pressing and serious threats to the ability of present and future generations to
  enjoy the right to life'.4 It noted states' obligations to respect and ensure the right to
  life through measures to protect the environment.5 The same Committee articulated the
  climate dimensions of rights to family and culture in its communication in the case
  of Daniel Billy et al v Australia (`Daniel Billy') (discussed in more detail in section
  2.3.1).6

   2.1.2 Social, Economic and Cultural Rights

   Social and economic rights, such as the right to social security, an adequate standard of
   living, health, education and worker rights protected under the International Covenant
   on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (`ICESCR'), are also affected by climate
   change. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (`IPCC') 2023 Synthesis
   Report noted that climate change has already adversely affected the physical and
   mental health of people globally.7 Increased heat and high energy costs mean that
   disadvantaged people living in inadequate housing are proving unable to protect
   themselves in heatwaves. Health and housing are thus connected as heatwaves are a
   major killer,8 outpacing other disasters such as floods and bushfires. Rights to health
   and housing place obligations on states to provide adequate accommodation and to
   adapt health systems to meet the challenges of a changing climate. Similarly, workers
   engaged in outdoor work require greater protections in changing climate conditions.
   The UN Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, in a 2019 report
   on climate change and poverty, noted that climate change will have the most severe
   impact in poor countries and on people living in poverty.9 Rights to food, water and
   social security are also key to addressing the impacts of climate change.

   2.1.3 Procedural

   State obligations include procedural rights related to equal access to justice and to
   effective remedies.10 Treaty bodies have noted that this includes `mandating human
   rights due diligence and ensuring access to education, awareness-raising and
   environmental information, and public participation in decision-making' and
   protecting the rights of environmental defenders.11 The UN Special Rapporteur on the

   promotion and protection of human rights in the context of climate change pointed to
   a `participation disconnect' between those most vulnerable to the impacts of climate
   change and their lack of ability to participate in international and national forums on
   climate change.12 He advanced a range of recommendations for improved participation
   in the conferences of the parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on
   Climate Change (`UNFCCC') and to the Paris Agreement and at national level through
   mechanisms such as youth representation in parliament already trialled in Scotland.13
   In relation to protection of climate rights defenders, the Special Rapporteur
   recommended that `the International Law Commission be mandated to develop, within
   a two-year time frame, an international legal procedure to give full and effective
   protection to environmental and indigenous human rights defenders'.14

                                                      ACTIVITY

           List five examples where rights in the ICCPR and ICESCR are impacted by
           climate change. Then list the obligations on states that these might
           generate.

   2.1.4 Especially Vulnerable Groups
   The human rights of particularly vulnerable groups -- including Indigenous peoples,
   women, children, people with disabilities and displaced people -- are specially
   affected by climate change. People or communities who already experience
   vulnerabilities and marginalisation due to geography, poverty, age, gender/sexuality,
   sex, disability, migration status, religion, race or cultural or ethnic background will

   be more vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and are likely to be affected
   more severely. Thus, human rights frameworks need to be especially attentive to the
   different ways in which vulnerable and marginalised individuals and communities
   are and will be impacted by climate change. Specific human rights instruments and
   bodies already exist to protect the rights of certain groups of people, including women,
   children, people with disabilities, Indigenous Peoples, migrants, refugees, workers and
   others. Some of these bodies provide detailed guidance on the implications of climate
   change on the human rights of specific groups and the obligations that follow from
   these. Two of these -- women and children -- are highlighted below, but guidance in
   relation to states' obligations as they concern other groups are emerging from human
   rights bodies. You are encouraged to explore this guidance further.

   2.1.5 Women
   The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (`CEDAW
   Committee') produced a General Recommendation (`GR') on the specific issue of
   disaster risk reduction in the context of climate change in 2018.15 The GR highlights
   the vulnerability of women and girls in disasters and the measures that must be taken
   to address this inequality. This attention to non-discrimination, a central principle of
   human rights, is important across a range of groups that the human rights treaties
   cover, including people with disabilities, racialised groups and migrants. The CEDAW
   Committee demonstrates that these groups overlap and the intersecting disadvantages
   they experience must be addressed by states. For example, it notes the failure of
   shelters and disaster relief programs to always accommodate the accessibility needs of
   women with disabilities, older women and Indigenous women.

                                                     QUESTION

           In the absence of a specific human rights treaty on the rights of older
           persons, how can this group draw on human rights to support their claims
           for state responses?

   2.1.6 Children
   The UN CRC produced a General Comment (`GC') on children's rights and the
   environment with a special focus on climate change in 2023, which provides valuable
   guidance.16 In addition to the important substance of the GC, its preparation modelled
   participatory process with child stakeholders. The GC focuses on mitigation,
   adaptation, and loss and damage and how states must develop laws and policies in
   these areas to advance the rights of children. It also sets out states' obligations in
   relation to the business sector, including transnational companies, and the importance
   of child-rights focused climate finance at domestic and international levels that ensures
   effective global cooperation to assist all children. It also gives attention to adaptation
   measures that must ensure that children are not left out of climate adaptation planning
   and disaster risk reduction. A key issue emerging increasingly in relation to climate
   change is the idea of intergenerational equity and the rights of future generations to a
   habitable planet.

                        think of ways that cultural rights should be protected and
                        promoted in the context of climate change?

   2.1.7 Obligations of Private Actors
   While international human rights are generally concerned with states' obligations
   under treaties to which they are parties, there is an increasing recognition of the need
   to provide guidance to transnational and national private actors, such as businesses,
   on their obligations to respect human rights. Corporate actors bear considerable
   responsibility for the climate crisis. Just 90 producers of fossil fuels and cement -- the
   so-called carbon majors -- are responsible for 63 per cent of cumulative worldwide
   emissions from 1751 to 2010.17 The 2011 Guiding Principles on Business and Human
   Rights (`UNGP') set out the corporate responsibility to respect human rights in Pillar
   II.18 This requires businesses to avoid causing or contributing to adverse human
   rights impacts through their own activities and seek to prevent or mitigate adverse
   human rights impacts that are directly linked to their operations, products or services
   through business relationships. The principle of `systemic integration' requires that
   Pillar II of the UNGP be interpreted in light of relevant rules of international law,
   including environmental and climate law. The corporate responsibility to respect
   human rights requires business to avoid causing or contributing to climate-related
   human rights impacts and to seek to prevent those impacts they are linked to through
   business relationships.19 This requires companies to engage in `climate due diligence',
   which entails, but is arguably not limited to, doing a risk assessment, setting concrete

   2.1.8 Further Development of the Framework of Human Rights Norms on
   Climate Change

   International treaty bodies, alongside other UN groups, have provided valuable
   guidance on the implications of climate change for human rights. Important work has
   begun to spell out the obligations that arise from rights affected by climate change,
   including by taking mitigation and adaptation measures to address climate change and
   its impacts. This work both draws on and influences similar work by regional human
   rights bodies, national bodies and courts, civil society and scholars. Further detailed
   work is still needed to guide states on their many obligations to avoid and address
   climate harms, including in relation to the rights of specific groups. This guidance
   needs to be somewhat flexible as the changes that climate brings to our world alter
   the challenges our planet faces and require innovative rights-informed responses --
   human rights itself will need to be adaptive.

   There are a number of important ongoing developments, including the request for
   advisory opinions from the Inter-American Court of Human Rights (`IACtHR') and
   the International Court of Justice (`ICJ'). The IACtHR has been asked to clarify
   the scope of state obligations to respond to the climate emergency, with particular
   attention to the differentiated impacts of the climate emergency.21 The ICJ has been
   asked to render an opinion on the obligations of states to ensure protection of the
   climatic system and the legal consequences for acts or omissions that have caused
   significant harm to particularly vulnerable states and present and future generations
   affected by the adverse effects of climate change.22 The court is asked to have
   particular regard to a number of human rights instruments including the ICCPR,

   ICESCR and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (`UDHR') and thus the
   opinion is likely to provide important clarification of international human rights
   obligations in the context of climate change.

  2.2 The Right to a Healthy Environment

   As already mentioned, the relationship between human rights and the environment
   at the international level was recognised in a resolution in July 2022 by the UNGA
   on `the right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment as a human right'.23
   The UNGA resolution followed a similar resolution the previous year by the United
   Nations Human Rights Council (`UNHRC') recognising that the right to a healthy
   environment `is important for the enjoyment of human rights'.24

   relating to the enjoyment of a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment has
   produced framework principles on human rights and the environment that provide
   detailed guidance on this connection.25 The right to a healthy environment contains
   both substantive and procedural obligations. Substantive obligations might, for
   example, impose a duty on the government to protect, preserve and improve the
   environment for the benefit of the community (in a similar way to that claimed by the
   applicants in Sharma v Minister for the Environment, as discussed below and in the
   chapter on Climate Change and Tort Law), while procedural obligations have been
   summarised as `access to information, public participation, and access to justice and
   effective remedies'.26

   domestic legislation.27 Australia was one of the 161 states that voted in favour of
   the UNGA resolution, but there has been limited legislative or other action taken to
   implement and realise this right at the domestic level.28 A key exception to this is the
   Australian Capital Territory, which recognised the right to a healthy environment in
   August 2024 under the Human Rights (Healthy Environment) Amendment Act 2024
   (`Amendment Act') by inserting a new s 27C into the Human Rights Act 2004 (ACT).

   When s 27C comes into effect (by ministerial notice or 17 March 2025 at the latest)29
   public authorities will have to consider the new right to a healthy environment prior
   to making any decisions, in line with their obligations to act consistently with human
   rights.30 If a member of the public believes that a public authority has acted in
   contravention of s 27C, they can also bring a human rights complaint to the Australian
   Capital Territory Human Rights Commission for conciliation.31 However, the
   Amendment Act also inserts a new ss 40C(5A) into the Human Rights Act 2004 which
   precludes the judicial enforcement of the new right to a healthy environment under the
   Human Rights Act.32

   As effective enforcement of environmental rights is a core element of the
   internationally recognised right to a healthy environment, the absence of a strong
   enforcement mechanism appears to undermine the value of introducing this right.
   This approach also appears to create a hierarchy between the rights that are currently
   given full protection under the Human Rights Act, on the one hand, and the right to
   a healthy environment, on the other, contrary to the principle that all rights are equal,
   interdependent and indivisible.33 Public controversy around the exclusion of litigation

                        broadly? If so, how should the right to a healthy environment be
                        enshrined in Australian law?
                      How would enshrining the right to a healthy environment in
                        Australian law help promote climate mitigation and adaptation?

  2.3 Rights-based Climate Litigation

   Following the adoption of the 2015 Paris Agreement, there has been a `rights turn'
   in climate litigation.36 There are a growing number of cases raising rights-based
   arguments before international, regional and national courts. There are now over 121
   decided or pending cases that utilised human rights arguments to advance climate
   mitigation or adaptation.37

   At the international level, the UN Human Rights Committee has provided a
   communication on Australia's obligations under the ICCPR in relation to climate
   change (see the case summary box: Billy et al v Australia), and the International
   Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) has provided an advisory opinion on state

       A Healthy Environment) Amendment Bill 2023 -- Government Response (May 2024) 1-2. The original bill already

   parties' obligations under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea.38 The unanimous
   opinion handed down by ITLOS in response to a request from small island states,
   recognises the human rights impacts of climate change,39 requires states to address
   marine pollution caused by emissions at a `stringent' standard of due diligence.40 As
   previously discussed, the ICJ is also due to consider the obligations of states in respect
   of climate change, which will include consideration of human rights issues.41

   Regional courts are also being approached to decide human rights obligations in
   relation to climate change, with a pending decision in the IACtHR42 and a recent
   decision from the European Court of Human Rights.43 In this latter case, a group
   of women pensioners whose health is being harmed by increasing heat brought a
   case against Switzerland.44 The court found that Switzerland's failure to adequately
   regulate emissions reductions or meet its climate targets violated the rights of people
   to protection of their lives, health, wellbeing and quality of life.

   There have been an increasing number of domestic climate change cases that have
   been decided in recent years (a great place to find these is the Sabin Center Climate
   Litigation Databases). Arguably the best-known case is Urgenda Foundation v State
   of the Netherlands, which was handed down in 2015 and played a significant role in
   shaping human rights-based climate litigation elsewhere. In that case, the Supreme
   Court of the Netherlands confirmed that the Dutch government had an obligation
   under articles 2 and 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which protects
   the right to life and private life, family life, home and correspondence from the threat
   of climate change and required the government to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by
   at least 25 per cent by 2020.

   The year 2024 was busy, with many new domestic climate change cases being
   litigated. On 21 March 2024, applicants in India were successful in their constitutional
   claims, with the Supreme Court delivering a historic judgment in MK Ranjitsinh and
   Others v Union of India and Others. The three-judge bench, led by Chief Justice DY
   Chandrachud, formulated a new constitutional right to be free from the adverse effects
   of climate change, derived from articles 21 (right to life) and 14 (right to equality) of
   the Indian Constitution.

   These cases have primarily focused on the human rights obligations of governments;
   however, some cases have also sought to clarify and enforce the human rights
   obligations of business and other private actors in relation to climate change. There
   is also growing focus on the human rights obligations of private business in climate
   litigation. The 2021 ruling of the Hague District Court in the Netherlands in
   Milieudefensie v Dutch Royal Shell required oil company Shell to reduce its net
   greenhouse gas emissions across their operations by 45 per cent by 2030 from 2019
   levels. While the decision was based on a duty of care, codified in the Dutch Civil
   Code, the court also referred to the UNGP, which it described as `suitable as a
   guideline in the interpretation of the unwritten standard of care'. In 2024, the Court of
   Appeal affirmed that Shell had a legal duty of care to take action on climate change
   but refused to impose a specific emission reduction target (currently under appeal).

   In 2022, the Commission on Human Rights of the Philippines found that major fossil
   fuel companies could be held liable for climate-related human rights impacts. In its
   report, National Inquiry on Climate Change, the Commission identified -- drawing on
   Pillar II of the UNGP -- that businesses enterprises `may be compelled to undertake
   human rights due diligence and held accountable for failure to remediate human
   rights abuses arising from their business operations'.45 It also recommended that
   `carbon majors' desist from activities that undermine climate science; cease further
   exploration of new oil fields, keep fossil fuels in the ground and transition to clean
   energy; contribute to the Green Climate Fund for the implementation of mitigation
   and adaptation measures; and continually engage with experts, civil society and other
   stakeholders to assess and continually improve the corporate response.46

   Australia has signed and ratified numerous international human rights treaties, and
   this allows Australian citizens and residents to utilise the complaints processes under
   these treaties to raise arguments about the human rights impacts of climate change.
   For example the Optional Protocol to the ICCPR allows individuals who claim that
   their rights under the ICCPR have been violated to bring a communication to the
   Human Rights Committee, if they have first exhausted all possible domestic avenues
   for redress.47

                                   CASE SUMMARY: BILLY ET AL V AUSTRALIA

      On 13 May 2019, eight adults and six children -- all Indigenous Peoples from the
      Torres Strait Islands -- brought forward a communication to the UN Human
      Rights Committee on the grounds that the Australian government had violated its
      human rights by failing to take adequate action to mitigate greenhouse gases and
      pursue adequate adaptation measures.48 The applicants outlined a litany of
      adverse impacts they had already experienced in the context of climate change,
      including flooding and inundation of low-lying communities, the erosion of
      traditional lands, loss of critical vegetation, and the reduced ability to practice their
      traditional culture and pass it on to future generations. The applicants also
      emphasised that the future impacts of climate change are projected to increase in
      severity, giving rise to the risk of some low-lying islands in the Torres Strait
      becoming uninhabitable.
      The petitioners alleged that Australia was violating their human rights by failing to:

                 take adequate adaptation measures -- namely, `take adequate
                   measures to provide infrastructure to protect their lives and way of life,

47. Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, GA Res 2200A (XXI), art 2 (16 December
       1966).

       Concerning Communication No. 3624/2019 (Daniel Billy et al v Australia)' (2022) CCPR/C/135/D/3624/2019
       (`Daniel Billy').

                   their homes and their culture against the threats posed by climate
                   change, especially sea level rise'; and
                 take adequate mitigation measures -- namely, `take adequate
                   measures to reduce Australia's national greenhouse gas emissions
                   which contribute to climate change'.

      Specifically, they alleged that a number of their rights protected by the covenant
      were violated, including:

                 Article 2: obligation of the state party to adopt laws or other measures to
                   give effect to the rights in the Covenant;

                 Article 6: right to life;
                 Article 17: protection from `arbitrary or unlawful interference with his

                   privacy, family, home or correspondence';
                 Article 27: right to culture; and
                 Article 24(1): rights of the child.

      The decision by the Human Rights Committee, released in September 2022, was
      significant for its development of the Committee's consideration of the human
      rights impacts of climate change.49 The Committee found that the Australian
      Government had violated the rights of the applicants protected in Article 17 and
      Article 27 of the ICCPR by failing to take adequate climate action adaptation
      measures. It did not, however, consider the Australian Government's human
      rights commitments in the context of mitigation measures.
      In considering Article 17, the committee found that the complainants may need to
      abandon their homes, and that the home of one was already flooded in 2010. It
      also found that the complainants and other members of their community
      depended on the health of the surrounding ecosystems for their own wellbeing, as
      they relied on local fish, marine resources, land crops and trees for subsistence
      and livelihoods. In considering Article 27, the Committee concluded this right
      seeks to protect and ensure the survival and continued development of the
      distinct cultural identity of minority and Indigenous groups. The Committee noted
      that the Torres Strait Islanders' distinct cultural practices were place-specific and
      deeply connected to the local land and sea environment. Thus, it concluded that

       Zealand CCPR/C/127/D/2728/2016 (7 January 2020), although the applicant was unsuccessful in his claims.
     559

      climate impacts on the island and surrounding seas had already impaired their
      ability to maintain their culture.
      It should also be noted that the committee found there was not yet a violation of
      the right to life under Article 6. It accepted the statement by the petitioners that
      `that their islands will become uninhabitable in 10 years (Boigu and Masig) or
      10-15 years (Poruma and Warraber) in the absence of urgent action' and that
      `without robust national and international efforts, the effects of climate change
      may expose individuals to a violation of their rights under article 6 of the
      Covenant'.50 However, it suggested that those 10 to 15 years allow time for
      `intervening acts' to protect those rights, including the potential relocation of
      Torres Strait Islander Peoples. A number of Committee members in dissenting
      individual opinions found there was a violation of the right to life.51 Some
      committee members highlighted that `the State party has a positive obligation to
      minimise "reasonably foreseeable threats to life"' and that `despite multiple
      requests and knowledge of the ongoing impacts on the lives of the authors, the
      State party did not undertake adaptation measures in a timely manner'. On this
      basis they found that Australia violated the petitioners right to life.52
      The Committee held that the Australian Government was under an obligation to
      provide the applicants with an `effective remedy'. On what constitutes an `effective
      remedy', the Committee stated that the Australian Government is required to
      make full reparation to individuals whose rights have been violated, including (1)
      compensation for the Indigenous Peoples from Boigu, Poruma, Warraber and
      Masig Islands for the harm they have suffered; (2) engaging in meaningful
      consultations to assess their needs; (3) taking measures to secure their
      communities' safe existence into the future; and (4) monitoring and reviewing the
      effectiveness of the measures implemented, and resolving any deficiencies as
      soon as practicable.

                                                 KEY QUESTIONS

                      In your assessment, do the facts presented by the applicants
                        demonstrate that there was a violation of the right to life? How
                        should human rights bodies take into account uncertainties about
                        future risks as well as uncertainties about future action by state
                        parties?

                      Why do you think the Committee focused on Australia's failure to
                        take appropriate adaptation measures, rather than Australia's
                        failure to take appropriate mitigation measures?

                      Do you think the Human Rights Committee communication
                        process was a powerful tool to protect the applicants' human
                        rights? Why/why not?

   2.3.2 Australia: Domestic Human Rights Litigation Related to Climate Change
   There has been limited scope for right-based climate litigation in Australia, as
   Australia lacks a national bill of rights.53 Only three Australian jurisdictions --
   Victoria, Queensland and the Australian Capital Territory -- have human rights
   legislation. The legislation in Victoria and Queensland does not give rise to an
   independent cause of action. It allows plaintiffs to raise issues of human rights when
   bringing a separate cause of action -- that is, to `piggy-back' a human rights argument
   onto an existing claim.54 In contrast, it is possible to take a direct action under the
   Human Rights Act 2004 (ACT). However, there are a number of procedural issues that
   might deter such climate change litigation, including costs.55

   arguments, nonetheless has important human rights implications.56 For example,
   Sharma v the Minister for the Environment was a novel attempt by eight children (and
   their litigation representative) to use private law to protect their human rights from the
   worsening effects of climate change by seeking an injunction to restrain the Minister
   for the Environment from granting approval to the Vickery coalmine extension.57 The
   applicants had claimed the Minister owed them and other Australian children a duty
   of care to exercise her power under the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity
   Conservation Act 1999 with reasonable care so as not to cause them harm resulting
   from climate change, and that any approval (of the mine extension) would amount to a
   breach of this duty (see the chapter on Climate Change and Tort Law). In the next case
   summary box we provide a brief overview of a recent significant rights-based climate
   case in Australia -- Waratah Coal v Youth Verdict.58

                            CASE SUMMARY: WARATAH COAL V YOUTH VERDICT

      In the 2022 decision of the Queensland Land and Environment Court case of
      Waratah Coal v Youth Verdict (`Waratah Coal'),59 Kingham P found that the grant
      of a mining lease (in the Galilee Basin) would be incompatible with the Human
      Rights Act 2019 (QLD).60 The applicants' claims were based on a range of rights
      recognised under the Act, including the rights to life, the cultural rights of
      Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, the rights of children, the right to
      property, the rights to privacy and the home, and the right to non-discrimination.61

      As the consideration of any potential limitation on human rights is subject to a
      proportionality test under s 13 of the Human Rights Act 2019 (QLD), the judge's
      detailed consideration of climate science, as well as her decision to include
      `Scope 3 emissions',62 rejection of the developer's `perfect substitution' argument
      (under which they claimed that the contribution to climate change from the mined
      coal was irrelevant, because if that mine did not supply coal, then another
      would),63 and sceptical approach to the claimed likelihood of both offsets and
      economic and social benefits64 made a significant contribution to her Honour's
      finding that the human rights impacts were disproportionate.65 Taken together with
      the broader impacts of the mine on ecological values, climate change and
      intergenerational equity, her Honour recommended that the application be
      refused, creating a notable precedent not only within human rights law but also
      within environmental law.
      When considering the impact on the right to culture, her Honour quoted a number
      of illustrative passages from the evidence provided by the First Nations
      witnesses, both through affidavits and on-Country evidence. This included
      evidence from Florence Gutchen that `our land is our mother because ... we
      come from the land, from the ground'.66 This sense of connection was also
      articulated by Harold Ludwig, `a Guugu Yimiddhir man from the community of
      Hopevale north of Cooktown' who explained, `[t]he environment gave us
      everything: the spiritual strength, nourishment, the cause and the life'.67 Kingham
      P noted his description of this relationship `as reciprocal -- not just a right, but a
      responsibility'.68 Finally, Juritju Fourmile articulated the deep sense of
      entanglement that they, `as Indigenous people, First Nations people', understand
      themselves as having with future generations and the rest of the biosphere:69

      and the rainforest dies off? ... Those trees are connected to this land. We as
      people are connected to those trees. They die, we die. Think of it holistically, the
      bigger picture, you know?
      Julia Dehm argues that Waratah Coal was the first case in Australia to explicitly
      link climate change and human rights and is arguably one of the few cases
      globally where the links between expanding fossil fuel production, its impacts on
      climate change, and the resulting effects on human rights have been
      recognized.70
      This is significant domestically and internationally.

                                                 KEY QUESTIONS
                      Despite the growth in right-based climate litigation there arguably

                        still remains a `supply-side accountability gap'. Some human
                        rights treaty bodies and special procedure mandate holders have
                        offered views on the role of fossil fuel production. Arguably, this
                        is starting to coalesce into a clear normative position that
                        preventing new fossil fuel developments is necessary to protect,
                        respect and fulfil the realisation of all human rights.71 To what
                        extent do you think Waratah Coal is a useful precedent in
                        preventing fossil fuel expansions or new fossil fuel projects
                        elsewhere?
                      What other human rights avenues might exist to challenge fossil
                        fuel expansions or new fossil fuel projects?

 3. Critiques of Human Rights Law in Response to
 Climate Change

  Human rights are not without their critiques, several of which are particularly relevant
  to the intersection of climate change and rights. Here it is important to note that
  many critical theorists have acknowledged that human rights still have significant
  instrumental value, and that their critique is offered to support a strategic deployment
  of rights alongside greater awareness of their risks and limitations.1

 3.1 Preventing Structural Change

  The first critique is that human rights detract energy and momentum from movements
  seeking to secure transformative or structural change, and may also work to legitimise
  existing power arrangements.2 Essentially, it is argued here that the institutional
  recognition of rights has a history of deradicalising social movements by incorporating
  their claims into the liberal, capitalist status quo.3 There is growing recognition that
  climate change is a direct result of our current neoliberal political economic order, and
  that genuine climate action will require fundamentally changing this status quo.4 In this
  context, the claimed deradicalising tendencies of human rights merit critical attention.

  A related critique here is that human rights have historically been individualist and
  centred the state (as the key source of oppression and protection). This individualist
  and state-centric focus has a poor record of addressing the role of third parties, such as

  corporations, in breaching human rights, which may be problematic given the central
  role of corporations in driving climate change. The state's dual role as protector and
  oppressor also creates an inherent tension for enforcement.

 3.2 Eurocentrism

  Another critique of human rights is that it presents Western, or `Eurocentric', cultural
  practices as being universal. Indeed, the foundational texts of international human
  rights law, and particularly the UDHR, were drafted almost exclusively by white
  (mostly male) elites. It is further argued that when the UDHR was adopted by 48 of
  the 58 existing members of the UN, `[a]lmost two-thirds of world countries were still
  colonies and as a result without a voice'.5 By asserting Eurocentric cultural practices
  as universal, human rights have been used to erase other ways of knowing and to assert
  dominance and justify imperialism.

  The Eurocentric history of human rights is particularly relevant to climate change
  due to the increasing recognition that colonisation and imperialism are core to its
  root causes.6 Heather Davis and Zoe Todd, for example, argue that by `making the
  relations between the Anthropocene and colonialism explicit, we are then in a position
  to understand our current ecological crisis and to take the steps needed to move away
  from this ecocidal path'.7 In response to these critiques, scholars are increasingly
  calling for human rights to shed its Eurocentric foundations through a process of
  decolonisation to enable it to positively contribute to this project of moving towards
  a more sustainable future.8

  3.3 Anthropocentrism

   The final critique that we will consider is the argument that human rights are
   `anthropocentric' -- that is, they elevate the rights of humans above those of the
   rest of the environment. This limits the usefulness of human rights for addressing
   the significant effects of climate change on more than humans -- and also risks
   entrenching the dualist mode of thinking (the separation of humans from the rest of
   the environment) that has contributed to driving climate change itself. One response
   to this charge of anthropocentrism has been the growth of a global movement for the
   recognition of rights for the rest of nature. The rights of nature movement has recently
   been associated with a raft of legal changes in jurisdictions around the world, which
   have recognised rights for individual natural entities (often rivers) or all of nature,
   sometimes through or alongside the mechanism of legal personhood.9

   However, rights of nature have also been criticised for many of the same reasons
   considered above (deradicalisation and Eurocentrism). As with earlier critiques of
   rights, many of these critiques acknowledge that there is nothing inherent within rights
   that leads to these downsides. Instead, they emphasise the need to be aware of the
   potential risks and of unconsciously adopting (and entrenching) Western ideological
   traditions (or ontologies).10 One strategy that can assist with this mindful approach
   is to acknowledge the leadership of Indigenous peoples in many rights of nature
   developments and to recognise that humanity is both part of and deeply interdependent
   on the rest of the biosphere. Alongside the recognition of rights for nature, many of
   these legal developments have embedded transformative mechanisms for empowering
   Indigenous authority within environmental governance, and these mechanisms also
   offer a radical potential for moving beyond Eurocentrism.11

 4. Future Trajectories of Human Rights Law:
 Relational Rights and Reparations

  Human rights are not static; they continue to evolve, and this evolution has been
  informed by the above critiques of human rights, alongside increasing recognition of
  the impacts of climate change and other environmental harms on human rights. One
  recent development has been the growing movement for the provision of redress for
  loss and damage (`L&D') caused by climate change. This concept seeks to recognise
  the contribution of colonialism and extractive imperialism in driving climate change
  and the disproportionate impact this continues to have on the Global South. L&D
  litigation and the recent L&D Fund (see Section 4.1) are two mechanisms for
  providing redress and demanding some accountability from those in the Global North
  who continue to profit from extractive practices.

  Another development, which has gone hand in hand with the shift away from
  Eurocentrism discussed above, has been a greater appreciation of the centrality of
  relationships to people's wellbeing and rights -- leading to a stronger focus on
  communal rights and on rights that better respond to humanity's deep entanglement
  with the rest of the biosphere. These `relational rights' seek to protect communities
  and reciprocal obligations, rather than individuals and extractive rights.

 4.1 Redress for Loss and Damage

  The concept of L&D was officially recognised in 2013 at the 19th Conference of
  the Parties (`COP19') in Warsaw, but it was not until 2022, at COP27 in Sharm El
  Sheikh, Egypt, that countries agreed to establish an L&D Fund (and not until 2023, at
  COP28 in Dubai, that this fund was officially operationalised).1 Abhijeet Shrivastava
  and Renatus Otto Franz Derler argue that the delay in recognising the concept of
  L&D and in implementing the fund led many stakeholders to seek another avenue

  for redress and compensation via L&D litigation.2 Notable cases include Asmania et
  al v Holcim, in which Indonesian fishermen sued a multinational company for sea-
  level rise impacts in Swiss courts; Lliuya v RWE, in which a Peruvian farmer sued
  RWE, a German electrical company, over glacial flooding threats; and Sacchi et al v
  Argentina et al (2021), in which the UN CRC accepted the possibility of determining
  states' proportional responsibility for climate harm (while dismissing the case because
  the applicants had failed to exhaust domestic remedies). Daniel Billy has also been
  described as a L&D case (see the case summary in Section 2.3.1).3 Shrivastava and
  Derler argue that although L&D litigation risks reinforcing Western hegemony, it can
  provide access to remedies and operate to strengthen the position of delegates from the
  Global South in UNFCCC negotiations, potentially leading to stronger L&D financing
  commitments.

 4.2 Relational Rights

  In contrast to Eurocentric and anthropocentric conceptions of rights (which tend to
  be individualist, atomised and sometimes competitive) Indigenous ontologies4 tend
  to focus on the relationship between peoples and the natural world. According to
  Mary Graham, the custodial ethic of Aboriginal people is created through `combining
  and melding together' two principles: first, `the ethical principle of maintaining a
  respectful, nurturing relationship with Land, Place and community', and second,
  `the organising governance principle based on autonomy and identity of Place'.5
  In Aotearoa New Zealand, the Whanganui iwi explain a similar concept with the
  simple expression: `I am the River. The River is me.'6 Elizabeth Macpherson notes

  the emergence of a scholarship around environmental relationality, reflecting `ideas
  of (often kinship-based) relatedness, relationships and "belonging" between people
  and place'.7 She argues that this relational `approach can be contrasted with typical
  Western laws, where humans are perceived as separate to nature, and law's
  engagement with nature is fragmented across seemingly arbitrary jurisdictional
  scales.8

  Recent developments in human rights law are increasingly reflecting a deeper
  understanding of Indigenous peoples' relationships with the natural world, and the
  threat posed by climate change to these relationships. For example, in Daniel Billy (the
  Torres Strait Eight communication), discussed above, the Human Rights Committee
  noted that climate change-related weather patterns were `making it harder for the
  authors to pass on their traditional ecological knowledge'.9 In addition to noting the
  particular vulnerability of Indigenous peoples to the impacts of climate change, there
  is a growing recognition of the essential role of Indigenous knowledge in responding
  to climate change. Daniel Billy represents a turning point in human rights law by
  recognising and reflecting the significance of Indigenous expertise and relationships
  with Country in the articulation of the right to culture and the right to privacy, family
  and home. Nonetheless, this recognition is only the beginning of reimagining the
  scope, normative content and, indeed, foundational principles, of human rights more
  generally.

5. Conclusion

Climate change has significant implications for human rights, and this is increasingly
being recognised at international and domestic levels. As this chapter has explored,
human rights frameworks are increasingly being applied to climate change issues,
providing new avenues for advocacy, litigation and accountability. However, critiques
of human rights approaches highlight important limitations and risks that need to be
navigated. Human rights law will continue to evolve in response to the climate crisis,
with emerging concepts such as relational rights and redress for loss and damage
potentially reshaping how we conceptualise rights in the Anthropocene. As future legal
practitioners, it will be crucial for students to think critically about how human rights
can be most effectively applied (and developed) to address the significant threats that
climate change poses to human wellbeing and to humanity's relationships with the rest
of the biosphere. Continued engagement with diverse perspectives, law and expertise,
particularly from Indigenous peoples and communities on the front lines of the climate
crisis, will be essential to developing a transformative approach to pursuing climate
justice.

 1. The Central Role of Labour Law in the Climate
 Crisis

  The climate crisis will revolutionise the world of work. In Australia and globally,
  the impact of the crisis, in terms of climate disruptions and climate action, has been
  described as akin to `a new industrial revolution'.1 Amid the `rapid, far-reaching and
  unprecedented transitions in all aspects of society',2 labour law -- being the legal
  regulation of work -- is of critical importance.

  Labour law is central to the two main types of climate action: climate adaptation (the
  process of adjustment to actual or expected climate and its effects in order to moderate
  harm or exploit beneficial opportunities) and climate mitigation (human interventions
  to reduce emissions or enhance the sinking of greenhouse gases).3

  Climate change adaptation requires that labour law contribute to workforces equipped
  to create, maintain and repair the social and physical infrastructures necessary for the
  flourishing of human beings and other living species in present and future climates.
  This encompasses a wide range of industries4 and spans `blue', `white' and `pink'
  collar occupations, as well as work in informal and unpaid contexts.5

   Climate adaptation also requires that workers are protected by labour law from the
   health and safety threats created by and accelerated by climate change, including
   impacts associated with working in climate-changed conditions (such as extreme
   temperatures, flooding, cuts to electricity supply)6 and impacts from disruptions that
   flow from collapsing physical and social infrastructures (such as staff shortages,
   agitated clients, transport and supply chain breakdown and increased care demands).
   According to one study, 75% of Australian workers have already indicated physical
   health impacts associated with climate change, almost 10% have lost wages or had to
   take personal leave and 2% have lost jobs.7

   According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, climate change
   mitigation requires, as a pre-eminent priority, rapid, deep and in most cases immediate
   greenhouse gas emission reductions. This demands systems capable of rapidly and
   fairly phasing out employment in fossil fuel extractive industries, reducing emissions
   within every industry and workplace,8 and industries that are able to support the
   work required to establish and maintain renewable energy infrastructure at sufficient
   speed and scale.9 These processes are sometimes referred to through the term `just
   transition',10 although it is a term with a contested and flexible meaning that has been
   used in ways consistent with the perpetuation and expansion of fossil fuel industries.11

This chapter examines the role of Australian labour law in the climate crisis (what
it is currently and what it ought to be). It begins by situating this role within the
contradictions and contestations of labour law. Turning specifically to Australian
labour law, it then argues that Australian labour law is presently indifferent towards
climate action and at times, restrictively so. It draws out how: (1) Australian labour law
typically does not have environmental objectives; (2) It severely restricts the pursuit of
environmental objectives, especially in relation to collective bargaining and industrial
action; (3) It does not systematically provide for climate action; and (4) It is premised
upon continuous economic growth.

The critique is followed by mapping out four pathways towards a climate conscious
Australian labour law, one which can be a vehicle for effective climate action. We
argue for (1) the integration of environmental objectives into Australian labour law;
(2) foregrounding green bargaining; (3) invigorating democratic solidarity; and (4) the
exploration of post-growth (post-capitalist) futures.

                                        DISCUSSION QUESTION

                  What are the two main types of climate action to which labour law
                    is central?
                                                                                                                                                                582

 2. The Contradictory Logics of Labour Law in the
 Climate Crisis

  Australian labour law comprises three core areas: the contract of employment,
  minimum standards (legislative standards and awards) and collective bargaining
  (including industrial action). Adjunct are two areas of law: work, health and safety
  laws; and equality and anti-discrimination laws.

  In this section, we draw out the contradictory logics of labour law that structure
  Australian labour law's role in the climate crisis. We begin with the two fundamental
  principles that are often said to underpin labour law. The first is the protective purpose
  of labour law, which is usually attributed to labour law theorist Otto Kahn-Freund,
  who said that `(t)he main object of labour law has always been, and we venture to say
  always will be, to be a countervailing force to counteract the inequality of bargaining
  power which is inherent and must be inherent in the employment relationship'.1 The
  protective purpose of labour law is part of the second, and broader, principle that
  `labour is not a commodity'. Originally articulated in these terms in the 1880s,2 its
  centrality to labour law is such that it is the first of the four `fundamental principles'
  enshrined in the International Labour Organization (`ILO') 1944 Declaration of
  Philadelphia.

  The fundamental principles of labour law (the protective purpose, and labour is not a
  commodity) deeply implicate democratic commitments. In 1897, Sidney and Beatrice
  Webb characterised trade unions as a necessary element in a democratic state. Unions
  were, in and of themselves, democracies: organisations composed of wage-earners,
  organised on the principle of `government of the people, by the people, for the
  people'. By participating in unions, workers were participating in the machinery of
  government.3 In the 1920s, the German labour law theorist Hugo Sinzheimer argued

  that for democracy to be meaningful, citizens had to do more than simply vote in
  regular elections; they also had to be free from unfair treatment at work and be given
  the chance to have a meaningful say about the rules that governed their daily working
  lives. In this profound way, democracy at work and democracy in society were tied to
  each other.4

  These orientations are reflected in the fourth fundamental principle of the ILO 1944
  Declaration of Philadelphia, which states that:

              the war against want requires to be carried on with unrelenting vigour within
              each nation, and by continuous and concerted international effort in which
              the representatives of workers and employers, enjoying equal status with
              those of governments, join with them in free discussion and democratic
              decision with a view to the promotion of the common welfare.5

  Both the protective purpose and the principle that labour is not a commodity involve a
  logic of decommodification which seeks to address `the most unfortunate attributes' of
  labour as a fictitious commodity.6 Labour law has, however, always had `contrapuntal
  themes',7 with the logic of decommodification inevitably partial. For one, it does not
  seek to completely decommodify labour. As Dukes and Streeck have pointed out:

              [L]abour law must serve two purposes at once: social integration through
              legally enforced conformity with collectively held values of social justice,
              giving rise to a legitimate social order, and capital accumulation demanding
              a social order that must first be profitable before it can be just.8

   Labour law's logic of decommodification is, therefore, partial because it is
   contradictory, resulting in a series of recurring regulatory dilemmas centred upon four
   social processes associated with labour being a `fictive' commodity: the incorporation
   of labour into the labour market, the matching of labour by institutions, labour control
   and the reproduction of labour.9 How these dilemmas play out in particular contexts
   -- including the climate crisis -- is shaped by the substance of labour laws and also
   their constitutive (commodity) form and class struggle.10 Labour law -- including
   Australian labour law -- is invariably a `contested terrain'.11

   There is another deep sense in which labour law's logic of decommodification is
   partial -- it does not extend to nature. This logic combines critical economic and
   social considerations, but it fails to include an explicit environmental dimension.
   Drawing on Polanyi, Zbyszewska argues that the separation of labour and ecology
   in labour law can be traced to the rise of laissez-faire capitalism, which led to the
   commodification of labour and land -- and their separation -- with `modern labor
   law norms subsequently replicat[ing] and naturali[zing] this disconnection'.12

   A consequence of this disconnection is that nature is viewed outside the exchange
   relationship between labour and capital and, by implication, the bargaining process
   between organised labour and employers. In labour law policy and scholarship,
   priority is given to the exchange of remuneration for subordination (the so-called
   wage-work bargain) -- an exchange that holds no place for nature. Like neoclassical
   economics, the dominant approach in labour sees `nature' as external to labour market
   exchanges.13

   With labour partially decommodified and nature not at all, the hierarchical relationship

   between humanity and nature assumed by labour law fits hand-in-glove with
   Enlightenment ideas of the domination of nature.14 These are ideas deeply rooted in
   Western legal traditions. Unlike Indigenous legal ontologies, these traditions construct
   human beings as separate to, and in a hierarchical relationship with, the non-human
   world. This is informed by the Cartesian notion that human beings should strive to
   be the `master and possessor' of nature, where there is a natural conceptual division
   between `persons' and `things' in which the latter are a resource for the former.15

   Labour law is, in this regard, no exception. While some of its master concepts aim to
   soften and ameliorate the impact of capitalist systems on human beings, labour law
   remains committed, as an overall system, to securing capitalist production premised
   on the idea that it is acceptable to appropriate and control humanity and nature as a
   capitalist resource.16

   The `othering' of nature by labour law does not mean that environmental
   considerations necessarily fall outside the realm of labour law. It is a type of fetishism,
   by which we mean `masks, disguises and distortions of what is going on round us'.17
   This is because labour and nature are mutually constituting -- the labour process
   depends upon and is shaped by the environment as much as the environment is an
   object of labour. The othering of nature does not -- cannot -- abolish this deep
   relationship. What it does is characterise the relationship in a particular way (based
   on commodification and human domination of nature). The result is a fundamental
   contradiction where environmental considerations play out through labour law but in
   mystified ways.18

   We can depict labour law's contradictory logic of de/commodification through three
   interacting dyads.

  in the climate crisis?
   587

 3. How Australian Labour Law is Indifferent to Climate
 Action

  There are four ways in which Australian labour law is indifferent to climate action:

          1. It typically does not have environmental objectives.
          2. It severely restricts the pursuit of environmental objectives, especially in

              relation to collective bargaining and industrial action.
          3. It does not systematically provide for climate action.
          4. It is premised upon continuous economic growth.

 3.1 Australian Labour Law Typically Does Not Have
 Environmental Objectives

  We clearly see the `othering' of nature by Australian labour law in its objectives.
  With the exception of work, health and safety laws, Australian labour law does not
  have environmental objectives (including climate-related objectives). The 10 elements
  provided in the object of the Fair Work Act 2009 (Cth) address important social
  and economic objectives; however, none of the elements include or constitute
  environmental purposes.1 This absence carries through to the modern awards
  objective,2 the minimum wages objective3 and the objects of the enterprise bargaining
  provisions.4

  The absence of environmental purposes has not arisen because Australian trade unions
  have failed to recognise the significance of environmental considerations.
  Environmental concerns have been apparent on numerous occasions during the 20th

   and 21st centuries. In the early 1970s, for example, the Builders Labourers Federation,
   in alliance with progressive professionals and resident activists, placed bans on
   building destructive urban developments, based on the `social responsibility of labour'
   to create buildings that were socially beneficial to the community at large.5 In the
   late 1970s, the Australian Council of Trade Unions (`ACTU') robustly debated the
   question of whether Australia should continue to engage in uranium mining and
   exports in light of the existential threat posed by nuclear weapons, having resolved
   that the matter was of such significance that the entire Australian community should
   decide via referendum that there should be a moratorium on all new mining.6 More
   recently, some Australian unions have articulated demands for democratic control and
   ownership of energy systems, as a basis for addressing the climate crisis through
   the global network Trade Unions for Energy Democracy.7 Others have been active
   supporters of Indigenous traditional owners resisting the exploitation of their land for
   fracking.8

   Nor does the absence of environmental objectives in Australian labour law mean an
   absence of environmental workplace policies. Employers still pursue environmental
   objectives but mainly outside the strictures of labour law. Businesses are subject to
   regulation from environmental laws, which regulate a range of matters, including air
   quality, site contamination, used packaging materials,9 the use of pesticides,10 plastics11

   and air, noise, water and waste pollution.12 It is also commonplace for employers to
   have environmental policies, some of which come under the banner of corporate social
   responsibility (`CSR') initiatives.

   The vacating of the environmental field by Australian labour law does not mean
   an absence of regulation (just as the `deregulation' of labour law does not result in
   the same). It has tended, rather, towards managerialism in relation to environmental
   workplace matters, in which employees may be consulted about environmental matters
   that fall within the common interest of employers and employees (eg waste
   management policies, energy efficiency, transport schemes) but lack legal entitlements
   to engage in conflict and take collective action over sustainability issues in a more
   fundamental sense. 13 We see here how the contradictory logics of Australian labour
   law play out with the othering of nature reinforcing employer power (managerial
   prerogative) (see Table 1).

  3.2 Australian Labour Law Severely Restricts the Pursuit of
  Environmental Objectives, Especially in Relation to
  Collective Bargaining and Industrial Action

   The othering of nature in the Fair Work Act has meant a highly restrictive framework
   for the pursuit of environmental objectives (including climate action). Foremost,
   environmental objectives have to be couched in terms of the economic and social
   framework of Australian labour law. For instance, the 2019-20 bushfires were
   considered by the Fair Work Commission in its 2019-20 Annual Wage Review. As it
   was obliged to do, the Commission took the impact of the bushfires into account in
   relation to gross domestic product, household consumption and inflation -- but not as
   environmental catastrophes in their own right.14 As emphasised earlier, the othering of

   nature does not displace environmental considerations but, rather, foists a particular
   characterisation upon these considerations.

   The obstacles to pursuing environmental objectives are evident with collective
   bargaining and industrial action. These obstacles illustrate how the contradictory
   logics of Australian labour law are strongly tilted towards the right-hand side of the
   dyads in Table 1 -- they prevent in many cases the pursuit of environmental objectives
   through the countervailing power of collective bargaining. As with the absence of
   environmental objectives in the Fair Work Act, these obstacles reinforce employer
   power in relation to environmental matters.

   The restrictions of the Fair Work Act in relation to collective bargaining and industrial
   action have been repeatedly found by the ILO's Committee on Freedom of Association
   and its Committee of Experts to breach the ILO conventions on freedom of association
   and collective bargaining (ILO conventions 87 and 98).15 The breaches relate to (1)
   the subject matter of bargaining; (2) the level of bargaining; and (3) the ability to take
   industrial action.

   The first two types of restrictions undermine the autonomy of collective bargaining
   -- specifically, `the principle of free and voluntary collective bargaining embodied in
   Article 4 of Convention No. 98'.16 The third violates the right to strike, which `not only
   concern[s] better working conditions or collective claims of an occupational nature,
   but also the seeking of solutions to economic and social policy questions and problems
   facing the undertaking which are of direct concern to the workers'.17

   All three types of restrictions stand in the way of effective green bargaining
   (bargaining for environmental objectives) and reinforce the managerialism over
   workplace environmental matters stemming from the lack of environmental objectives
   in Australian labour law.

   3.2.1 The Subject Matter of Bargaining
   Regarding the subject matter of bargaining, a narrow ambit for bargaining can be
   traced back to 1904, when the High Court interpreted the term `industrial matters'
   in the Industrial Relations Act 1904 (NSW) to mean only matters directly affecting
   work done or the mutual rights and privileges of employees and employers. In a
   fillip for managerial prerogative, matters indirectly affecting such work, such as the
   opening hours of a business, financing arrangements, supply of raw material and (by
   implication) environmental matters, were excluded from industrial matters.18

   Against this background of restrictive jurisprudence, the Fair Work Act limits the
   content of enterprise agreements to `permitted matters'; terms that are not about
   permitted matters have `no effect'.19 The concept of permitted matters also shapes the
   lawfulness of industrial action. The two main limbs of permitted matters are:

             `matters pertaining to the relationship' between an employer and employees
               who will be covered by the proposed agreement20 (`the employment
               relationship limb'); and

             `matters pertaining to the relationship' between the employer/s and the
               employee organisation/s who will be covered by the proposed agreement21
               (`the trade union relationship limb').

   The restrictive High Court jurisprudence on industrial matters has carried through to
   permitted matters, requiring a direct connection between the matter and the relevant
   relationship for a matter to `pertain to the relationship'.

18. Clancy v Butchers' Shop Employees Union (1904) 1 CLR 181. It was the definition of `industrial matters' that saw the
       Builders' Labourers Federation (`BLF') reprimanded for the `green bans' by the NSW Industrial Court. The Court
       deregistered the BLF on the basis that it had gone beyond its own rules (which required it to act in the interests
       of its members as builders only, not citizens) and contravened the purpose of NSW industrial relations laws to
       `promote goodwill in industry': Master Builders' Association (NSW) v Australian Building Construction Employees
       and Builders Labourers Federation (1974) 23 FLR 356.

   Green bargaining22 can occur within the confines of the employment relationship
   limb of permitted matters, in relation to established areas of bargaining such as job
   security, working hours and leave entitlements.23 All these areas can be understood as
   protections that have new significance in the context of the climate crisis: job security
   is essential in the context of climate restructuring of jobs and industries, shorter
   working hours are a way to reduce climate emissions and leave entitlements such as
   natural disaster leave are a climate adaptation measure.24 Also coming within this limb
   are working-from-home provisions, which may reduce commuting and associated
   emissions; and provision for workforce planning (including training and re-skilling,
   which may enable employees to transition to less carbon-intensive roles).

   More extensive green bargaining through the employment relationship limb is,
   however, severely constrained by the Fair Work Act. Unless there is a direct
   connection with the employment relationship, the following will not come within the
   employment relationship limb: energy-efficiency and waste management measures,
   planning for net zero, emissions targets and governance, and corporate accountability
   for employers' environmental impacts (including in relation to investment decisions).

   The trade union relationship limb performs the vital role of making clear that
   provisions relating to trade union rights and entitlements come within permitted
   matters, including provisions that enable trade union involvement in matters coming
   within the employment relationship limb. This is highly significant in securing the
   collective depth essential for effective green bargaining. The trade union limb does
   not, however, do much to extend the breadth of green bargaining under permitted
   matters. While there are decisions to suggest that the trade union limb extends to
   matters not otherwise considered permitted, they seem to limit the scope to
   consultative mechanisms.25

   Empirical research into Australian enterprise agreements appears to confirm the
   centrality of employer prerogative to environmental agreement-making in practice
   between 2011 and 2016. A study found that found that environmental clauses were
   rare (around 7% of all enterprise agreements in the period) and likely to be driven
   by management as much as by unions. Many of the clauses contained very general
   commitments to environmental improvement associated with existing environmental
   policies, and 40% placed the onus of environmental protection exclusively on
   employees, with 8% also linking environmental issues to disciplinary procedures,
   including summary dismissal.26 Significantly, the ACTU draft model clause for
   enterprise agreements is also framed in terms of consultation, cooperation and the
   centrality of employer prerogative. It frames climate change as a matter of risk
   `to job security and the economy' and establishes processes for consultation via a
   workplace environment/sustainability committee and information sharing about the
   risks of climate change to enterprise operations.27

   3.2.2 The Level of Bargaining
   Climate change is a spatially labile phenomenon, and responsibility for emissions can
   be conceptualised at many scales. Given the interdependence of enterprises in supply
   chains in the most polluting industries such as energy, manufacturing, agriculture
   and transport, a holistic approach is required by employees that involves working
   collectively within and beyond their sector.28 The activities of the International Union
   of Food, Agricultural, Hotel, Restaurant, Catering, Tourism and Allied Workers'
   Associations (known as the `IUF'), for example, exemplify such an approach that
   integrates issues of human exploitation with extractive practices across the entire food
   system. Their campaign addresses every stage of food production, from land use

   together agricultural workers, rural farms, food processing and hospitality workers to
   advocate for a radically transformed food system.29

   Similar approaches are challenging within the Australian system. The restrictions on
   the level of bargaining stem from the structural bias of the Fair Work Act towards
   bargaining at the enterprise level. This bias is explicit, with the main object of the
   Act's bargaining provisions `to provide a simple, flexible and fair framework that
   enables collective bargaining in good faith, particularly at the enterprise level, for
   enterprise agreements that deliver productivity benefits'.30 Good faith bargaining
   obligations are unenforceable,31 and the ability to take protected industrial action is
   not available with multi-employer bargaining,32 unless they come within the limited
   exceptions of the supported bargaining and single-interest employer bargaining
   streams enacted by the Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Secure Jobs, Better Pay)
   Act 2022 (Cth). While the Act does not prohibit multi-employer bargaining, it provides
   a difficult environment for such bargaining, especially for trade unions and workers,
   given the severe restrictions on lawful industrial action in pursuit of such bargaining.

   The structural bias towards enterprise bargaining channels whatever green bargaining
   that can occur under the Fair Work Act to what is perhaps the least effective level
   of bargaining, where the tensions between job security and environmental objectives
   (`jobs v environment') are most difficult to reconcile.33 Conversely, climate emissions
   are deeply shaped by industry practices, making industry-level bargaining essential
   for green bargaining, if not the most important. Yet the structural bias of the Fair
   Work Act generally precludes such bargaining in a meaningful way. Together, these
   circumstances create a further disincentive to green bargaining at the enterprise level,
   as employers striking agreements with strong environmental measures risk a
   competitive disadvantage with `green' premiums.

   3.2.3 The Ability to Take Industrial Action

   Restrictions on the ability to take industrial action result from the implacable hostility
   of the common law to industrial action and the limited immunity provided by the Fair
   Work Act to common law actions against industrial action. At common law, industrial
   action is invariably a fundamental breach of the contract of employment, enabling
   employers to lawfully dismiss striking workers; persons organising industrial action
   can also be committing various torts.

   In the context of such common law liability, the Fair Work Act provides for immunity
   against common law actions through a complicated regime for `protected industrial
   action'.34 Amongst others, this regime ties the immunity for protected industrial action
   to permitted matters -- a requirement for protected industrial action by employees is
   that it is `organised or engaged in for the purpose of supporting or advancing claims
   in relation to the agreement that are only about, or are reasonably believed to only be
   about, permitted matters'.35 The immunity is also generally unavailable with industrial
   action taken in relation to multi-employer bargaining.36 The result is that industrial
   action that advances claims regarding emissions targets will be exposed to punitive
   common law actions; the same generally applies to green bargaining with multiple
   employers. Under the Fair Work Act, the Fair Work Commission is also obliged to
   issue `cease and desist' orders for industrial action that is not protected.37

  3.3 Australian Labour Law Does Not Systematically Provide
  for Climate Action

   The othering of nature in Australian labour law thus flows from both the lack of
   environmental objectives and restrictions on the pursuit of environmental objectives
   in the Fair Work Act. It is also reinforced by limitations to existing work health and
   safety law and the extremely narrow scope of climate planning mechanisms -- both

   of which point to the absence of systematic mechanisms for climate action under
   Australian labour law.

   3.3.1 Work, Health and Safety Laws

   As noted earlier, work, health and safety laws are premised on the responsibility
   of employers to assess risks and protect workers from hazards, regardless of their
   employment status. Work health and safety protections are of critical and rising
   importance as increasing numbers of workers are exposed to high heat, polluted air,
   increased solar ultraviolent radiation and vector-borne diseases.38 For many employers
   in climate-changed workplaces, the implications of these laws are significant. They
   include investments in building modification, air-conditioning, ventilation, flexible
   working hours, working rotations, changes to dress codes, shade canopies, the
   implementation of monitoring programs and `buddy systems'; and changed schedules
   for drink breaks.39 Schofield-Georgeson has observed that there are affordances of
   state work health and safety law that enable worker perspectives on environmental
   policies to be, when expressed through a `provisional improvement notice', legally
   enforceable rather than merely consultative.40

   There is, however, a gap between work, health and safety laws and the climate crisis
   that is both de facto and de jure. Empirical research into the adequacy of climate
   change based health and safety measures indicates that adequate responses are not
   being realised in practice.41 Such laws, in any event, are confined in their operation
   to the boundaries of the `business or undertaking', or `any place where a worker
   goes, or is likely to be, while at work', and only demand action that is `reasonably

   practicable'.42 They do not provide a collective basis for systemic responses to unsafe
   work due to environmental instability, which is generalised, chronic, involves multiple
   kinds of infrastructure breakdown and/or requires the wholesale relocation of people
   dwelling in an entire region.43 Nor are such laws likely to empower workforces in
   fossil fuel extractive industries to address the most fundamental cause of climate
   collapse (the failure to leave resources in the ground), since to do so would necessitate
   the winding down of enterprise itself -- a matter unlikely to be judged as reasonably
   practical from the perspective of the employer.

   3.3.2 The Absence of Climate Planning

   The instability of the climate crisis takes us to the second area -- the absence of
   climate planning. As Giddens has argued, planning takes on central importance in the
   climate crisis, in terms of climate mitigation and adaptation and holistic risk mitigation
   (addressing the risks of the climate crisis together with other risks experienced by
   contemporary societies). This fundamentally applies to the state but also to other levels
   of society.44

   Yet Australian labour law does not systematically provide for planning mechanisms
   to address the profound changes in the world of work demanded by the climate crisis.
   Net-zero transition plans are increasingly a feature of CSR initiatives in Australia;
   however, the credibility of these plans is open to question. A study of 10 prominent
   Australian companies found that `[d]espite public net zero commitments, none of the
   companies studied has a comprehensive, independently verified and fully costed plan
   for reducing their emissions in line with a scientific pathway'.45

   A lack of planning is particularly concerning in relation to the imperative to rapidly
   phase out fossil fuel extractive industries.46 The Net Zero Economy Authority

   (`NZEA'), an agency within the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet
   (discussed at 4.1 below) offers a framework for workers, employers, businesses and
   investors in `regions notably affected by Australia's net zero transition' to take
   advantage of clean energy industries and mobilise private investment.47 The NZEA
   co-exists with Federal commitments to continue extracting coal and gas resources `for
   decades'; the rejection of calls to ban new fossil fuel projects; and the continuation
   of fiscal support for fossil fuel production through the Fuel Tax Credit Scheme,
   tax incentives under the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax, subsidised infrastructure and
   financing through Export Finance Australia and the Northern Australia Infrastructure
   Fund.48

   While the NZEA uses the language of `transition' and `transformation',49 there is
   nothing inevitable about the substitution of a fossil fuel based energy system by
   a renewables-based one at a societal level. The history of energy systems is
   overwhelmingly one of co-existence, addition and mutual entanglement rather than
   smooth and sequential `transition'.50 In energy sectors, there are radical disconnects in
   time, geography and security between employment in fossil fuel based industry and
   hypothetical jobs in renewable-based energy production. While the occupations and
   skills required for renewable energy production and fossil fuel production partially
   overlap, the location, parameters, conditions and timing of work commonly differs.51
   The ongoing government support for new fossil fuel extractive projects, in parallel
   with measures to attract investment to clean investments, indicates that Australian
   workforce planning is oriented toward an overall energy addition, rather than an
   energy transition.52

  3.4 Australian Labour Law is Premised Upon Continuous
  Economic Growth

   The premise of continuous economic growth is reflected in the object of the Fair Work
   Act which speaks of providing:53

               [A] balanced framework for cooperative and productive workplace relations
               that promotes national economic prosperity and social inclusion for all
               Australians by ... providing workplace relations laws that ... promote
               productivity and economic growth for Australia's future economic
               prosperity.

   The ILO Declaration of Philadelphia also speaks of `the continuous improvement
   of productive efficiency' and `measures to expand production and consumption'.54
   Under the banner of `green growth', `sustainable growth' and the like, there is now a
   concerted push to decouple economic growth from greenhouse gas emissions (and the
   use of fossil fuels), with this decoupling explicit in `net zero' commitments.

   In line with ecological modernisation approaches,55 this push seeks to integrate
   environmental, economic and social considerations in a new model of growth. This
   kind of perspective finds inchoate expression in the stated goals of the Future Made in
   Australia Act 2024 (Cth) which, according to the ALP Albanese government, seeks:

               [t]o help make Australia a renewable energy superpower ... [t]o modernise
               and strengthen our economy, in a world built on cheaper and cleaner energy;
               [t]o grab the vast industrial and economic opportunities from the world's
               shift to net zero; [a]nd share the benefits of those opportunities with every
               Australian.56

   This includes through the promotion of `safe and secure jobs that are well paid
   and have good conditions' and the development of `more skilled and inclusive
   workforces.'57

   This industrial policy is, however, inchoate and contradictory. As noted above, it does
   not commit Australia to phasing out fossil fuel extraction or reducing subsidies to
   fossil fuel producers. Australia retains an open-ended commitment to developing fossil
   fuel resources for export (including an increase in production of coal and gas for
   203058) and opposes efforts to develop international law to recognise the responsibility
   on high-emitting states to prevent transboundary harms that occur from greenhouse
   gas emissions.59 The Australian Workers Union (`AWU'), Australia's largest union,
   and the Offshore Alliance group (a partnership with the AWU and the Maritime Union
   of Australia) have intervened to support a 50-year extension to the north-west shelf gas
   export project, an undertaking which will result in emissions equivalent to 12 average
   Australian coal power stations over its lifetime.60 In supporting the continuation and
   expansion of fossil fuel extractive projects, in spite of the catastrophic climate
   implications, these unions are not alone in global terms.61 There are, therefore, many
   structural challenges to ensuring that a just transition in Australia also includes a `just
   cessation', a number of which emerge from the limitations of labour law itself.62 The

                  What are the four ways in which Australian labour law is

                    indifferent to climate action?
                  How is this role of Australian labour law connected to the

                    contradictory logics of labour law?
                                                                                                                                                                602

 4. Towards a Climate Conscious Australian Labour
 Law

  It is an immense task to transform Australian labour law from climate indifference to
  climate consciousness -- an Australian labour law that can be an effective vehicle for
  climate action. We begin this task by highlighting four pathways of potential change
  which emerge from our analysis above:

          1. Integrate environmental objectives into Australian labour law.
          2. Foreground green bargaining.
          3. Invigorate democratic solidarity.
          4. Explore post-growth (post-capitalist) futures.

 4.1 Integrate Environmental Objectives into Australian
 Labour Law

  Australian labour law might begin to overcome its othering of nature by integrating
  its social and economic objectives with environmental goals. Instructive here is the
  approach of the United Nations' 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development: People,
  Planet, Prosperity, Peace and Partnership, where sustainable development goals
  `are integrated and indivisible and balance the three dimensions of sustainable
  development: the economic, social and environmental'.1

  Such integration could be affected by enlarging the objects of the Fair Work Act to
  include specific climate objectives:

            the imperative to ensure that Australia advances an effective response to the
              urgent threat of climate change which draws on the best available scientific
              knowledge, as recognised in the objects of the Climate Change Act 2022
              (Cth);2

            Australia's international obligations in respect of climate change (to
              accompany the reference to `Australia's international labour obligations' in
              s 3(a) of the Fair Work Act);3

            explicit recognition that the longstanding labour law objective of securing
              the conditions for human wellbeing4 extend to present and future
              generations (with `Australians' in s 3 of the Fair Work Act defined
              accordingly).

  Another method of integration is to position work, health and safety laws as one of the
  core areas of labour law5 -- a fact now recognised in the ILO's Centenary Declaration
  for the Future of Work6 and Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at
  Work.7

  Such integration does not, however, obviate these dilemmas nor remove the tensions
  and trade-offs between environmental, social and economic considerations. Australian
  labour law will always be a `mechanism of adjustment'.8 Sustainable development
  discourse, for instance, does not prescribe processes for how different goals of decent
  work, participatory decision-making, affordable and clean energy, and climate action

   should be prioritised.9 Expressly integrating environmental goals into Australian
   labour law enables its recurring dilemmas and any necessary trade-offs in the
   environmental-social-economic triangle to be openly navigated -- and negotiated.
   Mechanisms are essential here to enable transparent negotiation for the fashioning of
   synergies through longer time horizons and effective worker representation.

   Green collective bargaining should be understood as a key climate mechanism. An
   increased focus on just transition planning (anchored in an overriding recognition of
   the importance of phasing out fossil fuels) would be consistent with the approach
   encouraged by the ILO Guidelines for a Just Transition, as well as being a key feature
   of the European Union's Green Deal.10 The UN High-Level Expert Group on Net Zero
   Emissions Commitments of Non-State Entities has also called for businesses to adopt
   net-zero transition plans, highlighting the importance of businesses partnering with
   workers, unions, communities and suppliers in developing just transition plans and the
   integration of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples into
   transition plans.11

   The mechanisms currently contained in the Net Zero Economic Authority Act 2024
   (Cth), which provide for an `Energy Industry Jobs Plan', could potentially be
   expanded to be consistent with Australia's climate change obligations, and in a manner
   that deepens the participatory dimension of transition planning.12 At present, the
   legislation offers valuable transition mechanisms to workforces employed in coal-fired
   or gas-fired power stations, where a decision has already been made by owners to
   close all or part of the facility.13 They are, however, temporally and geographically

   circumscribed, and they do not attempt to enable meaningful and long-term
   consultative processes over climate change driven energy transitions more generally.
   They apply to a narrow category of worker (those in power generation and working
   in coalmines that are connected to domestic energy generation, rather than export) and
   commence at a late stage (only applying after a decision to close has already been
   made). If similar measures were available to all workers involved in coal, oil or gas
   extractive industries, and were capable of being triggered by different parties well in
   advance of any final decision to cease extraction or terminate a licence, this would
   be valuable in enabling workforces and individual workers to plan futures over longer
   time horizons and in a coordinated manner.

   The integration of environmental objectives into Australian labour law should
   recognise the distinctive role of Indigenous workers. Both the Net Zero Economy
   Authority Act 2024 and the Future Made in Australia Act 2024 respectively lay
   down the goals `to support Indigenous persons to participate in, and benefit from,
   Australia's transition to a net zero emissions economy',14 and support `First Nations
   communities and traditional owners to participate in, and share in the benefits of,
   the transition to net zero'.15 In line with the ILO Indigenous and Tribal Peoples
   Convention 1989, recognition of the distinctive role of Indigenous workers should be
   grounded in the specific climate threats faced by Indigenous communities and how,
   `as agents of change, indigenous peoples are essential to the success of policies and
   measures directed towards mitigating and adapting to climate change, especially their
   sustainable economic model and traditional knowledge'.16

   measures, it is also a concomitant of democracy at work and a tool for social justice.17
   There are two minimum requirements for such bargaining to occur effectively across
   the Australian workforce. First, the Fair Work Act should be amended so that
   `permitted matters' include energy-efficiency and waste management measures, net-
   zero planning, emissions targets and governance, and corporate accountability for the
   environmental impact of employers (including investment decisions). Second, multi-
   employer bargaining (together with industrial action) should be permitted in relation
   to these areas.

   Such amendments would be in line with the opinion of the European Economic and
   Social Committee that green collective bargaining should extend to:18

                       a. the impact of companies' activity on the environment;

                       b. the protection of workers from the effects of the environment and
                           climate change;

                       c. the impact of the green transformation on a company's activity as
                           regards work organisation, changing occupational profiles and the
                           skills of employees;

                       d. internal monitoring of the implementation of points a, b, and c.

   Whilst necessary, these amendments are unlikely to bring about effective green
   bargaining on a significant scale. Even in jurisdictions that provide wide scope for
   green bargaining, there have been few environmental clauses in collective
   agreements.19

   This highlights the significant changes required in the culture and practice of collective
   bargaining to enable widespread green bargaining. Amongst other things,

     607

   managerialism and siloing in this context need to be broken down, so that bargaining
   parties view environmental matters as being within the purview of bargaining, and
   not simply as a matter of managerial prerogative or environmental laws. It will also
   be necessary to contemplate bargaining beyond the enterprise level to bargaining at
   the industry level and/or across supply chains. All this strongly suggests the need for
   facilitative provisions in relation to green bargaining. A facilitative approach is in line
   with Article 4 of the ILO Convention on Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining,
   which states that:20

               Measures appropriate to national conditions shall be taken, where necessary,
               to encourage and promote the full development and utilisation of machinery
               for voluntary negotiation between employers or employers' organisations
               and workers' organisations, with a view to the regulation of terms and
               conditions of employment by means of collective agreements.

   Under the Fair Work Act, this approach could be implemented by the Fair Work
   Commission facilitating green bargaining, as described above or, alternatively, a
   stronger form that has been adopted in France and Spain, where bargaining parties are
   obliged to negotiate on certain environmental matters such as sustainable mobility.21

  4.3 Invigorate Democratic Solidarity

   The profound insight that democracy in society and democracy at work are intertwined
   is all the more significant in the climate crisis. It stands as a powerful antidote to the
   managerialism that envelopes environmental workplace matters and the technocratic
   erosion of routines of participation in society more broadly.22 It also lays out the
   imperative of democratising the state, which underpins the principle in the ILO
   Declaration of Philadelphia that: `[T]he representatives of workers and employers,
   enjoying equal status with those of governments, join with them in free discussion and

   democratic decision with a view to the promotion of the common welfare'.23 As Ewing
   has observed, social democracy implies `giving labour representation in government
   -- not simply to manage labour but to empower and enable it', thereby necessitating
   `alternative structures for policy-making, operating alongside parliamentary
   procedures in which governments consult and negotiate with the social partners'.24

   The imperative of democratising the state through labour law in a manner that reflects
   eco-social values is all the more compelling, given the dramatic expansion of scope
   suggested by a just transition agenda which places the state at its centre.25 Amongst the
   priority areas for inclusion are industrial policy (such as the Future Made in Australia
   Act 2024), job promotion and training, social protection and social policy (including
   pension funds)26 and environmental laws with workplace impact.27 This expansion has
   an affinity with the broadened scope of labour law urged by Dukes' emphasis on `the
   labour constitution'28 and, separately, by the `labour market regulation' approach to
   labour law.29

   The democratic imperative should be understood together with the principle of
   solidarity. Not only is solidarity a principle that can be found in labour law,30 it
   is emphatically a democratic principle. As the International Institute for Democracy
   and Electoral Assistance has explained, solidarity `refers to the ties in a society that

   bind different people to one another, expressing social bonds rather than autonomous
   individual ties'.31 Democratic solidarity is essential, given the widespread restructuring
   necessitated by the climate crisis -- a point made decades ago by Raymond Williams:

               It is no use simply saying to South Wales miners that all around them is an
               ecological disaster. They already know. They live in it. They have lived in
               it for generations. They carry it in their lungs ... But you cannot just say
               to people who have committed their lives and their communities to certain
               kinds of production that this has all got to change. You can't just say: come
               out of the harmful industries, come out of the dangerous industries, let us
               do something better. Everything will have to be done by negotiation, by
               equitable negotiation, and it will have to be taken steadily along the way.32

   Equitable negotiation here must mean scrupulous attention to ensuring effective social
   and job protection for workers adversely affected by climate disruptions, and their
   ability to take action, including industrial action, to defend and advance their interests
   within the context of an overall societal commitment to fossil fuel cessation. Even
   more challenging (revolutionary) than ensuring `equitable negotiation' for workers
   most affected by climate transitions is establishing a solidaristic ethos that is broad
   and inclusive, and encompasses both intergenerational and intragenerational
   solidarity, as well as solidarity with nature.

  4.4 Explore Post-Growth (Post-Capitalist) Futures

   Treating the economy as an open system with limitless resources (ie capitalism with
   perpetual growth) will inevitably collide with a global ecosystem enclosed by

   Climate Change Secretariat, `a growth-oriented economy may not be compatible with
   a climate-safe economy'.34

   As Pope Francis put it forcefully:35

               [T]he idea of infinite or unlimited growth, which proves so attractive to
               economists, financiers and experts in technology ... is based on the lie that
               there is an infinite supply of the earth's goods, and this leads to the planet
               being squeezed dry beyond every limit.

   This brings us to a `dangerous contradiction' within capital accumulation -- capital's
   relation to nature. Always present within the accumulative logic of capital, this has
   reached `a key inflexion point' with `the exponential growth rate of capitalist activity',
   `having an exponential impact upon levels of environmental stress and distress within
   capital's ecology'36 -- the existential threat of climate change being the prime
   example.

   This has prompted calls for steady state or zero-growth economies, and even degrowth
   economies -- that is, societies based on `prosperity without growth'.37 These calls
   are being picked up by some trade unions38 and labour law scholars.39 They radically
   challenge the established purposes of labour law40 and seriously question the

   productivist or `treadmill of production' paradigm underlying these purposes, as well
   as the anchoring of worker welfare in continuous (compound) economic growth.41
   The purposes of labour law are predicated upon a functioning system of capitalism
   (or at least one that can be aspired to). Zero-growth and degrowth societies are,
   however, incompatible with capitalism. As Streeck argues, capitalism is a `progressive
   society', in the sense of having `coupled its "progress" to the continuous and unlimited
   production and accumulation of productive capital ... [and] promis[ing] infinite
   growth of commodified material wealth in a finite world'.42 Given this, Harvey is
   surely right when he says:43

               Capital is about profit seeking. For all capitalists to realise a positive profit
               requires the existence of more value at the end of the day than there was at
               the beginning. That means an expansion of the total output of social labour.
               Without that expansion there can be no capital. A zero-growth capitalist
               economy is a logical and exclusionary contradiction. It simply cannot exist.

 5. Conclusion

  The climate crisis is also a crisis for labour law. Because labour law is a dimension of
  sustainability, it is possible to view the climate crisis as an opportunity for reasserting
  and expanding the existing core concerns of labour law, such as the importance
  of collective bargaining, protections against unfair dismissal and discrimination,
  occupational health and safety protections and the reduction of barriers to protection
  created by tests for employment status.1 These matters are, and will remain, critical
  contributions to ensuring that the growing work of adaptation in Australian society can
  be undertaken at the necessary scale and on just terms.

  We have also suggested in this chapter that climate change enlivens a new set of
  challenges for labour law that are different in kind to the discipline's more familiar
  crises of scope, boundaries and enforcement.2 This perspective is founded on a
  conception of labour law's function as a space for collective struggle over the terms
  by which human beings may be permitted, required or forced to transform the world
  through their labour. From this perspective, existing Australian labour law exhibits
  limitations in four main ways: it lacks environmental objectives, it restricts the scope
  of collective bargaining and industrial action, it does not provide a basis for systemic
  climate action and planning, and it is premised on continuous economic growth. To
  shift from these climate-destructive foundations, we have suggested four ways to
  begin reorienting Australian labour law as a positive contributor to a participatory
  and democratic response to climate change. For labour law scholars, practitioners and
  students, recognising these new stakes is crucial. It is a turning point of both extreme
  danger and significant opportunity.3

This chapter explores a range of issues about the connections between climate change
and intellectual property (`IP') and technology law. We focus on three areas where
IP protection can impact climate concerns: incentives and access to green technology;
waste and the right to repair; and climate protest. The aim is to help students broaden
and deepen their understanding of the role that IP and technology law can play in
addressing climate change.

                                                                 615
                                                                                                                                                  616

                                     KEY QUESTIONS
          How does IP incentivise the development of technology that

            addresses the impact of climate change? How does it restrict
            access to this technology?

 1. Introduction

  Climate change creates a need and market for responsive innovative technologies
  that can be protected by a range of intellectual property rights (`IPRs'), including
  those that are the most common focus in tertiary legal education: patents, designs,
  copyright, trade marks and confidential information. The availability of these IPRs
  to protect intangible property can provide valuable incentives to invest in new types
  of technologies. However, IP can also create barriers to accessing new innovative
  technologies that can help address climate change or reduce the causes of climate
  change. As private rights, IPRs originally subsist with the authors or creators of the
  works. However, ultimately, IPRs are primarily controlled by large (and often global)
  corporations that often prioritise economic sustainability and profits over social and
  environmental sustainability goals. The drive to get return on their investment in
  research and development prioritises corporations' drive for control over the repair
  and service aftermarkets for the products, devices, machines and equipment that
  they produce and sell. This not only leads to higher prices but restricts competition
  in those markets. Often this results in limited access or distribution of newer and
  greener technologies in certain, less profitable markets. It is evident that IPRs create
  closed aftermarkets by creating barriers to repair of these goods and machines or
  by supporting poor design practices that contribute to premature obsolescence. This
  contributes to the global crisis in waste1 and pollution that negatively impacts the
  environment and accelerates climate change.2

  The need to ensure there is a balance struck between the IPR holders and the public
  who make use of the IP has long been addressed through the use of exceptions,
  defences and limitations that are built into IP legislation, such as fair dealing;
  provision for compulsory licensing of patents, designs and copyright, as well as the
  possibility of Crown use. Climate conscious lawyers can help ensure that IP laws
  operate in an environmentally sustainable way by balancing the need to incentivise
  the development of green technology with ensuring widespread, global access to

  technology that can directly or indirectly address climate change. This is usually
  through awareness of exceptions and limitations to IP protection. These exceptions,
  defences and limitations are highlighted in this chapter. One of the undeniable
  challenges for climate change advocacy groups (and their climate conscious lawyers)
  who wish to tackle IP barriers to climate change is the high costs associated with any
  form of IP litigation, particularly patent litigation.3 Additional legal competencies for
  climate conscious IP and technology lawyers that can drive legal and practical change
  should include an understanding of how access mechanisms that permit broader
  access to beneficial technologies such as creative commons licences or open science
  practices can accompany or replace enforcement of IPRs.4
  The second part of this chapter examines the influence of selected international
  legal agreements concerning IP and the environment on domestic IP protection and
  regulation of technology. Understanding these agreements can assist advocacy for
  legislative and regulatory change where the current exceptions and limitations are
  ineffective. The chapter then considers three important areas where technology and
  IP can impact climate change -- green technology, waste and the right to repair
  movement, and climate advocacy -- before concluding on future directions for climate
  change, IP and technology.

 2. The International Legal Framework for IP and
 Technology Law

 2.1. Influence of International Law on Domestic IP
 Protection

  Domestic IP law is shaped by standards found in international agreements that
  Australia has ratified, as well as bilateral and plurilateral agreements that include
  additional protection for IP owners, such as longer monopolies for protection for
  patent and copyright owners, or protection for foreign investors against expropriation
  of IP assets or treatment that is not fair and equitable, through investor-state dispute
  mechanisms.

  The most influential international IP agreement is the Agreement on Trade Related
  Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (`TRIPS'). This requires all World Trade
  Organisation (`WTO') members to implement minimum IP standards. For example,
  an Australian patent examiner examining an application to patent an innovation in
  relation to solar panels considers whether the application meets thresholds of novelty,
  inventiveness and industrial applicability that are required by TRIPS Article 27 and
  embedded in the Patents Act 1990 (Cth) and Patents Regulations 1992 (Cth).

  WTO members can contest failure to comply with these standards by other members
  through the WTO Dispute Settlement Body (`DSB') and enforcement measures can
  be applied against non-complying members. Several disputes have determined that
  WTO members need to address TRIPS noncompliance.1 These strong enforcement
  mechanisms can encourage members to prioritise their WTO obligations over other
  international obligations such as environmental obligations. However, recent disputes
  have recognised that other agreements such as the Framework Convention on Tobacco
  Control can support decisions by members to recognise societal interests in domestic

      Doc WT/DS362/R (26 January 2009).
                                                                   619
                                                                                                                                                                620

  IP legislation.2 Societal interests can include climate concerns where these motivate
  states to amend IP legislation `to promote the public interest in sectors of vital
  importance to their socio-economic and technological development'.3 This flexibility
  is important when states wish to amend domestic protection of IP to comply with
  obligations to address climate change, including the Framework Convention on
  Climate Change (`FCCC'), the Kyoto Protocol and the Nagoya Protocol. The DSB has
  previously recognised the relevance of these agreements in its interpretation of other
  WTO agreements.4 Other agreements such as the Sustainable Development Goals
  (`SDGs') may also provide justification for restrictions on IP protection.5

 2.2. Technology Law and International Influences

  Despite the impact of legal obligations on technology, `technology law' is not
  currently a cohesive body of law. Although entitlements to exploit innovative
  technology are frequently established through assertion of IPRs, technology is much
  less cohesively regulated than IP law in Australia and in international agreements.
  However, the relationship between technology and sustainable development is a
  critical aspect of approaching the regulation of technology. IP protection can strongly
  influence the availability of technology that benefits and restricts sustainable
  development. Climate change is a critical consideration in realising sustainable
  development and there is increasing recognition of this in domestic legislation that
  should impact demand for environmentally sustainable technology, including
  renewable energy technology.6

International consensus about the environment and sustainability, including the
importance of addressing climate change, can also be relevant to the way that law
regulates technology. For example, regulation of specific technologies can implement
standards for greenhouse gas emissions agreed through the Kyoto Protocol. There
is explicit recognition of the importance of the transfer of environmentally sound
technologies and cooperation and capacity building to effect this in SDG 17. Realising
the goals requires widespread development and use of technology consistent with
SDGs of taking urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts, building
sustainable communities and responsible production and consumption. Article 10 of
the Paris Agreement establishes a technology development and transfer framework to
support climate change mitigation and transformation and establishes a Technology
Mechanism to achieve this. These measures are consistent with the requirement in
TRIPS Article 66.2 that developed countries should provide incentives for promoting
technology transfer to least-developed countries but provide important focus on
environmental objectives.

                    different areas of law?

 3. IPRs and the Move to a Greener Economy

 3.1. IPRs as an Incentive for Green Technology

  IP can incentivise the development of green innovation - technology that improves
  environmental outcomes. IPRs generally provide incentives to innovators to make
  their innovations publicly available and disclose information about them.
  Experimental use of disclosed information can stimulate further innovation while
  the limited monopoly conferred on IPR owners, in which they can prevent other
  uses of their patent or design for a certain period or restrict use of trade marks
  or copyright protected information in relation to their innovations, enables them to
  maximise return on their investment. The exception to this is confidentiality, which
  protects information that has been disclosed where an obligation of confidence can
  be inferred. This permits protection of trade secrets and know-how and can limit
  access to knowledge that is important to climate change. For example, data about how
  positioning of a patented solar panel system impacts energy collection efficiency could
  be kept by a patent owner as a trade secret because this information was not necessary
  to meet patent disclosure requirements for describing the invention. This might mean
  that the environmental benefits of this technology are not maximised.

  The positive role that IPRs can play in addressing climate change and promoting a
  more environmentally sustainable future was acknowledged by the World Intellectual
  Property Organisation (`WIPO') when its Green Project was established in 2013.
  This project focuses on encouraging collaboration, technology transfer and open
  innovation, all significant WIPO goals to attempt to address climate change.1 WIPO
  is committed to the view that IPRs contribute significantly to the development and
  diffusion of new energy-saving green technologies, noting that inadequate IP

      Environmental Law.
                                                                   622
   623

  protection compromises the diffusion of technology and therefore sustainable
  innovation and practices grow further out of reach.2

  While IPRs are currently being used to protect green innovations and thus provide an
  incentive for developing sustainable innovation, there is no clear significant positive
  relationship between IP and the diffusion of sustainable innovation.3 A well-designed
  IP framework can enable a fundamental shift towards sustainable production and
  consumption by promoting sustainable practices -- for example, through incentive-
  driven IPRs such as green patents, green trade marks, labelling and green design
  practices. However, prominent Global South scholars, non-government organisations
  and activist groups have highlighted the potential for global technology companies to
  use their IPRs to create further monopolies over new climate-friendly technologies.4
  While compulsory licences are supposed to operate to ensure that IPRs do not create
  inequities, fair and equitable access to new IPR protected technologies, developing
  nations experience greater hurdles in implementing and enforcing compulsory
  licensing for new emerging green and climate-friendly technologies.

  Without a doubt, green innovations and green patents will contribute to significantly
  reducing the amount of new material added to the economy and IPRs provide
  incentives for the development of green technologies and green patents.5 The
  International Patent Classification has a specific IPC Green Inventory, which sets
  out the patent classifications that constitute Environmentally Sound Technologies.6
  It has already been implemented in the UK and Australia (and temporarily enacted

   in the United States)7 to fast-track green patent applications. In 2009, the UK, US
   and Australia established programs to fast-track green patent applications, thereby
   meaning the time to get a patent was significantly reduced from several years to a few
   months.8 While patent law allows for the refusal of patents on ordre public, public
   policy and morality grounds, domestic implementation such as Australia's exclusion
   of patents `for an invention the use of which would be contrary to law' is unlikely
   to exclude patents for environmental concerns.9 If these grounds were used to do
   this, this would introduce a drastic change into patent law for innovations that can
   have harmful environmental impacts. Alternatively, there is room for IPRs to provide
   further incentives to foster green patents by rewarding green technology inventors for
   making repair-friendly innovations.10

   Although green innovations and inventions do not have a single across-the-board mark
   designated at this stage, more and more green trade marks are being registered, which
   can be taken as anecdotal evidence for the existing marks having a positive impact.11
   Eco-labelling has also been recognised as a positive regulatory step in supporting
   consumers in their attempts to make purchasing decisions in line with the aims of
   sustainability and on the side of the companies, it signals the company's corporate
   social outlook and even acts as a commercial guarantee.12 Although protection depends
   on appearance rather than functionality, design protection is also playing an important
   role in the context of clean energy products, as these rights can help to support the

creators of such products and achieve clean energy policy aims.13 Some exemplary
circular business models include designing goods with a long life, which results in
`greater reuse; greater repairability, which can support the growing remanufacturing
industry; and allowing for the easy recovery of materials when a product is eventually
recycled'.14 Support is also growing for design for disassembly and `design for repair',
which `refers to a set of design efforts to facilitate fixing devices by end-users and
repair shops during the initial product's life cycle'.15

3.2. IPRs as a Barrier to Green Innovation Access

IPRs can also pose a barrier for access to innovation that addresses problems related
to climate change. Copyright and design law can place barriers on the ability to
keep products in use, reducing e-waste which is a significant contributor to climate
change.16 The monopoly a patent confers can mean that innovation is not available
or not affordable in certain jurisdictions. Australian patent law includes mechanisms
to permit compulsory licences to be issued where negotiations with a patent holder
have been unsuccessful, permitting an applicant to use a patent and pay the owner a
court-determined royalty.17 There are also provisions for Crown use18 and emergency

   use.19 The need to limit access barriers is also recognised in international law: TRIPS
   Article 31 permits use of a patent without the authorisation of a patent holder in certain
   circumstances, including public non-commercial use.

   Not all innovation will meet the patentability thresholds necessary to receive IP
   protection, including manner of manufacture, novelty and inventive step.20 Third
   parties can bring oppositions to the grant of patents that do not meet these
   requirements21 and even if a patent is granted, it can be revoked if courts later find
   that these requirements are not met.22 Similarly, for registered designs that protect the
   appearance of a product to be certified, they must meet standards of newness and
   distinctiveness compared to the prior art base and can be subsequently revoked if
   these standards are not met.23 Registered designs can also be subject to compulsory
   licences24 and Crown use,25 including emergency use.26 Governments or third parties
   could use these mechanisms to advance climate change objectives if, for example, the
   visual appearance of clean energy technology such as solar panels or wind turbines
   subject to a registered design is considered so appealing that it will encourage
   widespread use of this technology.27

 4. Waste and the Right to Repair

 4.1. The Right to Repair Movement

  Electronic waste (`e-waste') has become one of the fastest-growing waste streams
  in the world. Many of our everyday household appliances such as phones, fridges
  and dishwashers are now embedded with computer software to make them smarter
  and more convenient. The combination of IPRs that accompany these `smart' goods
  (whether it be patents over new technologies, trade marks over brands, copyright in
  embedded computer software or design rights in the product and its spare parts) means
  that IP owners can unduly restrict the access to and use of smart everyday products
  which, in turn, creates barriers to keeping those products in use for longer and keeping
  them out of landfill.

  The right to repair movement, which began with right to repair legislation in the
  automotive industry in the US in 2012, has now gained international support, with
  numerous regulatory interventions in the US1 and EU2 to ensure goods, appliances,
  machinery and cars are able to be kept in use for longer. Right to repair advocates
  highlight that durable and repairable products have a longer life cycle, which has been
  identified as being important economically, socially and environmentally.3 The right

  reduce the greenhouse emissions that would otherwise go into the energy consumption

                                                KEY QUESTION

                    How can IP achieve the right balance between IP owners of
                      smart goods by providing incentives to invest in innovation on
                      one hand, and accommodating the rights of those who purchase
                      and use these goods to exercise their full rights of ownership on
                      the other?

  The inability of Australians to repair their smart consumer goods, machinery and
  vehicles was the subject of a one-year national inquiry by the Australian Government's
  Productivity Commission (`PC').6 Throughout that inquiry, various concerns were
  raised that IPRs were being used to unnecessarily restrict repairs,7 and manufacturers
  were found to use a range of legal and technological measures to protect their IP
  in these products from unauthorised use. On 1 December 2021, the Australian

   Government publicly released the PC's final report8 and made several
   recommendations as to how repair barriers could be removed to empower Australians
   to repair faulty goods and access repair services at a competitive price. The following
   sections examine each of the barriers that IP laws pose to repairability and highlight
   how a rebalancing of IPRs could address the commitments in SDG 12 to responsible
   production and consumption.

   4.1.1. Copyright Barriers

   Australian copyright laws that prevent third-party repairers from accessing repair
   information were found by the PC to be one of the most significant IP-related barriers
   to repair.9 Two types of repair information are particularly affected: manuals and
   schematics10 and diagnostic and software tools.11

   The original information contained in repair manuals is protected by copyright (if the
   other threshold requirements are met).12 This prevents the copying of repair manuals.
   The PC recommended amendments to the Copyright Act 1968 (Cth) to allow repairers
   to reproduce and share copyright repair information (such as repair manuals and
   schematics) without needing to seek permission from the copyright holder under
   certain circumstances.13 These will provide improved access to information,
   facilitating the repairer to perform product repairs safely and efficiently, reducing
   additional costs associated with third-party repair (such as product teardowns, reverse
   engineering, search costs and repair delays).14

10. Manufacturers can use copyright protections to restrict access to and distribution of information on how to repair
       products.

11. Manufacturers can also use `digital locks' that protect embedded software and computer code to prevent third parties
       from accessing embedded repair data (such as diagnostic data, and consumer and product-use information that would
       be important to know when troubleshooting and debugging problems)

12. Copyright will subsist in works in Australia where the work falls within the subject matter of copyright, is original, fixed
       in a material form and must be connected to Australia: Copyright Act 1968 (Cth) s 31.

   Two exceptions were suggested that could be adopted in amending copyright laws,
   under which the reproduction and sharing of repair manuals can be considered as not
   infringing the exclusive rights of copyright holders:15 either the adoption of a new
   specific copyright fair dealing exception for repair or the adoption of the broader US-
   style fair use, which would allow for the sharing of repair information for the purposes
   of repair. This is not the first time that a `fair use' defence has been suggested for
   adoption by Australian regulators.16 The `fair use' exception and `fair dealing' defence,
   however, are both exceptions available to copyright law, so action would have to be
   brought for infringement before any defence could be raised.

   For a real rebalancing of copyright law, reform should shift from either limited or
   broad exceptions to positive user rights. For example, the recent mandatory data-
   sharing laws in the Australian motor vehicle aftermarket17 essentially override the
   copyright in the diagnostic and repair data of manufacturers for motor vehicle repair.

                                                 KEY QUESTIONS

                      Does copyright law currently ensure fair and reasonable access
                        to a manufacturer's repair and service information?

                      Should IP owners have a positive obligation to share copyright
                        information for the purposes of repair?

   Copyright's scheme of technological protection measures (`TPMs') were also
   recognised as creating unnecessary barriers to repair, as they were being used by IP

   owners to not only `lock' down the digital repair information but also the products
   and devices themselves, thus preventing access for repair purposes.18 As the software
   embedded in devices and machines is integral to their workings, TPMs or `digital
   locks' are used to prevent access to not only the copyright over the embedded software
   but the physical devices themselves. For example, modern cars and tractors only show
   error codes now if they have a breakdown, and owners are forced to go back to the
   manufacturers to get access to the diagnostic software, as the digital locks prevent
   them from defect identification. Accordingly, the PC suggested it was necessary to
   amend the existing TPM circumvention exception for repair,19 not only to clarify its
   scope and application to permit circumvention to access information necessary to
   perform repairs but also to permit the distribution of TPM circumvention devices for
   the purpose of repair. 20 This would allow repairers to distribute (and obtain from
   others) TPM circumvention devices, which will improve third-party repairers' access
   to digital repair information (such as diagnostics and product data).21

   The fact that copyright law and its scheme of defences and limitations can be
   `contracted out of' by manufacturer end use licence agreements (`EULAs') was also
   recognised as a barrier to the right to repair. These licences are often used by
   manufacturers or IP owners to claim trade secret protection (or confidentiality) over
   their IP (including repair information), as well as containing contractual limitation on
   the ability to repair the devices or machines. The PC recommended that the Copyright
   Act should be amended to prohibit the `contracting out' of copyright law exceptions,
   including those that relate to repair.22

   4.1.2. Patents

   The PC did not need to make any strong recommendations for reform of patent law,
   as the uncertainty surrounding repairing patented goods was clarified in 2020 by the
   important `printer cartridge' decision of the Australian High Court in Calidad Pty Ltd

   v Seiko Epson Corporation (`Calidad').23 This case critically addressed whether the
   patentee could use the patent system to control or limit the future use of the patented
   product (ie what may be done with a patented product after it has been sold by the
   patentee) or whether the rights of the patentee continue.24 The High Court needed
   to consider to what extent a patentee can enforce its patent rights against purchasers
   or subsequent purchasers of its patented products. This required evaluation of two
   competing doctrines: the longstanding `implied licence' doctrine that has been applied
   for more than a century; and the `exhaustion' doctrine that has been adopted in other
   jurisdictions, including the US and the Court of Justice of the European Union.

   The High Court of Australia decided that the patentee's exclusive rights over its
   patented products were exhausted upon the first sale of the product, bringing Australia
   in line with the US approach of Impression Prods. v Lexmark Int'l, Inc.25 Once a
   product has been sold to a consumer, this exhausts the patentee's rights over that
   product, thus leaving the purchaser and subsequent owners from any obligations as to
   its use.26 The majority held that Calidad's `modified' printer cartridges did not infringe
   Seiko's patents and found that patent owners cannot use the patent system to control
   or limit what may be done with a patented product after it has been sold by the patent
   owner, because the patent owner's rights are `exhausted' upon such sale.27 With the
   adoption of an `exhaustion doctrine', the High Court has brought about a significant
   change in Australian jurisprudence regarding IPRs for repair and reuse.

                        repair and reuse of patented products?

   4.1.3. Trade Marks
   Interestingly, Australian trade mark law was not yet found to have created any
   real barriers to repairability. However, the PC recognised the importance of trade
   mark law to Australian consumers, noting that `consumers may also benefit from
   some IP related restrictions (such as trade marks) where it enables them to clearly
   identify and distinguish brands that have established a reputation (including for safety
   and quality)'.28 Trade marks and a possible repair labelling scheme could play more
   useful roles in terms of recognising the role repairability and durability can play
   in empowering consumers to make better purchasing decisions, thus contributing to
   better environmental outcomes.

                                                 KEY QUESTIONS
                      How might IP owners use trade marks to prevent the use of

                        spare parts in a repair?
                      Would a repair label / trade mark empower you as a consumer?

                        Could it incentivise manufacturers to design their products
                        better?

   4.1.4. Designs Law
   Poor product design practices can increase the difficulty of repair. The PC identified
   stakeholder concerns over products being difficult to take apart or how their design

28. Productivity Commission (n 7) 35.
     635

   can prevent components from being separated for repair, which can make the repair
   more time-consuming and labour-intensive, leading to increased cost of repair and
   more waste.29 When products are protected by registered designs, Australian design
   law has a `repair defence'. This defence stipulates that it does not infringe a registered
   design to use, or authorise another person to use, a product that is a component part
   of a complex product `for the purpose of the repair of the complex product so as to
   restore its overall appearance in whole or part'.30 Importantly, this defence places the
   onus on a registered design's owner to prove that parts were being made, supplied or
   used for non-repair purposes.31

   The repair defence in Australian design law received its first judicial consideration in
   2019, in the case of GM Global Technology Operations LLC v SSS Auto Parts Pty.32
   This decision essentially highlighted the complexity and limited scope of operation of
   the repair defence.33 The issue at stake was whether GM Global could prove that the
   parts in question were produced for purposes other than repairs, such as customisation
   and enhancement.34 SSS Auto Parts succeeded in this case, which demonstrated the
   difficulty that Australian registered design owners face when bringing an action for
   infringement involving designs over repair parts due to the heavy onus of proof. They
   must establish that the manufacturer of the component in question knew (or reasonably
   should have known) that it would (rather than could) be used for purposes other than
   repair.

   Arguably, this repair defence is a broad mechanism which empowers spare parts
   manufacturers35 and Australian consumers with the ability to `repair' products that are

   protected by Australian design law. However, despite the reversal of onus, there is no
   certainty about repairability until an action for infringement is brought, as it is only
   then that the defence can be relied upon.
   In September 2021, IP Australia36 progressed a program of reforms in relation to
   design law in Australia.37 This has resulted in a new amendment Act: the Designs
   Amendment (Advisory Council on Intellectual Property Response) Act 2021 (Cth).
   Unfortunately for right to repair advocates, there was little attention paid to enhancing
   consumers' right to repair with compliance with environmental goals in mind. Despite
   submissions highlighting the importance of expanding the operation and scope of the
   existing repair defence within Australian design law, little attention seemed to be
   paid to the broader environmental goals of repair and reuse -- that is, compliance
   with SDGs 12 and 13 for responsible production and consumption and addressing the
   impact of climate change.

                                                  KEY QUESTION

 5. Climate Advocacy, Trade Marks and Copyright

  IP can also be a tool that restricts freedom of expression, as owners of copyright
  and trade mark rights can restrict the use of protected material through infringement
  claims. Trade marks can be powerful communication tools and expressive use of them
  in protest materials can strengthen the impact of protest campaigns.1 Where trade
  marks are logos composed of device marks, they can also be protected by copyright.

  The recent decision in AGL v Greenpeace illustrates how IP owners might use
  copyright and trade mark rights to restrict advocacy and protest about climate change
  but the nature of the rights and exceptions to protection can still permit some use
  of trade marks and copyright material.2 AGL is a well-known supplier of electricity,
  gas and telecommunications in Australia and registered its AGL logo as a trade
  mark. Greenpeace incorporated the AGL logo next to the words `Australia's Greatest
  Liability' (as a modified AGL logo) into online banners linked to a parody website,
  posters and materials for its `Still Australia's Biggest Climate Polluter' campaign
  protesting AGL's impact on the environment in the context of concerns that AGL's
  advertising constituted `greenwashing'.3

  AGL brought proceedings against Greenpeace, alleging that this modified AGL logo
  was substantially identical to the registered AGL logo and infringed its trade mark
  rights and copyright subsisting in the AGL logo. In Australia, infringement requires
  that the registered trade mark be `used as a trade mark' to suggest a connection in
  the course of trade between the user and the goods or services for which the trade
  mark is registered.4 This was not the way that Greenpeace employed the trade mark, so

      of Culturally Significant Trade Marks in Australia' (2019) 30(1) Australian Intellectual Property Journal 46, 49-53.

2. AGL Energy Ltd v Greenpeace Australia Pacific Ltd [2021] FCA 625; 395 ALR 275; 159 IPR 336 (`AGL Energy').

3. Trade marks can be used to greenwash products to make them appear more environmentally friendly to consumers than
      they are in reality. Burley J did not consider it necessary to assess whether AGL was `falsely creating the impression
      in its promotional materials that it is doing more to protect the environment than it really is': ibid [12]. For further
      discussion of greenwashing see Climate-Related Greenwashing and Australian Consumer Law.

                                                                   637
                                                                                                                                                                638

  the use was not infringing.5 This threshold also applied in relation to other impugned
  uses of the AGL logo on street posters, mock-up street posters, the parody website,
  social media, a protest poster image in Greenpeace's `Coal-faced: Exposing AGL
  as Australia's biggest climate polluter' report and placards held by protesters. The
  court made no finding of trade mark infringement. This is valuable confirmation that
  expressive use of trade marks that does not involve using them as a badge or origin in
  relation to a good or service is unlikely to be infringing use.

  Still, the trade mark in dispute combined the lower case letters `agl' with five stylised
  rays, so it also qualified for copyright protection as an artistic work. There are
  limited exceptions to copyright infringement for fair dealings with copyright works
  for specific purposes specified in Part III of the Copyright Act 1968 (Cth). The two
  relevant exceptions in this case were fair dealing for parody or satire, and fair dealing
  for criticism or review. The court determined that use of the protected artistic work in
  the modified AGL logo was fair dealing for the purposes of parody or satire, noting
  that the viewer would understand that the message came from Greenpeace.6 However,
  certain uses that did not make reference to the tagline `Australia's Greatest Liability',
  including social media posts and protest placard images, did not constitute fair dealing
  for the purposes of parody or satire, nor was the Court satisfied that viewers would
  consider it to be for the purpose of criticism or review, so the exception did not apply.7
  Although the court granted an injunction in relation to the removal of the limited
  materials that infringed copyright, it refused to award damages and AGL was ordered
  to pay 85% of Greenpeace's costs.8

  The emphasis given in the decision on the need for clearly messaging that use of
  copyright materials is for the purpose of criticism or review provides important
  guidance for future climate protests.

                  How can trade marks be used in climate protest without infringing
                    the rights of trade mark owners?

                  How can fair dealing exceptions to copyright permit use of literary
                    and artistic material protected by copyright in climate change
                    advocacy? Do you think copyright and trade mark law adequately
                    protected freedom of expression for climate protestors in this
                    case?

                  Why might the costs of legal proceedings restrict the willingness

6. Conclusion

This chapter has invited you to consider the relationship between protection of
technology through IPRs and climate change. This can be shaped by the Australian
Government's obligations to implement international agreements that establish
minimum standards for the protection of IPRs, but Australia also has international
obligations to address the climate emergency. The role that IPRs can and should
play in relation to efforts to respond to climate change is one that is currently being
addressed through many different lenses and avenues. There is a myriad of ways
in which the role of IPRs can address climate change issues, including fast-tracking
patents, limiting the availability of patents or promoting new green patents, trade
marks or design rights.

While the IP system more specifically has been attributed with being the driving
force behind advancing and strengthening green technologies and innovations that
could mitigate damage to the environment, it is equally acknowledged that IPRs are
failing to strike the right balance between the interests of rights holders and of others
seeking to access and use the subject matter of IPRs. There is much work to be
done to ensure there is a stronger rights-based approach to IPRs, taking into account
consumers' rights, issues of open and fair competition and broader environmental
considerations to realign IPRs to ensure that compliance with the UN SDGs and
broader environmental goals can be achieved. The chapter has identified ways that
IPRs can be beneficial to incentivising the development of technology that attempts
to mitigate the impact of climate change and ways that IPRs can pose barriers to
environmentally friendly technologies, product durability, repairability and climate
advocacy. The exceptions, defences and limitations to enforcement of IPRs discussed
in this chapter are highlighted as useful tools for a climate conscious lawyer to engage
to limit the negative impact of IPRs on efforts to address climate change.

As more legislation is implemented that recognises the importance of environmental
sustainability in Australia's future, more attention needs to be given to the role
that IPRs should play in supporting this green transformation. A climate conscious
lawyer should continue to critically reflect on the role that IPRs and their limitations,

exceptions and defences can play in ensuring new technologies can be used as a tool
to address the climate emergency rather than exacerbate it.

  Climate change has wide ranging impacts on health, some of which are direct, while
  others operate through complex causal mechanisms.1 Climate change has current
  and anticipated impacts on unintentional injuries, infectious diseases, cardiovascular
  disease and mental health. It is anticipated to have devastating impacts on the
  conditions needed to ensure healthy lives, through water scarcity, ecosystem
  degradation and diminished agricultural capacity, along with increasing global hunger
  and food insecurity, as well as associated health risks, such as the development of

  non-communicable diseases (`NCDs').2 The health impacts of climate change vary
  depending on the geographic region concerned, as well as mediating factors such as
  socio-economic status and ethnicity, with those in low-income groups, people with
  disabilities and older people being particularly vulnerable.3

  The interactions between climate health and the social determinants of health (access
  to income, education, adequate housing and other resources necessary for good health)
  have the potential to widen inequalities in health status between the worst off and the
  best off in Australia.4 Australia is also particularly vulnerable to climate change, and in
  response to growing evidence of its health impacts, leading public health bodies have
  declared climate change a health emergency and urged governments to accelerate their
  response to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.5 In December 2023, the Australian
  Government released the National Health and Climate Strategy, which takes a whole-
  of-government approach to addressing the health impacts of climate change, as well
  as building resilience to climate change in the health system and mitigating the health
  system's climate impacts.6 The government's actions on heat and heatwaves, air
  quality, communicable disease, food and nutrition, the built environment and physical
  activity are all core public health concerns, and are therefore relevant to public health
  law -- the central focus of this chapter.

 1. Introduction

  The World Health Organization (`WHO') has identified climate change as the most
  significant 21st century threat to health.1 There is now growing action on identifying
  the links between climate change and health, raising awareness of climate change's
  significant public health threats and proposing solutions to preventing and mitigating
  the worst health impacts.2 Climate change directly impacts health through the injuries,
  illnesses and deaths associated with extreme weather events. There are also indirect
  impacts associated with the effect of ecological changes on the spread of infectious
  diseases, poorer mental health and wellbeing, and reduced air quality, as well as more
  limited access to food and drinkable water. While national health systems will need to
  implement strategies to mitigate and adapt to the health impacts of climate change, law
  is a powerful tool for advancing action on health and climate change at a population
  level.3

  This chapter focuses on public health laws -- that is, the dedicated laws concerned
  with creating the conditions for people to live healthy lives. The core functions of
  public health laws include infectious disease control, emergency preparedness and
  response, and creating public health infrastructure, policies and workforces within
  governments.4 In Australia, each state and territory has its own public health Act,5
  which follow this core model. However, reforms over the past 25 years have created
  significant differences in the scope and responsiveness of these Acts to contemporary

  threats to public health. This chapter evaluates the role of Australia's public health
  Acts in mitigating and adapting to the health impacts of climate change, comparing
  key provisions from legislation in each jurisdiction. To date, public health laws have
  played a limited role in facilitating climate change adaptation,6 although provisions
  on infectious disease control and emergency preparedness are central to managing
  critical climate change related health threats. A wide range of (interacting) laws are
  also important for preventing and mitigating the health impacts of climate change,
  including workplace health and safety laws, environment and planning laws, and
  emergency management laws operating at state and federal levels in Australia.7
  However, reforms to public health laws in some states show that pathways are opening
  for these laws to play a more central role in addressing and mitigating the health
  impacts of climate change.

 2. Environmental Change and Human Health

            Climate change can increase the number and severity of extreme weather
              events, such as bushfires and floods. These events can have an adverse
              impact on human health.

            Increasing temperatures can affect the geographic spread of diseases -- for
              example, by changing the distribution of mosquitoes and therefore of
              vector-borne diseases such as dengue fever or malaria.

  Climate change is linked to increased exposure to extreme heat, with Australians
  experiencing a 35% increase in exposure to excessive heat over the period 2002 to
  2022.1 Rapid rises in heat gain (due to hotter conditions) affect the body's ability
  to regulate internal temperature and can result in illnesses such as heat cramp, heat
  exhaustion and heatstroke.2 Exposure to high temperatures can also lead to respiratory
  distress and dehydration (which can result in kidney disease), as well as exacerbating
  pre-existing conditions such as cardiovascular disease.3

  Climate change also increases the risk of extreme weather events, including floods
  and bushfires, the latter of which are a particular concern in Australia. Between 2013
  and 2022, there was an increase in exposure to very high or extremely high bushfire
  danger, and the average annual exposure increased from 27.5 days per person to 33.6
  days per person between 2003 and 2012.4 Bushfires can significantly impact human
  health, through direct exposure to fires (causing burns and unintentional injuries) or
  smoke.5 Smoke exposure and changes in air quality have impacts on people with pre-

   existing conditions such as asthma and chronic lung disease, with other vulnerable
   groups including the elderly, young children and pregnant women.6

   Apart from bushfires, there are many other sources of air pollution, most crucially
   from burning fossil fuels for transportation, energy and industrial production.7 Over
   90% of the world's urban population is exposed to air containing pollutants at levels
   that exceed WHO's guidance.8 Chronic air pollution exposure (indoor and outdoor)
   has been identified by the WHO as the second leading cause of deaths from NCDs
   globally, being responsible for 26% of deaths from heart disease, 24% from stroke,
   43% from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and 29% from lung cancer.9 It is
   also linked to pregnancy complications and an increased incidence of low birthweight
   babies. Although Australia has a reputation for good air quality, an estimated 3,000
   people die prematurely each year from air pollution.10 Climate change is linked to other
   environmental changes that affect air quality and cause respiratory health conditions,
   such as elevated levels of urban ozone during heatwaves, which can cause difficulties
   with breathing, as well as increasing susceptibility to lung infections and aggravating
   lung diseases such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and chronic
   bronchitis.11

   Exposure to climate-related disasters, such as bushfires, can cause psychological
   trauma and is linked to mental illnesses such as post-traumatic stress disorder,
   depression and anxiety.12 Bushfires can impact the short- and long-term mental health

   Climate change will also increase longer-term weather events such as drought, which
   is anticipated to lead to loss of life, disruption of relationships and displacement,
   which are associated with depression, chronic psychological stress and generalised
   anxiety. In Australia, farmers and rural communities are at particular risk, as they are
   increasingly exposed to environmental degradation, persistent drought and weather
   disasters, which are impacting productivity in the agricultural sector and the financial
   viability of many farms.14 Climate change also impacts mental health through more
   indirect pathways. First, it impacts physical health, with physical health problems
   causally and reciprocally related to the development of mental health problems,
   particularly in vulnerable groups such as older people and Indigenous people. Second,
   it disrupts economic relationships in communities, creating economic hardship and
   subsequent poor mental health, as well disrupting social cohesion, community
   participation and social relationships, which are all important to good mental health.15
   Finally, people's awareness and anticipation of the effects of climate change can have
   negative mental health impacts, with terms such as `ecoanxiety' being used to describe
   feelings of hopelessness, anxiety and fear stemming from the awareness of climate
   change and environmental degradation.16

   A growing body of evidence links planetary warming to changes in the rate and
   distribution of infectious disease. Vector-borne infectious diseases (such as malaria
   and dengue fever), zoonotic diseases (such as H5N1 influenza carried by birds)
   and food-borne illnesses (such as salmonellosis) are highly sensitive to changes in
   environmental conditions.17 Increases in global temperature mean that mosquitos
   which act as disease vectors can live at higher latitudes and altitudes, introducing
   diseases such as malaria and dengue fever into new areas. Global warming lengthens

   increased rainfall and flooding events, combined with warmer weather, create ideal
   conditions for mosquito breeding, thus increasing the risk of disease outbreaks.19
   Increases in the density and geographic range of some species (caused by climate-
   related ecosystem changes) may lead to a rise in the emergence of novel infectious
   diseases by amplifying pathogen populations and circulating mutations.20 Greater
   global connectivity and population growth also increase the interactions between
   humans and animals that act as disease reservoirs, compounding these effects.21 As
   illustrated by COVID-19, novel infectious diseases are particularly concerning
   because the human population does not have pre-existing natural immunity.22

 3. Climate Change and Food Production

            Food production can be a contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, and
              therefore a contributor to climate change.

            Changing patterns of floods, droughts and agricultural pests because of
              climate change can also affect food production, reducing agricultural yields
              and increasing food insecurity and associated health conditions.

  Scientists, researchers and policymakers have brought increased attention to the
  complex nexus between climate change, human health, and food, energy and water
  systems, with a particular focus on nutrition and diet-related health.1 Public health
  researchers describe obesity, undernutrition and climate change as a global syndemic
  (or synergy of epidemics), as they interact with each to produce complex effects,
  share common underlying societal drivers, and affect most people in every country
  and region worldwide.2 Research has demonstrated how the dominant industrialised
  food system -- the process of growing, producing, distributing, retailing, marketing,
  consuming and disposing of food -- makes a significant contribution to anthropogenic
  planetary change, while at the same time, food production, nutrition and diet-related
  health are being negatively impacted by climate change. For example, food production
  is one of the largest contributors to climate change, with agriculture directly
  contributing approximately 15 to 23% of all greenhouse gas emissions, rising to
  approximately 30% when other food system processes and impacts (such as food
  waste) are included.3 Livestock production alone accounts for 19% of greenhouse
  gas emissions, with meat and dairy products (the consumption of which is increasing
  globally) requiring more resources and generating larger methane emissions than
  plant-based alternatives.4 The globalisation of food systems has also relied on energy

   from fossil fuels for large-scale agricultural production, as well as long-haul
   transportation of food products around the world.5 Other negative environmental
   impacts from industrialised food production include soil erosion, deforestation and
   biodiversity loss caused by large-scale land clearing and over-irrigation of rivers.6

   Simultaneously, climate change has already impacted food production and is predicted
   to have serious, long-term impacts on the resilience of the food system.7 In Australia,
   higher temperatures, changing rainfall patterns and worsening drought and flood
   conditions are having a significant impact on agricultural industries and farm
   productivity. Crop production is also being impacted by changes in the incidence of
   pests and increases in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, which
   can damage or wipe out harvests. In addition to drought and water scarcity, fruit
   and nut crops produced in warm, temperate regions are threatened by increasing
   temperatures during winter, as sufficient winter chill accumulation is necessary for
   critical milestones in crop development.8 Western Australia's farming region has
   experienced the greatest decrease in productivity in Australia due to climate
   conditions, which lowered productivity in the state by an average of 7.7% between
   2000 and 2015.9 Globally, climate change is anticipated to lead to reduced crop yields,
   as well as reductions in the micronutrient content of staple crops.10

   The decreasing supply of fresh, nutritious food will have serious implications for
   food availability and affordability, thus impacting food security, nutrition and the
   prevention of NCDs. Increases in food insecurity, nutrient deficiencies and chronic
   undernutrition are most likely to impact those already at risk of these conditions, which
   in Australia include people in lower income groups, asylum seekers and refugees,

   where it is already difficult to access affordable, good quality, fresh food.11 In low-
   and middle-income countries, severe undernutrition and malnutrition in early life
   causes stunting of physical growth as well as increased susceptibility to diarrhea and
   infections.12 Malnutrition and food insecurity are also predictors for obesity later in
   life, as well as the development of cardiovascular disease, diabetes and other metabolic
   disorders.13 Further, globalisation of the food system and other commercial drivers
   have increased the availability of, and people's exposure to, cheap, highly processed,
   energy-dense and nutrient poor foods.14 These food products are likely to dominate the
   food supply as fresh produce becomes scarcer and more expensive,15 yet consumption
   of these products is identified as a key risk factor for health conditions such as high
   blood pressure, obesity and NCDs.

                                                 KEY QUESTIONS
                      How might the climate change impacts of food systems be

                        reduced or mitigated at the stages of food growing, transport,
                        sale, consumption and disposal?
                      How is climate change likely to impact what foods people eat?
                      Will the effect of climate change on people's diets be felt equally
                        by all groups in Australia?

 4. Legal Responses to the Health Impacts of Climate
 Change

  The health impacts of climate change are predicted to create significant challenges
  for healthcare systems worldwide. Healthcare systems may need to adapt to the
  introduction of new illnesses in areas that do not have adequate surveillance and
  response infrastructure in place,1 and will need to be equipped with sufficient resources
  to meet the needs of people affected by extreme weather events, infectious disease
  outbreaks and other climate-related emergencies.2 Concerns about the capacity of
  healthcare systems to respond to the growing burden of climate change related illness
  and injuries (as well as the climate impacts of healthcare systems themselves) engages
  with health law, which is the area of law concerned with regulating healthcare systems
  and with the provision of healthcare.3 The role of law in addressing the health impacts
  of climate change at a population level engages with public health law, which is
  concerned with ensuring access to healthy living conditions, including through the
  adoption of climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies.4 Typically, public
  health laws establish public health functions at different levels of government and
  provide for inspection and regulation of facilities and local conditions posing a risk to
  public health, as well as granting significant powers in relation to infectious disease
  surveillance and control, including isolation, mandatory vaccination and treatment of
  those affected by specific infectious diseases.5 A central issue in public health law
  is balancing respect for individual rights and freedoms with the need to undertake

   infectious disease control functions that can involve the use of highly coercive
   measures,6 which was a crucial concern during the COVID-19 pandemic.7 Domestic
   public health laws are complemented by a global governance framework relevant
   to health, including international instruments such as the International Health
   Regulations8 and other policies and governance instruments developed by the WHO,
   as well as measures concerned with climate change and sustainability more broadly,
   such as the Sustainable Development Goals.9

  A. Public Health Law in Australia

             Australian public health laws date to the 19th century and were based on
               earlier British laws. While all states and territories have modernised their
               laws, some have engaged in broader reform, adopting flexible, principles-
               based approaches to regulation.

             Australian state and territory public health Acts generally assign primary
               responsibility for public health to state or territory health departments and
               set out the responsibilities of the chief health officer and other public health
               officials.

             In most states and territories, the public health Acts require public health
               planning to be undertaken at state, regional and/or local government levels.

   Each Australian state has its own public health legislation, and institutional
   arrangements for its administration. Public health laws date back to the 19th century,
   with early public health legislation originating in the UK, followed by Australia and
   New Zealand.10 The original concerns of these laws were sanitation and hygiene,

   including the removal of `nuisances' (insanitary or unhealthy environmental
   conditions), as well as the creation of penalties and offences for failing to comply
   with removal orders; the regulation or licensing of procedures or premises potentially
   presenting a risk to public health (eg hairdressers and tattooists); and infectious
   disease surveillance, reporting and control.11 Over time, these laws have expanded to
   encompass more modern threats to public health, including NCDs, and disaster and
   emergency management and response.12 Public health laws also typically establish
   state health departments as a central public health body (with a chief health officer and
   dedicated public health workforce within these departments), with some public health
   functions shared with local governments (usually exercised by environmental health
   officers at the local government level), although the exact arrangements differ between
   states.13

   The basic model of early public health legislation still informs contemporary laws in
   Australia.14 Beyond this basic model, there are significant differences in the content
   and structure of public health legislation in each Australian state. All states and
   territories have modernised their public health legislation in the past 25 years,15 but
   some states have gone further with reforms than others. Legislation in New South
   Wales, for example, is still primarily organised around specific, identified public
   health risks and infectious diseases.16 However, public health laws in other states have
   undergone more radical reform to create holistic, principles-based models, with greater

   flexibility to respond to newly emerging threats and disasters.17 The original concern
   of public health laws with `nuisances' (such as sources of water pollution or noxious
   air) mean that these laws have long been concerned with environmental protection.18
   Provisions on the surveillance and control of infectious diseases -- a centrepiece of
   public health law -- will also become increasingly important due to changes in the
   spread of infectious diseases and the rise of novel diseases linked to climate change,19
   as will provisions on emergency management.20 However, public health laws with
   broader and more general objectives, principles, public health planning provisions and
   duties not to cause public health risks (as compared to narrowly defined `nuisance'
   provisions),21 can provide a legislative framework that empowers state and local
   governments to introduce policies aimed at climate change mitigation and adaptation,
   and which promote public health.22 The next section explores how key provisions
   currently found in each state's public health legislation can and are being used for
   these purposes.

  B. The Role of Public Health Law in Addressing the Health
  Impacts of Climate Change

   i. The Objectives and Principles of Public Health Legislation

   Except for Tasmania, each state and territory public health Act contains an objectives
   provision, which lists a set of objectives relating to promoting public health and
   wellbeing and preventing disease and injury. These provisions are statements of what
   each Act aims to achieve, providing terms of reference and a guide for decision-

   making under the relevant Act.23 Some Australian public health Acts contain
   objectives relevant to climate change.24 The South Australian Act contains an object
   on ensuring a healthy environment, particularly for those `who live in disadvantaged
   communities'.25 Victoria's Act has as one object, `promoting conditions in which
   persons can be healthy',26 while the Northern Territory Act aims to `provide a flexible
   capacity to protect the health of particular individuals and communities in the Territory
   from emerging environmental conditions, or public and environmental health issues,
   that may impact on their health and wellbeing'.27

   Complementing such objectives, some state legislation contains guiding principles
   that are also relevant to climate change. The South Australian and WA Acts contain
   sustainability principles.28 For example, to further the objectives of the South
   Australian Public Health Act 2011 (SA) (and in administering the Act), s 8 provides
   that `[p]ublic health, social, economic and environmental factors should be considered
   in decision-making with the objective of maintaining and improving community well-
   being and taking into account the interests of future generations'. Section 6 also
   applies the precautionary principle (which has long informed international and
   national environmental laws) in a public health context,29 requiring that scientific
   uncertainty must not be used as a basis for postponing measures to prevent, control
   or abate material public health risks and setting out a process for ensuring that any
   action or decision-making that aims to protect public health is proportionate to the
   seriousness of the risk involved.

   ii. State Public Health Infrastructure, Workforce and Planning

   A key function of public health legislation is establishing a public health infrastructure
   and workforce within the relevant state government. These Acts also delineate public
   health functions between state and local governments.30 For example, administration
   of the NSW Public Health Act 2010 is shared between a chief health officer, who
   undertakes a range of public health functions specified under the Act, public health
   officers employed within the NSW Department of Health (`NSW Health')31 and
   `authorised officers', who may be members of NSW Health or council employees.32
   All states and territories have a chief health officer, a publicly appointed doctor and
   civil servant who provides advice to ministers and secretaries of health, and who
   speaks on the government's behalf in relation to public health issues.33 The role
   of the chief health officer varies significantly between states, with some playing a
   significant role in infectious disease control, public health emergencies and pandemic
   management,34 and others (as in WA) leading state public health planning that in other
   states fall to the minister for health (described further below).35

   Under part 15 of the Public Health Act 2016 (WA), the WA Chief Health Officer
   can conduct inquiries `into any matter relating to public health', either on their own
   initiative or at the request of the Minister.36 This provision was used to initiate the
   WA Climate Health Inquiry, which was announced in March 2019 and reviewed
   the planning and response capacity of WA's health system in relation to the health

   impacts of climate change.37 The inquiry was led by a former WA chief health
   officer, and the resulting report made recommendations for adaptation and mitigation
   policies that could be adopted by the health sector.38 Under part 7 of the Act (which
   has yet to come into force under the staged implementation of WA's new public
   health legislation), the chief health officer can also require a public health assessment
   to be undertaken of an `assessable proposal' (to be defined under accompanying
   regulations) and advise on the public health risks that may arise if the proposal is
   implemented.39 An `assessable proposal' will be one where there is overlap between
   issues of planning and development, environmental protection and public health,
   such as a mining development proposal.40 These provisions will be used for health
   impact and vulnerability assessments that will complement existing impact assessment
   and approval processes found under WA's environmental legislation,41 potentially
   enabling a comprehensive evaluation of the climate change related health and
   environmental impacts of relevant proposals.

   In addition to chief health officers, public health officers comprise a key part of
   the state public health workforce. Their powers vary, but they include ensuring
   environmental health, appointing environmental health officers within local
   government, monitoring air and water quality, drafting policies, and using
   enforcement powers under public health legislation, such as issuing improvement
   notices and enforcement notices, and undertaking investigations and seizures.42
   Researchers argue that the provisions of public health legislation grant public health
   officers numerous powers that could be used to prevent greenhouse gas emissions and
   the health harms that result.43 The kinds of functions that public health officers could

   undertake include monitoring and publicising the links between ambient temperature,
   air and water quality and health impacts; strengthening links between public health
   and other departments such as energy and environment; and ensuring a health-in-
   all-policies approach is taken in relation to policies that impact greenhouse gas
   emissions.44 However, the authors acknowledge that the role of public health officers
   is constrained by Ministerial oversight and direction and that using public health
   legislation in this manner `will require creative use of definitions and provisions within
   the Acts', as well as negotiation with the relevant health Minister.45 Accordingly, while
   public health laws empower public health officers to act on climate change, it may be
   difficult or politically infeasible for them to do so.

   Most states' public health Acts provide for public health planning, undertaken at state,
   regional and/or local government levels. For example, under s 50 of the Public Health
   Act 2011 (SA), the Minister for Health must prepare a public health plan setting
   out principles and policies for achieving the objects of, and implementing principles
   established under, the Act. The plan must (among other things) comprehensively
   assess the state of public health in South Australia, identify existing and potential
   public health risks and develop strategies for addressing and eliminating or reducing
   those risks, and identify opportunities and outline strategies for promoting public
   health.46

   State public health plans offer the opportunity to quantify climate-related public health
   risks at a state level, and to identify strategies for addressing those risks. The Victorian
   Public Health and Wellbeing Plan 2023-27 identifies `[t]ackling climate change and
   its impacts on health' as one of 10 priority areas, recognising that climate change
   mitigation and adaptation strategies can create conditions that benefit a range of
   health and wellbeing outcomes.47 For example, initiatives to increase active transport
   reduce transport-related emissions, improve air quality and produce opportunities for

   physical activity.48 The Victorian plan aims to increase action to reduce greenhouse gas
   emissions `at a scale and pace required to reduce the impacts on health and wellbeing
   and realise associated health co-benefits', create resilient and safe communities that
   can adapt to the public health impacts of climate change, and accelerate action to
   support communities to adapt to the public health impacts of climate change.49
   Targeted strategies will be implemented via related state and regional plans. Victoria's
   use of its state public health plan to identify and address the health impacts of climate
   change could be a model for similar use in other states.50

   iii. The Role of Local Governments under Public Health Legislation

   Public health laws in Victoria, WA and South Australia require local governments
   to develop their own public health plans,51 enabling local governments to act on
   climate change and its health impacts. For example, under s 26 of the Public Health
   and Wellbeing Act 2008 (Vic), councils must prepare a municipal public health and
   wellbeing plan that identifies goals and strategies for maximising the health and
   wellbeing of local communities, provides for community input in the plan's
   development and implementation, and considers the state Public Health and Wellbeing
   Plan (which identifies climate change as a priority area, as described earlier). Other
   Victorian legislation reinforces the need for local government action on climate
   change and health, with the Climate Change Act 2017 (Vic) requiring local
   governments to consider climate change when undertaking public health planning.52
   This Act integrates consideration for climate change into government decision-
   making, as well as setting a long-term greenhouse gas emissions reduction target and
   requiring the preparation of a state climate change strategy.53

   The Victorian Department of Health has prepared guidance for local governments on
   tackling climate change and its health impacts through each stage of the public health
   planning process, with specific discussion of local governments' role in emergency
   and disaster preparedness, response and recovery; environmental health services,
   surveillance and control; planning and design of local environments; healthy,
   sustainable and equitable food systems; improving mental health; and preventing
   violence.54 As an example, City of Melbourne's Municipal Public Health and
   Wellbeing Plan identifies the health impacts of climate change as a 2021-25 focus
   area,55 with the accompanying action plan identifying initiatives such as supporting
   the development of a circular economy, reducing food waste and mitigating urban
   heat.56 Under South Australia's public health legislation, local governments are also
   required to develop public health plans that consider environmental issues,57 with
   many choosing to include information on the health impacts of climate change.58

   Within local governments, environmental health officers (`EHOs') form an important
   part of the public health workforce and administer a range of health-related legislative
   functions on behalf of councils, including those under tobacco control, environmental
   protection, drinking water and food laws.59 EHOs are involved in a wide range of
   regulatory and planning activities, including recreational water monitoring,
   responding to public health complaints, legionella control and developing stormwater
   management plans.60 EHOs and environmental health teams within councils are
   already responding to the day-to-day impacts of climate change and will increasingly
   be called on to do so as these impacts increase.61 This could include, for example,

   increases in blue-green algal blooms in council-managed recreational water bodies
   due to lower water levels and increased temperatures.62 Environmental health teams
   in councils also play a leading role in emergency management preparedness, response
   and recovery associated with events such as bushfires and floods.63 However, research
   on the functions of EHOs suggest they currently play a limited role in climate change
   mitigation and planning, with these functions typically undertaken by other teams and
   specialists within council, such as environmental services.64 This may also suggest a
   lack of health input in councils' climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies.65

   There is growing recognition that EHOs are an untapped resource in climate change
   adaptation planning, given their professional skills and knowledge in environmental
   health and risk assessment.66 However, EHOs face significant hurdles in expanding
   their role into climate change adaption, including legislative constraints and a focus on
   the investigative and regulatory functions required by public health legislation, as well
   as a lack of visibility and capacity.67 Overall, local governments are a crucial first line
   of defence in local public health preparedness and response,68 but local governments'
   capacity to engage functions such as disaster preparedness and response is extremely
   variable.69

                                             KEY QUESTIONS

                  Are public health laws sufficiently responsive to modern threats
                    to public health?

                  How does the role of local government differ from that of state/
                    territory governments in addressing climate change?

                  Do current public health laws provide an adequate framework for
                    state and local government collaboration to prevent and mitigate
                    the health impacts of climate change?
                                                                                                                                                                666

 5. Proposals for Reform: What Would a Climate
 Conscious Public Health Act Look Like?

  Law is a key determinant of health, providing the framework for securing and
  improving public health.1 Although Australian public health Acts contain provisions
  for emergencies, and the International Health Regulations address public health
  emergencies of international concern, the more gradual health impacts of climate
  change may not come within the scope of these laws.2 This means that new legislative
  provisions -- or even new legislation -- may be required.

  As is clear from the above, some Australian public health laws do contain some
  provisions that are relevant to climate change. However, not all states and territories
  have these provisions and where they do exist, they vary between jurisdictions.
  Inclusion of climate change within the objects of the Act can articulate the importance
  of this issue. Some Acts, such as the South Australian Public Health Act 2011 (SA)
  also set out principles, such as sustainability, that can assist with interpretation of the
  legislation. Given the role of public health officials in administering public health
  within the jurisdiction, the inclusion of relevant provisions can enable public health
  officials to act in response to emerging health threats, although we note that legislation
  should also provide for assessment of risks and protection of human rights if restrictive
  measures are required. Finally, climate change is an emerging challenge and its public
  health consequences may change over time. Any legislation will need to be flexible
  and responsive to new and emerging public health needs.

                  Should public health laws include specific provisions related to

6. Conclusion

Climate change presents critical challenges for human health, through increased
frequency and severity of severe weather events and associated injuries and poor
health, growing rates of infectious disease and the emergence of novel diseases,
and increased food insecurity through reduced agricultural yields due to droughts or
floods, with flow-on effects for nutrition and diet-related health. As an area of law
that specifically engages with human health (at a population level), public health law
potentially has an important role to play in addressing the impacts of climate change
and protecting human health.

                                                KEY POINTS

                  Public health laws are focused on promoting public health and
                    preventing disease and injury. The public health Acts in some
                    states and territories contain provisions setting out the objects of
                    the Act that specifically address environmental health, or guiding
                    principles that address sustainability. These provisions may be
                    relevant to addressing climate change.

                  State and territory public health legislation sets out the public
                    health functions of state and local governments (which includes
                    public health planning), as well as the functions and powers of
                    public health officers. These functions and powers can be used
                    to introduce policies and actions that aim to mitigate or adapt to
                    climate change, and which address the health impacts of climate
                    change.

                  Local governments can play an important role in public health,
                    with legislation in some states requiring local governments to
                    develop public health plans. These plans could be used to
                    address climate change (and some local governments are doing
                    so already).

                  Public health laws can potentially address the health impacts of

                                                                 668
669

                    climate change. However, there is significant variation between
                    state and territory laws, and law reform may be required to
                    include provisions explicitly addressing climate change within
                    Australia's public health Acts.

Consumer law is one way in which the law supports and enables consumerist
economic and social systems that contribute to the production of greenhouse gas
(GHG) emissions. Nevertheless, climate advocates and leaders are now calling on
consumer law to be a force for positive climate action by ensuring that consumers are
given sufficient meaningful and accurate information about the climate credentials of
different products to enable climate conscious consumption. As a result, consumer
law action against greenwashing (deceptive advertising about environmental

                                                                 672

credentials or actions) is now a priority for consumer regulators and for public
interest litigation by environmental advocacy groups.

Section 1 of this chapter shows how consumer law has contributed to the climate
crisis by supporting consumerism. It then shows how at the same time climate
conscious consumption is seen as a solution to the climate crisis. Section 2 sets
out how both the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC),
Australia's lead consumer law enforcement agency, and environmental advocacy
groups are using the prohibition on misleading and deceptive conduct (and related
provisions) in the Australian Consumer Law to prevent climate greenwashing and
support climate conscious consumption. Section 3 of the chapter concludes by
suggesting some stronger options for using law and regulation to prevent
greenwashing and to support the transition to a climate safe future that do not put all
the responsibility on climate conscious consumers alone.

                                             KEY QUESTIONS

                  Do you see consumer law more as responsible for promoting
                    over-consumption and thus contributing to climate change or
                    more as a tool for empowering climate action by providing
                    consumers with information about the environmental credentials
                    of different products and services?

                  How can regulators and activists use consumer law to contest
                    climate greenwashing?

                  What are some reasons for prioritising consumer law action
                    against climate greenwashing within legal responses to climate
                    change?

                  What are some counterproductive effects of using consumer law
                    action against greenwashing within legal responses to climate
                    action?

                  What kinds of new laws might be introduced to prevent
                    greenwashing?

 1. Australian Consumer Law, Marketing Claims and
 Climate Change Impacts

  Consumer law facilitates and encourages consumer purchasing by giving individuals
  certain consumer rights against traders and guaranteeing certain protections against
  physical and economic harm. Specific laws protect consumers against identified risks
  when they purchase certain goods and services such as food, pharmaceuticals,
  financial services and so on. In addition, the Australian Consumer Law (ACL)
  contains a set of general guarantees and protections that apply across every area of
  consumption.1 The ACL prohibits misleading or deceptive conduct and unfair trading
  practices, including certain unfair contract terms. It also contains protections against
  unsafe or faulty goods and services. In this chapter, our focus will be mainly on section
  18 of the ACL, the prohibition on misleading and deceptive conduct, and associated
  prohibitions on false and misleading representations (section 29) and other misleading
  conduct (sections 33 and 34) (see Box 1).

  Consumer law is not directly concerned with environmental protection. Rather it is
  one way in which the law supports and enables the economic and social systems of
  consumption that contribute to the level of production of greenhouse gases (GHG)
  driving the climate crisis. The historical development of consumer rights and
  protections is closely linked with the rise of `consumerism', which is the idea that
  people should pursue their individual interests and realise their personal identity and
  social status through the consumption of various goods and services.2 Fundamental to
  liberal social orders and capital-based economies, consumerism sees it as a significant,
  even dominant, aspect of people's `civic' duty to contribute to economic productivity
  and growth by earning and consuming.3 The market is expected to allocate goods and

  services effectively and efficiently.4 Marketing, including green marketing, which will
  be the main focus of this chapter, promotes consumerism by driving continued demand
  for products and conveying cultural ideas about how consuming particular products
  will enhance one's life and identity.

  Consumerism contrasts with ideals of citizenship that emphasise the responsibilities
  of individuals to contribute to the social order through political and social action and
  not just economic activity. These responsibilities of citizenship include participation
  in democratic governance processes, respect for the dignity and rights of all human
  beings, and increasingly the protection of the environment and other species.5 The
  narrow focus of consumer law on the rights of individuals as consumers does nothing
  to address the need to regulate systems of unsustainable production and consumption
  in the collective interest, for example by placing limits on the production and
  marketing of GHG-intensive products like petrol vehicles, air travel, single use
  plastics, fast fashion, meat and dairy products, and many household products and
  appliances.

  This distinction between consumerism and citizenship is blurred by the commercially
  promoted and widely held belief that consumers can meaningfully tackle the climate
  crisis by choosing climate-friendly products. For example, many household products
  now carry energy ratings which encourage consumers to buy the most energy efficient
  refrigerator, airlines offer carbon offsets as an add-on to their flights, and many
  products now advertise themselves as `climate-active' or `climate-neutral' or make
  other environmental and climate related claims. Underlying such marketing efforts
  is the idea that consumers can `vote with their dollar' and that the tension between
  consumerism and environmental responsibilities can be resolved by being a climate
  conscious consumer. The claim here is that consumers' purchasing choices will shape

  the market to drive positive change for the collective environmental good:6 the more
  consumers purchase climate-friendly products, the more businesses are incentivised
  to take climate action to attract more consumers, thus driving climate action through
  climate conscious consumption. And vice versa, the more that businesses advertise
  their products as climate friendly, the more consumers will be informed and make
  more climate conscious choices. Climate conscious consumerism therefore relies
  heavily on green marketing.

  In order to assess the strengths and limitations of this approach, we therefore need
  to examine the role of consumer law in prohibiting false and misleading marketing.
  Climate conscious consumerism relies on consumers having meaningful and accurate
  information about the climate credentials of different products and services to inform
  their choices. In this ideal of environmentally responsible consumption, consumer law
  therefore has an important role to play in ensuring that the marketing information
  consumers receive is accurate and meaningful. False, misleading or deceptive
  marketing claims about the environmental credentials of a product, service, brand or
  company is `greenwashing'. Where the false, misleading or deceptive environmental
  claims relate to the climate, we call this `climate greenwashing'. Box 1 sets out some
  of the ways greenwashing can breach consumer law.

  Climate greenwashing weakens the incentives for business to reduce emissions, as
  they can make climate claims and then benefit from increased sales to climate
  conscious consumers without having to significantly change the way they produce
  goods and services. Because many consumers are prepared to seek out and pay
  more for climate-friendly products and are willing to publicly criticise businesses
  which do not act on climate change, the incentives for business to increase profits
  by greenwashing are high. Greenwashing also has a political effect. As it becomes
  more obvious that strong climate action is needed, greenwashing can stave off stricter
  government regulation and public concern by making it appear that businesses are
  voluntarily doing more to mitigate and adapt to the climate crisis than they really are.
  As a result, the evidence shows that greenwashing is frequent and ubiquitous.7

  As the climate crisis worsens and more businesses make claims about their climate
  friendliness, regulators and climate advocacy bodies are turning to consumer law to
  protect against greenwashing. In the following section we set out how the Australian
  Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) and environmental advocacy
  groups have used the ACL to combat climate greenwashing. The Australian Securities
  and Investments Commission (ASIC) is also taking steps to prevent greenwashing
  regarding financial services using similar prohibitions.8

               BOX 1: GREENWASHING AND AUSTRALIAN CONSUMER LAW
         Greenwashing refers to marketing claims or conduct concerning the
         environmental credentials of a product or service, category, brand or trader
         that mislead or are likely to mislead people because they are untrue,
         unevidenced or unclear.
         Climate greenwashing occurs where the marketing claims or conduct
         relate to the climate credentials of the product or service, category, brand
         or trader, and may relate to either climate mitigation or climate
          adaptation credentials.
         Greenwashing may breach a number of provisions of the ACL, including:
         Section 18 which states that `A person must not, in trade or commerce,
         engage in conduct that is misleading or deceptive or is likely to mislead
         or deceive.'
         Section 29 which details various prohibited false and misleading
         representations, and sections 33 and 34 prohibit misleading conduct
         concerning `the nature, the characteristics, the suitability for their
         purpose' of good and services.

                                             KEY QUESTIONS

                  What are some examples of marketing claims regarding climate
                    change with which you are familiar?

                  How accurate are these claims? In answering this question,
                    consider how can you assess their accuracy? For example, can
                    you identify any evidence the company has provided to support
                    the claim?

                  Why do businesses make claims about climate change in their
                    marketing?

                  What social, economic and demographic factors might influence
                    different individuals' willingness and capacity to purchase
                    products that claim to be better for the climate or the
                    environment?
                                                                                                                                                                680

 2. Consumer Law Actions Against Climate-Related
 Greenwashing

  Because climate greenwashing is misleading and deceptive conduct, it contravenes
  the ACL (see Box 1). These provisions can be enforced by the ACCC and state and
  territory consumer bodies. They can also form the basis for civil action by private
  litigants such as consumers, advocacy organisations and other businesses. In this
  section we set out three different ways in which regulators can make a legal argument
  for greenwashing and show how difficult they can be to prove. This shows that
  the idea of climate conscious consumerism may be difficult to enact in practice if
  consumer law cannot be successfully used to combat greenwashing. We will then
  examine the way that environmental advocacy groups are using the ACL in a more
  activist way against greenwashing.

 2.1 Three Ways to Prove Climate Greenwashing is
 Misleading and Deceptive Conduct

  Greenwashing actions in consumer law typically include allegations that a trader has
  made a claim about the environmental credentials of its products, services or broader
  activities that was either (1) false; or misleading or deceptive because it (2) omitted
  important information or (3) used vague or ambiguous terms. There is no need to prove
  intention to tell a lie (as the definitions in Box 1 indicate). These actions depend on
  whether the claim was false, misleading or likely to mislead the public, or a relevant
  section of the public.1

  An example of successful greenwashing action, based on making false environmental
  claims, is the successful Australian enforcement action in the global `Dieselgate'
  scandal. Volkswagen (VW) had intentionally designed and fitted their diesel cars with
  a `defeat device' that enabled the cars to meet government limits on nitrous oxide (a
  GHG) emissions when tested in the lab, but then allowed them to emit more nitrogen
  oxide on the road, enhancing performance. This affected more than 10 million VW and

                                                                   680

  Audi cars globally, and tens of thousands in Australia. Regulators around the world
  took action. In Australia, VW agreed to a $75 million civil fine for misleading and
  deceptive conduct, which the Federal Court increased to $125 million.2

  The VW case succeeded because the intentional misrepresentation had already been
  discovered in the US and overseas regulators had already taken enforcement action,
  adducing much of the evidence needed for the Australian case.3 In most cases,
  however, it is much more difficult for a consumer or regulator to access internal
  corporate information about the environmental impact of products to know whether
  a claim is false or not. It is also very rare to find `smoking gun' evidence that a
  company intentionally misled regulators and the public, which would make their moral
  culpability obvious.

  A (rare) example of successful action against climate greenwashing by omitting
  important information was an advertising campaign by global banking giant HSBC
  in the lead up to a meeting of country leaders regarding climate change in Glasgow.
  HSBC put posters and billboards up all over Glasgow highlighting their intention to
  provide up to USD1 trillion in financing for clients to transition to `net zero' and
  plant 2 million trees (see Figure 2). HSBC did not disclose on their posters that they
  were also still financing billions for fossil fuel and other emissions-heavy industries
  and were committed to do so in some cases up until 2040. Activists made dozens
  of complaints to the UK Advertising Standards Agency (ASA), arguing that HSBC's
  billboards amounted to misleading greenwashing.

  The ASA agreed that the ads gave consumers the misleading impression that HSBC's
  climate commitments included immediate divestment from emissions-heavy industry:

              Despite the initiatives highlighted in the ads ... HSBC was continuing to
              significantly finance investments in businesses and industries that emitted

            notable levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses [and would be
            until 2040]. We did not consider consumers would know that was the case.
            We concluded that the ads omitted material information and were therefore
            misleading.4

Although HSBC's climate approach was detailed on its website, consumers would
have had to follow the scan code on the billboard to find the information and be
sufficiently educated about climate policy and investment strategies to correctly
interpret the disclosures.

The ASA ordered that HSBC stop its advertising campaign and ensure any future
environmental claims were `adequately qualified and did not omit material
information about its contribution to carbon dioxide and greenhouse gas emissions'.5
No penalties were levied as the ASA is a self-regulatory body with no power to issue
fines or other punishments. This form of climate greenwashing (by omission) remains
very common, including by banks and superannuation (or pension) and investment
funds.6

  Enforcement action against vague or ambiguous green claims can be particularly
  difficult. Generic terms like `clean', `green', `sustainable', `bio', `pure', `eco' or `eco-
  friendly' and `for the planet' are common in green marketing.7 Such terms are used
  with little consistency or explanation. They are often used in combination with colours
  (green, ocean blue or earthy beige), nature imagery and even environmental emojis
  (such as green ticks, recycling logos or suns). These aesthetic elements are known
  as `executional' greenwashing since the greenwash is in the way the ad format and
  images have been creatively executed rather than in the textual claims. Research has
  shown that executional greenwashing can be even more effective at manipulating

   consumer responses than functional textual claims because it appeals to consumers'
   emotional connection to nature and desire to do the right thing.8

   The ACCC's first greenwashing action was regarding vague and ambiguous claims
   and occurred in 1992.9 It was against Continental, which was Australia's largest
   manufacturer of paper cups. The ACCC argued that Continental had falsely claimed
   that their poly-coated cups were `environmentally friendly' and `recyclable', and this
   was further inferred through a pine tree logo.10 However, at that time there was no
   facility in Australia for recycling these cups. Continental did not admit liability but did
   sign a settlement with the ACCC (known as an `enforceable undertaking') agreeing
   not to continue making these claims.

   Claims made regarding the sustainability of plastics is highly relevant to climate
   change as most plastic is produced from fossil fuels, and the small number of plastics
   made from plants still relies on resource-intensive agriculture (including GHG-
   intensive inputs). Despite the action against Continental for such claims, plastic
   packaging and containers nowadays commonly claim to be `recyclable',
   `biodegradable' or `plant based'. Yet plant-based plastics (or bioplastics) can still be
   GHG intensive. Likewise, claims regarding a product being recyclable, compostable
   or biodegradable rely on a consumer having access to the right kind of waste service,
   which is very rare (unless the product says it is home compostable). For instance, only
   green bins at houses in South Australia, and a few other councils, currently accept
   specific kinds of compostable packaging.11

   The proliferation of these kinds of claims on plastic packaging reflects how difficult
   it can be for the ACCC to take enforcement action for greenwashing. Traders can,

   for instance, argue that their use of terms like `compostable', `recyclable' or
   `biodegradable' are accurate in principle even though in reality their products are
   far more likely to go to landfill.12 For example, the ACCC lost a case concerning
   disposable picnicware that was labelled `eco', `biodegradable' and `compostable'. The
   court accepted the defendant's argument that the products had at the time of sale the
   quality of biodegradability, even though in practice consumers could not rely on this
   quality because the picnicware would only biodegrade in specific circumstances in a
   special facility.13 Consumers expect such green claims to be used consistently, reliably
   and in a way that has been checked and verified by a trusted authority.14 But the very
   vagueness and ambiguity of these terms means that business can often escape liability
   for greenwashing.

  2.2 The Need for a More Proactive Public Interest Approach
  to Regulatory Action Against Greenwashing

   When the regulator loses a greenwashing case, such as the case concerning `eco'
   picnicware, businesses are effectively given more license to make meaningless claims.
   Even when the regulator wins and obtains a hefty financial penalty, they have only
   won one prosecution regarding an individual business and a specific representation or
   claim. A more general deterrent effect on greenwashing conduct is more difficult to
   achieve. The more likely result is a `discourse-based arms-race'15 in which knocking
   out one term becomes a reason to invent another. This sort of reactive regulation
   also relies on a consumer, non-government organisation (NGO) or competitor waiting
   until a representation is made, then identifying a false representation, complaining to a
   regulator and compiling enough evidence to prove it was false. This sets up a game of

   `whack a mole', going after claim after claim serially, making it impossible to address
   all the instances of greenwashing, given how frequent it is.

   The ACCC's enforcement against product packaging marketed as made from `ocean
   plastic' is a good example of the limits of consumer law enforcement for climate
   action. The ACCC took action against a yoghurt company for claiming its containers
   were `100% ocean plastic', which gave the impression that `the recycled plastic waste
   was collected directly from the ocean'.16 The plastic used in the tubs was `collected
   within 50 km of the shoreline in regions where waste management is inexistent or
   inefficient'.17 After the enforcement action, the company now clarify their containers
   are made from `ocean bound plastic'. The images in Figure 3 show the before and after
   packaging.

   Arguably, this is a slight change that leaves many consumers believing that the plastic
   was picked up from rivers and beaches rather than potentially tens of kilometres away.
   Furthermore, the consumer is still left with an impression that plastics recycling is
   a viable option for dealing with plastics waste when, in reality, recycling plastics is
   costly, resource intensive, causes pollution and cannot be done indefinitely on the
   same plastics (like it can for some other materials). This is partly why experts call
   for a focus on reducing plastic production and consumption rather than recycling.18
   Hence, tweaking one claim does not address the broader ways in which marketing on
   such products individually and across multiple products is misleading the consumer
   regarding the existence of environmental solutions.

   In response to these problems with the reactive case-by-case approach to
   greenwashing, regulators including the ACCC are developing a more proactive
   approach to greenwashing. The ACCC's Making Environmental Claims: A Guide
   for Business includes eight principles aimed at guiding businesses about how to
   substantiate and evidence environmental claims and avoid greenwashing.19 In Box 2
   we show how these eight principles apply to climate-related claims specifically.
   Nevertheless, it may remain difficult to take enforcement action against climate
   greenwashing claims that a business is or will be `net zero', `carbon neutral' or
   `climate friendly' unless there are established science-based standards against which
   to judge them. Section 4 of the ACL does provide that claims about the future,
   which could include a business that will be net zero in the future, will be assumed
   to be misleading or deceptive unless there is substantial evidence to back these
   claims up.20 What should count as appropriate evidence of climate commitment and
   how to measure emissions is often at issue when environmental advocates argue
   that businesses are greenwashing (see examples in Box 3). Governments failing to
   introduce standards to clarify these matters is a key barrier, and it reflects how

20. But note that the courts can ultimately determine what is a future representation and what is not a future representation.
       In the Woolworths case discussed above (see n 21 and accompanying text), the ACCC argued that the claims were
       representations about the future but the court disagreed, leading to the ACCC's loss in the case.
                                                                                                                                                             688

governments also benefit from being able to make vague claims about their own
climate credentials.

                1. Businesses should be clear when they are using offsets rather
                    than reducing emissions from operations.

                2. Aspirational claims about future plans to reduce emissions or
                    achieve `net zero' targets should be backed up with an actionable
                    plan to realistically achieve the stated goal.

                3. Emission reductions should be calculated using accepted
                    methodologies, and records of the calculations should be kept.

                4. Businesses should avoid making claims about emissions as if
                    they apply to the whole lifecycle or the product and instead be
                    specific about where emissions are actually being reduced.

                5. There should be information readily available that quantifies the
                    emissions that are offsets and puts this in the context of the total
                    emissions associated with operations.

                6. Businesses should avoid broad or unqualified claims or claims
                    that only provide partial information -- for example, `renewable'
                    or `produced with renewable energy' -- without additional
                    information.

                7. Businesses should be transparent about what type of emissions
                    the claim relates to (e.g. carbon dioxide)

                                             KEY QUESTIONS

                1. Using the claim you identified previously, or choosing a new
                    example, consider what a business would need to do to comply
                    with the principles in Box 2. What kinds of evidence would they
     689

                        need to support the claim? How would you, as a consumer, know
                        if they were complying with these principles?
                   2. Consider a situation where the ACCC has commenced
                        proceedings against another company for making a similar
                        representation that the product was `50% ocean plastic' along
                        with pictures of waves, which the company later altered to `50%
                        ocean bound plastic'.

                                a. Do you think the ACCC would be able to convince the
                                    court that both claims were misleading and deceptive?

                                b. Would the court consider the fact that Australia only
                                    recycles a small amount of plastic?

                                c. How likely do you think the ACCC is to succeed in court
                                    if the case were fully argued?

  2.3 Consumer Law Enforcement Against Greenwashing as
  Environmental Activist Public Interest Litigation?

   To reveal the extent of greenwashing to the public and put pressure on governments
   to be more proactive regarding greenwashing, environmental activist groups are also
   using consumer law to draw attention to greenwashing by businesses, including how
   businesses use greenwashing to delay serious climate action. The Environmental
   Defenders Office (EDO), an environmental advocacy focused community legal
   centre, has been particularly active in filing complaints with the ACCC, ASIC and
   other government authorities on behalf of various NGOs and citizen clients alleging
   climate greenwashing in breach of consumer law. (Box 3 gives some examples of their
   climate greenwashing complaints.) The EDO has released the Misleading or Deceptive
   Conduct a Greenwashing Handbook: A Legal Guide to Greenwashing to help clients
   create new complaints.21 This strategy puts pressure on government regulators to keep
   prioritising greenwashing education and enforcement.

                                                                                                                                                                  690

   In addition to encouraging regulators to use their enforcement powers against climate
   greenwashing, some environmental activist groups have also commenced their own
   civil actions against misleading climate claims by corporations. For example, the EDO
   on behalf of the Australian Centre for Corporate Responsibility is suing Santos for
   `clean energy' claims that assume gas is better for the climate than oil and future `net
   zero' promises reliant on what the EDO argues is an overly optimistic interpretation of
   the potential of carbon capture and storage.22 At the time of writing, the case has just
   begun to be heard by the Federal Court.

   The ACCC actions discussed above are largely aimed at ensuring clear information
   about each product to support individual consumer choice. The strategies of
   environmental NGOs, however, go further and are intended to delegitimise the climate
   claims of high-emissions industries such as fossil fuels, aviation, petrol vehicles and
   fertilisers.23 They seek to reveal a range of greenwashing tactics used by companies
   to avoid or delay serious climate action, such as vague net-zero claims. These tactics
   include a focus on future unproven technologies and a reliance on carbon offsets rather
   than reducing emissions directly from business activities. In regard to carbon offsets,
   they are further limited by significant integrity issues and difficulties in ensuring long-
   term storage of carbon in soils and trees.24

           BOX 3: EXAMPLES OF CLIMATE CLAIMS AND GREENWASHING
             COMPLAINTS BY THE EDO TO THE ACCC, ASIC AND OTHER
                                        GOVERNMENT BODIES

      Climate Credentials of Gas as Energy Source

       Australian Gas Network's (AGN) `renewable' gas campaign suggests
       hydrogen and biomethane are low or no-carbon alternatives that are
       compatible with existing gas infrastructure.

       EDO greenwashing complaint: These energy sources often use fossil
       fuels in their production and existing infrastructure and household
       appliances are not generally compatible.

       Santos advertises its gas project (i.e. mining) as essential for providing
       electricity and gas in NSW.

       EDO greenwashing complaint: NSW's electricity is mostly not generated
       with gas.

       `Net Zero', `Climate Active' and `Climate Neutral' Claims

       Toyota makes various climate claims such as `Toyota will aim for zero
       CO2 emissions ...' and `We've made a vehicle that produces less CO2
       than a human produces on a run. It's in our nature to work towards a
       cleaner tomorrow.'

       EDO greenwashing complaint: Toyota lacks clear plans to transition to
       net zero and has lobbied against emissions standards, and the types of
       vehicles Toyota is producing (hybrids) do not create significantly less
       emissions than petrol cars.

       Etihad Airways states `Flying shouldn't cost the Earth' and `Net zero
       emissions by 2050'.

       EDO greenwashing complaint: Flying does have a significant
       environmental impact currently and, according to its public plans and
       general technological capabilities, Etihad does not have a reasonable plan
       in place to achieve net zero and seems more likely to increase emissions
       based on current plans.

       Glencore states it aims to be net zero by 2050.

       EDO greenwashing complaint: Glencore is expanding its coal production
       and has no reasonable plans to be net zero.

         Carbon Neutral Claims

           The Climate Active trademark program, which was developed by the
           Australian government, makes carbon neutral claims.
           EDO greenwashing complaint: Businesses can use the trademark even
           where they rely on carbon offsets rather than reducing emissions from their
           own operations, and only certain parts of the business may actually be
           certified.
           NeuRizer claim they are `Australia's first carbon neutral producer of urea
           fertiliser'.
           EDO greenwashing complaint: The company relies on fossil fuels to
           produce the fertiliser and relies on offsets rather than reducing emissions
           from their own .

   The strategy of environmental NGOs like the EDO's clients may be regarded as
   strategic public interest litigation, `intended to achieve change to law and policy
   that will benefit individuals and communities beyond those directly involved in the
   campaign'.25 It may not be significant that such a case succeeds on technical legal
   grounds. Rather the charge of `greenwashing' is designed to change public and policy
   perceptions of the industry to argue against their social licence26 to operate, and to
   extend the legal and societal interpretations of what counts as unlawful greenwashing.
   Accordingly, activist litigation against greenwashing may be most impactful where it
   is supported by political and media campaigns to pressure corporate and state actors to
   take real and meaningful action on climate mitigation and adaptation.

   However, activist strategies by civil society and regulatory action continue to rely
   heavily on existing consumer law. As we saw in section 1, consumer law exists largely

   and social change needed to meaningfully mitigate and adapt to the climate crisis, nor
   to promote sustainable consumption levels.27

 3. Future Trajectories in Australian Consumer Law
 and Green Claims

  Successful action against greenwashing relies on proving that business marketing
  breached the general provisions in the ACL, such as those in Box 1. Such action can
  only be taken after the claims have been made and relies on evidence that they are false
  or misleading in some way. Given the prevalence of greenwashing and the resources
  required to take enforcement action against them, many potentially false or misleading
  claims may remain unaddressed.

  An alternative approach is to seek to prevent greenwashing in the first place. We now
  discuss three main ways to prevent greenwashing.

 3.1 Prohibiting Marketing by GHG-Intensive Industries

  The first option to prevent greenwashing is to prohibit emissions-intensive industries
  from marketing their services and products at all. Some stakeholders, including the
  United Nations (UN), have called for such prohibitions.1 The argument in support
  of this option is that it is illogical and inherently greenwashing for industries such
  as fossil fuels producers and retailers to be allowed to promote themselves when
  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change evidence and global climate
  commitments make clear that these industries must radically reduce or transition to
  non-fossil fuel alternatives (such as renewable energy or electric vehicles). The only
  reason for such industries to advertise is to expand their market or to extend their
  social licence. Proponents of such bans draw an analogy with big tobacco and argue

   695

  that industries that profit from actively destroying the climate necessary for life and
  health should not have any more licence to market themselves than tobacco has to
  market its products. Figure 1 at the top of this chapter is an example of a banner
  promoting the idea that fossil fuel marketing is inherently misleading and should be
  banned. Figure 4 below is a campaign poster seeking to promote the message that
  fossil fuel car advertising should be banned.
  In response to pressure from civil society, several local government authorities have
  used their powers to determine what can be advertised on billboards and council
  property to implement such bans.2 Some art galleries, newspapers and sporting bodies
  have also agreed to not accept fossil fuel sponsorship.3 Any more encompassing ban
  would require an amendment to the ACL or the introduction of new legislation.4

 3.2 Proactive Regulatory Standards for Substantiating
 Climate Marketing Claims

  A second option for preventing greenwashing would be for legislation and policy
  to define in advance precisely what environmental and climate claims can be made
  in what circumstances and with what substantiating evidence and auditing. Green
  marketing that did not comply with those standards would be prohibited. This
  approach is consistent with the UN's recommendations for ensuring net-zero pledges
  from companies are credible and can be used to hold companies accountable.5
  Developing such standards and mandating requirements around certain claims is
  similar to the more proactive approach taken by the ACCC when it developed and

      United Nations' High-Level Expert Group on the Net Zero Emissions Commitments of Non-State Entities, 2022)

  updated its guidance to businesses about avoiding misleading and deceptive claims
  (see section 2.2).

  The European Union (EU) provides a good example of how Australia might do this.
  The EU has reformed its consumer law to make explicit that certain environmental and
  climate claims are prohibited. It also introduced laws regarding the kinds of evidence
  required to substantiate those environmental claims that are allowed. Box 4 provides a
  summary.

  A strength of the EU approach is that it directly targets claims regarding climate
  change that are often misleading and requires companies be clear about what
  emissions they have reduced from their own operations and what emissions they are
  offsetting. This approach could reduce climate greenwashing and drive companies to
  achieve genuine progress towards decarbonisation of their operations.

  The EU approach, however, still leaves scope for climate greenwashing. For instance,
  the public may not be aware of the limitations of offsetting and potentially trust
  marketing claims that rely on offsetting. Companies may also carefully select and
  manipulate evidence used to support claims. Moreover, the EU's reliance on third-
  party certification schemes can also lead to climate greenwashing, given the
  weaknesses of the standards and accountability mechanisms in some schemes and
  the commercial interest in accrediting more products.6 The EU approach still allows
  climate neutral claims even though no product is climate neutral. Finally, the approach
  of developing higher standards for environmental claims, and prohibiting generic
  terms, does not address marketing as a key driver of consumption patterns associated
  with environmental challenges like climate change.

 3.3 Looking Beyond Greenwashing to Reductions in
 Production and Consumption

  A third way to respond to greenwashing is to address the underlying problem of
  marketing promoting unsustainable consumerism and delaying action to reduce GHG
  emissions from production. High-income countries need to significantly decrease

  GHG emissions, which means decreasing production and consumption of goods and
  services that are emission intensive like fossil fuel powered energy, meat, oil,
  petroleum-based plastics, synthetic fertilisers and petrol vehicles, and transitioning
  industry and individuals away from reliance on these products.7

                           BOX 4: EU RESPONSES TO GREENWASHING

         The EU Unfair Commercial Practices Directive will prohibit:

                    carbon neutral or similar claims when they rely on offsets and
                      generic environmental claims (like `climate friendly') when the
                      trader is unable to show `excellent performance'; and

                    the making of environmental claims related to future
                      environmental performance (like net zero 2030) without `clear,
                      objective, publicly available and verifiable commitments',
                      contained in an adequately detailed and feasible implementation
                      plan that is regularly verified by an independent third party.

Climate claims on products and services sends the message to citizens that climate
change is already being solved through voluntary market actions and individual
consumption choices, as opposed to collective political, economic and legal change.
When people are surrounded by messages about how companies are helping solve
the climate crisis, it weakens the pressure on governments and companies to make
the urgent and radical changes needed and creates flawed understandings about how
to combat climate change. Enforcement and activism against marketing and
greenwashing claims (as described in the previous two subsections) can be helpful.
However, focusing attention on greenwashing enforcement may distract attention and
resources away from consideration of the ways in which governments, communities
and industries should transition to a low-GHG-emissions economy and reduce
production and consumption overall. This will require transition plans for all industries
to move away from reliance on fossil fuels and other emissions-intensive practices,
realigning of tax incentives and subsidies to achieve a low-carbon society, caps on
production of some goods and services and prohibitions of certain components as well
as public campaigns.

4. Conclusion

This chapter has argued that one of the main ways consumer law can help address the
climate crisis is through consumer law enforcement action and civil society activism
against greenwashing. However, the use of consumer law to respond to individual
instances of greenwashing is not enough to address the link between marketing and
the ubiquitous culture of consumerism that contributes to the climate crisis. This
is because marketing continually reinforces a need to buy more and reinforces
consumption choices as a way to express one's identity and spend leisure time.
Marketing also reinforces the assumption that business can voluntarily act to solve the
climate crisis if individual consumers make the right choices, thereby delaying more
definitive, and urgently needed, community and government led action to transition
industry away from GHG-intensive production and consumption. The chapter
concludes by reflecting on ways that law and policy might prevent greenwashing and
support the transformation of production and consumption practices towards a climate-
safe future.

                                             KEY QUESTIONS
                  Do regulators and NGOs have the resources, access and

                    expertise required to take action against a sufficient number of
                    greenwashing cases to make a real difference?
                  Should governments ban marketing on GHG-intensive products?
                    If so, what products would you choose?
                  How could regulators design a ban on the marketing of GHG-
                    intensive products?
                  What other steps could activists and governments take to ensure
                    that climate-related marketing claims do not hinder the broader
                    societal transformation required to mitigate and adapt to climate
                    change?

                                                                 700

Housing has a substantial impact on climate change through its initial construction
and ongoing use. As a result, concerted efforts are being made to make all aspects of
housing more sustainable. There are a range of ways to do this, and the provision of
`sustainability infrastructure' is key.

                                                                 702

Strata title is the fastest growing form of housing title in Australia, and it offers
opportunities for the collective ownership and management of more extensive
sustainability infrastructure than freestanding homes. However, strata title and the
obligations it imposes also create risks for owners and tenants. This chapter sets out
the key concepts in strata title so that climate conscious lawyers can harness strata title
for the benefit of their clients and the environment.

                                             KEY QUESTIONS
       What role do private land titles and property doctrines play in facilitating
       sustainability infrastructure?
       How does strata and community title facilitate the ownership and
       management of collectively owned sustainability infrastructure?
       What risks do complex land titles create for owners and tenants?

 1. Introduction

  Housing has a substantial impact on climate change both through its initial
  construction and ongoing use. The Green Building Council of Australia estimates that
  the materials and activities for the construction of a typical Australian home are equal
  to total upfront carbon of 185 tonnes of CO equivalent.1 The Climateworks Centre
  estimates that the ongoing use of Australian homes contributes more than 10% of
  Australia's total carbon emissions.2 As a result, concerted efforts are being made to
  make all aspects of housing more sustainable.

  There are a range of ways to do this, and the provision of `sustainability infrastructure'
  is key. Sustainability infrastructure is any energy, water or other infrastructure that
  produces long-term environmental gains -- for example, water tanks, food gardens,

  photovoltaic (solar) panels, batteries and EV chargers, along with an unknown number
  of future technologies. Sustainability infrastructure can be included in the initial
  construction of housing, or it can be retrofitted into existing housing. The latter can be
  more complex, but it is important as the majority of our housing stock is already built.

  Sustainability infrastructure starts out life as personal property, but if it is attached
  to a building or land, as is often necessary for its use, according to the doctrine of
  fixtures it will become part of the land and belong to the landowner.3 Consequently,
  landownership is central.

  Legally, there are two main forms of landownership for Australian housing: non-
  strata title and strata title.4 While Australian cities are still dominated by non-strata
  housing (typically freestanding houses, along with traditional semidetached houses
  and terraces), strata title is the fastest growing form of property title in Australia
  today. This is a result of urban consolidation policies which aim to fit new housing
  within existing city footprints, thereby minimising urban sprawl,5 and increasingly, the
  result of government incentives to build high-density housing, in an attempt to combat
  housing unaffordability through increased supply.6

  Non-strata title and strata title create different challenges and benefits for the inclusion
  of sustainability infrastructure in housing. For example, almost 40% of Australian
  freestanding houses have solar panels,7 one of the highest uptakes in the world. It
  might be assumed that this is simply a result of our abundance of sunshine, but equally
  significant are our land titles. The majority of Australians still live in freestanding

3. The doctrine of fixtures holds that `quicquid plantatur solo, solo cedit' (`whatever is attached to the soil becomes part of
      it'): TEC Desert Pty Ltd v Commissioner of State Revenue (Western Australia) (2010) 241 CLR 576; [2010] HCA 49,
      [23].

4. It is common to hear the term `Torrens title' being used to denote non-strata titles. This is incorrect for the simple reason
      that almost all land in Australia, including all strata title, is Torrens title. The only alternative to Torrens titles is Old
      System title. This is land that was granted prior to the introduction of Torrens statutes in the 19th century, and which
      has not yet been converted to Torrens title. There is almost no Old System land left in Australian states. It is also not
      possible to create strata titles unless the land being subdivided is Torrens title land; eg, Strata Schemes Development
      Act 2015 (NSW) s 9(4).

   houses, which they own, rather than rent.8 As the owner of a fee simple title, the largest
   interest in land in the common law, the single owner (or couple) has the freedom to
   install panels,9 and as the occupier(s) of the property, they have the incentive to do so.

   In contrast, retrofitting strata schemes with solar panels or other sustainability
   infrastructure is more complex. This is because of the collectively owned nature of
   strata schemes and the challenge of gaining majority or special majority agreement.
   Property scholars refer to this as `the tragedy of the anticommons' -- that is, the risk
   that land use stagnates because too many people have rights of veto.10 These problems
   are compounded by the fact that over 50% of apartments in Australia are owned by
   investors,11 creating the further problem of split incentives; that is, the people who pay
   for sustainability upgrades -- landlords -- do not necessarily benefit, and the people
   who benefit -- tenants -- do not have the power to do so as their property rights are
   limited.12

   However, strata title has distinct advantages in relation to the inclusion of
   sustainability infrastructure during initial construction. A physically large and
   populous strata scheme can host much more complex sustainability infrastructure
   than an individually owned freestanding house -- for example, a trigeneration plant
   or black and/or grey water treatment plant. Further, unlike the discrete freestanding
   houses (fees simple) in an ordinary suburban street, strata schemes have collectively
   owned common property on which to site infrastructure, regulation for its management
   and above all else, a mechanism to make people pay for its use and upkeep. As we will
   see in this chapter, the ability to compel people to make ongoing payments by virtue of

 9. This freedom is not accidental; it is the hallmark of private property ownership in a liberal democratic state. However,
       freedom is not absolute. We are free to use our land as we please so long as we do not harm others, and as land
       use routinely affects others, landowners are routinely regulated, most commonly by planning and environmental
       legislation.

   landownership is the single most beneficial, and simultaneously problematic, attribute
   of strata title.
   For climate conscious lawyers to play a role in the increased uptake of sustainability
   infrastructure in housing, particularly high-density housing, they need to understand
   land titles accurately. Contrary to the claim of the lawyer in the iconic Australian film
   The Castle, the law does not operate through `the vibe of the thing'.13 Law operates
   through longstanding doctrines and detailed legislation which climate conscious
   lawyers need to master if their work is going to have tangible results. This chapter sets
   out the fundamentals of strata title legislation, within the context of broader property
   doctrines and theory. The legislation is hyperlinked so readers can read it in its original
   form, as all lawyers must do. The chapter ends with two case studies -- a small
   intentional community and large-scale market towers - to illustrate the benefits and
   risks of strata title law when used to pursue sustainability goals.

2. Strata and Community Title Fundamentals

                                                    STRATA BASICS

   Registration of strata plan creates:
             individual lots (apartment)
             common property
             body corporate (all owners)
             by-laws

   Common property:
             eg lifts, corridors, car parks in a high-rise strata scheme
             eg roads, parks and infrastructure in a community title master planned
               estate
             can include sustainability infrastructure, eg solar panels, batteries, EV
               chargers
             owned by lot owners as tenants in common in proportion to unit
               entitlements
             body corporate has a statutory obligation to maintain and repair

2.1 Strata Title

Strata schemes are usually apartment buildings, ranging from two-storey walk-ups
to multistorey high-rise buildings. They are created and regulated by strata title
legislation, which although state-based is largely consistent throughout Australia. This
chapter will use the New South Wales legislation as the basis for discussion.
In NSW, strata schemes are created under the Strata Schemes Development Act 2015
(`SSD Act') by the registration of strata plans under s 9. Drawn by skilled surveyors,

                                                                 709
                                                                                                                                                                710

  strata plans subdivide `land' -- which is a column of space from the centre of the earth
  to the heavens1 -- into individually owned lots (apartments) and collectively owned
  common property (corridors, lifts, car parks etc). Exploring a real strata plan will
  greatly aid understanding. It includes a page for each level of the building, as well as a
  schedule of `unit entitlements' for each lot.2

  Registration of the plan automatically creates a body corporate, called an owners
  corporation (`OC') in NSW. This is a separate legal entity, made up of all lot owners
  (not tenants), and is responsible for the ongoing operation of the strata scheme in
  accordance with the Strata Schemes Management Act 2015 (NSW) (`SSM Act').3

  The SSM Act imposes extensive obligations on the OC to manage finances, take out
  insurance, keep records and accounts, and crucially, to manage, repair and maintain
  the common property.4 In what is arguably the most significant aspect of strata title,
  the OC must estimate the costs of maintaining and running the strata scheme each
  year5 and `levy' -- that is, extract money -- from owners in accordance with their
  unit entitlement.6 Any sustainability infrastructure that is attached to common property
  will prima facie be a fixture, part of the common property, and subject to statutory
  obligations for the OC to maintain it through owners' levies.7 OCs are often assisted
  by a strata manager, but the manager is simply an agent who has been delegated OC
  functions.8 Colloquially, people sometimes refer to `the strata', but there is no such

      the soil, it is theirs all the way to Heaven and all the way to hell'.

2. SSM Act s 83(2). Every strata scheme has an `aggregated unit entitlement', which is a random number, such as 8,400 on
      the hyperlinked plan. Each individual lot is then allocated a smaller proportionate number that represents the relative
      market value of the unimproved lot. For example, lot 86, a large, top-floor apartment, with two balconies and a double
      car space in the basement, has the highest unit entitlement in this scheme.

   thing. Ultimate power in all strata schemes rests with the OC, the collective body of
   owners.

   Strata plans must be registered with a set of by-laws that regulate the use of both
   common property and individual lots.9 These can be the model by-laws in the
   legislation10 or bespoke by-laws written by the developer's lawyer. By-laws simply
   need to relate to the `management, administration, control, use or enjoyment of the lots
   or the common property', an expansive description that captures almost any activity.11
   A by-law banning people eating meat in their own apartment relates to the use or
   enjoyment of a lot and is prima facie valid. By-laws banning washing on balconies,
   compelling residents to use fossil-fuel powered dryers, are routine. However, by-laws
   can be amended through special majority vote, and in an effort to address climate
   change, resolutions for sustainability upgrades only require majority agreement.12

   The SSM Act s 139(1) also prohibits by-laws that are `harsh, unconscionable or
   oppressive', and case law has emphasised that the power to create by-laws does
   not extend to activities that have no meaningful effect on others.13 But by-laws
   remain a double-edge sword: they have the capacity to produce negative and positive
   environmental, social and economic outcomes.14

  2.2 Community Title

   Community title developments are essentially flattened out strata schemes or master
   planned estates, created by the Community Land Development Act 2021 (NSW) (`CLD
   Act') and regulated by the Community Land Management Act 2021 (NSW) (`CLM
   Act'). Individual lots might be vacant land, a house or townhouse, and common
   property will be parks, roads, pavements, recreational facilities and increasingly

   infrastructure, including sustainability infrastructure. Like strata schemes, community
   schemes have a governing body corporate made up of all owners (a community or
   neighbourhood association')15 and a set of by-laws (a `management statement') that
   regulates the use of lots and common property.16 In mainstream market housing, these
   often contain architectural rules, but they can include rules for ecologically sensitive
   land use as illustrated by the management statement hyperlinked in the first case study
   below.

   Community schemes can be tiered, with multiple subsidiary neighbourhood or strata
   schemes within an overarching community scheme. Community title is used for a
   wide range of housing developments, from low-rise `resort style' developments and
   rural ecovillages through to high-density, high-rise estates. For example, Wentworth
   Point, in Sydney, is made up of multiple high-rise strata schemes (each created by the
   SSD Act and regulated by the SSM Act), within an overarching community scheme
   (created by the CLD Act and regulated by the CLM Act). It should be noted that it is
   not necessary to have quite so many pieces of legislation: Queensland has a single Act,
   the Body Corporate and Community Management Act 1997, that covers the creation
   and management of both low- and high-rise schemes.

 3. Why Do We Need Strata Title Legislation?
 Limitations in Orthodox Property Law

  To understand the benefits and risks of strata and community title, it is important
  to understand why the legislation was enacted. To a large degree it was created to
  overcome the limitations in orthodox property law, particularly traditional easement
  and covenant law.

 3.1 Limitations of Freehold (Restrictive) Covenants

  There is a foundational rule of orthodox property law that prohibits current owners of
  freehold fees simple from burdening their land with covenants (promises in relation
  to land) that bind future owners of the fee -- for example, covenants created by
  an original owner that compel all future landowners to buy water from a particular
  supplier or to repaint houses pink every year. This cardinal rule ensures that each
  generation of landowners will be free to economically and socially exploit their
  land as they please; by limiting current owners' freedom, the law guarantees future
  owners' freedom. There is one exception to this rule -- restrictive covenants. That is,
  the equitable doctrine from Tulk v Moxhay1 (`Tulk') that allows current landowners
  to burden their land with restrictions of which later owners have notice. Examples
  include `brick and tile' and `residential only' covenants, preventing the construction
  of houses in substandard materials like fibro and corrugated iron and protecting the
  residential character of neighbourhoods. Restrictive covenants were used to combat
  the ills of unplanned, overcrowded Industrial Revolution cities, and they played a key
  role in the development of suburban Australia, resulting in single-storey, freestanding
  houses set in spacious gardens as the dominant housing form, as noted above.2

  Beneficial as Tulk may have been for suburban development, like strata by-laws,
  freehold covenants are a double-edged sword. Legally, Tulk is arguably wrong because

                                                                                                                                                                714

  it allows a current landowner to be bound by a contract made between a previous
  owner and a third party, violating the basic contractual rule of privity. Practically,
  the decision's effect was to potentially undermine the utility of all freehold land. If
  current owners can be bound by promises of previous owners of which they have
  notice -- for example, to employ a particular cleaner, buy electricity from a particular
  supplier -- all land could potentially be burdened by an unlimited range of contractual
  agreements made by previous owners, reducing the social and economic utility of land.
  Recognising the potentially destructive nature of the decision in Tulk, courts rapidly
  backtracked, limiting covenants to restrictions,3 not positive obligations (the litmus test
  of a positive obligation being the payment of money),4 and covenants that benefit land,
  not businesses.5 The result is that when people buy a fee simple they will be obliged to
  pay their vendor the purchase price, and their annual council rates, but they will never
  be required to make ongoing payments to their vendor or third parties for facilities or
  services.

  While this rule is essential to maintain a free and functional land market, it creates
  an impediment to the construction of apartments with freehold fee simple titles. The
  building will need to be maintained, but there is no way to impose an obligation
  on individual apartment titles to pay for maintenance; any freehold covenant to pay
  money would be positive and thus invalid.

  Strata and community title legislation was enacted to overcome this problem. As
  noted above, the legislation not only allows but mandates the imposition of monetary
  levies on all lot owners. Unlike non-strata owners, who can allow their homes to
  fall down around them, strata owners, via the OC, have a statutory obligation to
  maintain and repair common property.6 Further, by-laws can contain restrictive and
  positive obligations -- for example, a positive obligation to clean windows or practise
  permaculture. The result of the requirement to pay levies, and of expansive by-laws, is

3. Pirie v Registrar General (1962) 109 CLR 619; [1965] ALR 860.

4. It is clearly permissible to attach positive obligations to leasehold land, the most obvious one being the obligation to
      pay rent. Courts are much less concerned with the content of leasehold covenants because leases, and the covenants
      contained in them, eventually come to an end. In contrast, freehold covenants, like the fees simple to which they are
      attached, potentially go on forever.

  that strata titles are freehold fee simple Torrens titles burdened by positive obligations
  that are impermissible for non-strata housing.

  While this legislative amendment of the common law and equity is rational for
  the maintenance of collectively owned buildings, the consequence has been the
  construction of increasingly complex developments with extensive facilities and
  services. If you can make people pay for facilities and infrastructure, there is an
  incentive to provide them, either in response to perceived market demand (eg `resort-
  style' developments with pools and gyms7) or in response to government incentives
  (eg planning approvals that preference the private provision of infrastructure,
  including sustainability infrastructure). That is why, in contrast to traditional suburbs
  in Australia where there might only be a public park, the facilities in new high-rise
  buildings and master planned estates can include private pools, gyms, country clubs
  and electricity networks.

                                               KEY QUESTIONS
                    What is the reason for the law's prohibition on positive obligations

                      on freehold land?
                    What are the risks and benefits of overcoming this prohibition?

 3.2 Limitations in Easement Law

  In addition to overcoming the limitations in orthodox freehold covenant law, strata
  and community title overcome limitations in easement law. Like restrictive covenants,
  modern easement law has its roots in the Industrial Revolution: the rapid and
  unplanned development of densely populated British cities necessitated the express or
  implied creation of property rights that allowed one landowner to walk, drive or run

7. For example, Sanctuary Cove on the Gold Coast, Australia's first resort-style community: Sanctuary Cove,
      <https://sanctuarycove.com>.
                                                                                                                                                                  716

   pipes across another owner's land.8 Running pipes over others' land for the outward
   passage of sewage and inward passage of clean water became particularly pressing
   after the mid-19th century medical realisation that cholera was waterborne. As a result,
   easement law, most notably the cardinal rules in Re Ellenborough Park,9 is well
   adapted to giving one landowner limited rights to cross or run pipes or wires over
   another person's land, but it is not well adapted to allowing the collective use of land
   and facilities10 or the use and maintenance of complex modern equipment.11

   Strata and community schemes allow developers to avoid the complexities and
   limitations of easement law because schemes have common property. The common
   property is held by the OC as agent for all lot owners as tenants in common,12 and
   tenants in common have a right to `occupy the whole'. This means that all lot owners,
   and their tenants, will automatically have the right to use (and obligation to pay for)
   common property, including fixtures, such as pools, gyms or solar panels. There is no
   need to draft complex easements granting those rights or obligations.

   Finally, the cherry on the cake of strata and community title is that unlike easements
   and covenants that require enforcement by an individual owner of benefited land
   against an individual owner of burdened land, often in a superior court with equitable
   jurisdiction, enforcement of obligations and restrictions in strata and community
   schemes is done by the OC, often assisted by a professional strata manager. If resort
   must be made to legal enforcement, this is usually done in a tribunal such as the
   NSW Civil and Administrative Tribunal (`NCAT'), at considerably less expense than
   litigation in a superior court.

3.3 Effect of Strata and Community Title Legislation

At the end of this section, it should be clear that unlike traditional doctrines of the
common law and equity, strata and community title legislation actively facilitate the
collective ownership of land and infrastructure, including sustainability infrastructure.
This is because strata and community title schemes:

          have land on which to site sustainability infrastructure: common property;
          allow for the collective ownership of land and sustainability infrastructure

            on it -- common property is held by the OC as agent for lot owners in
            proportion to their unit entitlements, and as infrastructure will invariably be
            a fixture, and part of the common property, it will also be owned by the OC
            as agent for lot owners;
          allow for collective use of infrastructure -- the OC holds common property
            and fixtures on it for lot owners as tenants in common; tenants in common
            are entitled to `occupy the whole' so lot owners (and their tenants)
            automatically have the right to use infrastructure;
          ensure maintenance and repair of infrastructure on common property
            through payment of statutory levies;
          have a collective body (the OC) to take responsibility for the use and
            maintenance of the infrastructure; and
          have a set of rules (by-laws) that can regulate the use of infrastructure.

We will now turn to two case studies that illustrate these legislative provisions in
action.

                                             KEY QUESTIONS

                  What features do strata and community title schemes have that
                    facilitate the collective ownership of sustainability infrastructures?

                  Do these exist in orthodox property law?

  3.4 Case Study A: Jindibah Community

   Jindibah is an intentional, ecological community inland from Byron Bay, New South
   Wales.13 The 113 acre site was a disused dairy farm, bought by six people in 1994, and
   subdivided under the original Community Land Development Act 1989 (NSW) (`CLD
   Act') into 12 individual, 2 acre housing lots and 90 acres of common property.14

13. Intentional communities are residential communities formed with the intention of living in accordance with a particular
       ethos, vision or rules. `Utopian communities' have a long history, and were often religious, while modern intentional
       communities are frequently ecological.

       <https://www.bangalowherald.com.au/index.php/2024/11/03/a-transformation-30-years-on/> (`A Transformation').
       Jindibah is a standalone `neighbourhood' scheme. While neighbourhood schemes are generally the lowest level of
       subsidiary scheme inside an overarching community title scheme, standalone neighbourhood schemes are permitted
       under the CLD Act s 10(2).

The community had an `environmental enhancement and management plan' to guide
the ecological repair of the land through rainforest regeneration and sustainable
agriculture. Each year, hundreds of rainforest trees were planted, totalling 12,000
today, while environmental weeds were consistently controlled. An agricultural buffer
zone was planted along one boundary to prevent spray drift from a neighbouring
macadamia plantation and a rough bush track was replaced with an internal road.
Twelve housing lots have been landscaped and are used by owners to suit their own
                                                                                                                                                                  720

   needs, whether with play spaces for children, vegetable plots or a pool. Founder,
   Christobel Munson, said,

               While this property could easily have ended up as an unprofitable farm
               running beef cattle (as often happens when city people relocate to the
               country and don't know what to do with the land), we've found a way that
               12 households can each care for their own lot, so each garden is loved and
               flourishing. The trees we've planted on the remaining common land have
               brought the rest of the land back to life, attracting lush flora and abundant
               fauna in the wildlife sanctuary it's become, while providing shade for the
               agisted cattle and horses. The creek, now shaded by mature trees, attracts us
               to sit, or swim, or simply enjoy nature's bounty.15

   This ecological and social achievement has been facilitated by the community title
   legal structure. First, community title allows for the individual ownership of land. As
   privately owned property, the housing lots can prima facie be used by their owners as
   they please (subject to the management statement) and can be sold.16 One of the key
   benefits of community title for intentional communities is that, unlike cooperatives or
   trusts, individual members have a Torrens title fee simple that they can easily sell on
   the public land market, allowing free exit from the community and the financial means
   to acquire a home elsewhere.

   Second, community title creates collectively owned land -- the common property --
   which in Jindibah includes the internal road and bridges,17 agricultural equipment, a

15. Munson, A Transformation (n 14).

16. While intentional communities traditionally select their members, this power is limited in strata schemes. Section 139(2)
       of the Strata Schemes Management Act 2015 (NSW) (`SSM Act') states that by-laws cannot `prohibit or restrict the
       devolution of a lot or a transfer, lease, mortgage or other dealing relating to a lot'. This was to avoid similar restrictions
       to those that existed in company title buildings, which made banks reluctant to lend money for their purchase: Strata
       Title Property Rights (n 2) 19. However, under the Community Land Management Act 2021 (NSW) s 128(2)(a) (`CLM
       Act') community management statements can limit occupancy `to persons of a particular description' through by-laws
       that `relate to the control or preservation of the essence or theme of the development'. Although this power exists, it
       is rarely used, as it would limit the pool of purchasers. Most intentional communities provide potential members with
       ample information about the values and the rules in the community so that, ideally, people only buy property if they
       are comfortable with those rules.

17. Internal roads in community title developments are called `access ways'. They can be open access ways, which connect
       the scheme to a public place, or private access ways, which connect internal parts of the scheme: CLD Act s 41. All
     721

   wastewater system, meeting hall and swimming hole, as well as the regenerated land
   which makes up the bulk of the site. The common property, and any fixtures on it,
   must be managed by the neighbourhood association (the body corporate)18 and must
   be maintained and repaired19 through the payment of annual levies by lot owners.20

   Third, community title schemes have management statements (by-laws) that regulate
   the use of both lots and the common property.21 In what has to be one of the most
   poetic parts of the Torrens register, the management statement for Jindibah begins
   thus:

               Jindibah is a local Aboriginal word meaning both `wisdom' and `tawny
               frog mouthed owl' ... This community is being created with ecological
               sensitivity and, hopefully, the wisdom of the owls, for a few compatible
               people who share the same vision and objectives ...22

   The management statement goes on to regulate both lot and common property. For
   example, homes on lot property must be single storey, built in earth-toned colours
   and have solar hot water and water-efficient plumbing and appliances and a minimum
   water storage facility. The neighbourhood association is responsible for implementing
   an environmental enhancement and vegetation management plan, and while owners
   are responsible for removing noxious weeds on their lots, if they do not do so the
   neighbourhood association may do so in their stead. Interestingly, the management
   statement contains an `Acknowledgement of Rural Uses & Practices', which may
   be carried out early in the morning or late in the evening. They include logging
   and milling, piggeries and poultry farms, cattle dips, clearing and cultivation of
   land, weedicide and pesticide spraying, slashing, and the use of tractors, chainsaws
   and motorbikes. Incoming purchasers must initial this section to indicate their

       access ways are part of the common property, and private property, even if they are accessible by the public: CLD Act
       s 43.

   understanding of ordinary rural land activities, and their agreement to them. While
   all lot owners have access to NCAT pursuant to the legislation,23 the management
   statement creates a system of alternative dispute resolution, at community level,
   through discussion, mediation, negotiation or counselling.24

                                                 KEY QUESTIONS
                      Do you think an intentional ecological community could be

                        created using orthodox easement and freehold covenant law?
                      What other climate-conscious rules could be included in by-laws

                        or a management statement?

   For other ecological communities structured with strata or community title see:

               on the Central Coast of New South Wales, just north of Sydney.

               (RRR) centre, pool and centralised wastewater treatment system.

  3.5 Case Study B: Embedded Networks

   At the other end of the housing spectrum from small intentional eco-communities
   are large-scale high-rise strata schemes. Governments are particularly concerned to
   ensure that these buildings contain sustainability infrastructure, including `distributed
   energy resources' (`DER'). DER are privately owned renewable energy assets that
   produce and/or manage power behind the meter at household or business level. The
   most common examples are rooftop solar panels, battery storage, thermal energy
   storage, electric vehicles and chargers, smart meters, and home energy management
   technology.26 In its report, Unlocking the Potential of Distributed Energy Resources,
   the International Energy Agency (`IEA') found that DER are in the process of
   transforming global energy markets.27 As noted at the beginning of the chapter, it is
   often easier to construct housing from the outset with sustainability infrastructure than
   to retrofit existing housing. DER is a good example of this.

   DER in large strata schemes are often included as part of an `embedded network'.
   Embedded networks are private energy networks that allow for the onsite generation
   of energy (eg with solar panels or trigeneration plants) or discounted bulk purchase of
   energy from the grid, with savings being passed on to residents within the network.28
   To the extent that embedded networks rely on renewable energy (generated on site or
   purchased) and to the extent that they use energy saving systems (eg heat pump hot-
   water systems), they contribute to our efforts to reach net zero.

   Currently, most new large strata schemes in New South Wales are constructed with
   embedded networks, which have increased exponentially in recent years in response
   to state governments and local councils looking favourably on new developments with
   sustainability features.29 Unfortunately, embedded networks have not operated well in
   practice and have been subject to consistent consumer complaint, and consequently
   parliamentary and regulatory inquiries.30 Residents inside networks have found
   themselves paying high, opaque energy bills, and are unable to escape the embedded
   network and source energy from alternative providers, benefiting from market
   competition. Ironically, OCs have also found that they are not receiving any of the
   renewable energy generated on site, because it is being sold back to the grid, and they

   are prohibited from installing further sustainability infrastructure, such as additional
   solar panels.31

   These problems have their root in the use -- or more accurately misuse -- of strata
   title legal structures: specifically, developers causing OCs to sign service contracts
   with third-party companies that apartment owners will ultimately have to pay through
   levies.

   Developers are currently allowing third-party companies, called embedded network
   operators (`ENO'), to install sustainability infrastructure in strata schemes at no cost to
   the developer. ENOs do this in return for the developer causing the OC to enter a long-
   term contract with the ENO. Pursuant to that contract, the ENO will run the embedded
   network for the OC, bulk purchasing energy from the market and/or managing its
   onsite generation, and then onselling it to residents in the building or even back to
   the grid. The terms of these contracts are negotiated at the construction stage, prior
   to the registration of the strata plan that creates the OC. Once the OC is in existence
   and controlled by the new apartment owners, the first annual general meeting will be
   held.32 The owners who are present (usually a minority) will be shown the embedded
   network contract for the first time and told to sign it as a necessary part of the
   functioning of the building.33 Lay apartment owners are unlikely to understand its legal
   significance or the complex infrastructure to which it relates.

   The problem with this practice is that the longer the ENO and body corporate contract,
   and the more it allows the ENO to charge the OC, the more infrastructure the ENO
   will be prepared to provide the developer for free. Of course, the developer will not
   have to pay the ENO-OC contract it negotiates; apartment owners will have to pay
   it through levies. The practice of developers selling OC contracts, for cash or in-
   kind payments, is likely a breach of the fiduciary duty that developers owe OCs they

   create;34 however, it has plagued strata developments in one form or other (eg contracts
   for strata and building management, security services, landscaping) for decades.35
   Apartment owners have repeatedly found themselves forced to pay for uncommercial
   OC contracts from which they cannot escape.

   These practices exist because developers and the strata industry recognise that the
   thing that makes strata title different from non-strata titles -- namely, the statutory
   obligation to pay levies for the maintenance and repair of common property and
   the management of the scheme, highlighted at the beginning of the chapter -- is
   effectively an income stream that can be tapped. The more common property, facilities
   and services that a developer provides a scheme, the more levies owners will have
   to pay to meet the OC's statutory obligations. The OC will frequently need third-
   party companies to help it discharge those obligations, particularly in large schemes
   with extensive common property and large numbers of owners. To that end, the OC
   will form contracts with strata and building managers, security service providers,
   landscapers and increasingly sustainability infrastructure providers. These contracts
   will be paid via annual levies.

   To the extent contracts for infrastructure and services are negotiated robustly by
   OCs made up of owners, they present no problem. For example, Stucco, the student
   cooperative apartments owned by the University of Sydney, retrofitted its building
   with solar panels and an embedded network, which has provided considerable savings
   for residents.36 However, most new developments have contracts for infrastructure and
   services that were negotiated by the developer, prior to the creation of the OC, in
   return for a kickback. Those contracts are frequently uncommercial and exploitative
   of owners and tenants, compromising people's access to functional and fair housing,
   and in the case of embedded network contracts, ironically compromising their ability
   to source renewable energy.

                  What elements of strata and community title make owners

                    vulnerable to developers imposing inflated or unwanted costs on
                    them?

 4. Conclusion

  Intentional ecological communities like Jindibah, and the practice of developer-
  negotiated contracts for embedded networks, demonstrate an essential lesson for
  climate conscious lawyers, flagged at the chapter's outset: lawyers must understand
  law properly to ensure that their work has tangible, beneficial outcomes and to guard
  against the law's misuse. This is particularly important in the context of high-density
  and master planned housing, which create unparalleled opportunities for the collective
  ownership of sustainability infrastructure but which rely on technical legislation that is
  open to abuse. Lawyers need to understand the mischief that the orthodox prohibition
  on positive obligations on freehold land sought to avoid -- namely, current
  landowners controlling future landowners' use and imposing financial obligations on
  them that benefit the original owner and/or their associates. Although that rule needed
  to be overcome to ensure the proper running and maintenance of collectively owned
  housing, as property theorist Carol Rose famously warned, in `devising new strategies
  in an old war among generations of land owners ... we should not be overly surprised
  if we wind up in some of the same old trenches'.1 By allowing original owners,
  typically developers, to create rules and obligations for future landowners, we have
  permitted the mischief the foundational rule of property law sought to avoid.

  However, with properly drafted and enforced legislation preventing owner abuse,
  strata and community title can produce positive social and environmental outcomes,
  as a community like Jindibah demonstrates. With baseline legislative provisions that
  safeguard against socially and environmentally regressive rules, private citizens
  should be empowered by property law to create and regulate housing to higher
  environmental standards, making positive contributions to climate action, one
  community at a time.

  the Australian personal insolvency system encompasses a range of legal processes
  designed to assist people in severe financial hardship. It offers immediate respite from
  debt recovery action and, over time, the prospect of release from debts that cannot be

  repaid. The system also aims to assist creditors by encouraging debtors to repay what
  they can. It seeks to distribute any available assets among these creditors, in a fair and
  orderly way, in proportion to the amounts they are owed. This process means that a
  single creditor can't obtain an unfair advantage simply by being more aggressive or
  insistent than others. The personal insolvency system is governed by the Bankruptcy
  Act 1966 (Cth) and regulated by the Australian Financial Security Authority (`AFSA'),
  within the Treasury portfolio.

  As its name suggests, the personal insolvency system is designed for individuals.
  Legally, it is quite distinct from corporate insolvency, which deals with the failure
  of incorporated businesses.2 Yet in a practical sense, personal insolvency is often
  intimately connected to business activity. Many individuals who enter personal
  insolvency are owners of small businesses, either as sole traders, members of a
  partnership or as directors of proprietary companies. When a business fails,
  particularly a small business, it often leads to the personal insolvency of the business
  owners. The failure of a large corporation can also trigger personal insolvencies. It
  can cause many employees to lose their jobs and other smaller businesses to lose
  important contracts. The directors of a failed company can be held personally liable
  for the company's debts if they are found to have engaged in insolvent trading.3 In this
  respect, so-called personal insolvency is not merely a consequence of private financial
  decisions but reflects broader trends and pressures in the economy.

  In recent years, there has been increasing recognition that climate change can trigger
  business failures and, at the same time, cause serious financial harm to households
  and individuals. To date, much of this debate has focused on corporate insolvency,
  as discussed elsewhere in this volume.4 It is likely, however, that personal insolvency
  will also play an increasing role in mitigating the financial impacts of climate change
  on individuals, households and small businesses, as these impacts become more
  pervasive and severe. This chapter considers the past, present and possible future

 1. Extreme Weather and the Development of
 Australian Personal Insolvency Law

  Extreme weather and natural disasters played an important role in the development
  of modern personal insolvency law. The term `bankruptcy' derives from the Italian
  `banco rotto', or `broken bench'. It is thought to refer to the medieval European
  custom of breaking a merchant's table in two, when he was unable to pay his debts.
  The first English bankruptcy laws were enacted in 1542, during the reign of Henry
  VIII. These laws were extremely punitive, allowing for debtors to be arrested,
  imprisoned, set upon a pillory in a public place or even maimed, through the removal
  of an ear. It was not until 1705 that English law offered any meaningful relief to
  distressed debtors. The 1705 law made a radical departure from previous bankruptcy
  law by offering bankrupts release from their debts, on the condition that they
  relinquished all their property for distribution among their creditors. This innovation
  was intended to create an incentive for debtors to cooperate, rather than running
  away, hiding assets or making secret payments to preferred creditors, such as family
  members.1

  Yet this change was also prompted, in part, by a series of extremely savage storms
  in 1703 and 1704.2 These storms, which affected the most populous areas of England
  and its ships as far away as Barbados, caused immense destruction and ruined many
  English merchants. The writer Daniel Defoe, best known for his novel Robinson
  Crusoe, described these unprecedented natural disasters in a pamphlet on bankruptcy,
  published in 1706. It was `as if,' he wrote, `Heaven had particularly stretcht out its
  Hand to touch us in the most sensible article, our Trade,' sending `unusual Tempests
  which made strange Havock among our Shipping ... more than any former History can

  remind us of ...'3 The `Great Storm' of November 1703 was particularly catastrophic,
  drowning of one fifth of the sailors of the English sovereign fleet, destroying buildings
  across England and wrenching millions of trees from the ground.4 Defoe observed that
  in the wake of this disaster, the `Multitude of Insolvents increased to such a Degree,'
  and the harshness of the law fell `so severely on the miserable and unfortunate ... that
  it began to move the Nation to Compassion'.5

  Australian bankruptcy law has also been shaped, in significant ways, by natural
  disasters. In the early 1800s, the colony of New South Wales passed a series of laws
  that went well beyond their English precedents. These laws made debt discharge
  widely available and abolished imprisonment for debt, more than 20 years before this
  change occurred in England. This `revolutionary'6 reform was triggered by a drought,
  which endured from 1827 to 1829 and devastated the pastoral economy. Laws to deal
  with debt became a high priority and pragmatism was essential. In 1828, the Sydney
  Monitor reported that `extreme drought is the cause, immediate or remote, of the
  embarrassments of nine debtors in the Colony out of ten'.7 In 1830, a writer to the
  Sydney Gazette, identified only as `a friend to trade', wrote that `[t]he necessity of
  some Act for the relief of insolvent debtors ... becomes every day more apparent by
  the crowded state of our gaols, which hold, pent up within their walls, many an honest
  debtor, whose failure has been the result of the late unprecedented drought'.8

  In 1830, the temporary Debtors' Estates Distribution Act 1830 (NSW) gave courts
  the power to release imprisoned debtors and to discharge their debts. Following
  another severe drought from 1838 to 1840, the colony was plunged into economic

   crisis, involving the failure of six banks.9 This crisis became the catalyst for further,
   lasting bankruptcy law reform. The New South Wales Insolvency Acts of 1841 and
   1843 transformed the law `irrevocably', treating debtors in `a recognisably modern
   manner'.10 They offered relief, in the form of debt discharge, to a much wider class of
   people than English bankruptcy laws at the time.

 2. Australian Personal Insolvency Law Today

  Today, the Australian personal insolvency system offers three options to individuals
  in severe financial hardship. The first and most well-recognised is bankruptcy.
  Bankruptcies currently make up around 57% of total personal insolvencies.1 The
  term `bankruptcy' can conjure strong emotions, including embarrassment and fear.2
  Declaring bankruptcy can have significant consequences for individuals: in the short
  term, it disqualifies them from certain occupations and prohibits them from borrowing
  large amounts.3 In the longer term, bankruptcy can also restrict individuals' access
  to credit, or mean that they must pay higher interest rates to obtain credit.4 Yet
  many of those who go bankrupt find the process to be far less stressful than they
  expect. They report that declaring bankruptcy offers immediate benefits to health and
  wellbeing, by bringing an end to distressing debt collection activity.5 At the end of the
  bankruptcy period (usually three years and one day), most people receive an automatic
  discharge, meaning that they are released from their debts. Most Australians who enter
  bankruptcy do so voluntarily, by lodging an application with the regulator, AFSA.
  There is no fee to enter bankruptcy and individuals do not need to pay a representative,
  such as a lawyer or accountant, to act on their behalf.6

   The second most common form of personal insolvency is a debt agreement, a formal
   agreement under Part IX of the Bankruptcy Act.7 Debt agreements currently account
   for around 42% of personal insolvencies each year.8 Introduced in 1996, these
   agreements allow individuals to avoid formal bankruptcy by reaching a compromise
   with their creditors. The compromise involves agreeing to pay back a certain, fixed
   proportion of the total debt (eg 50 cents per dollar owed), in regular instalments,
   over a period of three to five years. At the end of the agreement, if all stipulated
   payments have been made, the remaining debts are discharged. Debt agreements don't
   offer the instant relief that can be obtained by declaring bankruptcy. They can place
   significant, ongoing financial pressure on those who enter into them. They are not
   universally available: to access them, an individual's unsecured debts, property and
   after-tax income must fall below certain indexed thresholds (currently $148,129.80,
   $296,259.60 and $111,097.35, respectively).9 Even so, debt agreements can be helpful
   to people with assets to protect, such as a family home.10 This is because they offer
   a way to retain these assets, instead of relinquishing them to a trustee, for potential
   distribution among creditors. Debt agreements are initiated by lodging paperwork
   with AFSA, but because they require the agreement of creditors, they are complex
   to arrange. It is necessary to appoint an accredited `debt agreement administrator' to
   manage this process and negotiate with creditors. These administrators can charge
   high fees. Consumer advocates say that some administrators are too aggressive in
   their marketing of debt agreements to low-income earners. With few assets and little
   capacity to repay their debts, these people would sometimes be better off simply
   declaring bankruptcy.11

   Currently, the only other option provided by the personal insolvency system is a
   personal insolvency agreement (`PIA') under Part X of the Bankruptcy Act. Like debt

   agreements, PIAs allow individuals to avoid bankruptcy by making private agreements
   with their creditors.12 Unlike debt agreements, however, there are no asset, debt or
   income thresholds applicable to PIAs. Due to their complexity and cost, PIAs are
   rare. They are typically used by high-income earners whose business or professional
   activities would be severely curtailed by bankruptcy.13 In the 2024-25 financial year,
   there were only 210 new PIAs initiated, representing less than 2% of all personal
   insolvencies.14

 3. Climate Change and Personal Insolvency

 3.1. The Problem of Causation

  It is difficult to measure the relationship between climate change and the personal
  insolvency system precisely. As scientists frequently observe, it is not possible to
  prove that any single event was the result of climate change -- only that it has
  increased the probability of such events occurring.1 Even if we accept, in a general
  sense, that climate change is leading to an overall increase in the number and severity
  of natural disasters,2 the relationship between a specific disaster and personal
  insolvency rates is still not clear. There is typically a `lag' between the immediate
  impact of an event, such as a bushfire, flood or drought, and any resulting personal
  insolvencies.3 A study published in the United States (`US'), tracking the impact of
  hurricanes on bankruptcy filings, found that the greatest impact on bankruptcy filings
  could occur years after the disaster.4 This study observed that hurricanes may produce
  `short-term increases in economic activity once the immediate physical destruction
  and dislocation of a hurricane abates'. However, in the long term, `financial losses
  offset these short term gains' and lead to a spike in bankruptcy rates.5

  This observation holds true in the Australian context. In 2011, the Hon. Paul de Jersey,
  then Chief Justice of the Queensland Supreme Court, discussed the extremely severe

   floods that had affected Queensland in January of that year. His Honour noted that
   the immediate financial impact of a flood could be disguised by government aid.
   Yet `[o]ver time, the financial pain for victims may actually increase, as destroyed
   resources and businesses lead to unemployment, personal savings are depleted, and
   the value of assets afflicted by the disaster plummets due to re-zoning and keen
   market awareness of the disaster'.6 More recent research has pointed out that, in the
   aftermath of a disaster, the cost of repairing or rebuilding a home can be far higher than
   anticipated, due to intense demand for supplies and tradespeople.7 Acute demand for
   temporary accommodation can also inflate the cost of housing8 and, in turn, increase
   reliance on credit to meet daily living costs. Creditors may not immediately descend
   on communities affected by a natural disaster. In time, however, they will begin to
   resume their normal collections activities.9 Individuals and households vary widely in
   their capacity to withstand the financial shock of such events, with cash reserves, debt
   levels, ability to access credit, job security, social networks and many other factors
   playing a part. For this reason, in Australia, as in the US, the personal insolvencies
   resulting from an extreme weather event may be delayed, and occur at irregular
   intervals, making them difficult to measure.10

  3.2. The Absence of Data

   Compounding this difficulty, the data collected by the regulator offers little insight
   into the potential impact of extreme weather on the personal insolvency system. As
   Chief Justice de Jersey noted in 2011, `bankruptcy law deals only with process,
   and not the fact-specific circumstances behind each application'. It does not make
   `substantive or procedural distinctions based on why the debtor files'.11 For this

   reason, the data gathered by AFSA does not enquire, in any detail, into the causes of
   the individual's financial hardship. When people apply to enter personal insolvency,
   they must complete a detailed `Statement of Affairs' form providing information
   about their assets, debts, income and other matters. Until 2020, this form invited
   applicants to nominate the `main cause' of their insolvencies. Those who considered
   their personal insolvencies to be `business-related' were invited to nominate `seasonal
   conditions including floods and drought', among other options. In 2020, AFSA
   released a new, simpler version of the form.12 This form no longer includes flood,
   drought or other natural events among the possible causes of personal insolvency.13
   This means that the data gathered by AFSA, though extremely useful in many respects,
   does not provide an easy way to measure the impact of drought, flood or other weather
   events on the personal insolvency system.

      In the absence of quantitative data, we can look to media reports, public inquiries
      and other sources for qualitative evidence that extreme weather is placing
      Australians at increasing risk of personal insolvency. The Queensland floods of
      2011 provide a vivid insight into the potentially severe and long-lasting financial
      impacts of extreme weather. The floods were caused by a severe tropical
      cyclone, Cyclone Tasha, which originated in the Coral Sea and reached the
      northern coast of Queensland on 25 December 2010.14 With the cyclone came
      heavy rain, which spread southward and caused extensive flooding in many areas
      of Queensland. The floodwaters reached the regional city of Toowoomba on 10

      January 2011 and the state's capital, Brisbane, on 12 January.15 A Commission of
      Inquiry in 2012 found that 78% of the state was declared a disaster zone, with 2.5
      million people affected and 29,000 homes and businesses experiencing `some
      form of inundation'.16 Thirty-three people lost their lives. Compounding the trauma
      of these deaths, and the terror of witnessing the flood descending on their towns,
      many Queenslanders returned to homes that were saturated with dirty water and
      smeared with foul-smelling mud.17 By 24 January 2011, the Insurance Council of
      Australia reported that victims of the floods had lodged more than 31,000
      separate claims worth $1.2 billion.18 By November 2011, this figure had risen to
      58,463 claims.19 The Commission of Inquiry estimated that the total cost of the
      floods exceeded $5 billion.20
      As the Chief Justice noted in his 2011 address, the floods created immediate,
      intense financial hardship for many thousands of people. `Many individuals and
      businesses ... had to confront the reality of having their home, belongings, cars
      and paperwork washed away,' His Honour observed, `whilst the obligation to pay
      for such items persist[ed] as well as the need to replace them.'21 The floods
      created particular challenges for homeowners with mortgages: some properties
      depreciated sharply in value,22 to the extent that the owners' mortgages were

      greater than the value of the property.23 Victims endured months of uncertainty,
      as they waited for insurance companies to process and assess their claims. As
      the Commission of Inquiry found, many households affected by the Queensland
      floods did not understand that their insurance policies excluded flood cover. Some
      discovered too late that their policies did not include flood damage or only
      covered certain types of flood (eg a `flash flood'), meaning that their claims were
      declined.24 In April 2011, the Brisbane-based Courier-Mail reported that the
      financial impact of the floods was only gradually `becoming apparent' as insurers
      finalised claims, with households frequently receiving less than they expected and
      some learning that they were not eligible for compensation at all.25 The
      newspaper noted that while quarterly personal insolvencies had declined
      nationally by 16%, compared to the previous year, they remained `stubbornly
      high' in Queensland.26 This is confirmed by AFSA's published statistics27 and
      became more pronounced in the two-year period following the floods. In the first
      quarter of 2013, there were 2,176 personal insolvencies in Queensland, a
      decrease of 8% from the first quarter of 2010. By contrast, national personal
      insolvencies declined to 7,442, a decrease of 18% over the same period.28
      The financial impacts of the 2011 Queensland floods were still palpable when the
      same region suffered further extreme flooding in 2022. This flood, which affected
      south-east Queensland as well as large areas of New South Wales, was at that
      time `the costliest climate driven disaster in Australia's history'.29 For those who

      had already experienced the 2011 Queensland floods, its impact was especially
      acute. A national news outlet reported the experience of one man, living in
      Grantham, whose family was `still reeling financially from the floods of 2011'.30
      The family had declared bankruptcy after the 2011 floods and had `just got out of
      bankruptcy' when the 2022 floods occurred. `We'll probably end up back there
      again,' the man reflected.31 For some, the 2022 floods were even more harmful
      than those of 2011, because in the intervening period, their insurance policies
      had become unaffordable. In Grantham, in 2022, an auto warehouse owner told
      reporters he had lost 60 uninsured cars in the floods.32 Following the 2022 floods,
      a Senate Select Committee Inquiry identified significant failures in the insurance
      industry's response to extreme weather events. It noted that, for many victims, the
      experience of pursuing `prolonged and complex claims' was `more traumatic than
      the disaster itself'.33 While the committee did not specifically consider the link
      between such events and personal insolvency, it observed that for a particularly
      `vulnerable cohort' of Australians, insurance had become prohibitively expensive
      or `simply unavailable' due to their location in `high risk' areas.34 Such households
      are exposed to immense financial loss in the event of a natural disaster.

 4. The Future: Personal Insolvency Law as a
 Response to Climate Change

  In 2025, the problem of inadequate insurance remains an acute challenge for
  Australians, with direct implications for the personal insolvency system.1 The Chief
  Executive Officer of AFSA, Tim Beresford, stressed this in a speech to the Future of
  Banking Summit in May 2025. Mr Beresford observed that Australia is now ranked
  22nd in the world for exposure to natural disaster risk; that 5% of Australian homes
  are already `uninsurable or unaffordable to insure'; and that this figure is expected to
  rise 10% by 2035, `[a]s disasters become more common and severe'.2 He noted that
  in 2024, 15% of Australian households were already under `extreme insurance stress',
  spending more than one month's gross income on insurance premiums each year.3
  Mr Beresford predicted that the worsening problem of underinsurance will affect
  home values, access to finance and homeowners' capacity to meet ongoing mortgage
  obligations, with `obvious flow-on effects' for the wider economy.4 Recent analysis by
  the Australia Institute offers further evidence of this problem. It finds that, on average,
  a household without home and contents insurance risks losing 74.3% of its overall
  wealth in the event of a flood, fire or other natural disaster.5 The Australia Institute
  notes that bankruptcy is a distinct possibility for such households, particularly if a

   property is destroyed and the mortgage exceeds the value of the household's remaining
   assets.6

   Because the financial impacts of a disaster vary so widely, those affected should
   always have the benefit of legal advice before deciding to enter personal insolvency.7
   For some, a personal insolvency might in fact create new challenges or exacerbate
   existing problems. For those displaced from their homes, the legal requirement to
   disclose one's status as an undischarged bankrupt could make it difficult to secure
   housing, particularly in a tight rental market.8 The decision to enter a debt agreement
   carries even greater risk, given that such agreements involve ongoing repayments and
   assume the existence of a steady income. Individuals whose employment is affected
   by a flood, fire or other disaster might, at first, overestimate their future capacity to
   make such payments. If a debt agreement fails, due to missed payments, the individual
   is at risk of being made bankrupt by his or her creditors. In these circumstances, the
   individual derives no benefit from the repayments already made and cannot claim a
   refund of the fees paid to the debt agreement administrator. In this sense, entering a
   debt agreement might only prolong or even worsen the financial harm caused by an
   extreme weather event.9

   The Australian legal system is evolving to provide more targeted assistance to victims
   of natural disasters. Since the `Black Saturday' bushfires of 2009, in Victoria,10
   legal aid commissions and community legal centres have developed multidisciplinary
   outreach services to help those affected.11 Financial ombudsman schemes can also

assist victims, offering free dispute resolution relating to insurance claims, mortgages
and other loan contracts, as well as utilities and telecommunication contracts.12 They
are developing specialist teams and procedures to respond to floods and other extreme
weather events.13 Specialised financial counselling is available through the National
Debt Helpline and Small Business Debt Helpline, offering assistance with applications
for disaster relief, insurance claims, loan variations and payment deferrals.14 AFSA has
also developed a `vulnerability framework' to improve its service provision to people
in financial crisis, including those affected by disasters.15 These initiatives may help
some individuals to avoid personal insolvency, or alternatively, to choose the personal
insolvency option most suitable to their circumstances, in the aftermath of a disaster.

To date, however, there has been little discussion of how personal insolvency law
might change, to offer more support to those financially affected by such events.
One change recently proposed by the Commonwealth Government might achieve this,
in part, though this was not one of its explicit objectives. In 2024, the government
consulted on a new procedure, known as the `Minimal Asset Procedure' (`MAP'),
which would offer a quicker, less complex form of bankruptcy to those with low
incomes, low assets and relatively small debts.16 Those accessing the MAP would
be eligible for discharge in one year, rather than the usual three. Their names would
appear on the National Personal Insolvency Index, but only for four years, meaning
that the MAP may have a less significant impact on access to credit than a traditional

   bankruptcy.17 The MAP would only be available once in an individual's lifetime and
   would not be open to those who had previously declared bankruptcy.18

   The MAP would not be a comprehensive solution for those affected by extreme
   weather or disasters. It would only assist those with debts below the prescribed
   threshold (tentatively fixed at $50,000 in the 2024 consultation). This means it would
   likely be of little value to homeowners or small business owners. Moreover, at this
   stage, the MAP's future is uncertain. Although it attracted support from consumer
   advocates, the Law Council of Australia and some private insolvency practitioners,
   other stakeholders expressed concern that the MAP could reward poor financial
   behaviour or produce unjust outcomes for creditors.19 If implemented, however, the
   MAP could benefit some of the most vulnerable individuals affected by extreme
   weather events, including renters and single parent households. The streamlined,
   simplified process would be a significant advantage for those whose financial records
   are destroyed in a disaster. The opportunity to achieve debt discharge within a shorter
   period, and with limited impact on credit reports, could facilitate faster financial
   recovery.20

 5. Conclusion

  Natural disasters have always been intimately connected with the Australian
  experience of personal insolvency. As climate change intensifies, Australians are
  confronting these events with increasing frequency. They are also witnessing new
  natural phenomena with profound economic consequences, such as the unprecedented
  algal bloom currently affecting coastal communities in South Australia.1 These
  phenomena not only cause sudden, catastrophic losses but increase financial pressure
  on households and businesses over time, for example by making insurance
  increasingly costly or even unattainable.
  Many Australians financially affected by climate change will require far more
  comprehensive assistance than they can obtain by entering personal insolvency.2
  Merely discharging someone's debts cannot restore a lost home, job, small business
  or community. Even so, the personal insolvency system continues to offer a vital last
  resort for those in financial crisis. In this respect, it remains an important tool for
  climate conscious lawyers.

Australian insolvency law is divided into personal insolvency law, which deals with
the insolvency of natural persons and partnerships, and corporate insolvency law,
which deals with the insolvency of corporations. Personal insolvency is primarily
regulated under the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth), whereas corporate insolvency is
regulated under the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (`Corporations Act'). The focus of
this chapter is on climate change and corporate insolvency law. The topic of climate
change and personal insolvency law is dealt with under a separate chapter .

                                                                 753
                                                                                                                                                                754

  It is no doubt true that climate change and adverse weather conditions might cause
  or contribute to the insolvency of corporations. Sectors like farming, tourism, and
  hospitality could be particularly vulnerable in this regard. Other non-climate related
  adverse conditions may similarly cause or contribute to the insolvency of corporations.
  Principles of corporate insolvency law will apply to insolvent corporations in the
  same way, whether or not the cause of the insolvency is climate related. The purpose
  of this chapter is therefore not to describe the number of ways in which climate
  change could cause or contribute to corporate insolvency (the economic implications
  of climate change), but to consider the legal implications of climate change in the
  context of corporate insolvency.

  Traditionally, the `fundamental purpose' of insolvency law is `to provide a fair and
  orderly process with the financial affairs of insolvent individuals and companies'.1
  This fair and orderly process emphasises the position and rights of creditors -- in
  other words, private obligations. In the case of an insolvent company, it is clear
  that the company does not have sufficient assets to satisfy all the claims against it.
  Insolvency law recognises this and provides rules to facilitate a fair distribution to
  creditors when company funds are insufficient to pay every creditor in full. A key
  principle in this regard is the one of `pari passu' distribution, which requires that all
  unsecured creditors should receive an equal proportionate amount of assets available
  for distribution.2 There are exceptions to this rule -- for example, some unsecured
  claims, such as costs of administration, insolvency practitioner remuneration and
  employee claims, enjoy a statutory priority and will consequently be paid in advance
  of other unsecured claims.3

  As the impact of climate change becomes more apparent, there is increased interest
  in the issue of how insolvency law deals with public obligations, particularly
  environmental obligations and stranded assets. The `polluter pays principle' demands
  that `the polluter should be charged with the cost of whatever pollution prevention
  and control measures are determined by the public authorities, whether preventive

  measures, restoration, or a combination of both'.4 In the context of a financially
  stable `polluter' company it is clear that the company, as a separate legal entity, will
  be liable for these types of obligations and associated costs. However, an insolvent
  company may not have sufficient funds to meet these and other obligations. In that
  case the question becomes `Who should pay when the polluter cannot pay?' Since
  insolvency law frameworks emphasise private obligations in the first instance, these
  frameworks are perhaps ill equipped in their current form to deal with questions of
  this nature. As a result, courts are often tasked with resolving these types of issues.
  Strictly speaking, unmet environmental obligations as such is not a `climate change'
  issue. However, increased focus on the impacts of climate change may influence
  how the court approaches application of competing policy rationales in respect of
  environmental obligations of an insolvent polluter company where current principles
  of insolvency law do not always provide clear answers.

  The issue of environmental obligations and stranded assets is not the only climate
  change matter relevant to insolvency law. A second question is whether insolvency
  law, and particularly its related restructuring mechanisms, could promote
  environmental sustainability objectives. A company in financial distress may enter a
  financial restructuring of its operations under pt 5.3A of the Corporations Act with a
  view to its survival.

  This chapter will consider the impact of climate in relation to insolvency law in
  the context of two forms of external administration that could apply to insolvent
  corporations, namely liquidation and restructuring (either voluntary administration
  or small business restructuring). In a liquidation context the primary question
  revolves around liability or responsibility for unmet environmental obligations. In a
  restructuring context the focus is on the way in which insolvency law could indirectly
  promote environmental sustainability objectives, by way of general law and statutory
  officers' duties that apply to administrators of companies.5

                                             KEY QUESTIONS
       To understand the intersection between insolvency law and climate
       change, this chapter invites you to consider the following key questions:

                  Is insolvency law, as an area of law primarily concerned with
                    private interests, equipped to deal with public obligations related
                    to climate change?

                  Are environmental obligations `debts' for the purposes of
                    insolvency law?

                  What are the roles and obligations of the insolvency practitioner
                    in relation to climate change matters relevant to an insolvent
                    company?

This chapter will consider these questions with reference to the following three core
insolvency law topics:

          the disclaimer of onerous assets;
          debts and distribution rules; and
          insolvency practitioner obligations.

1. Insolvency Law and Climate Change Impacts

1.1 Contextual Background

Corporate insolvency is regulated under chapter 5 of the Corporations Act. The
Act broadly creates two ways to deal with an insolvent company, namely through
a reorganisation process (administration1 or small business restructuring2) and
winding up or liquidation.3

Voluntary administration and small business restructuring involve the appointment
of an insolvency practitioner (an `administrator' or a `restructuring practitioner',
both of whom are registered liquidators) and the financial reorganisation of the
company's debts.

In the case of voluntary administration and the appointment of an administrator, the
administrator displaces the directors of the company.4 The restructuring practitioner
does not displace directors in the case of a small business restructuring, in which
case the company retains control of its business5 and the directors are able to enter
transactions or dealings in the ordinary course of the business of the company.6

Both mechanisms require creditor approval in order for the restructuring to be
implemented.7

   The purpose of the administration process is to return the insolvent company to a
   successful concern, or if that is not possible, to achieve a better outcome for creditors
   than would have been the case if the company went into immediate winding up.8

   The purpose of the small business restructuring process is to develop a payment plan
   with the assistance of a small business restructuring practitioner, and for the company
   to enter into a restructuring plan with creditors.9

   Liquidation involves the liquidator taking control of company assets, realising the
   assets and distributing the proceeds among creditors according to distribution rules
   of insolvency law.10 Once the liquidation process has been completed, the company's
   existence is terminated by way of deregistration of the company.11

   In order to understand the intersection between environmental obligations and
   insolvency law, it is important to recognise the impact of the constitutional power
   to legislate in respect of `corporations'. Even though the Corporations Act is federal
   legislation, the constitutional power to legislate in respect of corporations vests in
   respective states and territories.12 Federal corporations legislation was possible in
   spite of this, as the desire for uniform corporations legislation motivated states and
   territories to cede their power to regulate corporations to the federal government. As
   a result, corporations legislation, even though Commonwealth legislation, may not
   necessarily prevail in case of an inconsistency between state or territory environmental
   legislation and the law under the Corporations Act,13 as would usually be the case.14

   This arrangement has important consequences in respect of a conflict between
   environmental legislation and corporations legislation insofar as the treatment of
   environmental obligations in insolvency is concerned.

  1.2 How is Climate Change Relevant to Insolvency Law?

   The extent to which and the way in which climate change is relevant to insolvency
   law will be affected by the form of external administration that applies to the
   insolvent company. In the context of a company in insolvent liquidation, the primary
   question will revolve around determining liability for environmental obligations that
   the company has not met and is unable to meet. It is possible that a company in
   insolvent liquidation has an asset that is subject to environmental clean-up or
   remediation costs that are so significant that these costs will exceed the value of the
   asset. Such property is of no benefit to the insolvent liquidation and the liquidator may
   disclaim the property for that reason.15 A disclaimer has the effect of terminating the
   company's rights, interests and liabilities in respect of the disclaimed property.16

   There is statutory protection for a person who has an interest in the disclaimed
   property. For example, a person who has an interest in the disclaimed property
   may apply to court for an order setting aside the disclaimer before it takes effect,
   provided they do so within the timeframes prescribed by legislation.17 A person who
   is aggrieved by the operation of a disclaimer is further regarded as a creditor of the
   company to the extent that they suffered a loss due to the disclaimer, and may prove
   such a loss as a debt in the winding up.18 A successful disclaimer in respect of an asset
   subject to significant environmental obligations will have the effect that the liability
   of the company in that regard has been terminated. The question then becomes who is
   liable for the environmental obligations. As the disclaimer has the effect of terminating
   the rights of the company in respect of the property, the property becomes `ownerless'

     761

   and may vest in the State due to the operation of the bona vacantia doctrine,19 with the
   State thus potentially becoming liable for environmental obligations.

   Hypothetically, a second scenario is also possible. If the environmental obligations are
   not so significant as to exceed the value of the relevant property, the liquidator may
   elect not to disclaim the property. The company therefore retains its interest in the
   property and on the basis of principles of corporate and insolvency law only, would
   appear to remain liable for the cost of meeting the environmental obligations. If that
   assumption is correct, the following could occur: claims in respect of environmental
   obligations are likely to be unsecured, do not enjoy a statutory priority20 and will
   therefore have to share in the residue, if any, with other unsecured claims on a
   proportionate basis21 once unsecured claims with a statutory priority have been paid.
   In a practical sense, this scenario is likely to result in the environmental claims not
   being paid, or not being paid in full, due to the typical insolvent liquidation leaving
   very little or nothing available for distribution among the general body of unsecured
   creditors. However, this would ultimately depend on the provisions of the relevant
   environmental legislation -- a critical factor to consider in light of the fact that the
   Corporations Act may not have paramountcy in case of a conflict with state or territory
   environmental legislation.

   The issues in a restructuring context are different. Unlike a liquidator, the
   administrator or restructuring practitioner does not have as the ultimate aim the
   winding up and termination of the company's existence. Instead, the administrator
   or restructuring practitioner aims to `restructure' the business of the company in an
   effort to allow the company to become a successful concern again. In this regard it is
   important to consider that administrators and restructuring practitioners are captured
   by the definition of `officer'.22 They will consequently be subject to statutory duties
   that apply to directors and officers. The indirect influence that these duties could

have in relation to climate change, particularly the duty of good faith and the duty
of care and diligence, has been mentioned previously in the context of directors
of companies . This also applies to administrators and restructuring practitioners as
`officers' of the company. However, while administrators and restructuring
practitioners are subject to the same duties, it is important to recognise that the context
in which administrators and restructuring practitioners operate is very different from
the context in which directors operate. Administrators and restructuring practitioners
deal with an insolvent company, appointed pursuant to, and with authority under, a
particular statutory regime, as a result of which expectations of administrators and
restructuring practitioners in respect of these duties may be quite different when
compared with what is expected of directors.

1.3 How is Insolvency Law Relevant to Society's Response
to Climate Change?

Insolvency law is unlikely to have a significant direct role in society's response to
climate change. However, it can have an indirect influence. In a liquidation context,
this will occur in relation to the determining of liability for environmental obligations.
In a restructuring context the duties of administrators and restructuring practitioners
could play an indirect role in supporting sustainability goals.

The intersection between insolvency law and climate change is a developing area of
law. As a result, legal principles are not always clear. Policy considerations are likely
to play a significant role in matters where the court is required to exercise judicial
discretion. With increased awareness of the impact of climate change, it is possible
that there may increasingly be a policy shift from the traditional and exclusive focus
of insolvency law on interests of creditors. A question is whether current insolvency
law principles are equipped to deal with these new demands being made on it.

 2. Insolvency Law Responses to Environmental
 Obligations

 2.1 Environmental Obligations in Liquidation: Case Studies
 on Disclaiming Onerous Property

  In the context of insolvent liquidation, the issue in regard to the intersection between
  insolvency law and environmental issues often involves a disclaimer of property of
  the insolvent company that is subject to some form of environmental obligation. There
  is obvious tension between principles of environmental law and those of insolvency
  law in this context, and there are examples of cases in Australia and abroad where
  this tension resulted in litigation. Judgments of the Queensland Supreme Court of
  Appeal and the Victoria Supreme Court of Appeal in relation to a disclaimer of
  onerous property that involved environmental concerns provide a good illustration of
  the complexity of this issue.

  In Queensland, an appeal was lodged against a judgment of the court at first instance1
  in the case of Longley v Chief Executive, Department of Environment and Heritage
  Protection (`Linc Energy').2 This case involved liquidators disclaiming land that was
  subject to an environmental protection order (`EPO') issued by the Department of
  Environment and Heritage Protection (`DEHP'). The liquidators approached the court
  to seek directions on whether they were to comply with the EPO. The effect of the
  disclaimer was a key issue, with the DEHP arguing that the environmental liabilities
  under the EPO would not be affected by the liquidators' disclaimer. The argument
  of the DEHP relied on interpretation and application of s 5G(11) of the Corporations
  Act, which deals with the `roll back' of the operation of the Act to the extent that
  any provision is inconsistent with state legislation. The court at first instance found in
  favour of the DEHP, stating that `liquidators are not justified in causing the company

  that s 5G(11) did not apply. In spite of having found that the provision did not apply,
  the Court considered the application of s 5G(11) and rejected the argument of the
  DEHP that s 5G(11) has the effect of disapplication of the disclaimer provisions under
  the Corporations Act. The apparent acceptance of the validity of the disclaimer by the
  DEHP proved detrimental to their case, ultimately causing the Court to find that the
  disclaimed property vested in the state. Any environmental obligations in respect of
  the property were thus to be fulfilled by the state.

  The Court of Appeal in Victoria was confronted with a similar type of issue in The
  Australian Sawmilling Company Pty Ltd (in liq) v Environment Protection Authority4
  (`TASCO'). At first instance,5 the Environmental Protection Authority (`EPA') in
  Victoria successfully applied to have a disclaimer notice set aside. The liquidators'
  appeal against the judgment of the Court at first instance was unsuccessful. As a
  result, the state was able to avoid the property vesting in itself in a similar manner
  that occurred in Linc Energy. This raised the question of who was liable for the
  environmental clean-up costs.

  Under environmental legislation in force at the time,6 the EPA was entitled to conduct
  clean-up under particular circumstances, and would then be able to recover any
  reasonable costs incurred in that way, from the `occupier' of the premises.7 The
  definition of `occupier' includes `a person who is in occupation or control of the
  premises, whether or not that person is the owner of the premises'.8 The EPA and
  the state argued that the liquidators were the `occupiers' of the land, and therefore
  personally liable for the clean-up costs. The Victorian Supreme Court, at first instance
  and on appeal, agreed that liquidators are captured by the definition of `occupier' in s
  4(1) and that they could thus be personally liable for the clean-up costs.

It may initially appear alarming that liquidators may become personally liable for
environmental clean-up costs in respect of property of a company in liquidation.
However, it should be noted that a critical factor in this case was that the holding
company of the company in liquidation provided the liquidators with an indemnity in
an unlimited amount in respect of `environmental liabilities'. In fact, the order of the
Supreme Court of Victoria setting aside the disclaimer was made subject to the EPA
and the state providing an undertaking that the liability of the liquidators would be
limited to the amount recovered under the indemnity. Even though liquidators were
thus personally liable in principle, they were not required to cover the liability through
use of personal assets. This was just one of many of the unique circumstances in this
case, and it is difficult to predict the outcome of future cases involving disclaimer of
onerous property subject to environmental obligations on the basis of this judgment.

Special leave to appeal to the High Court was denied, due the relevant environmental
legislation having been repealed, and the Court being of the opinion that the
application therefore did not raise an issue of significant public importance. Special
leave to appeal to the High Court was also denied in Linc Energy. With the High Court
thus not having settled the issue yet, the impact of constitutional law principles on the
interaction between principles of insolvency law in respect of the liquidators' right to
disclaim and the principles of environmental law remains uncertain.

What is clear is the fact that relevant environmental legislation will be a key
consideration in determining the effect of a disclaimer of onerous property, and that
this could vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.

                                                   KEY TAKEAWAYS

   Read the judgments in Longley v Chief Executive, Department of Environment

             1. What advice would you give to a state/territory environment protection
                  authority in relation to a liquidator issuing a notice of disclaimer?

             2. What advice would you give to a liquidator on the basis of these
                  decisions?

             3. Select the relevant environmental legislation from a jurisdiction other
                  than Queensland or Victoria, apply that instead of the legislation in the
                  judgments, and evaluate whether application of the legislation that you
                  selected may potentially be able to affect the outcome of the judgment.

 2.2 Environmental Obligations in Liquidation: Actions
 against Directors

  The relevance of directors' duties to issues of climate change has been mentioned
  previously. This aspect may also be relevant in the context of liquidation of an
  insolvent company.

  Liquidators have an obligation to investigate the affairs of the insolvent company
  and to determine whether it is possible to increase the pool of assets available for
  distribution among the general body of unsecured creditors. One of the ways in which
  that could be achieved is by successful action against directors of the company for
  not having complied with their duties. Liquidators have statutory powers to bring
  or defend any legal proceeding in the name of or on behalf of the company.9 It is
  therefore possible for liquidators to pursue an action against delinquent directors on
  behalf of the company where directors' failure to properly consider climate change
  issues may be seen as contravention of the good faith duty or of the duty to act with
  care and diligence. Successful action brought in this way may increase funds available
  for distribution among the general body of unsecured creditors.

 2.3 Environmental Obligations in Corporate Restructuring

  As mentioned previously, administrators and restructuring practitioners are `officers'

9. Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) s 477(2B) (`Corporations Act') <https://www5.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/
      ca2001172/s477.html>.
                                                                                                                                                                  768

   of the company and thus subject to statutory directors' and officers' duties. Similar
   to directors, these duties, particularly the duty of good faith and the duty of care and
   diligence, could potentially require administrators and restructuring practitioners to be
   cognisant of the company's environmental obligations and to exercise their powers
   accordingly. However, context in this regard is critical, and there is a significant
   difference between the position of a director of a prosperous, profitable company and
   the administrator or restructuring practitioner of an insolvent company.

   It has already been explained that the duty of good faith could require directors of
   a company in financial distress to consider the interests of creditors, along with or
   rather than those of shareholders. Given that a company under administration or small
   business restructuring is insolvent, it is clear that the focus is on the interests of
   creditors rather than shareholders. The duty of good faith will thus not expect the same
   careful balancing between interests of shareholders and creditors from insolvency
   practitioners as it does from directors of companies in financial distress.

   However, a question is whether the insolvency practitioner may also need to consider
   a broader range of interests, such as social and environmental considerations
   (including climate change), in terms of this duty. The importance of insolvency
   practitioners being alive to these issues may increase as policy shifts become more
   apparent. One may argue that there are already indications that this shift has started,
   when considering the case of Preston, re Qenos Pty Ltd (Administrators Appointed).10

   The case involved a group of companies which operated Australia's largest plastics
   and chemical manufacturing business, and which was important to the continued
   production and supply of natural gas in south-east Australia. The administrators in this
   case were seeking directions from the Court in relation to the entry into of a $200
   million facility agreement, for orders that the agreement was justified, specifically
   for the purpose of limiting their personal liability under statute.11 The facility would
   enable a managed slow down and winding up of operations, without significant
   environmental hazards and disruption of the natural gas supply to south-east Australia.
   The alternative would be to liquidate the companies and to disclaim their assets. The
   administrators argued that `the significant safety and environmental risks ... were such

11. Corporations Act s 443A <https://www5.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca2001172/s443a.html>.
     769

   that the "public interest weighs firmly in favour of the orders being made"'.12 The
   orders approving the entry into the facility agreement were granted and were non-
   controversial, as creditors would also benefit from this agreement.

   However, an interesting aspect of this case is the statement from the Court, in the
   context of an insolvent company under administration, that a focus on creditors'
   interests does not suggest that `administrators should take a course of action that is
   cavalier or reckless as to environmental hazards and risks ... simply because it would
   be advantageous to unsecured creditors'. 13 This statement appears to point to the fact
   that interests other than those of just the creditors could and should be considered
   where the circumstances warrant -- for example, in relation to environmental hazards
   and risks. This statement was not critical to the outcome but does indicate an
   interesting potential development.

   The relevance of the directors' duty of care and diligence in the context of climate
   change matters has been discussed , and this approach also applies in respect of
   administrators and restructuring practitioners in their capacity as company officers.
   That said, it is once again important to consider context, particularly as the statutory
   duty of care and diligence is framed to indicate that the standard of conduct that is
   expected will depend on the circumstances of the corporation14 and the particular
   office15 held by the person. Liquidity concerns in the insolvent company have the effect
   of amplifying the usual tension that exists between long-term sustainability goals and
   financial returns. The extent to which environmental factors are capable of being
   considered may thus look different when the focus is on trying to keep the company
   alive -- it may mean that long-term sustainability goals are sacrificed as a result of the
   acute focus on short-term liquidity.

   It is also necessary to consider how what is expected from the insolvency practitioner
   could vary, depending on the extent to which directors remain involved in the
   management of the business of the company. This would, of course, depend on

 3. Potential Future Developments

  Australia is not the only jurisdiction with issues raised by the intersection between
  insolvency law and environmental obligations. Insights to be gained from the
  management of this tension in other jurisdictions, or the way in which other policy
  considerations have been given form in Australian insolvency legislation, may prove
  useful in regard to future policy and law reform discussions.

 3.1 Environmental Claims as Public Obligations: Canada

  Canada provides an interesting basis for comparison due to it being a federation
  state, similar to Australia. In both jurisdictions, bankruptcy (Canadian terminology)1
  or insolvency (Australian terminology) is dealt with at a federal level, while
  environmental regulation is largely the responsibility of states/territories or provinces.
  In Canada, this takes place through the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act.2 An important
  distinction is that the doctrine of federal paramountcy in Canada clearly determines
  that bankruptcy legislation will prevail in case of inconsistency with provincial
  environmental legislation. This is different to the position in Australia, where
  environmental legislation may be paramount.

  The Supreme Court of Canada, the highest court in the land, had an opportunity
  to decide a matter involving environmental obligations in bankruptcy in the case
  of Orphan Well Association v Grant Thornton3 (`Redwater'). The case involved
  disclaimer of assets (oil and gas wells) subject to environmental obligations, without
  fulfilling any of the obligations. The environmental regulator asserted that Redwater
  had a responsibility to clean up its own wells. In the relevant province, Alberta,
  the court at first instance and on appeal considered the regulator's claim that

1. While the term `bankruptcy' is used in Australia only in the context of personal insolvency, its use in the Canadian
      context is different. `Bankruptcy' in the Canadian context is similar to the term `insolvency' in the Australian context.
      Canadian terminology will be retained for the purposes of this paragraph only -- ie `bankruptcy', rather than the usual
      `insolvency'.

                                                                   771
                                                                                                                                                                772

  environmental obligations should be discharged prior to a distribution to creditors
  being made. In both cases, the court held that the regulator's attempted use of statutory
  powers to enforce Redwater's compliance with environmental obligations in
  bankruptcy is inconsistent with distribution rules under federal bankruptcy legislation,
  as it would provide the regulator with a priority ahead of other creditors in respect of
  payment of these `debts'. As a result, the doctrine of federal paramountcy was seen to
  render provincial environmental legislation inapplicable.

  The Supreme Court of Canada overturned these decisions. It found that environmental
  obligations are not `debts' that are provable in bankruptcy, but public obligations.
  As such, compliance with these obligations will not constitute payment of `debts'
  contrary to the distribution rules under federal bankruptcy legislation. This led to a
  conclusion that there was no inconsistency between distribution rules under federal
  bankruptcy legislation and obligations under provincial environmental legislation,
  which meant that the bankrupt company was ordered to discharge environmental
  obligations under provincial environmental legislation before making a distribution
  to creditors. The outcome was that the company did not have any funds left for
  distribution, to the extent that even secured creditors were left unpaid. In this way,
  environmental obligations were effectively (though not in a legal-technical sense)
  given a `super-priority' in respect of creditors.4

 3.2 Preferential Treatment of Environmental Claims in
 Distribution: France5

  Another way to address the issue of environmental claims in insolvency is through
  legislative change in respect of distribution rules. An example of such an instance can
  be found in the French Commercial Code. This method is supported by structured
  regulation requiring companies in France wishing to enter insolvency proceedings
  to provide information about their status in respect of environmental protection to

  enable the court to determine whether the company is an `ICPE' (operator of facilities
  classified for environmental protection).

  In a similar manner to many other jurisdictions, France recognises certain claims
  against the insolvent company as priority claims (`privileged' claims). Environmental
  claims in insolvency were not regarded as privileged claims. However, due to
  amendment to article L. 641-3 of the French Commercial Code on 23 October 2023,
  claims arising from rehabilitation of ICPE sites now have the status of privileged
  claims.

 3.3 Guarantee Fund, Priority and Super-Priority: Protection
 Measures in Respect of Employee Claims in Australia

  The Australian corporate insolvency framework contains examples of how policy
  objectives could translate into additional statutory protection for the claims of certain
  creditors. This is particularly apparent in respect of the claims of employees of
  insolvent companies.

  In an insolvent liquidation, claims of employees in respect of certain employee
  entitlements enjoy a statutory priority, and these claims would thus have to be paid
  ahead of other unsecured claims against the company.6 Employees are also protected
  by way of a `super-priority', in terms of which wages and entitlements have priority
  over the claims of a secured party in relation to a circulating security interest, where
  the company does not have sufficient property to meet employee claims.7

  Additional protection is available to employees by way of a government-funded
  legislative safety net scheme of last resort under the Fair Entitlements Guarantee
  Scheme.8 Under this scheme, employees may claim certain unpaid entitlements, to
  statutory monetary limits, from the government fund where the insolvent company
  does not have sufficient property to satisfy their claims.

  Some suggest that similar protections should apply to environmental obligations in
  insolvency on the basis of policy rationales.9

                      legislative intervention. Which approach is preferable?

4. Conclusion

This chapter considered climate change and insolvency law in the context of core
insolvency law topics, namely disclaimer of onerous property, distribution rules and
insolvency practitioner obligations. It provided an overview of the tension that exists
in respect of the handling of environmental obligations in an insolvency context,
identifying how core insolvency topics may be affected by increased awareness of the
importance of environmental safeguards. The Australian constitutional framework that
applies to insolvency law and environmental law exacerbates the complexity of the
issue. While insolvency law principles are typically concerned with private interests,
the increased awareness of the consequences of climate change may contribute to
enhanced emphasis on public policy objectives. Judicial statements may indicate that
the first steps in this direction have already been taken. It raises an interesting question
of whether such significant policy matters should be left to the discretion of the
courts or whether legislative intervention is required, as it is apparent that various
jurisdictions adopt different approaches in this regard.

                                                                 775

Clinical legal education is a powerful methodology for teaching and learning in
law. It bridges practical learning with service in the public interest; in clinic students
learn through hands-on, supervised work for real clients and causes. Amid the climate
crisis, where the increasing frequency of extreme weather events will impact lawyers
both professionally and personally, it is crucial to consider how students can equip
themselves to be climate prepared future legal practitioners. Clinical legal education
provides a valuable opportunity for students to reflect on their role in addressing these

                                                                 777
                                                                                                                                                             778

critical challenges and better understand how law and legal practice intersect with
environmental and social issues, in a way not generally possible in doctrinal-based
subjects.
This chapter will discuss why clinical approaches are well suited to teaching and
learning about the climate crisis. Through working on real matters and with real
clients, the complexity and interconnections between areas of law as well as
interdisciplinary factors are made clear. The process of reflection and close
supervisory feedback in clinic allows students to develop the skills and knowledge
necessary to practice across discipline boundaries in the context of climate change.
The chapter will then explain how clinical subjects operate and provide examples of
climate clinics and climate co-curricular programs across Australian universities.

 1. Introduction

  Clinical legal education (`CLE') is a method for teaching and learning in law in
  which students work under supervision for real clients on real legal matters. It is an
  experiential learning methodology1 that combines student learning with community
  benefit. This chapter explains the types of CLE teaching that students may encounter
  and the benefits that students get from a clinical approach to learning about climate
  (and) law.

  A `climate clinic' is a CLE subject or program that is both about and for the climate.
  It is also where students must learn about themselves as lawyers in a climate-changed
  future. Understood this way, a climate clinic could focus on climate justice, climate
  resilience, climate change, sustainability or the changing environment more broadly.
  The law is less a focus than the purpose and methodology of the clinic. Through a
  process of supervisory feedback and reflection, a climate clinic2 provides an often
  rare opportunity for students in their degree to consider the ways in which they might
  contribute to addressing the climate crisis through their professional work, together
  with building skills and professional understandings to do so.

  This chapter is a bit different to others in this book. Unlike areas of law considered
  in this collection, CLE is a pedagogy or approach to the teaching and learning of
  law rather than an area of legal doctrine.3 A climate clinic has as its focus a client
  problem or need -- a real-world issue on which the law has a bearing -- that will often
  require students to draw on multiple areas of study across and beyond the law school
  curriculum. One of the points we emphasise in this chapter is that all laws are climate
  laws.4 Year on year, the areas of law addressed by a climate clinic will change, as the

  needs of clients change. Again, unlike in the typical lecture theatre, CLE has core aims
  of addressing a client or a community need.

  The chapter begins with an explanation of what is meant by the term `clinical legal
  education', introducing the main features and benefits to student learning. While all
  clinical law subjects share core features, clinics vary widely in design and focus
  depending on the nature of the legal need or problem addressed and the learning
  outcomes sought, as well as more pragmatic factors such as available resourcing and
  university and faculty support.

  CLE has been described as a `dynamic pedagogy'5 and new clinical models continue
  to emerge. The main Australian clinical models will be briefly outlined, with further
  discussion of three key climate clinics that are offered at Australian law schools, and
  which adopt different models for the work of the clinic and engaging students in
  the work of climate justice. As noted, the categories of clinic are not closed; they
  can -- and must -- respond to new needs and situations. An emergent fourth model
  that integrates climate justice within an existing and longstanding clinical approach
  demonstrates one such future possibility.

  Finally, this chapter will discuss the role that co-curricular experiential opportunities,
  outside of the formal curriculum, can play in law students learning about and for the
  climate. For students without access to a climate clinic, the co-curriculum presents a
  place to engage in CLE for the climate.

                                               KEY QUESTIONS

                    Do you agree with the statement that `all laws are climate laws'?
                      Can you think of examples where an area of law that is not
                      conventionally related to climate issues can nevertheless be
                      regarded as climate law?

                    How might the role of a student be different in a climate clinic
                      than in other subjects, like Environmental Law, for example?

 2. What is Unique About CLE ?

  CLE has been described most simply as `learning by doing and reflecting'.1 It is a form
  of experiential learning in which students are placed in the role of lawyers, working
  under supervision on real legal work.2 Typically students will need to have completed
  certain foundational subjects before enrolling in a clinic. Student learning in a clinic
  takes place not just through learning what the law `is' or says (though this is part of it)
  but through engaging with the law as it operates.
  Through a process of close supervisory feedback and reflection on their experience,
  students learn skills for legal practice, together with a deeper understanding of the law
  and justice system in operation and the nature and possibilities of their own future role
  as lawyers in that system.

 3. How did CLE come about and what do clinics do
 that is relevant to the climate?

  CLE in Australia began in the early 1970s alongside and in conjunction with the
  nascent community legal centre (`CLC') movement. Australian CLE and CLCs had a
  common focus on social justice and providing legal help for economically and socially
  disadvantaged individuals who were unable to access regular paid legal services.1
  Many CLE programs in Australia were started by volunteer law students inspired by
  the politics of social change and social justice. Similar forces were at work in other
  jurisdictions. While each jurisdiction has its own history, the 1960s and early 1970s
  saw clinical programs established in at law schools in the United States of America,
  Canada and the United Kingdom. Clinical programs are now found in law schools
  worldwide.

  In Australia, early clinical programs provided general legal support and focused on
  assisting individual clients, usually low-income or disadvantaged.2 Specialist clinics
  that focused on a particular subject matter, area of law or category of client emerged
  in the 1990s.3 Since then the concept of the `client' as well as the nature of the work
  done by students in clinic has expanded. For instance, clinics now:

            offer advice and transactional work for organisations and enterprises;

            undertake research, advocacy and policy development for social
              movements or even for the environment as client;4

            do community legal education, law reform and capacity building where the

4. A conception of the client highly relevant for the current discussion is the idea of the Earth itself as client. This
      idea will be explored further in the following sections in the discussion of the mission of a climate clinic. See,
      eg, Client Earth (Web Page) <https://www.clientearth.org/>; Australian Earth Laws Alliance (Web Page)
      <https://www.earthlaws.org.au/>.
                                                                   783
                                                                                                                                                                784

              client is the community.

  Two elements provide a common link for clinics across time: the real nature of the
  work and the ongoing commitment, particularly in the Australian context, to social
  justice and the public interest.5

  The term `climate justice' recognises that structural and socio-economic inequalities,
  and intergenerational inequity, impact individuals' and communities' experience of
  climate change, and advocates for equitable solutions that prioritise the needs of those
  who most affected.6 Given the existential threat posed by a changing climate -- to
  the environment and humanity -- and the recognition that the impacts of a changing
  climate are not borne equally, a climate clinic falls squarely within this framework.7

  In addition to the wide ambit of the `work' and `clients' of a clinic there are a range of
  approaches or models for CLE, ranging from in-house generalist or specialist clinics
  based at law schools in which students are supervised by law school academic staff
  practitioners, to externship models in which students undertake placements and are
  supervised by lawyers in CLCs, private firms or government. These different ways
  of doing CLE will be discussed in more detail later in the chapter in the context of
  different models for climate clinics.

                                               KEY QUESTIONS

                    Conduct some quick research on a CLC near where you live.
                      Have a look at their website to identify their purpose, the
                      communities they support and the types of legal work they

                  Think about the kinds of work that clinics in Australia do

                    (transactional work, research work, and legal education and
                    reform work). Who might be a client of a climate clinic, and why?

 4. What impact can CLE have in the fight for climate
 justice?

  Alongside the multiple facets of student learning discussed later in this chapter, a
  climate clinic aims to meet the needs of the client. As noted above, social justice has
  been a central value of Australian CLE since its beginnings, aligned with its shared
  origins and links to CLCs.1 Unlike the (purportedly) value-neutral traditional approach
  to doctrinal black letter subjects, CLE in Australia aims to `inculcate [in students]
  social justice values that transcend mere legal service provision'.2 A climate clinic,
  therefore, can only exist to support the community to address the climate crisis.3 It
  could not be used to advance the interests of fossil fuel industries or used to frustrate
  progressive policies to limit climate-harming emissions or block efforts to achieve
  justice for communities in the energy transition.

  A climate clinic is mission-driven. Clients are deliberately chosen to advance the
  clinic's aims. The startup sustainability and environmental `new economy'4 enterprise
  clients of Melbourne Law School's Sustainability Business Clinic, for example, are
  carefully chosen to raise issues and require assistance that will raise novel and
  multidisciplinary questions or matters that are challenged by existing laws. In this
  way, the Sustainability Business Clinic has been recognised as an important part of the
  ecosystem of supports in Australia for social enterprise.5

      practise is an opportunity for students to analyse and reflect on the relationship between law and these various ideas of
      access to justice and social justice, and the part that lawyers play': at 75.

Because CLE exists in a public realm and takes a progressive stance to law and policy,
it also has the potential to contribute to closer connections between the profession and
the academy, as well as to a university's outreach and community engagement as a
public institution.

 5. Why a clinic for teaching and learning about the
 climate crisis?

  One of the key strengths of CLE is its potential to broaden and deepen1 student
  learning in law by making the law real. Moreover, a clinical approach allows for
  learning climate-related law and practice unconstrained by disciplinary boundaries.

  The `real' aspect of clinic is critical in the case of teaching and learning about climate
  and the law. Whichever approach or model for a climate clinic is adopted, CLE
  involves engaging with the law in action, and through this encountering a justice
  system and laws that can operate fairly or unfairly, can help or hinder the client's
  interests and which might be reformed (or transformed). Real clients and real matters
  rarely come packaged in the categories of a compulsory law subject. To provide
  effective and professional assistance in the `swampy lowlands'2 of practice requires
  students to move beyond legal rules and doctrinal boundaries and to understand and
  take into account the web of legal and non-legal causes and consequences that make
  up any legal matter.

  The focus in clinic on the problem or matter requires students to `[break] down
  existing knowledge boundaries'3 as well as recognise the interconnections and
  interplay between law and other disciplines. This idea of connections is shown in
  the Federation of CLC's climate justice wheel (see Figure 1). The climate crisis
  is inherently complex and multifaceted, with multiple stakeholders and points of
  entry; environmental problems are `polycentric and multidisciplinary'.4 Sustainability
  scholars have criticised the focus of traditional legal education on fragmented

  While important in any area of legal practice, this broad perspective is perhaps crucial
  here. Skills in thinking across and beyond the traditional taxonomy of law, and
  integrating understandings from multiple disciplines, is needed to understand and --
  crucially -- address the wicked nature of the climate crisis.6 That is the case whether
  the work is transactional advice on setting up a new enterprise in the community
  energy economy, for which students need to understand the law and the complexity
  of energy markets;7 or developing a guide for landowners to better understand their
  rights in a changed climate, which would be informed as much by the politics of
  the climate as by the law of property;8 or advising a university on best-practice
  climate-mitigation measures, which would entail a cross-jurisdictional understanding
  of university governance.9

 6. What skills are learnt in CLE and how are they
 relevant to our shared climate future

  CLE supports students to build skills for practice through engaging in real legal work
  under supervision. Through this process of hands-on experience, coupled with close
  supervision and feedback, CLE aims `to produce graduates who can deal effectively
  with the modern world'.1

  While the nature of the work of a particular clinic will shape the specific technical
  skills students develop -- legal writing, analysis, advocacy or litigation process --
  CLE has a particular capacity to support essential skills for practice, including ethical
  awareness and `emotional skills, values, responsibility, resilience, confidence, self-
  esteem, self-awareness and humility'.2

  The question of what it means for law graduates to be `practice-ready' has been
  described as `neither clear-cut nor well-articulated',3 and it is a question made more
  complex by the ongoing and dynamic changes in legal practice and the profession, as
  well as in the regulatory framework, and the lack of certainty about our environmental
  future. New technology and the use of artificial intelligence (AI) open both
  opportunities and challenges for law and for legal practice.4 The skills required to be
  `practice-ready' today are unlikely to be the same as those required in 5, 10 or 15
  years.5 The most important skill in this context might be the skill of learning how to

  learn6 and to understand law in context and in the broader framework of clients' needs
  and ethical practice.7
  While the future of work is unknown, it is accepted that the climate has and will
  continue to change.8 A climate clinic has the added role to prepare students as
  professionals entering that climate-modified future. This is partly achieved through
  supervised practice; it is also achieved through using reflective techniques that support
  professional self-awareness and acknowledge wellbeing and personal growth.

 7. What is and why do reflective practice in climate
 clinics?

  Reflective practice in CLE builds the skill of learning how to learn and supports the
  development of an ethical professional identity. In a climate clinic, this can extend to
  reflecting on the role and function of legal ethics in a climate context while doing legal
  work for a clinic client. It allows students to understand their own ethical framework in
  a context of practice for the climate. The generally small student enrolment of a clinic,
  an emphasis on guided and structured reflective practice, and the powerful catalyst of
  the real-life legal matter make the clinic a fertile site for this transformative learning
  to occur.

  Reflection and reflective practice are considered an integral feature of clinical
  methodology and have been described as the `magic ingredient' that transforms
  experience into learning1 and as a `core competency' for legal professionals.2 They
  allow experiences to be seen through a future gaze. In a climate clinic, this includes
  a future affected by weather extremes and climate inequities.3 Reflection in clinic
  takes place formally (often as a structured and assessed part of the curriculum) and
  informally, between legal educators or supervisors and students, and between students.

  Many clinical teachers use Leering's model of reflective practice.4 It identifies five
  types or aspects of reflection: reflection on action, reflection in action, self-reflection,
  critical reflection and reflection in community. The climate exists in plural ways
  within this framework. It could be the recognition of approaches to a client's matter

  informed by a different discipline. It could be a trigger for action, it could be a context
  for self-reflection, and it could be a motivating factor for community activism.
  In the context of a climate clinic, reflection provides not only a means by which
  students can develop an integrated understanding of what is needed to practice across
  doctrinal and discipline boundaries but also what it means to be a practitioner for the
  climate.
  One commonly agreed view in the scholarship on reflection is a feature of cycles of
  learning. Through reflection, students identify skills development and values, which
  inform further learning. This can help students clarify their views about justice in law,
  therefore helping them navigate their future in the law,5 and the development of an
  ethical and healthy6 professional identity.

     What are the benefits of engaging in reflective practice? How

       might those benefits be realised in a climate clinic?
     Using Leering's reflective framework, how are your reflections on

       your values similar to or different to the values of the community
       on the issue of climate change? How can you navigate those
       differences (if any) in a climate clinic and in a legal career?

 8. How can CLE promote climate wellbeing in
 students?

  Today's law students face well-documented risks to mental health and wellbeing.1
  Potentially compounding risks to student mental health are emerging experiences of
  `climate anxiety'.2

  While not confined to younger generations, the incidence of psychological distress
  related to the climate crisis is higher in young people,3 with increasing evidence of the
  direct and indirect impacts of climate change on young people's mental health.4 For
  some law students this climate distress might raise questions about their professional
  future in the law.5

  Many students enrol in a climate clinic driven by a desire to contribute to a community
  working for the environment. Some may be motivated to develop skills in a developing
  area of practice, or simply curious about what is involved. For others, an awareness

  of the multifaceted impacts of climate change informs questions around how to best
  prepare for a professional future in the law.6
  The real nature of the work of the climate clinic is important in this respect. We
  suggest that a clinical methodology allows students to learn about and for the climate
  in a way that is not possible within the doctrinal confines of the standard curriculum.
  The clinic provides a glimpse into a different career possibility for students who are
  eager to make a difference in a climate-changed world7 but who are often at a loss
  about how to do so in the depressing state of world governance order.8
  It is also where students and teachers can channel the real anxiety experienced in the
  face of the climate crisis in a way that is supportive of their wellbeing and professional
  identity formation.9

 9. Climate clinics as a site of climate wellbeing?

  The context of climate is not unique in causing students to reflect on their role and
  professional identity as (future) lawyers. The experience of encountering clients in
  clinic who have been treated unfairly by the legal system, or who have been unable
  to protect or assert their rights, is common across clinical programs. However, the
  existential threat and hydra-headed nature of the climate crisis brings into focus these
  issues of professional identity more viscerally and more starkly for students who want
  to contribute positively to addressing the climate crisis but may not know how to do
  so.1 Aided by reflective practice, students can ask: What kind of lawyer can and should
  I be? What does it mean to practice law for the environment?

  In considering the intersection of climate learning in law and student wellbeing, the
  recognition that how students learn is at least as important as what they learn is
  significant.2 Clinical methodology -- with the emphasis on small, collaborative groups
  engaging in personally and professionally meaningful work -- offers an environment
  that is well placed to meet the basic psychological needs for autonomy, relatedness and
  competence, as well as providing a sense of purpose.3 The clinic has been described as
  a `practice community' where staff and students cultivate a sense of belonging, valuing
  and promoting empathy and support to others.4

  A clinical model for climate-related learning provides students with an opportunity
  to share these concerns and, critically, to act on them to contribute positively and
  collectively to a more positive vision of the future. In acquiring the skills to understand

                    lawyers in a time of environmental crises?

 10. What is the role of clinics in the emerging area of
 climate resilience and preparedness?

  By 2050 we will live in a world that is at least 1.5 degrees warmer,1 a reality that will
  bring increasing extreme weather events and will change exponentially the way all of
  us exist and function.

  As a student (and future legal practitioner) the ability to prepare for and bounce back
  from climate-induced extreme weather professionally, from within the legal system,
  and on a personal level, living with and through the impacts of changing climatic
  conditions, will be crucial. A level of resilience and preparedness is required.2 Just
  as the clinical setting provides opportunities to support wellness, it also offers a
  unique opportunity to develop climate resilience and preparedness, personally and
  professionally.

  Resilience and preparedness, particularly in a climate context, are relatively new
  and emerging areas of work both within the CLC and CLE settings. As noted, new
  clinic subject matter or approaches emerge to meet new situations and challenges.
  In Australia, the CLC sector is already responding to increased community need
  following extreme weather events by providing legal help, as well as working
  alongside communities to support resilience and preparedness.3

  Many intersecting or adjacent bodies of `resilience' literature exist, including socio-
  ecological resilience,4 and social capital building to improve and promote `community

  resilience'.5 `Resilience' as a concept is used differently across professions, sectors
  and academic fields. However, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
  (`IPCC') describes resilience in a climate change context as `the capacity of social,
  economic and ecosystems to cope with a hazardous event or trend or disturbance
  responding or reorganising in ways that maintain their essential function, identity
  and structure ... while also maintaining the capacity for adaptation, learning and
  transformation'.6 The concept of community disaster resilience is visualised in the
  work of Haworth et al.

What `preparedness' (including climate or legal preparedness) looks like will vary
across professional contexts and sectors and is applied variously to individuals and
communities at structural, international, country, state and local levels. Recognition
and responses to calls to support community climate resilience and preparedness
are evolving and developing. In its 2023 report, the Australian Pro Bono Centre
observed a need for `a focus on preparedness work, including advocacy, especially
funding advocacy, community legal education, the development of legal information
                                                                                                                                                                804

  factsheets and resources, and sector capacity building'.7 In addition, the peak body for
  CLCs highlights the need for greater awareness of the legal risks associated with a
  changing climate as well as how community members can better protect themselves
  against legal problems.8 Yet preparedness and resilience connected with the climate do
  not fit neatly into particular areas of legal doctrine. They are overarching concepts that
  will vary in content depending on their context. They are informed by the real issues
  of clients. A place to respond to these issues is the climate clinic.

 11. What are the personal and professional benefits
 of learning about resilience and preparedness?

  As we have set out so far, participation in climate clinics is directed to supporting
  climate action across individual, community and structural/systemic levels, and it
  brings personal and professional benefits.

  Professionally, students develop the practical legal skills and theoretical
  understandings required to become a lawyer who understands the breadth of law
  relevant to climate change and is capable of using the law for the benefit of
  communities that are most affected by it (including people and communities often least
  responsible for climate change, and those with the most vulnerability to its effects).1
  Students can begin to observe that they can make meaningful change and contributions
  not only to marginalised communities but to their own climate futures, as a lawyer
  for the climate and not simply by striking on a Friday2 or engaging in often fatiguing
  climate litigation.3 It is in this sense that climate clinics are often described as clinics
  for climate justice. While curriculum-based climate CLE is the focus of this chapter,
  the potential for wider, even global, connectedness through the co-curricular program
  (discussed further later in this chapter) also contributes scope for students to build their
  own climate law resilience and preparedness.

  This chapter has so far explored the history and methodology of CLE, how it can
  operate to support wellbeing, and CLE's role in promoting climate justice,
  preparedness and resilience. The next question we address is: what exactly does a
  student do, and might they do, in a climate clinic? With this in mind we now turn to
  setting out the types of climate clinics, the models they employ, and the key activities
  and learning of students involved in each.

 12. What do law students do in a climate clinic?

  Our research into legal clinics with an environmental purpose across Australia1
  indicates a plurality of approaches to CLE that can be used for a climate clinic. The
  programs considered include:

            Australian National University: Environmental Law Clinic with a
              placement at the Environmental Defenders Office (`EDO') (ACT)

            Bond University: Climate Sustainability Clinic
            Monash University: Climate Justice Clinic
            The University of Queensland: Clinical Legal Education with a placement

              at the EDO (QLD)
            The University of Sydney: Public Interest Law Clinic with a placement at

              the EDO (NSW)
            The University of Melbourne: Sustainability Business Clinic
            University of New South Wales: Land and Environment Court Clinic with

              a placement at the Land and Environment Court of NSW

  From within this list of clinics we identified three explicit, in-house or non-placement-
  based climate clinics, at Bond University, Monash University and the University of
  Melbourne. These three clinics share many similarities, especially with respect to their
  mission, goals and the CLE pedagogic approach, all described earlier. But each of
  these climate clinics has been designed and seeks to expose students to different legal
  skills and career directions. Through this chapter we hope that students can see the
  potential of CLE for the climate, and for those students enrolled in a climate CLE to
  understand how and why they are being taught as they are. For students who wish to

  advocate for a climate clinic subject within their law school, these are models that they
  could present.

  In this section we focus on the unique features of three climate clinics, recognising that
  there are no hard divisions between the types of clinics that the three featured clinics
  represent. The details we provide help explain the different ways a climate clinic can
  do CLE for different types of clients, using different areas of law and legal skills.

  Bond's Climate Sustainability Clinic (a climate policy and advocacy clinic)

  A policy and advocacy clinic is a model of CLE where students typically seek to
  activate for legal change in the public and to governments. These types of CLE
  have been described as training grounds for social change advocates.2 The clients
  are typically representative groups and public advocates, and rarely do these clinics
  provide individual legal assistance.3 In some instances, there is no traditional client
  at all. Rather, students do work for the public interest under the name and leveraging
  the status of the clinic. They might write law reform submissions for the clinic or
  produce policy briefs in the same way as university research centres or privately
  funded research institutes. Indeed, for those universities with research centres on
  the environment or climate, there is scope for law students in a climate clinic to
  collaborate with the research centre on the development of climate legal material.

  This is similar to what has occurred at Bond University. The Bond model involves a
  small group of students each semester co-designing with their academic supervisors
  climate policy and advocacy projects, including projects directed at improving the
  university's sustainability performance and to educate university staff on climate
  governance and regulation.

  Students work during a nine-week period on a research-based project with self-
  designed outcomes and a plan for achieving those outcomes. The skills foci of the
  clinic are legal research, problem framing, policy development, advocacy planning
  and performance, and strategic thinking. The goal of the clinic is to effect policy

  change, especially at the university level, with students plying public advocacy skills
  in a closed and safe space.

  Monash's Climate Justice Clinic (a climate litigation clinic)

  Litigation clinics are one of the most familiar types of CLE, very common in the
  United States, and address disputes about and over the environment.4 In the United
  States, student legal practice rules from state to state generally permit supervised law
  students to act as lawyers for clients, but this is less common elsewhere. In Australia,
  students cannot provide legal advice,5 and they can only appear in court on behalf of a
  client with leave of that court.

  Within a litigation clinic, law students assist in the preparation of a case headed for
  a court or tribunal. In some instances, and especially in small courts or tribunals,
  students act as a client advocate. In a litigation clinic there will be a clear and direct
  client -- the person or group that is a party to a case.

  Litigation clinics have been criticised6 because they show to students only part of the
  role of the lawyer, especially because most lawyers will never become litigators and
  certainly not immediately upon graduation. These clinics also represent only part of
  the community of legal need, because many members of the community will not want,
  and even with pro bono legal support find it too difficult, to litigate their legal problem.
  Yet strategic climate litigation can achieve a high level of public awareness and is an
  established part of the toolkit of climate justice actions.

  Monash University's climate clinic was conceived as a climate litigation clinic. In
  its first iteration, it was run in partnership with Environmental Justice Australia and
  students worked on climate litigation cases for that CLC.

  This initial focus on litigation has broadened to refer to students engaging in a

   wide range of commercial legal work over a 14-week clinical period alongside
   environmental organisations, barristers and community groups.7 The clinic has also
   sought philanthropic support to employ an in-house climate litigator, which would be
   novel for Australian CLE programs.8

   In the absence of a permanent in-house lawyer, students are supervised by external
   lawyers seconded from firms. They are supported by a seminar program delivered by
   university lecturers and speakers representing non-government organisations involved
   in climate justice and climate litigation topics. The work completed by students is
   more varied than litigation preparation. Students write legal memorandums and letters
   of advice, and complete legal research and prepare reports9 for community clients in
   the areas of public law, administrative law, human rights, environmental law and
   planning law.

   Melbourne's Sustainability Business Clinic (a transactional climate clinic)

   A transactional legal clinic is often presented as the other side to the litigation clinic.
   Transactional clinics provide legal assistance to individuals and enterprises, generally
   for the greater good of the community or to advance local economic development.
   Their clients are typically small and use business approaches as a way to achieve
   their goals. The earliest forms of transactional legal clinics were designed to help
   people use the law to have secure housing.10 While some transactional clinics are
   now supporting startups and entrepreneurs, most maintain their original community
   development focus.11

   Within a transactional legal clinic, the clients will be varied, as will the legal issues
   and legal doctrine that they and the students encounter. Students will perform legal
   research and advice work, engage regularly with a client, and sometimes prepare
   documents for their clients under the supervision of experienced lawyers. A
   transactional legal clinic is less likely to send students to an organisation on an
   externship or placement, rather to be run in-house.

   The University of Melbourne's Sustainability Business Clinic was set up with the
   objective of providing legal assistance to the community renewable energy sector
   and clients within the new (carbon neutral, circular) economy as they set up, grow
   and encounter regulation.12 Its most frequent client has been Hepburn Energy, where
   students have worked on matters as varied as share arrangements, energy market
   access rules, property transfers, carbon farming and planning laws for solar farms.13
   The Sustainability Business Clinic supports clients trying to achieve a positive
   community climate or environmental outcome by using the law without going to the
   courts.

   The students' 12 weeks of clinical work are supported by a 10-week teaching program
   on `new' or `fourth generation' environmental laws',14 the ethics of climate lawyering
   and the laws of the `green economy'. Students are supervised by lawyers from a
   dedicated firm15 and mentored in-house by a university staff member.

                                             KEY QUESTIONS
                  How is your CLE experience similar to or different from the

                    models above? Are there aspects from any of the three models
                    that you find especially interesting? How might your law school
                    be able to replicate those aspects in your degree program?
                                                                                                                                                                812

 13. Climate and community legal education in a
 non-climate clinic

  As we have explained, contemporary CLE adopts a wide view of the client, and
  of the legal work done within the clinic to meet the needs of the client. When the
  client is viewed as being more than an individual, the nature of the work done
  in CLE has a broader remit. We explained that clinics around Australia now do
  community legal education, law reform and capacity-building work for community-
  minded clients. These might be environmental charities advocating for legal change or
  CLCs attempting to educate and empower their community through the dissemination
  of legal education resources. In this way at least some climate justice work might
  be seen as a form of movement lawyering, in which lawyers contribute their skills to
  build the power of community-led campaigns through a range of legal and political
  advocacy strategies.1

  Where the work done by a CLE program or subject that is not squarely a climate
  clinic involves reform or education, there is great potential for that non-climate clinic
  to nonetheless do climate CLE, especially clinics that place students within the EDO,2
  where students have the opportunity to be most exposed to activist or rebellious
  lawyering for the climate.3

  This was the experience of Melbourne Law School's Street Law subject in 2023.
  Street Law is a worldwide CLE program in which students deliver community legal
  education.4 They learn about the law and the goals and approaches to the provision of
  legal information and education for a community that has encountered legal problems.

   813

  In a climate context, this education-focused CLE proved especially appropriate to
  build resilience and legal preparedness in communities at risk of weather extremes
  or climatic changes.
  Street Law partnered with a CLC on the metropolitan fringe to develop legal education
  and information resources to be used by the centre to support their community before
  and in response to an extreme weather event. In doing so it increased the capacity of
  the CLC to meet the legal need experienced by their vulnerable clientele, including
  in the areas of insurance and disaster law.5 Within the Street Law subject, students
  prepared community presentations, checklists and videos on legal preparedness and
  legal response avenues for individuals harmed by fires, floods and storms. The peak
  body for CLCs in Victoria notes climate justice aligns with the fundamental social
  justice mission of CLCs, reinforcing and underlining the importance of place-based
  approaches, rather than, for instance, directing at-risk clients to distant city-based legal
  centres.

                                                KEY QUESTION
                    Think about all the groups working for climate justice in your

                      area. How might law schools partner with them, and in so doing
                      train lawyers for the climate justice movement?

 14. The CLE-led climate co-curricular program

  CLE does not exist only in the clinic classroom or reside solely in the semester that a
  student takes a clinical legal subject. The skills a student develops in a climate clinic
  can be repeated and refined in voluntary work that emerges from the CLE experience
  and which students continue during their law degree.1

  Climate clinical skills and approaches have been used in university co-curricular
  programs. The law co-curriculum comprises all the learning activities that occur at
  law school that are linked with, but additional to and outside of, the formal teaching
  programs. Commonly, the co-curriculum has a focus on professional practice, skills
  and contemporary issues, and increasingly it is prepared in partnership with student
  leaders. The focus of a law co-curricular program might include communication
  skills, working with diverse clients, advocacy skills (mooting or friend of the court
  submissions), and activism and law reform projects. Two examples of legal co-
  curricular activities in the climate context are the Student Law Clinics Global Day
  of Action for Climate Justice2 and the University of Queensland's Climate Justice
  Initiative.3

  The Global Day of Action was conceived by the Baroness Hale Legal Clinic at York
  Law School in the United Kingdom and more than 50 clinical programs within law
  schools around the world have pledged to `rais[e] awareness of the issue of climate
  change in our teaching, research and activism; and to [find] ways to support law
  students to contribute to the struggle for climate justice'.4 Participating clinics are
  invited to organise a co-curricular activity open to all law students, not just those

  studying a clinic, to activate for change on a chosen issue.5 The purpose of the Day of
  Action is threefold: to show law students that they have a professional responsibility
  to social and climate justice and to advocate for those most vulnerable to climate
  change; to harness in law students their learnt capacities and skills that they can use
  to respond to the climate crisis; and to demonstrate to students that they are part of a
  global movement of concerned future legal professionals.

  The University of Queensland Climate Justice Initiative is an example of a quasi-
  climate clinic. It has goals similar to a climate clinic, but it is not taken for credit and
  there is no formal learning embedded within it. It is a model, however, for law schools
  that do not have a large or sufficiently staffed clinical program or, as in the case of the
  University of Queensland,6 want to instil in law students an ethos of pro bono practice.
  The Climate Justice Initiative sits within the UQ Pro Bono Centre, which operates
  as a form of clearing house, connecting students with practitioners, academics and
  community organisations to undertake pro bono legal research assistance, especially
  the production of law reform submissions on areas of climate mitigation, adaptation
  and resilience.

                      to climate justice? What other things could you do to help build a

15. Conclusion

The more students that take part in a climate clinic or (especially for students at law
schools without a clinical program) a climate co-curricular program, the greater
the prospect there is for a climate conscious, reflective and resilient legal sector.
Although there are models for climate clinics, the model is not the most important
thing. We have mentioned three specific climate clinics, as well as a clinic with
a climate purpose. Rather, a CLE approach to climate change -- reflective, real
and supervised -- offers students ways to develop their climate lawyering skills,
ranging from empathy with vulnerable clients to drafting law reform submissions
to governments. Climate clinics, and related co-curricular opportunities, open varied
career pathways, including into a CLC sector acutely aware of the present lack of
climate preparedness in communities, and clinics teach and supervise students to
reflect in a way that supports climate wellbeing and a climate-conscious professional
identity.

One of the key law jobs you, as law students, will undertake once in legal practice is
litigation. You will use the legal tools of the substantive and procedural law explained
in earlier chapters of this book to litigate a legal claim in the courts. The litigation
may be brought in the public interest to address climate change. This chapter provides
practical tips and techniques for public interest litigation, following the course of the
litigation from its beginning to its end. It will seek to explain in simple terms how you
can be an effective, climate conscious lawyer at each step.

                                                                 819

          Before reading the chapter, what do you think are the steps in
            public interest litigation and how can you be the most effective
            litigator in each of these steps? When you have finished the
            chapter, is there anything you would add to the steps outlined in
            it? Which steps do you think are most important?

 1. Learning the Craft of Lawyering

  The chapters of this book have explained the legal tools of substantive and procedural
  law needed for climate conscious lawyering. But any tools are useless if they are left
  unused in the toolbox. Effective lawyering involves not only selecting the tools from
  the toolbox that are most appropriate for the law-job at hand but also knowing how to
  use those selected tools skilfully. This is the craft of lawyering.1

  Learning the craft of lawyering is not an intellectual process but rather an experiential
  one -- learning by doing. Learning by doing will be more productive when the
  learning is guided by experienced practising lawyers, rather than aimlessly wandering
  along a path of self-discovery. How, then, can this book provide guidance to assist law
  students in their experiential learning?

  The answer, this chapter proposes, is to offer guidance on one of the key law-jobs that
  students will undertake once in legal practice of preparing and conducting litigation.
  Because this book is concerned with developing skills in climate conscious lawyering,
  this chapter provides guidance on a particular type of litigation, public interest
  litigation (PIL), seeking to catalyse action to tackle climate change.

  What do we mean when we talk about PIL? PIL is a generic term for litigation
  brought in the public interest, and comes in all shapes and sizes. One definition of
  PIL is that it refers to `proceedings in which the public or the community at large
  has some pecuniary or legal interest'.2 Litigants choose the vehicle of litigation to
  achieve a desired outcome, and adopt a strategy to achieve this outcome. If the desired
  outcome does concern the public interest and is primarily related to the question raised
  by the litigation, then this is termed PIL. If the litigation is designed to achieve a
  broader outcome to reform law, policy or governance, beyond the question raised by
  the litigation, then this may be referred to as strategic litigation. The latter is the sense

                                                                                                                                                                822

  in which Durbach et al define PIL as being litigation `intended to achieve change to
  law and policy that will benefit individuals and communities beyond those directly
  involved in the campaign'.3
  This demarcation between PIL and strategic litigation makes no difference to the tips
  and techniques discussed in this chapter for running successful climate change PIL.
  These tips and techniques are grouped in time phases between two end points, what TS
  Eliot in his poem `The Hollow Men' termed `between the idea and reality'. Expressed
  colloquially, these time phases are getting to `Go', don't pass `Go', from the `get-go',
  from `Go' to `whoa' and too far gone.

 2. Getting to `Go'

 2.1. Planning the Case

  Players begin the boardgame Monopoly at the space `Go'. Plaintiffs begin the
  endgame of PIL by filing an originating process in the court. The originating process
  may be a statement of claim, a summons or other application seeking the relief that is
  appropriate for the legal claim or cause of action (the claim) raised in the originating
  process.

  The commencement of the PIL is the culmination of a process of planning that needs
  to begin long beforehand. Planning PIL includes finding willing and able plaintiffs,
  instructing knowledgeable, experienced and willing lawyers, choosing the appropriate
  claim, obtaining evidence to prove the claim, and being able to fund the litigation. I
  will explain each task.

 2.2. Willing and Able Plaintiffs

  Citizens,1 community groups2 or environmental non-governmental organisations
  (NGOs)3 must be willing and able to bring the PIL. Willingness is not only a product
  of enthusiasm and zeal for the climate change cause but also a cultural attitude.
  A society's cultural traditions, including its legal culture, need to support, and not
  inhibit or punish, citizen access to justice through their bringing PIL in the courts.
  PIL is often a form of protest, challenging powerful interests in the government and

  PIL involves promotion of the democratic principles of free speech and assembly, and
  access to justice.4

  Ability is a product of three attributes: first, knowledge and experience of the subject
  matter of the PIL, such as the climate change problem sought to be addressed by
  the litigation; second, the capacity to access sufficient human, financial and material
  resources to bring the litigation; and third, personal attributes such as dedication,
  perseverance and resilience.

 2.3. Knowledgeable, Experienced and Willing Lawyers

  Citizens, citizen groups and NGOs can represent themselves in courts; they are not
  required to be represented by lawyers. However, lawyers improve the prospects of
  the PIL succeeding if they are knowledgeable and experienced in litigation, especially
  litigation of the type and subject matter of the PIL. This involves knowledge in
  the relevant substantive and procedural law upon which the PIL claim relies and
  experience in the craft of applying that law in litigation. PIL, by its nature, complexity
  and importance, justifies engaging the assistance, advice and advocacy of leading
  lawyers. There is a need, therefore, to facilitate access to leading lawyers by
  addressing the issue of the cost of legal services. One way is if lawyers are willing to
  act for the plaintiffs in the PIL, on a no fee or reduced fee basis. This is addressed in
  section 2.6 on funding the litigation.

 2.4. Choosing the Appropriate Claim

  Successful PIL depends on choosing the appropriate claim to address the climate
  change problem of concern. The claim must be founded on adequate and appropriate
  law. The law must create or enable legal actions to be brought. If there is no right of
  action, there can be no litigation. Civil actions could be to enforce compliance with
  the law by the government and the private sector and to restrain and remedy non-
  compliance (civil enforcement), to obtain compensation for loss or damage caused by

  a breach of duty (damages actions) or to review the merits of administrative decisions
  on a rehearing (merits review). Criminal actions could be to prosecute and punish
  wrongdoers for offences against the law.

  In choosing the appropriate claim for the PIL, plaintiffs and their lawyers should be
  the activist, be creative, show the way, choose a suitable vehicle, have an emotive
  hook, ensure appropriate remedies and avoid a scattergun approach. I will unpack
  these seven tips.

  First, be the activist. Courts are responsive to the claims brought before them. Hence,
  plaintiffs, not the courts, must be the activist. Plaintiffs must provide the courts with
  the opportunity to be active, to contribute to solving climate change problems and
  developing climate jurisprudence. The doctrinal development of environmental and
  climate change law is a proper role for the courts.5

  Second, be creative. Albert Einstein is attributed (although possibly misattributed)
  with saying that insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting
  different results. Irrespective of the source of this aphorism, this definition of insanity
  fits much of environmental PIL: doing what has always been done but expecting a
  different result. There is a need for legal imagination,6 for thinking intra-disciplinarily
  and inter-jurisdictionally.

  Intra-disciplinary thinking involves thinking within the discipline of law but across
  the boundaries of the bodies of substantive law that make up the discipline of law.7
  Climate change litigation may be based on claims not only in substantive climate
  change or other environmental legislation but also in administrative law, constitutional
  law, human rights law, tort law (including nuisance, negligence, trespass, conspiracy,
  deceit and misrepresentation), contract law (including misrepresentation and void
  for public policy), property law (including real property, misrepresentation in sale

   or lease, and public trust), trade practices and consumer law (including misleading
   representations and practices) and corporations law (including directors' duties of
   care). Consideration needs to be given to how claims based on these diverse bodies of
   substantive law can be adapted to fit the purpose of climate change litigation.

   Inter-jurisdictional thinking8 involves looking over the borders of one's home
   jurisdiction to seek assistance in the law of other jurisdictions. Environmental law is
   increasingly becoming globalised and harmonised.9 Inspiration and ideas for climate
   change litigation in one jurisdiction can be drawn from international law, such as the
   Paris Agreement and decisions of the Conferences of the Parties; other jurisdictions'
   laws, such as national and sub-national climate change legislation; and judicial
   decisions of international, national and sub-national courts. Consideration can be given
   to how the laws and judicial decisions of other jurisdictions can be adapted to frame
   and adjudicate the claims that could be made in the home jurisdiction.10

   Third, show the way. There is a need, in framing the PIL claim, to be a leader, to
   demonstrate to the court not only what the claim is but also how and why the court
   can and should uphold it, legally and factually. It is insufficient to make a bare appeal
   to what is right or just. That emotive hook is needed, as explained below, but first the
   path to success must be laid.

   Fourth, choose a suitable vehicle. The PIL claim is the legal vehicle for achieving the
   purpose of the PIL, such as to reduce the sources of greenhouse gas emissions or
   preserve the sinks of greenhouse gases, or to adapt to the consequences of climate
   change. Consideration needs to be given to which claim is the best vehicle to achieve
   this purpose. This involves checking that the facts that will be able to be proved are
   suitable and sufficient to establish the claim and to obtain the appropriate relief.

   Fifth, have an emotive hook. The judge hearing the PIL has choices in adjudicating the

   claim. There are choices in finding and interpreting the law to be applied, in finding the
   facts from the evidence before the court and in granting relief for any proven breach of
   law.11 Some of the choices will favour the plaintiff's case, some the defendant's case.
   The judge needs to be persuaded to choose in favour of the plaintiff. This is easier if
   there is an emotive hook -- a compelling story, strong facts, or reasons of justice and
   fairness.

   Sixth, ensure appropriate remedies. The PIL claim is that there has been some breach
   of substantive law. But establishing a breach of law is insufficient; the breach needs
   to be remedied. Only then will the purpose of the PIL be achieved. There is a need,
   therefore, to check that the remedies available for a particular type of claim are
   appropriate to achieving the purpose of the litigation. Different remedies are available
   for different claims.

   The remedies in judicial review proceedings may include a declaration as to rights,
   duties or liabilities or whether there has been a wrong committed;12 an injunction,
   either prohibitory (restraining wrongful conduct) or mandatory (remedying wrongful
   conduct or its effects);13 and orders in the nature of prerogative orders, such as
   mandamus (compelling the exercise of a public duty by government),14 including
   continuing mandamus (compelling the ongoing performance of a public duty),
   prohibition (restraining government action) or certiorari (quashing government
   decisions).

       that the Commonwealth is in breach of this duty of care.

       sought an order, and The Hague District Court ordered, that the Dutch Government reduce greenhouse gas emissions
       by 25% by 2020. This order was upheld by The Hague Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court of the Netherlands:

       develop environmental quality objectives, guidelines and policies to ensure environment protection from climate
       change.
                                                                                                                                                                  828

   In administrative proceedings involving a merits review of administrative decisions,
   the court usually has the same functions and powers as the administrative decision-
   maker whose decision is under review, such as granting or refusing permits, making
   administrative orders, or making any other decision the administrative decision-maker
   could have made.15

   In civil actions, remedies may include monetary damages, including compensatory
   damages (compensating for personal or property injury or for economic loss);16
   punitive damages (punishing past wrongdoing and deterring similar future
   wrongdoing); natural resources damages (compensation for damage to public natural
   resources, such as marine and terrestrial waters, and their birds, fish and other
   wildlife); and restitution (removing unjust enrichment, such as property or money
   gained by the wrongdoer and restoring the property or its value to the wronged party).

   These substantive remedies in civil actions may be supplemented by an order for the
   payment of the costs of the proceedings (which include the legal fees, expert witness
   fees and other court costs), such as an order that the unsuccessful party pay the costs
   of the successful party.17

   Adequate redress and remedy are fundamental to the achievement of access to
   environmental justice.18 If rights cannot be upheld, duties cannot be enforced or
   wrongs cannot be remedied, justice is left undone.

   The court must also be willing to grant the appropriate remedies. The grant of a remedy

       appeal brought by a coalmining company against the Minister for Planning after the Minister refused consent for a
       proposed coalmine, the Land and Environment Court of NSW exercised the function of the Minister as the consent
       authority and dismissed the appeal, partly on the basis of the scopes 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse gas emissions the project
       would cause.

16. See, eg, Luciano Lliuya v RWE AG, in which a Peruvian farmer has brought a claim in Germany against the large
       electricity generator RWE seeking damages `to cover the expenses for appropriate safety precautions in favour of
       the claimant's property from a glacial lake outburst flood from Lake Palcacocha': see Luciano Lliuya v RWE AG,
       Statement of Claim, dated 21 November 2025 (unauthorised translation) <https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/

17. In Bushfire Survivors for Climate Action Inc v Environment Protection Authority (2021) 250 LGERA 1; [2021] NSWLEC
       92, the unsuccessful Environment Protection Authority was ordered to pay the successful applicant's costs of the
       proceedings.

18. See Principle 10 of the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, 31 ILM 874 (1992).
     829

   is usually at the discretion of the court. This is necessary to achieve justice in the
   individual circumstances of the case. However, inappropriate or too frequent exercise
   of the discretion to withhold relief can undermine the rule of law and the statutory
   purpose and scheme, and may not secure equal justice.19

   There is a need to check that the court in which the PIL is to be brought has jurisdiction
   to grant the appropriate remedy. Different courts have different jurisdiction to grant
   different remedies.

   Plaintiffs also need to be realistic as to what can be achieved by the PIL. Consider
   a judicial review claim of a government decision. Success in the claim may not
   necessarily result in the government making a different decision on remit, but it may
   lead to an improvement in the process of decision-making, increase transparency and
   accountability, and raise public awareness.20

   Seventh, avoid a scattergun approach. PIL should not be viewed as a scattergun,
   hoping to hit the target with one of multiple shots. There is a need to be selective
   in choosing the claims and arguments that are most likely to succeed. Poor claims
   and arguments deflect attention from, and taint, good claims and arguments, and add
   unnecessarily to the costs of the litigation, both the plaintiff's and the defendant's
   costs.

  2.5. Evidence to Prove the Case

   Plaintiffs bear the burden of proving their claim in court. Evidence is needed to
   establish the claimed breach of law and the claimed relief to remedy the breach of
   law if established. Evidence can include evidence of fact of lay witnesses; opinion
   evidence of expert witnesses; documents, including the administrative record or
   business records, and images such as photographs and videos; admissions by the
   defendants; and answers to notices to admit facts or to interrogatories.

       `Changing Climate Law and Governance: A Multi-Level Perspective' (2024) (n 10) 11.
                                                                                                                                                                  830

   There is a need to ensure the quality, reliability and admissibility of all evidence.
   This requires careful selection of the persons who are to be called to give evidence,
   especially experts. Much environmental litigation requires expert opinion evidence.21
   If scientific, technical or other specialised knowledge will assist the court to
   understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert
   by knowledge, skill, experience, training or education may give opinion evidence.22

   A difficulty PIL plaintiffs encounter is being able to access, and afford to pay for,
   experts who not only satisfy the minimum criteria for being an expert but also have
   excellent knowledge, experience, reputation and communication skills so as to be
   reliable, credible and persuasive witnesses.23 One impediment is that many experts
   who are work-dependent on the government and private sectors may be unwilling
   to work for PIL plaintiffs challenging decisions and conduct of those sectors. An
   even greater impediment is PIL plaintiffs' usual lack of financial resources to pay for
   experts. Some of the means discussed below for funding PIL, such as by public or
   private legal aid grants, may provide funds to pay for experts, but other means do not.
   The provision by lawyers of their services on a pro bono, contingency or reduced fee
   basis only addresses the costs of legal services, not of expert services.

   Suggestions have been made for an expert aid program involving a system of pro bono
   expert assistance that increases the availability of expert assistance and improves the
   quality of that assistance. Experts in various disciplines could form associations which
   encourage and facilitate pro bono expert assistance. Legal professional associations
   could encourage and facilitate effective use of this expert assistance.24 A similar
   initiative could be pursued by universities.

  2.6. Funding the Litigation

   A critical issue is how to fund the PIL. Litigation is costly. Consideration needs to
   be given to how to fund not only the plaintiff's costs of the litigation but also the
   defendant's costs if the litigation is unsuccessful and the court orders the plaintiff to
   pay the defendant's costs. There are at least seven means by which PIL plaintiffs can
   fund PIL:

             the plaintiff, if they have or can raise the funds;
             litigation funders,25 usually where damages are sought as a remedy as the

               litigation funder takes a cut of the damages awarded;

             legal aid, although these days legal aid is rarely available for environmental
               litigation;

             public interest legal centres, such as the Environmental Defenders Office or
               Environmental Justice Australia;

             university legal clinics, where available;

             lawyers and experts acting on a contingency basis (`no win, no fee'), a
               reduced fee basis or a no fee basis (`pro bono');26 or

             intervenor funding, in some administrative proceedings, such as was done
               in Ontario, Canada.27

   A PIL plaintiff can also apply to be protected from adverse costs orders if the litigation
   is unsuccessful. The court rules may provide the court with a discretion not to order
   an unsuccessful plaintiff to pay the costs of the defendant if satisfied the litigation

25. For example, the Grata Fund is a `not-profit strategic litigation incubator and funder' and supports climate litigation,
       including Pabai Pabai & Anor v Commonwealth of Australia: see `About Grata Fund' (webpage, last accessed 15
       October 2024) <https://www.gratafund.org.au/about_us>. For a discussion on litigation funders in climate change

 3. Don't Pass `Go'

  There are some up-front barriers to PIL that prevent plaintiffs passing `Go'. Two are
  justiciability and standing.

  Justiciability involves the claim having the quality of being capable of being
  considered legally and determined by the application of legal principles and methods
  by the courts.1 If a claim is not justiciable, the court has no jurisdiction to hear and
  determine it and it risks being dismissed at the outset. That has been the fate of some
  climate change litigation in the United States2 and Canada3 as well as in Australia in
  the Sharma litigation on appeal.4 There is a need, therefore, to ensure that the PIL
  claim is demonstrably framed so as to be justiciable.

  Standing refers to the right of the plaintiff to bring the claim the subject of the PIL.
  Standing depends on the identity of the person, the type and subject matter of the
  proceedings, and the relationship the person has to those proceedings.5 In Australia,
  the common law test for standing to bring judicial review or civil enforcement
  proceedings is that a person can sue, without joining the Attorney-General, in two
  cases: first, where the interference with the public right is such that some private right
  of the person is at the same time interfered with; and second, where no private right is
  interfered with, but the person has a special interest in the subject matter of the action.6

   The plaintiff's special interest need not be proprietary or pecuniary, but it must be
   more than intellectual or emotional.7

   The standing test can restrict the range of individuals that can bring environmental
   PIL. The individual or group must be able to establish their special interest in the
   subject matter of the litigation. This might be by the plaintiff's active use of the land
   that is the subject of the litigation,8 the plaintiff's spiritual or cultural relationship to
   the subject land,9 adverse impact on the amenity of the plaintiff's land,10 protection
   of the plaintiff's statutory participation rights,11 government decisions or conduct
   relating particularly to the objects and activities of the plaintiff organisation12 or the
   plaintiff having a demonstrated history of taking `sufficient, concrete or active steps to
   effectuate the particular concern'.13

   In some jurisdictions, the hurdle of standing has been overcome legislatively. In NSW,
   for example, most environmental legislation contains an open standing provision,
   entitling any person (natural or legal) to bring proceedings for an order to remedy or
   restrain a breach of the legislation, whether or not any right of that person has been
   or may be infringed by or as a consequence of that breach.14 These open standing
   provisions have facilitated environmental PIL.

   At the federal level in Australia, the Environment Protection and Biodiversity
   Conservation Act 1999 (Cth) gives standing to seek injunctions relating to conduct or

   interests have been, are or would be affected by the conduct or proposed conduct,

   conservation of, or research into, the environment, or in the case of an organisation,
   whose objects or purposes include the protection or conservation of, or research into,
   the environment.15
   There is a need, therefore, to select a person or group who has standing to sue,
   or the proceedings risk being dismissed at the outset. The risk that the court will
   find the plaintiff lacks standing can be lessened by using multiple plaintiffs, some
   demonstrably having standing to sue, coupled with others who less evidently have
   standing but where there is a strategic advantage in including these persons as co-
   plaintiffs.

 4. From the Get-go

  Successful PIL depends on thorough case preparation of the plaintiff's case as well
  as anticipating and addressing the defences to the claim likely to be raised by the
  defendant. Cases are often won or lost before the trial; preparation from the get-go is
  thus critical.

  Case preparation includes developing a case theory, establishing the law on which the
  claim is based, proving the facts to establish the claim, demonstrating the application
  of that law to those facts and proving the relief the court should grant to remedy the
  proven breach of the law. In short, case preparation should focus on the adjudicative
  tasks the court is called upon to undertake in deciding the claim.

  First, develop a case theory. There is a need to build and articulate a strong, coherent
  theory of the case. The case theory is the strategy that will guide the conduct of
  the case to achieve the realistic outcomes sought by the plaintiff. It serves as a map
  to reach the desired destination. The case theory informs every aspect of pre-trial
  preparation and in-court conduct of the case. The case theory is also the means by
  which the plaintiff shows the court what is the desired judgment and outcome to be
  achieved by the litigation.

  Second, establish the law. The PIL claim is based on substantive law. But identifying
  and articulating the rule of substantive law to be applied is rarely straightforward,
  especially in strategic PIL that pushes the boundaries of the law, like many climate
  change related cases. There are three steps in establishing the law: finding the law
  relevant to the claim, formulating that law in the form of a rule of law that can be
  applied to adjudicate the claim, and interpreting that rule of law as formulated. There
  is legal method in undertaking these steps.1

  Third, prove the facts. The facts that need to be established are the facts relevant to
  the rule of law as formulated. Typically, the rule of law has an `if ... then' structure,

1. Brian J Preston, `Specialist Environmental Courts: Their Objective, Integrity and Legitimacy' in Enduring Courts in
      Changing Times (Australian Academy of Law, 2024) 338, 360-70.
                                                                   836
   837

  such as if {A, B, C, D, E}, then F. This formulation describes a rule of law that if
  facts A, B, C, D and E are established, legal consequence F follows. With such a
  rule of law, in order for the plaintiff to succeed in establishing a breach of law (legal
  consequence F), the plaintiff would need to prove facts A, B, C, D and E. These facts
  constituting the rule of law may be ultimate facts describing the elements of the claim.
  For each element, there may be primary and secondary facts that combine to establish
  the ultimate facts. The plaintiff will, therefore, need to prove the constituent primary
  and secondary facts in order to prove the ultimate facts.

  Case preparation for identifying the facts that need to be proved may be assisted by
  creating a master chart of evidence for the case showing the elements of the claim,
  the sub-elements of each element of the claim, the facts for each sub-element that
  need to be proved and the means of proof of each fact, such as evidence of lay
  or expert witnesses, documents, admissions, or answers to notices to admit facts or
  interrogatories.

  Case preparation in relation to proving the facts should be directed to the court's
  adjudicative task of finding the facts. There are three steps in the court finding the
  facts: first, evaluating the evidence before the court in order to select the evidence from
  which the court will find the facts; second, finding the facts and interpreting their fact-
  meaning from the evidence that has been selected; and third, classifying the facts that
  have been found for their legal significance after their fact-meaning has been found.2

  Fourth, apply the law to the facts. The adjudication by the court of the PIL claim
  involves syllogistic reasoning. The rule of law formulated by the court in the first
  adjudicative task is the major premise of the syllogism. The facts found by the court
  in the second adjudicative task is the minor premise of the syllogism. The court draws,
  by deductive reasoning, a conclusion from these premises as to whether the claimed
  breach of law has or has not been established. The validity of that conclusion depends
  on the validity of the premises.3 Hence, the importance of the plaintiff establishing the
  major and minor premises.

  Fifth, prove the relief. If a breach of law is established, the court has a discretion as

2. Ibid 370-5

3. Ibid 375.
                                                                                                                                                                838

  to what, if any, relief should be granted to remedy the breach of law.4 The court's
  exercise of this discretion similarly involves finding the law and the facts of relevance
  to granting the appropriate remedy. The plaintiff therefore needs to prepare its case to
  establish the law and facts that support granting the remedy sought.

  Plaintiffs need not only to prepare their own case but also to anticipate and address the
  defendant's case. There is a need to anticipate the arguments the defendant is likely to
  raise and formulate how these arguments can be pre-empted or rebutted. For example:

            Interlocutory applications -- an example is the defendant seeking an order
              that the plaintiff lodge security for costs in the event that the plaintiff is
              unsuccessful in the litigation.5 What should be the plaintiff's response? One
              response might be to rely on rules of court that protect public interest
              litigants from having to provide security for costs.6

            Challenges to the elements of the claim -- the plaintiff needs to anticipate
              and address the defence arguments that certain elements of the claim will
              not be established. An example might be that causation in climate change
              litigation has not been established.

            Arguments of law and fact by the plaintiff to establish causation -- an
              example might be to adduce evidence on climate attribution science to
              establish causation.7

            Defences to the claim -- the plaintiff needs to anticipate and address the
              defences to the claim that the defendant is likely to raise and call evidence
              to rebut those defences.

            Decline to grant relief -- the plaintiff needs to rebut any argument that the
              court should decline to grant relief because of prejudice to the defendant if
              relief is granted and to establish that the balance of convenience favours the
              grant of relief.

5. From `Go' to `Whoa'

Successful PIL depends on properly conducting the case from filing to finalisation.
Proper conduct of the case includes employing techniques and language of persuasion
from the outset and throughout the course of the litigation. The plaintiff needs to set
the tone of a winning case from the beginning.

The originating process and the pleadings must not only comply with the relevant civil
procedure requirements but also should articulate a clear, compelling and logical case.
The originating process and pleadings are an early opportunity to persuade the court
of the strength and rightness of the PIL claim. The law and facts of each element of
the claim should be pleaded clearly and compellingly, so as to persuade the court of
the ineluctability of the claim succeeding. Equally, every interlocutory application and
attendance at the court is another opportunity to persuade the court of the strength and
rightness of the claim. To that end, the plaintiff's lawyer should be well prepared and
articulate at every attendance before the trial.

The proper conduct of the trial includes making an informative opening of the case,
always being ready, maintaining control, monitoring and adaptively managing the
conduct of the case, and making a helpful and persuasive closing address.

To informatively open the case, the plaintiff's lawyer should prepare an outline to
speak to and, if practicable, provide a written outline to the court. The lawyer should
explain how each element and sub-element of the claim will be established, legally
and factually. The lawyer should use engaging rhetoric; the opening is the first
opportunity at the trial to persuade the court of the strength and rightness of the claim.
Consideration might be given to using aids for explaining the evidence, such as charts,
tables, diagrams, photographs, PowerPoint presentations, demonstrations in court or in
the field, or taking a site view to explain the evidence.

During the trial, the plaintiff's lawyer should always be ready for each step in the
conduct of the hearing. The lawyer should have the documents ready for tender,
the plaintiff's affidavits ready to be read, and the plaintiff's witnesses ready to be
called; be ready to cross-examine the defendant's witnesses; be ready to deal with the

                                                                 839
                                                                                                                                                             840

defendant's objections to the plaintiff's evidence; and be ready to answer questions
from the court. Always being ready at the hearing maintains momentum through the
trial and cultivates the ineluctability of victory.

In the conduct of the trial it is important for the plaintiff's lawyer to maintain an aura
of calm, competence and control. The lawyer needs to stay on message throughout the
trial. The lawyer should not engage in tactics or sledging of the defendant's lawyer, or
conversely be diverted or distracted by any defence tactics or sledging.

The plaintiff's lawyer needs to monitor how the case is going and adaptively respond
to the dynamics of the trial. This includes responding to the evidence adduced at
the trial by adducing further evidence to fill gaps or rebut damaging evidence, and
answering any questions or concerns of the court. The lawyer should, where possible,
adapt the legal and factual arguments and adjust the emphasis of the case to match the
state of the evidence before the court at the close of the trial.

To persuasively close the case, the plaintiff's lawyer needs to anticipate and address
the court's concerns about the PIL claim. The closing address needs to make it easier
for the court to uphold the claim. This includes showing how the court can find for the
plaintiff on the law, the facts and the remedy -- in effect, how the judgment might be
drafted in the plaintiff's favour.

In terms of the law to be applied, the closing address should explain how the legal
arguments concerning the claim fit with orthodox legal method for finding,
interpreting and applying the law. Every proposition of law should be supported by
legal authority, both statutory and case law. The court should be provided with copies
of unreported and out-of-jurisdiction authorities. The court should also be provided
with the orders the plaintiff seeks for the court to make and, where necessary, legal
authority for making the orders.

In terms of the facts to be found, the closing address should identify and summarise the
evidence that the plaintiff submits should be selected by the court and the findings of
fact the court should make from that evidence, with exhibit and transcript references.
Where the evidence is voluminous, consideration may be given to providing the court
with a compendium of extracts of key documents, transcript or evidence that the
841

plaintiff's lawyer will refer to in the closing address, annotated with exhibit references
to assist the court.

 6. Too Far Gone

  Not all PIL can be successful. As Scottish poet Robert Burns observed in his poem
  `To a Mouse', even the best-laid schemes of mice and men oft go awry. Nevertheless,
  a lack of success in a case can still prove to be of use. Unsuccessful PIL can influence
  and change behaviour of governments and the private sector. Unsuccessful climate
  litigation has prompted change in government and corporate behaviour.1 Lessons
  can also be learnt from unsuccessful PIL for bringing successful PIL in the future,
  either in the same jurisdiction or other jurisdictions. The claims or arguments might
  be changed or refined, or different evidence adduced.2 Unsuccessful PIL can also
  raise public awareness, effecting a change in social consciousness, which may in
  turn influence the behaviour of governments and the private sector.3 In these ways,
  unsuccessful PIL is not too far gone; it just has further to go.

7. The Path Ahead

This chapter has sought to offer law students guidance in the ways of handling the
legal tools of substantive and procedural law to the law-job end of litigation. It offers
practical tips and techniques on how to plan, prepare and conduct climate change
PIL. These tips and techniques draw on the knowledge and experience of senior
environmental litigators. They are not a substitute for experiential learning on the job,
but hopefully they light a path that can beneficially be followed by a student aspiring
to be a climate conscious lawyer.

Glossary

Aboriginal freehold

      A statutory tenure that varies from state-to-state (and territory) but broadly is
      available to Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander people on the basis that it is
      inalienable. Depending on the statutory scheme involved, it may be held by
      individual Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander people or may be held on trust for
      Indigenous people generally, or to groups of people with connection to that land.
      The term differentiates native title from other forms of statutory Aboriginal and
      Torres Strait Islander land ownership.

Access to justice

      Access to justice is a central element of the rule of law. It refers to the need for
      the system to be equally accessible to all and lead to results that are individually
      and socially just.[1]

      [1] Mauro Cappelletti and Bryant Garth, `Access to Justice: The Newest Wave in
      the Worldwide Movement to Make Rights Effective' (1978) 27(2) Buffalo Law
      Review 181).

Actus reus

      Latin for `a guilty act'; the physical or external element(s) that need to be proved
      for the accused to be found guilty of criminal offence; usually some form of
      conduct (act or omission), circumstance in which the conduct occurred, or the
      result of the conduct. See also mens rea.

Adaptation

      The process of adjustment to actual or expected climate and its effects (IPCC,
      Climate Change 2022: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability).

                                                                 848
849

Adaptive capacity

      Adaptive capacity refers to the ability of systems, institutions, humans and other
      organisms to adjust to potential damage, take advantage of opportunities and
      respond to consequences. This definition comes from the Intergovernmental
      Panel on Climate Change: see IPCC (2022) Climate Change 2022: Impacts,
      Adaptation and Vulnerability. Contribution of Working Group II to the Sixth
      Assessment Report. Cambridge University Press.

Administrator

      The term administrator refers to the insolvency professional who is appointed
      to administer a company in voluntary administration. Only registered liquidators
      can be appointed as administrators.

Alienation

      The legal transfer of land from one legal person to another, sometimes for value
      (money) or by gift or other assignment.

Anthropocentrism

      Centred on the human. Western thought tends to be anthropocentric because it
      puts human beings and human values at the centre of everything.

Attribution science

      Attribution science refers to `the process of evaluating the relative contributions
      of multiple causal factors to a change or event with assessment of confidence'.[1]
      In the context of climate change, attribution science is used to provide evidence
      of: (i) how human activities affect the global climate system (climate change
      attribution); (ii) how changes in the global climate system affect other
      interconnected natural and human systems (impact attribution); (iii) how changes
      in the global climate system affect the frequency, magnitude, and other
      characteristics of extreme events (extreme event attribution); and (iv) the relative
      contributions of different actors and activities to global climate change (source
      attribution).[2]
                                                                                                                                                             850

Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC)

      Australia's lead regulator for implementing and enforcing Australian Consumer
      Law.

Bail

      A form of conditional liberty; person arrested for a criminal offence may be
      released from custody on the condition that they undertake to appear in court at a
      specified future time and potentially subject to other conditions.

Bankruptcy

      A legal process, governed by the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth), allowing an
      individual to obtain permanent release from debts that cannot be repaid.

Carbon sequestration

      Carbon dioxide can be removed from the atmosphere and held in liquid or solid
      forms by natural processes such as photosynthesis, or artificial carbon capture
      and storage activities. Carbon sequestration is recognised as an important method
      to absorb carbon emissions produced by activities, which are contributing to
      anthropogenically induced climate change. Along with reducing GHGs at their
      source, carbon sequestration is one of the two methods of mitigating climate
      change.

Circular economy

      The model of production and consumption, which involves sharing, leasing,
851

      reusing, repairing, refurbishing and recycling existing materials and products as
      long as possible. In this way the life cycle of products is extended.

Civil disobedience

      Breaking the law with the aim of persuading the authorities to change the law or
      government policy; the `civility' of such law-breaking is usually seen as requiring
      that it be done in public, in good conscience, with a preparedness to be arrested,
      and without violence.

Climate Co-Curricular Program

      Co-curriculums are learning activities and experiences that extend beyond the
      formal academic programs while complementing them. In legal education, co-
      curricular programs often focus on professional practice, skills development,
      and addressing contemporary issues. Climate and sustainability co-curricular
      programs have gained prominence in higher education in the last decade. They
      aim to enhance students' understanding of climate-related issues, build skills for
      assisting clients affected by climate change or hoping to create positive climate
      impact and encourage students to reflect on current climate-related laws and
      policies through bridging theoretical learning with practical experience.

Climate conscious consumption

      The idea that consumers can make purchasing choices that will shape the market
      to drive change for climate mitigation and adaptation because the more
      consumers purchase more climate-friendly products, the more businesses will be
      incentivised to take climate action to attract more consumers.

Climate greenwashing

      Greenwashing where the false, misleading or deceptive environmental claims
      relate to the climate credentials (mitigation or adaption) of a product, service,
      brand or company.
                                                                                                                                                             852

Climate justice

      There are many definitions of climate justice. The definition by the Climate
      Justice Global Alliance states that `climate justice advocates for equitable
      solutions that prioritize the needs of those who are most affected by climate
      change, strive to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and ensure that the burdens
      and benefits of climate action are distributed fairly, taking into account historical
      and systemic inequalities.' Climate justice has various aspects:

      - Distributive justice: paying attention to inequalities in the causes, burdens of
      addressing and experience of impacts.
      - Procedural justice: ensuring participatory, accessible, fair and inclusive
      processes to address climate change.
      - Recognition justice: centring voices of those who have historically been
      marginalised, such as First Nations in Australia.
      - Reparative or corrective justice: considering what actions are necessary to
      redress and repair harms caused

Climate litigation

      Cases where climate change is a central issue in the dispute, climate change is
      raised as a peripheral issue, climate change is one motivation behind the case,
      or where the case has implications for mitigation or adaptation (Jacqueline Peel
      and Hari Osofsky, Climate Change Litigation: Regulatory Pathways to Cleaner
      Energy, Cambridge University Press, 2015, p. 8).

Climate wars

      Climate wars in Australia refers to the acute political contestation and
      polarisation in Australia in relation to the necessity and level of state response to
      climate action.

Clinical Legal Education

      Clinical Legal Education (`CLE') is a form of experiential learning in which
      law students are placed in the role of lawyers working under the supervision of
      qualified lawyers and learn by doing in a clinic (a clinical legal education subject
853

      or program) setting. Key is the engagement in a process of supervisory feedback
      and reflection on experience.

Commons

      In Australia, a parcel of land reserved by the Crown for the use and enjoyment of
      local people within a specified area.

      Historically, common lands were a widespread and essential feature of the
      landscape across England, Wales, Scotland, and much of Europe. These lands
      were not privately owned in the modern sense but were instead governed by
      strictly enforced locally created laws that allowed communities to access and use
      common lands for a variety of purposes, such as grazing livestock, collecting
      firewood, cutting turf, or growing crops.

      Commons have played a central role in sustaining rural ecologies, economies,
      and livelihoods, and supported intricate systems of social organisation and
      cooperation, with rules and obligations that were often deeply embedded in
      local legal cultures. Commons were more than just physical spaces--they were
      legal, cultural, and economic institutions that underpinned the collective life of
      communities.

      In England, a piece of land in a feudal manor reserved for the use of local
      commoners to graze livestock or grow food. There are four main rights of
      common: piscary (the right to fish), turbary (the right to take turf or peat for use
      as fuel), estover (the right to remove timber from land for immediate use), and
      pasture (the right to graze livestock).

Community Legal Centre

      The community legal centre (`CLC') movement began in the early 1970s, driven
      by students, academics, young workers and lawyers. Currently, there are
      approximately 200 CLCs across Australia. They provide free and independent
      legal support to people experiencing hardships but unable to access regular paid
      legal services due to socioeconomic disadvantage. Their services span across
      civil, family and criminal law. In addition to providing legal services, CLCs also
                                                                                                                                                             854

      participate in community legal education, law reform and advocacy to mobilise
      change and support the community in a holistic way.

Community legal education

      Community legal education refers to the provision of legal information and
      education to the general public, community groups, schools and other agencies.
      Its goal is to enhance understanding of the law, legal rights and responsibilities,
      and how to identify, prevent and i legal issues. Community legal education is
      considered to be an effective early intervention and prevention strategy, helping
      individuals and communities build resilience by addressing legal problems before
      they escalate.

Compensatory damages

      A form of damages that aims to put a person, as nearly as possible, in the position
      that they would have been had the contract been performed or the tort not been
      committed.[1]

      [1] Lewis v Australian Capital Territory (2020) 271 CLR 192.

Compensatory federalism

      Compensatory federalism describes the operation of a federal system of
      government where there are overlapping, dual sources of power across the
      national and sub-national governments, and this allows for the sub-national units
      to `step up' (or `compensate') when the national government fails to act.[1]

      [1] Alan Fenna, `Climate Governance and Federalism in Australia' in Alan
      Fenna, Sbastian Jodoin, and Joana Setzer (eds) Climate Governance and
      Federalism: A Forum of Federations Comparative Policy Analysis (CUP, 2023),
      1, 28-29.

Compulsory Licensing

      A grant of a licence by courts to use an IP rights (such as a patent) without
855

      the consent of the IP owner under certain terms such as payment of royalties or
      making it available to the public

Confidential Information

      Non-public information disclosed with restrictions placed on its dissemination

Consumerism

      The idea that people should pursue their individual interests, and realised their
      personal identity and social status through the consumption of various goods and
      services.

Copyright

      A legal right to protect particular forms of expression of ideas and information
      (such as writing, software, artistic or musical works and associated films, sounds
      recordings etc.) from copying. There is no registration requirement for copyright.

Cosmology

      Encompasses both ontology and epistemology, and refers to a way of
      understanding normative relations in the world and the universe. The term is
      often used to refer to a culturally situated way of being and knowing, such
      as Indigenous cosmology or Christian cosmology, which each offer a distinct
      account of creation and meaning. While each cosmology exists among and in
      relationship with others, in what has been called a `pluriverse', some cosmologies
      make claims to universality. Cosmology also refers to the western scientific study
      of the universe and its origins.

Country

      Country is a word that holds many different meanings for First Nations people,
      especially given the diversity of First Nations across Australia. There are certain
      concepts and ideas about Country that many First Nations people share. For
      instance: Country is alive. Country is timeless. And Country is us. Country
      refers to the lands, waterways, seas and skies to which First Nations peoples are
                                                                                                                                                             856

      connected through ancestral ties and family origins. Country also encompasses
      relationships, such as relationships with plants, relationships with animals and
      relationships with Ancestors. Country is a proper noun, which is why it should be
      capitalised.

Creative Commons Licences

      A licence that permits use in certain conditions without the payment of licensing
      fees or royalties. Conditions can include requiring the attribution of authors
      and licencing derivative works under similar conditions. Types of use such as
      commercial use can be restricted.

Crown Use

      Use of an IP right for government purposes without the consent of the IP owner.

Cultural Awareness/Cultural Competency

      The skills of cultural awareness/competency requires a recognition that
      Indigenous knowledges are an important, unique element of Australian society,
      which contributes to economic productivity by equipping people with the
      capacity to work across Australian society and in particular with First Nations
      communities.

Damages

      A sum of money awarded to a plaintiff at the conclusion of a successful lawsuit
      in satisfaction for the wrong suffered by the plaintiff.

Debt agreement

      A legal alternative to bankruptcy, governed by Part IX of the Bankruptcy Act
      1966 (Cth), in which an individual's creditors agree accept only a portion of the
      debts they are owed, to be paid in regular instalments over a period of three to
      five years.
857

Declaration

      An order made by a court that conclusively pronounces the existence or non-
      existence of rights or obligations concerning the parties before it.[1]

      [1] Katy Barnett and Sirko Harder, Remedies in Australian Private Law (2nd ed,
      Cambridge University Press, 2018) 420.

Decolonisation

      Decolonisation occurs when First Nations people or non-Indigenous people
      reverse impacts of colonisation. Decolonisation seeks to remedy the aftermath
      of colonisation through direct action and listening to the voices of First Nations
      people. First Nations people can decolonise through self-determination, that is
      taking care of their own affairs. Non-Indigenous people can decolonise by
      making a conscious effort to prioritise and learn about First Nations culture and
      values.

Deed of company arrangement

      A deed of company arrangement is the formal agreement entered into between
      a company in financial distress and its creditors where creditors voted in favour
      of the deed when deciding on the fate of a company in voluntary administration.
      An administrator will be appointed in respect of the company operating under a
      deed of company arrangement. Only registered liquidators can be appointed to
      administer a company under a deed of company arrangement.

Deliberative multilateral forums

      Deliberative multilateral forums (such as citizens assemblies) are forums
      designed to bring together a wide cross-section of the public to deliberate in
      a structured and informed way to understand issues and reach collaborative
      decisions.

Design

      An exclusive exploitation right that protects the overall visual appearance of new
                                                                                                                                                             858

      and distinctive products for a registration period of five years, with a further
      registration renewal available.

Easement

      A right that benefits land (dominant tenant) through the non-possessory use of
      land of another person (servient tenement). Easements can be positive or negative
      in nature. For example, an easement for the flow of air, or an easement for support
      of a building (so it doesn't fall over!).

Ecocentrism

      Earth or ecologically-centred.

Ecocide

      `unlawful or wanton acts committed with knowledge that there is a substantial
      likelihood of severe and either widespread or long-term damage to the
      environment being caused by those acts' (Independent Expert Panel for the Legal
      Definition of Ecocide).

Emergency, defence of

      A statutory defence to a criminal charge, whereby an accused person is not
      guilty if they reasonably believe that `circumstances of sudden or extraordinary
      emergency exists, committing the offence is the only reasonable way to deal
      with the emergency, and the conduct is a reasonable response to the emergency'
      (Commonwealth Criminal Code 1995, s 10.3); the wording of the defence differs
      across the jurisdictions; based upon the common law defence of necessity, which
      still applies in New South Wales, South Australia and Tasmania.

Environment and planning law

      Environmental and planning law is a broad area of laws that regulates human
      activities that interact with, and may impact upon, the environment - both in
      natural and modified form.[1] It encompasses regulation of areas such as land
      use planning and development control, heritage protection, coastal management,
859

      biodiversity conservation, national parks, pollution control, water management,
      climate change and others. Licencing, approvals, and permits are a key method of
      regulating specific activities under environmental and planning laws.

      [1] Rachel Baird, Environmental Law (Thomson Reuters, 2012) 1-3.

Environmental Protection Provisions

      Provisions in a constitution that require governments to undertake environmental
      protection or limits on government power to restrict environmental degradation.
      These include duties placed on governments to protect the environment, rights of
      citizens to a healthy environment and rights of nature itself to flourish.

Epistemology

      A theory of knowledge. Epistemology asks how human beings know what (we
      think) we know. Is knowledge always socially situated? Is knowledge necessarily
      subjective?

Experimental use

      An exception to the patent-holder's exclusive right of use that allows the use of
      another's patented device when the use is for inquiry, curiosity, or amusement.

Expert Opinion (s 79)

      s 79 (commonly referred to as the expert opinion exception (though the section
      does not actually use the term `expert'), is an exception to the exclusionary rule
      in s 76. It allows certain witnesses to offer opinion evidence, subject to the
      threshold questions of relevance (discussed above), where the witness possesses
      `specialised knowledge based on training, study or experience' and the opinion is
      `wholly or substantially based on' that specialised knowledge. The recent High
      Court decision in Lang v The Queen [2023] HCA 29 has, arguably, unified the
      approach for all Australian jurisdictions, by relying on the UEL framework in a
      case from Queensland (one of the remaining common law jurisdictions). While
      cases have held that the (specialised) knowledge, `"connotes more than subjective
      belief or unsupported speculation. The term applies to any body of known facts
                                                                                                                                                             860

      or to any body of ideas inferred from such facts or accepted as truths on good
      grounds"' (see Re Tang [2006] NSWCCA 167, [138] quoting Daubert v Merrell
      Dow Pharmaceuticals Inc 509 US 579 (1993)), Australian courts have rejected
      arguments that s 79 should be interpreted to include an expectation that the expert
      opinion has to be shown to be reliable or trustworthy before it is admitted.

External administration

      External administration implies that an external party (other than directors) has
      officially become involved in the administration of the company. This typically
      occurs in respect of insolvent companies and can involve the external party
      displacing the directors (as in the case of voluntary administration or liquidation),
      or operating alongside the directors (as in the case of small business
      restructuring).

Fair Dealing

      A copyright defence which allows use of a copyright work for limited specific
      purposes.

Fossil fuel

      An energy source formed in the Earth's crust from decayed organic material. The
      common fossil fuels are petroleum, coal, and natural gas.[1]

Fossil fuel hegemony

      Fossil fuel hegemony refers to the dominant, and over-represented influence that
      the fossil fuel industry has in relation to state actions (including laws, policies and
      political discourse) to maintain the status quo and delay actions combat climate
      change.[1]

Free Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC)

      Free Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) is a right to be consulted and included in
      decision-making about projects and activities impacting on First People and their
      lands. It is contained in Articles 18 and 19 of the United Nations Declaration on
      the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. The essential elements of FPIC are:

      Free - should imply no coercion, intimidation or manipulation. This ensures that
      Indigenous people can make decisions about projects or activities affecting their
      lands, territories, and resources in an autonomous and self-directed manner.
      Prior - consent should be sought in advance and with sufficient time for
      community consultation and decision-making processes to take place.
      Informed - should imply that information is provided that covers the nature
      and scale of any project or activity; its purpose, locality and duration; and an
      assessment on the likely economic, social, cultural and environmental impact,
      including potential risks; fair and equitable benefit-sharing; and any persons and
      organisations involved.

Fringe Benefits Tax (FBT)

      A Commonwealth government tax paid by employers on non-salary benefits
      provided to employees or their associates as a reward for services, such as private
      use of a car or reimbursement of personal expenses. FBT is separate from income
      tax and is calculated on the grossed-up value of the benefit.[1]

      [1] Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986 (Cth).

Future Generations Commission

Green lawfare

      Green lawfare is a term used by opponents of climate action to describe `the
      law and the institutions and processes of the law ... to conduct a kind of social,
      political or environmental warfare by other means.'[1]

Greenhouse gas emissions

      Sources of greenhouse gases - which may be natural or anthropogenic (i.e.
      caused by human activity).

Greenhouse gases

Indefeasibility

      The legal protection of an interest in land held by a registered proprietor against
      unregistered interests in that land, subject only to prior registered interests and
      except in the case of fraud or an exception otherwise recognised by statute or
      law. Indefeasibility applies to Torrens System land as a key feature of the Torrens
      System of land title by registration.

Indigenous Laws and Customs (s 78A)

      As Indigenous laws in Australia are handed down, generation to generation, in
      the form of oral history, testimony about the content of those laws would be
      contrary to both the rule against hearsay and the rule against opinion evidence.
      Section 78A of the UEL is an attempt to overcome these dual problems in
      relation to evidence about customary indigenous laws in Australia. The general
      rule established in s 76 is that evidence of an opinion is not admissible to prove
      the existence of a fact about the existence of which the opinion was expressed.
      Section 78A states that an opinion expressed by a member of an indigenous group
      about the existence or non-existence, or the content, of the traditional laws and
      customs of that group, may be admissible as evidence of the existence of that
      traditional law or custom.

Indigenous Peoples/ First Nations/Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders

      Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples are the first peoples of Australia,
      meaning they were here for thousands of years prior to colonisation. Current
      research confirms that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples have lived
      on the Australian continent for upwards of 60,000 years. While estimates vary,
      this figure represents the most widely accepted timeframe based on available
      evidence. Australia is made up of many different and distinct Aboriginal and
      Torres Strait Islander groups, each with their own culture, language, beliefs
                                                                                                                                                             864

      and practices. Aboriginal people come from the mainland of Australia and its
      surrounding islands. The Torres Strait region is located between the tip of Cape
      York and Papua New Guinea and is made up of over two hundred islands. First
      Nations is a collective term that refers to Indigenous peoples of a nation, region
      or place. Indigenous peoples refers to the people with historical and ancestral ties
      to a place that pre-date colonisation, and is the term used by the United Nations
      in its Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. All these collective terms
      can be used respectfully. As proper nouns, all should be used with a capital letter.

Indigenous Sovereignty

      The Uluru Statement from the Heart expresses the idea of sovereignty as a
      spiritual notion. It expressed it this way: `The ancestral tie between Country
      and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples who were born therefrom,
      remain attached thereto, and must one day return thither to be united with our
      ancestors'. Sovereignty means exercising autonomy, both at an individual level
      and as a people. It encompasses an obligation to look after Country for future
      generations. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders have always been sovereign
      peoples, who practised sovereignty differently from European nation states. Their
      obligations were not to some hierarchical god, represented by a monarch. Their
      obligations were to their law and they were responsible for the maintenance of
      Country for the benefit of future carers of law and Country.

Injunction or Injunctive Relief

      A coercive remedy originating in equity in the form of a court order compelling a
      party to do or not to do something.

Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)

      The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is an intergovernmental
      body of the United Nations that publish interim reports advancing scientific
      consensus about climate change caused by human activities.

Intersectionality

      Intersectionality is a social theory and a framework for understanding how
      multiple aspects of a person's identity, such as race, class, gender, sexuality
      and ability - intersect to create unique experiences of discrimination, privilege,
      oppression and social positioning. Intersectionality is a term that was theorised
      by critical legal scholar Kimberl Crenshaw in 1989 to highlight how Black
      women's experiences were often overlooked by both feminist and anti-racist
      movements, because those movements tended to treat race and gender as separate
      issues.

Inventive Step

Judicial Notice (s 144)

      Judicial Notice is a common law doctrine which has been adopted by the Uniform
      Evidence Laws. Section 144 of the UEL provides that provides that "proof
      is not required about knowledge that is not reasonably open to question and
      is (a) common knowledge in the locality in which the proceeding is being
      held or generally; or (b) capable of verification by reference to a document
      the authority of which cannot reasonably be questioned". The Australian Law
      Reform Commission notes that matters of `common knowledge' is understood
      to mean those facts which are so broadly understood that requiring confirmation
      would be a waste of effort. For instance, the fact that on a sunny day the sky
                                                                                                                                                             866

      appears blue, or that sea water is salty. Note that while evidence is not required
      for matters that fall within the doctrine, parties are not precluded from leading
      evidence about these matters.

      Section 144(2) provides that a judge may acquire common knowledge or
      knowledge sourced in an authoritative document in any way that the judge thinks
      fit. If the judge decides that judicial notice applies, the court (including a jury, if
      there is one) must take this common knowledge into account (s 144(3)).

      Finally, s 144(4) provides that parties to a proceeding must be given the
      opportunity to make submissions as to how this common knowledge should be
      acquired or taken into account. The ARLC states that this requirement reinforces
      judicial obligation to accord natural justice to parties to a proceeding.

Judicial review

      Examination by a court of the legality (rather than the substantive merits) of an
      administrative decision.

Jurisdiction

      Jurisdiction refers to the scope of a court's authority to decide matters. It comes
      from the Latin `juris' (the law) and `dicto' (to say or declare).

Just transition

      The terms `just transition' refers to the transition away from a fossil fuel economy
      to low-carbon and environmentally sustainable economies and societies. It is
      `just' if no one is left behind during the transition, for example workers in the
      fossil fuel industry, who should be supported to learn other skills they can use in
      other industries.[1]

      and determined by the application of legal principles and methods by the courts.

Law reform

      Changing laws, or law reform, involves processes and practices that might
      involve government institutions and non-government agencies, protests, court
      decisions and elections.

Legal Assistance Sector

      The legal assistance sector is a term that describes the public legal service
      system in Australia. It is a collection of publicly funded legal services that
      deliver free assistance to people who cannot afford private legal assistance and
      who experience discrimination and/or disadvantage. This sector is comprised of
      various organisational providers including Legal Aid Commissions, Community
      Legal Centres, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Services and Family
      Violence Prevention and Legal Services. The legal assistance sector is highly
      varied and each organisational agency varies in its size, composition, location,
      reach, and the range and type of legal services that they provide.

Legal Constitutionalism

      An approach to drafting a constitution that involves the inclusion of detailed
      limits on government power to be enforced by courts. This contrasts with
      constitutions written in a political constitutionalist model. Such constitutions are
      typically more skeletal. They set up a robust democratic system and rely on
      political means, such as public debate and parliamentary scrutiny, to weed out
      government wrongdoing.

Legal Preparedness

      `Preparedness' refers to a state of being ready for something to happen, especially
      for a disaster.[1] In the context of disaster law and climate change, `legal
      preparedness' can be understood as activities or initiatives that aim to reduce
                                                                                                                                                   868

the risk of legal issues arising for individuals or communities prior to a disaster/
extreme weather event occurring and to equip them with tools to manage and
recover from legal challenges arising from such events.

Examples of legal preparedness initiatives can be observed in the work of
community legal centres. They include:

- Sharing legal information through various channels;

- Conducting community legal education to raise awareness of potential legal
problems, such as insurance disputes, and strategies for legal protection;

- Encouraging the safe keeping of key legal documents by promoting `digital
inclusion'; and

- Developing legal information resources to highlight the intersection of legal
problems caused by disasters.

Legal Relevance and Discretionary Exclusion (s 135)

Section 135 was included in the proposed uniform evidence law to replace the
concept of `legal relevance' under the common law. Section 55 of the UEL
refers to the capacity of the evidence to `rationally affect the assessment of the
probability of the existence of a fact in issue' and is a low threshold requiring
only a logical connection between the evidence in questions and proof of a fact
in issue. By contrast, `legal relevance' was said to enable the judge to make
a qualitative assessment of the probative value evidence and exclude evidence
where the connection was considered to be insufficient. Section 135 allows
a judge to exclude evidence where the probative value of the evidence is
substantially outweighed by the risk that it will be, `misleading, confusing or
cause an undue waste of time'. The section also allows the judge to exclude
evidence carrying a risk of unfair prejudice where that risk substantially
outweighs the probative value of the evidence. In criminal cases, under s 137,
the trial judge must exclude prosecution evidence where the probative value of
869

      the evidence is outweighed by the risk of unfair prejudice to the defendant. The
      scope of the application of s 135 or 137 has been narrowed, however. Following
      a controversial High Court majority judgment, the current position in Australia
      is that in undertaking the balancing exercise contained in the UEL, s 135 (that
      applies in all cases) and s 137 (that applies only in criminal cases), probative
      value is to be assessed without considering the reliability of the evidence in
      question, as reliability is to be reserved for the finder of fact. In the context of
      civil litigation, the judge as both the trier of fact and of law and so judges are
      generally less likely to exercise their discretion to exclude evidence, preferring
      such considerations to be taken into account when considering the weight to be
      given to evidence. However, find that even `at its highest' there is some scope for
      the trial judge to find that the evidence is `weak and unconvincing' and exclude
      it under either s 135 or s 137.

Legal Subject

      The holder of legal rights, ordinarily theorised as a construct of law. Natural
      persons are legal subjects when they are recognised as such by a legal system.
      Corporations are made into legal subjects by corporations law. Some have argued
      that legal subjectivity ought to be extended to natural entities, such as rivers.

Liberal democracy / Liberal democratic tradition

      Liberal democracy / Liberal democratic tradition refers to a system of
      government that reflects three key conditions, including democratic government
      (usually through representative government based on regular elections), limited
      government (through a number of mechanisms including the rule of law,
      independent judiciary and judicial review, separation of powers and federalism),
      and the protection of individual liberties against the state, with a priority given to
      civil and political rights.

Liquidation

      Liquidation refers to the process whereby which a liquidator takes control of a
      company and its assets, investigates the affairs of the company, realises company

      fundamentally and iteratively shape each other.

Native title

      Native title describes a property interest in land in two different ways. It is both
      (1) an interest held by Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander people under the
      traditional law and custom of the Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander people
      connected with that land; and (2) the recognition of those rights by the common
      law.[1]

Policy capture

Policy capture refers to the `process of consistently or repeatedly directing public
policy decisions away from the public interest towards the interests of a specific

Political Constitutionalism

An approach to drafting a constitution that emphasises political institutions and
processes to hold governments accountable. The expectation is that political
means, such as public debate and parliamentary scrutiny, will effectively weed
out government wrongdoing. This contrasts with constitutions written in a legal
constitutionalist model. Such constitutions typically include more detailed limits
on government power to be enforced by courts.

Probative Value

      The UEL dictionary defines `probative value' as, `the extent to which the
      evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence
      of a fact in issue' (emphasis added). The probative value of the evidence is the
      maximum capacity of the evidence to affect (directly or indirectly) the assessment
      of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue in the proceedings. The High
      Court in IMM v The Queen [2016] HCA 14 has held that in assessing probative
      value (in the context of balancing it against the danger of `unfair prejudice') a
      judge is to take the evidence `at its highest', which has been interpreted to mean
      that a judge cannot to consider the reliability of the evidence when assessing the
      probative value of the evidence in the context of an admissibility challenge

Public health law

      Public health law aims to create the conditions for people to lead healthy,
      fulfilling lives. It encompasses the prevention of public health `nuisances' or
      local/environmental risks to health, infectious disease control, and the prevention
      of non-communicable diseases, as well as establishing the public health
      institutions, powers, and functions of government. In addition to public health
      Acts, the field encompasses dedicated legislation on significant public health

      challenging, and the term has not been definitively defined by legislation or by
      the courts: see, e.g., Chris Wheeler, `The Public Interest Revisited - We Know
      It's Important But Do We Know What it Means?' (2016) 72 Australian Institute

Public law

      Public law conventionally refers to the law governing the state, specifically, the
      exercise of state power. It includes the design of institutions exercising state
      power; the distribution of power amongst these institutions; the nature of their
      exercise; and the public law principles that traditionally govern their operation
      (including federalism, representative government, separation of powers and the

Regulatory frameworks

      A regulatory framework governs the conduct of companies, organisations and
      individuals operating in the regulated industry or sector. The framework
      comprises legislation (Acts, regulations and rules) as well as procedures,
      guidelines and standards.

Relationality

      This is a cultural, legal and philosophical foundation for First Nations people
      that encompasses the central relationships of life and extends to people and to

Relevance

      Under the UEL, `relevance' is a first threshold rule of admissibility. Section 56
      of the UEL provides that if evidence is found to be `relevant' then it will be
      admissible as long as it it not otherwise excluded by other rules (for example, the
      rule against hearsay, in s 59 or the opinion rule in s 76). Conversely evidence
      that is not relevant in the proceedings is never admissible. Relevance is defined
      in s 55 of the UEL as evidence that "if it were accepted, could rationally affect
      (directly or indirectly) the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact
      in issue in the proceeding" (emphasis added). It can include evidence relevant
      only to the credibility of a witness (which will be relevant indirectly to a fact in
      issue). The s 55 definition provides a low threshold in so far as all that is required
      is a rational connection to a fact in issue in the proceedings (if the evidence
      were accepted); under the common law this was referred to as `logical relevance'.
      The common law concept of `legal relevance' is incorporated into s 135 of the
      UEL, that allows the judge to exclude evidence where the probative value of
      the evidence is substantially outweighed by the danger that it will be unfairly
      prejudicial to a party, be misleading or confusing, of cause or result in an undue
      waste of time.

Systems thinking

      Systems thinking is a holistic approach to understanding complex problems by
      examining how parts of a system interact, influence one another and contribute to

The `opinion rule' (s 76)

      A fundamental principle of the adversarial trial (whether criminal or civil) is that
      witnesses offer their evidence by way of a narrative of fact(s) and refrain from
      offering their opinion or interpretation of those facts. Thus, witnesses are required
      to give evidence in relation to facts about which they have personal knowledge
      - so what they `saw, heard or otherwise perceived' - not their opinion as to the
      significance of what they saw or heard or perceived. This principle recognises
      that witnesses should not trespass on the role of the fact-finder (whether a jury
      or a judicial officer) whose role it is to absorb the information presented, draw
      inferences about the meaning or significance of evidence, and reach a conclusion
      about whether the party bearing the relevant onus of proof has succeeded in
      proving their case to the requisite standard (which in civil cases is on the `balance
      of probabilities, see s 140.) This exclusionary principle is codified under the UEL
      in s 76 which prohibits witnesses from offering their opinion if the purpose of
      adducing that opinion is proving the truth of the facts asserted in that opinion.
      There are three main exceptions to the exclusionary rule contained in s 76,
      an exception for `lay opinion' in s 78, a relatively new exception that allows
      members of an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander group to offer opinions about
      the existence or content of their own traditional laws and customs (s 78A), and s
      79, the exception for witnesses possessing `specialised knowledge'.

Torrens System

      The State guaranteed system of indefeasible land titles recorded on Registers
      of land holdings in Australian states and territories. Rather than registering pre-
      existing interests in land, the Torrens System is renowned for creating title to land
                                                                                                                                                             882

      only via the register. Hence, it is described as a system of `title by registration'
      (distinct from previous systems for registration of title).

Trade Mark

      A trade mark is a sign (logo, name, colour shape etc) that distinguishes unique
      goods or services from other competitors in the market.

Trade secret

      Confidential information that can give a business a competitive advantage over
      another business.

Transboundary harm

      Adverse effects experienced in one State caused by or originating from an area

Uniform Evidence Law (UEL)

      Uniform Evidence Law (UEL) refers to the evidentiary and procedural regime
      governed primarily by an Evidence Act that is based on the Model Evidence Bill
      drafts produced by the Australian Law Reform Commission in response to their
      Evidence Inquiry 1980 - 1987, rather that the common law. Jurisdictions that
      have adopted the UEL are New South Wales, Victoria, the ACT, the Northern
      Territory, Tasmania, Norfolk Island and the Commonwealth. All of these
      jurisdictions have adopted an Evidence Act that mirrors in most substantive
      respects thethe Evidence Act 1995 (NSW/Cth). Some sections of the UEL were
      amended or added following the 2004 - 2005 Review by the Australian Law
      Reform Commission, the New South Wales Law Reform Commission and the
      Victorian Law Reform Commission. While not all the Acts are exactly uniform
      in each jurisdiction, the differences are relatively minor.

Voluntary administration

      Voluntary administration refers to the formal process whereby which an
      administrator is appointed to a company in financial distress. The administrator
883

      will investigate the affairs and report to creditors. Creditors will vote to determine
      the outcome of the voluntary administration process. There are three possible
      outcomes: creditors can vote to return the company to the directors; to liquidate
      the company; or to enter into a Deed of Company Arrangement (DOCA).

World Bank

      World Bank is an international development organisation and research institution
      owned by 189 member countries. Its primary role is to reduce poverty by
      providing financial assistance to the governments of lower-income countries to
      support economic development and improve living standards. It also offers policy
      advice in sectors such as health, education, nutrition, finance, justice, law, and the
      environment.[1]
