ABOUT THIS BOOK

This book is designed to support students undertaking legal studies and contribute to developing research
skills in New Zealand law schools.

Essential Legal Research Skills in Aotearoa New Zealand is organised into six parts:

   Part 1: The New Zealand Legal System briefly introduces the two New Zealand legal systems:
      tikanga Mori and state law.

   Part 2: Research Skills introduces the concept of legal research, identifies the key sources of legal
      information and emphasises the importance of researching strategically.

   Part 3: Case Law provides an introduction on how to locate cases by citation or topic and how to
      judge a case's reliability.

   Part 4: Legislation helps students learn about the parliamentary process, how to find legislation
      and the materials used for statutory interpretation.

   Part 5: Secondary Sources focuses on the role of secondary sources in legal research.
   Part 6: The New Zealand Law Style Guide assists students in using the New Zealand-specific

      legal referencing style.

This book is general in nature and is designed to be institution and database neutral. The authors
acknowledge tikanga as a source of law in Aotearoa New Zealand and hope to expand this content with te
ao Mori expertise in a future edition of this book.

 1.

 THE NEW ZEALAND LEGAL SYSTEMS:
 TIKANGA MORI AND STATE LAW

     Kate Thompson

  Aotearoa New Zealand has two legal systems: tikanga Mori and state law.
  In 2023, Te Aka Matua o te Ture | New Zealand Law Commission produced an extensive study paper He
  Poutama1 in which it addresses the interaction between tikanga Mori and state law.

 Tikanga Mori

  Tikanga Mori, also known as Mori customary law, is a "structured framework, comprising tikanga
  concepts (principles, values and norms) and the processes and procedures (sometimes called kawa) for
  enforcing those concepts".2
  Te Khui Ture o Aotearoa | New Zealand Law Society has produced a Practise Briefing to provide guidance
  to lawyers on the relevance of tikanga Mori, which states:3

         In 2022, the Supreme Court in Ellis v R confirmed that tikanga has and will continue to influence
         the common law in Aotearoa New Zealand in cases where it is relevant. The Court observed
         that tikanga forms part of the law through incorporation in statutes and regulations, is a relevant
         consideration in the exercise of discretions, and is incorporated in the policies and processes of public
         bodies. The majority in Ellis also recognised that tikanga is the first law of Aotearoa New Zealand
         and that care is required not to impair the operation of tikanga as a system of law and custom in its
         own right. There are also several other cases that have confirmed tikanga is part of New Zealand law.

State Law

State law is a common law system consisting of statute law enacted by Acts of Parliament and case law, in
which the judiciary may apply and interpret the statutes or make decisions of law where no statute exists.
This is also called judge-made law.

       Throughout this book the main focus will be on state law. For further information about

INTRODUCTION TO LEGAL RESEARCH

   Catherine Doughty and Theresa Buller

     Learning Outcomes

     After reading this chapter you will be able to:
           understand the sources of legal information in Aotearoa New Zealand;
           think critically about the legal information sources you may need for work or study;
           develop a legal research strategy to help you find appropriate legal material for your
             work or study.

The ability to research and locate legal information is essential for law students and lawyers. Incomplete
or inaccurate research can lead to lower marks in law school or professional embarrassment for practising
lawyers.
This chapter helps you to develop these skills; later chapters will explain how to locate specific sources of
legal information.
                                                                                                                      WHAT IS LEGAL RESEARCH? | 6

 WHAT IS LEGAL RESEARCH?

     Theresa Buller

  Legal research is the ability to find, evaluate and use sources of legal information to:
      solve a legal problem;
      suggest reform of the law;
      compare the laws of different jurisdictions;
      understand the role of law in society.

          "Lawyers are expected to know the law when they come to Court. In presenting an
          argument, a lawyer is expected to have researched the law and not simply be depending on
          other's statements whether in textbooks or of researchers. It is the lawyer's duty to assist
          the Court in determining the law applicable."1

   7 | SOURCES OF LEGAL INFORMATION

 SOURCES OF LEGAL INFORMATION

     Theresa Buller

  Legal information is divided into two categories:

    1. Primary sources, which are the law itself;
    2. Secondary sources, which provide commentary on the law or help you find the law.

  Legal information is hierarchical, which means the courts take much more notice of some types of
  information than others.

    1. Primary sources of law are the law and these sources can bind the court, that is, the court must
        follow it.

            Legislation is the highest authority because it has been enacted by Parliament, which acts under
              our authority as voting citizens. Legislation includes statutes (also known as Acts or
              enactments) as well as secondary legislation (formerly called legislative instruments and
              statutory regulations) and other delegated legislation.

            Cases (or judicial decisions, also called judgments1) come a close second. Cases cannot
              contradict legislation, but they can bind the court.

    2. Secondary sources roughly fall into two groups:

            Commentary on the law. This is material written to help us make sense of the law. Books, legal
              encyclopaedias and journal articles fall into this category. They may help our understanding of
              the law and they may even sometimes be cited in court, but they cannot bind the court. Books,
              legal encyclopaedias and journal articles may provide you with a quick overview or an in-depth
              analysis of a topic along with references to cases or relevant legislation.

            Access tools or finding aids. This category includes some tools that will be familiar from other
              subjects, such as indexes and dictionaries, but some are peculiar to the law, such as citators and
              case law digests.

1. Note the lack of an `e' in judgments when used in a legal context.
                                                                                                         SOURCES OF LEGAL INFORMATION | 8

In legal research, students can approach a topic by looking at secondary sources of law to understand the
key issues in that area of law. Secondary sources provide analysis and explanation of the law and identify
relevant cases or legislation on a topic. Understanding the background of a topic before reading the primary
sources (ie, cases and legislation) can help to contextualise your research.

LEGAL RESEARCH STRATEGY

   Theresa Buller

How you approach your research task may vary depending on your research question.

Your legal research may start with a legal problem that needs to be answered. Legal problems can begin
anywhere: in a judicial decision, in a section of a statute, in a broad question on a principle of law or in a
human situation that involves legal thinking to untangle it.

A Legal Research Process

When you are new to legal research or unfamiliar with an area of law, proceeding from general information
(secondary sources) to more specific, authoritative information (legislation and cases) is a good approach.
Secondary sources are written by subject-matter experts who can efficiently lead you to the key authorities
you will need to use. Alternatively, if you feel like you have a good grasp of the area of law and legal
principles at play, you may wish to move straight to primary sources to answer your legal question.
A good legal-research process will follow this path:

 1. Start by finding general legal commentary on a topic - that is, a textbook or legal encyclopedia - to
      give you a broad overview of the subject.

 2. The general legal commentary will alert you to relevant legislation, and your next step should be to
      find it.

 3. The general legal commentary will also alert you to relevant case law, and your next step should be to
      find it.

 4. If no legislation is involved, you can proceed straight from the general commentary to the case law.
 5. Then you can refine your search by narrowing your search down to locate the precise principles

      involved. By now you should be able to refine your searching to focus on specific aspects of the area
      of law under investigation. This will involve a greater precision in your use of search terms, and at
      this stage it is usually a good idea to search for journal articles in the legal journal indexes.

This process is illustrated in the diagram below.
                                                                                                                 LEGAL RESEARCH STRATEGY | 10

TOOLS FOR LEGAL RESEARCH

   Catherine Doughty and Theresa Buller

There are several online free and subscription legal databases that can be used for legal research in Aotearoa
New Zealand.
The most well-known are:

   CCH iKnowConnect;
   HeinOnline;
   Lexis Advance;
   the New Zealand Legislation website;
   NZLII;
   Westlaw New Zealand.

Which ones you use depends on what legal information you are looking for, personal preference and - for
subscription databases - what access you have through your university or workplace.

Subscription Legal Databases

CCH iKnowConnect, HeinOnline, Lexis Advance and Westlaw New Zealand are all subscription
databases. This means that a library needs to pay for access to this content.
Each database is owned by a different legal publisher and may contain legislation, cases and secondary
sources, such as books, journal articles, commentaries and legal encyclopaedias. As each database is owned
by different legal publishers, there may be some identical content, but some content (particularly reported
cases and secondary sources) will be different.
It is best to access these databases via links provided by your university or workplace library. These links will
verify you as a student or employee of the subscription holder and give you access to each database.

Free Legal Databases

Both the New Zealand Legislation website and NZLII are free websites that provide access to legislation,
unreported cases, law reform material and secondary sources.
                                                                                                                TOOLS FOR LEGAL RESEARCH | 12

The New Zealand Legislation website is a free government website maintained by the Parliamentary
Counsel Office. On this site you can find official copies of New Zealand Acts, Bills and secondary
legislation. It has all versions and amendments of New Zealand legislation in force or enacted since 2008.

NZLII is a freely accessible database of full-text New Zealand judgments (largely unreported but with a
few early reported series), legislation, treaties, journals and law-reform material. It is constantly being added
to and has an extensive but incomplete collection of judgments from the courts, tribunals and authorities
around New Zealand.

GENERATIVE AI AND LEGAL RESEARCH

   Theresa Buller

       Note this page is based on information known to the authors at the time of writing (August
       2025).

The application of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in the legal sector is increasing and evolving
rapidly as AI capabilities improve.
Generative AI such as ChatGPT, Perplexity AI and Copilot may help users to understand a legal topic and
locate some legal sources. Generative AI tools are known to make things up or provide plausible but false
ouputs, commonly known as hallucinations.

Guidance on the Use of AI in Aotearoa New Zealand

The rapid adoption of AI technologies has lead the Courts of New Zealand and the New Zealand Law
Society to issue guidance on the use of generative AI:

   Courts of New Zealand Guidelines for use of generative artifical intelligence in Courts and Tribunals;
   New Zealand Law Society Generative AI guidance for lawyers.
Students should refer to the policies of their own institutions for guidance on the appropriate use and
attribution of AI for study within their institution. Additionally, the diagram below describes seven factors
to consider for the ethical use of generative AI, including the concepts of transparency, reliability, bias,
equity, sustainability, data sovereignty and privacy.

Know Your AI. By Kate Thompson. CC-BY-NC 4.0

Generative AI and Legal Research

Some ways in which generative AI can potentially be used in legal research include:
   summarising complex texts, concepts and legal cases into plain language to aid understanding of
      topics and facilitate further research;
   providing broad answers to common legal questions and general information relating to legal topics;
   helping to identify key research concepts and create basic search strings;
   conducting broad secondary legal research to guide primary research into case law and legislation;
   brainstorming and generating ideas for further research.

It is important that legal researchers who use generative AI apply caution and critical evaluative judgement
of outputs, fact-check for accuracy and verify all information sources, case law and legislation cited. They
should be viewed as a tool to augment routine tasks but not as a replacement for legal interpretation and
analysis. They can be used as a starting point for research but require careful verification for every output.
Note: This is not an endorsement of the accuracy or efficacy of generative AI while undertaking
legal research.
15 | GENERATIVE AI AND LEGAL RESEARCH

How to Use Generative AI Tools Effectively

A generative AI tool requires a prompt to produce content. When entering your prompt, provide
thorough context, details and boundaries. A prompt can specify:

   the points you want addressed;
   the role or perspective from which the text should be written, for example, a legal practitioner;
   the focus, format, style, intended audience and text length;
   specific requirements, such as to be accurate and not creative in its response.
Prompting is an iterative process. Responses generally improve when additional questions are asked or
rephrased.
Some basic prompt ideas:
For legal research and analysis:

       Prompt: Act as a legal practitioner who is advising a client. Conduct legal research on [legal
       issue or topic]. Summarise the relevant case law and legislation in New Zealand. Provide
       analysis and conclusions based on your research. Be concise and accurate.

To uncover precedents:

       Prompt: Act as a legal practitioner who is advising a client. Provide an overview of the legal
       precedents in [area of law]. List the leading cases that exist in this area of law and the key
       legal arguments for each case. Provide analysis and conclusions based on your research. Be
       concise and accurate.

Identify legislation and judgments for [legal issue]:

       Prompt: Act as a legal practitioner who is preparing a case. What is the legislation relating
                                                                                                   GENERATIVE AI AND LEGAL RESEARCH | 16

       to [legal issue] in New Zealand? List the leading cases that have cited this legislation and
       the key legal arguments for each case. Be concise and accurate.

The University of Arizona has a useful resource with ideas on writing prompts for legal research using
generative AI. Their guide discusses the RICE (Role, Instructions, Context, Expectations) elements that
can be incorporated into a prompt.

 SEARCHING STRATEGIES AND TIPS

     Theresa Buller

  Before you start searching for information, take some time to think about the legal question you are trying
  to answer and where you may find legal material that will help you to answer your question.
  There is a vast amount of primary and secondary material available in print and electronically. This material
  can be found in multiple databases, so it is important to consider where you might find this material in a
  time-efficient manner.
  Before you begin searching, consider:

      What do you wish to find (legislation, cases, journal articles and/or commentary)?
      What material do you have access to through your university or workplace library?
      Are you looking for the law in New Zealand or in another jurisdiction?1
      What search terms will you need (keywords, phrases and synonyms) to find the legal material that

        will help you to answer your legal question?

 Keywords and Phrases

  As part of planning your search strategy, think of keywords and phrases to find relevant information.
  Remember, you are researching the legal issues, not the facts of the scenario, so select keywords and phrases
  that are relevant to the legal issues of the case. Brainstorm related words, subject terms, synonyms and
  phrases. The more care and thought you put into your search strategies, the more relevant your results will
  be.

          Imagine you are searching for journal articles on the topic of refugees. A keyword search for

1. In this book we focus on skills to find New Zealand material. Many of the skills can also be used to find material from other
  jurisdictions, although other jurisdiction-specific databases may need to be used.
                                         SEARCHING STRATEGIES AND TIPS | 20

refugee returns 919 hits. After expanding your search and using other possible keywords
and phrases, a search for refugee OR "asylum seeker" OR "displaced persons" returns 956
hits.

                          Keywords and Synonyms

Keyword                   Synonym        Related Term
Refugee                   Asylum seeker  Displaced person

Boolean Operators

Boolean operators are connective words you place between your keywords to improve your search results.

Using Boolean Operators to Connect Keywords

Boolean operator Example  Results
                          Finds results with both words (note that it is best to search
AND      Maori            without macrons for words in te reo Mori)
         AND land         Finds results with either word

OR zealand OR aotearoa    Finds results with the first word but without the second word

NOT      remedy
         NOT
         damages

Truncation and Wildcards

Truncation symbols are used to find alternative word endings. For instance:

       placing a truncation symbol (such as * or !) as with law* retrieves law, laws, lawyer, lawless,
21 | SEARCHING STRATEGIES AND TIPS

                                    lawlessness

Wildcard symbols are used to replace a single character within the word, for example, when the spellings
vary by a single letter. For instance:

                                 organi?ation retrieves organisation or organization.

The truncation and wildcard symbols vary between databases. Use the help section in each database or the
handy cheat sheet below to find the specific symbol.

Proximity Operators

Proximity operators enable you to define how closely your search terms will be found in relation to one
another. For example s is for sentence, p is for paragraph, n is for the number of words adjacent to another
keyword. Proximity searching is commonly used in legal research to improve the relevancy of results, as
most legal databases perform searches across lengthy documents (such as entire journal articles or full-text
judgments). For instance:

          contributory w/s negligence retrieves documents in which both words appear within the
                                                         same sentence.

Phrase Searching

Searching for a phrase (putting quotation marks around the words) can dramatically focus your search
results. Rather than finding results for ungrouped words, the database will return results for the words
contained within the quote marks in the exact order they are written.

This example search in Google Scholar demonstrates the power of phrase searching:
                                                                                                         SEARCHING STRATEGIES AND TIPS | 22

                                                 maori land = 191,000 results

                                           "maori land" = 10,200 results

Combining Operators

Sometimes you may need to use more than one operator in the same search. An example is if you wanted
to find material on the Treaty of Waitangi and New Zealand's Constitution. By adding more operators, the
following search string will capture the most relevant records in one search:

           ("Treaty of Waitangi" OR "te Tiriti") AND (Zealand OR Aotearoa) AND Constitution

By using operators and brackets to nest and connect your keywords and synonyms, you can ensure that you
receive the most relevant results.

Database-Specific Search Operators

Each database has its own way of combining terms and truncating words. Use the correct search connectors
for each database, otherwise you will get unreliable results.
Below is a handy cheat sheet for the most-used legal databases:

WHAT IS CASE LAW?

       Learning Outcomes

       After reading this chapter you will be able to:
             recognise the elements of a case;
             understand how cases are published and the difference between a reported and an
                unreported case;
             identify components of a case citation and what the abbreviations mean;
             find a case when you have a citation;
             find a case on a topic or issue.

  A case, often referred to as a decision or judgment, is a written record of a judge's or judges' reasoning or
  decision-making applied to a particular dispute. When deciding cases, judges apply legislation or common
  law, and apply the doctrine of precedent (stare decisis), which means the court must follow the decisions
  reached by a higher court in the same jurisdiction.1 For this reason, case law has precedential value and is
  sometimes known as common law or judge-made law.
  Case law is a primary source of law in Aotearoa New Zealand.

 Anatomy of a Case

  Understanding the different parts of a case is helpful for case-law research. The figure below shows some of
  the key parts of a case.

1. Peter Spiller Dictionary of New Zealand Law (eBook ed, LexisNexis, 2019-).
27 | WHAT IS CASE LAW?

Anatomy of a New Zealand Reported Case. By Kate Thompson. CC-BY-NC 4.0

At the very top of the decision, you find information about the case, including the:
   citation;
   party names;
   court;
   judge or judges;
   hearing date or dates.

Headnote

The headnote of the decision contains catchwords and a summary of the case. Catchwords are keywords
and phrases, separated by dashes, summarising the legal principles and legislation discussed in the case. The
summary provides a short description of the matter and outlines the key findings of the case.
The headnote and its keywords are not officially part of the judgment. The headnote is written by a law
reporter, who is an employee of the publisher, not by a judge. Accordingly, do not quote from it.
          WHAT IS CASE LAW? | 28

Judgment

The start of the judgment proper is usually indicated by the judge's surname (eg Cooper J). If the judgment
is from an appellate court (eg the Court of Appeal or Supreme Court) with several judges sitting, there may
be multiple judgments. This is certainly the situation if one of the judges does not agree with the others
and writes a dissenting judgment.2

Each judgment will generally include:

   the litigation history of the case;
   statement of facts;
   relevant legal issues, legal principles and application to the case;
   conclusion;
   order of the court.

Learning how to analyse a case and distinguish the ratio decidendi3 is a core skill in legal studies.

   29 | HOW CASES ARE PUBLISHED

 11.

 HOW CASES ARE PUBLISHED

     Kate Thompson

  It is helpful to know how judgments are published in Aotearoa New Zealand when undertaking research
  in case law.

 Which Courts Produce Written Decisions?

  The higher-level courts usually produce written decisions, particularly the Supreme Court, Court of
  Appeal and High Court. The District Courts also produce written decisions on substantive issues. Matters
  heard in tribunals and authorities may not lead to a written decision. Many written decisions are not
  publicly available.
  Jury trials do not necessarily result in a written decision; however, following the accused pleading guilty
  or the jury finding the accused guilty at trial, there will be a sentencing hearing. Many courts make these
  sentencing remarks available to the public.

 Unreported and Reported Judgments

  Almost all decisions, except those that are suppressed on the grounds of privacy or public interest, are
  initially published online on court websites, in legal databases or on NZLII as unreported judgments.1
  These written decisions from the court are called "unreported" judgments because they have not been
  published in a law report series, that is, reported. From 2005, Aotearoa New Zealand courts began to adopt
  a standardised system of citation known as a "[medium] neutral citation" for unreported judgments. The
  Supreme Court has used neutral citations since 2005, with the other courts and tribunals adopting the
  convention in following years. See the New Zealand Law Style Guide rules 3.1(a) and 3.3.3(b)-(c) for
  details.
  Judgments deemed to be significant are reported and published in law report series. These are called
  reported judgments or reported decisions. All substantive judgments from the Supreme Court are reported

1. See Chapter 6: Tools for Legal Research
                                                                                                                   HOW CASES ARE PUBLISHED | 30

  in the New Zealand Law Reports. Occasionally, a judgment may be reported in more than one series. To be
  reported, a judgment should do one or more of the following:2

      raise significant points of law;
      introduce a new principle of law;
      significantly modify an existing principle of law;
      settle a question of law;
      apply an established principle in a new area;
      define or interpret legislation or legal terms or be particularly instructive.

 Official Report Series

  The New Zealand Law Reports, published by LexisNexis, is the official law report series for Aotearoa New
  Zealand. There are a number of other unofficial law reports too, usually specialising in a particular branch
  of law.

 Which Version of the Judgment Should Be Used?

  It is possible that a decision has been published multiple times. First, in unreported format, then sometimes
  in an unofficial law report series and finally in the official law report series. Vector Gas, an important
  contract-law case, exists in an unreported format from the Supreme Court and was reported (published) in
  the New Zealand Law Reports, the New Zealand Business Law Cases and the New Zealand Company and
  Commercial Law Reports. The latter two reports are unofficial report series and are referred to as parallel
  citations.

2. https://www.thelawreports.org.nz/law-reporting/how-are-cases-selected-for-reporting
   31 | HOW CASES ARE PUBLISHED

  It is proper3 to cite the neutral reference and then the most official reported version. For example, Vector
  Gas Ltd v Bay of Plenty Energy Ltd [2010] NZSC 5, [2010] 2 NZLR 444.
  Therefore it makes sense to use the most official version if it is available. Always cite the version you used!

     HOW TO TALK ABOUT A CASE | 32

12.

HOW TO TALK ABOUT A CASE

   Kate Thompson

When citing cases verbally, some elements of a case citation need to be pronounced differently than they
would appear in written form.

     For instance, in Aotearoa New Zealand the "v" between the party names is not pronounced;
     instead use "and". For example:

          The Queen and Horsfall
          Haug and Jupiters

       Instead of pronouncing the R in criminal matters, use The Queen [1952-2022] or The King or
       The Crown.

       For cases such as Re Horlick's Malted Milk Co (1914) 34 NZLR 91 (SC), say "In the matter of"
       instead of Re.

Make Sure to Provide the Full Citation

In advocacy or moot situations, use the full citation the first time the case is referred to. With subsequent
citations, simply indicate the party names and pinpoint reference as needed.
33 | HOW TO TALK ABOUT A CASE

       For example, when verbally citing R v Horsfall (2008) 24 CRNZ 402.
             First instance: "The Queen and Horsfall, decided in 2008 at volume twenty-four of
               the Criminal Reports of New Zealand at page 402."

FINDING A CASE

   Kate Thompson

There are two approaches to finding cases:

 1. using the citation or some other information about a known case;
 2. looking for relevant cases, if there are any, while researching a legal problem.

Finding a Known Case

The known-case approach relies on having some details about the case - either the case citation, the judge's
name, the date of hearing or some other combination of details.

If there is a case citation, locating the decision is straightforward:

 1. Locate the law-report abbreviation.

      very least, find the unreported version.

Finding an Unknown Case

The diagram below demonstrates how you might locate an unknown case by approaching the problem in
two different ways. You could start with a secondary source, such as a textbook, encyclopaedia or journal
article. Alternatively, you could start with the relevant provisions of a statute. Chapter 5 also discusses this
strategy in the legal research process.

Using secondary sources to find cases

Secondary sources such as legal encyclopaedias, books, articles and commentaries are often the best place to
start when looking for case law, whether you want to understand a specific known case or you are looking
for inspiration. Experts writing in secondary sources discuss and analyse important cases and the key points
of law. Any good textbook on the subject will have a Table of Cases at the front or back of the book, so you
can immediately see if the book analyses your case.

Using legislation to find cases

Many legal databases allow you to search for cases that cite and consider a particular section of an Act or
of secondary legislation. Generally you can achieve this using the Advanced Search function in a database.
Major law databases also provide analytics that allow you to find a section of an Act and then leapfrog to
cases citing that provision.
                                                                                                                                      FINDING A CASE | 36

  Consider changing the ranking of any results you have so that decisions from higher courts occur at the
  top.

 Keyword searching

  Searching for cases by subject or topic can be difficult, especially if you are unsure of the jargon or
  legal terms that best describe the problem. It is almost always more efficient to identify relevant cases in
  secondary sources. The indexes at the back of textbooks are great places to glean relevant keywords, and
  legal databases often include catchwords and phrases in their case law results - similar to the set-up in
  reported cases' headnotes.

 Catchwords and phrases

  The catchwords are a series of keywords and phrases, separated by dashes, added to the headnote of the case
  by the law reporter or publisher. The purpose is to describe the subject matter of the case quickly, including
  relevant legislation and provisions. See these example catchwords from R v Horsfall [2008] NZCA 449,
  (2008) 24 CRNZ 402:

  Criminal law - Verdicts - Unreasonable and unsupportable - Insufficiency of evidence

  Criminal law - Sentencing - Drug offences - Manufactured and sold Class A controlled drug
  methamphetamine

  In some databases, these catchwords are active links, whereby clicking them sends you to all the other cases
  with that same catchword assigned to them. One good case finds another. The digest or summary briefly
  summarises the matter and outlines the key holdings of the case.

 Full-text searching of cases

  A full-text search looks for keywords across the entire text of the case.2 This is the broadest type of search
  and will not only receive the largest number of results of all the searches but also the highest number
  of irrelevant results. Most databases use natural language searching, which may be good enough in some
  instances. Better results are obtained by using search functions, such as Boolean (OR / AND), phrase
  searching or proximity searching to "tighten" your results, and by making good use of the limits and filters
  upon search results. Your librarian can show you these techniques, and each database has a help section
  with tips on how to search effectively. Spending a little time planning your search, including how you might
  connect your keywords, can save significant time later.

2. See Chapter 5. Legal Research Strategy for details.
37 | FINDING A CASE

Words and phrases judicially considered

Some legal databases will have an Advanced Search - Cases search template that includes the option to
search for "words and phrases judicially considered". This search will find decisions in which which judges
have discussed or defined particular words and phrases.
                                                                         USING CASE CITATORS | 38

USING CASE CITATORS

   Kate Thompson

The main role of a case citator is to provide extra analytical information about cases. In Aotearoa New
Zealand legal databases, any judgment of a superior court will have a citator record that includes
information about the:

   status of the case;
   publication and citation details;
   litigation history - whether the case has gone on appeal and been subsequently affirmed or reversed;
   subsequent judicial treatment - how later judges have treated the decision;
   consideration of earlier cases;
   secondary sources that cite the case;
   legislation considered by the case.

Always check case citators to understand the case.

The main case citators used in Aotearoa New Zealand legal research are:

      CaseBase (Lexis Advance);
      KeyCite (Westlaw New Zealand);
      LawCite (NZLII).

The citators CaseBase and KeyCite use a system of flags, symbols and annotations to provide extra
information about the litigation history of the case as well as how the case has been treated by subsequent
cases.

Check the Flag or Signal

In the citator record for a case, look for the symbol or flag appearing next to the party names. The symbol
will give an indication of the status of the case.
39 | USING CASE CITATORS

 Red
             A red flag or symbol indicates the decision has been reversed on appeal or subsequently disapproved or
             overruled on at least one point of law.

Yellow

        A yellow flag or symbol indicates the decision has subsequently been distinguished, explained, not
        followed. It may have some negative history but has not been reversed or overruled.

Green

        A green flag or symbol indicates the decision has been applied, approved, followed, affirmed or upheld.

Neutral The neutral symbol indicates the decision has been considered or cited.

The flag or signal gives limited information about the status of the case, so always look at the case
annotations as well. Annotations are single word descriptors that indicate the litigation history of the case
as well as how the case has been treated in subsequent judgments.

Check the Litigation History

The litigation history section of the citator outlines the path of the legal dispute through the appellate
hierarchy. This may directly affect the reliability of the case.

Reversed (Red)

                  Used where the decision has been overturned on appeal.

Varied (Yellow)

                  Used where a case on appeal is only partially affirmed or reversed.

Affirmed (Green)

                  Used where the decision has been upheld on appeal.

Subsequent Judicial Consideration

The doctrine of precedent means that judges are bound by decisions of higher courts in the same court
hierarchy. They also often consider lower decisions in the same hierarchy, or even decisions produced
outside the hierarchy altogether.
                                                                                                                          USING CASE CITATORS | 40

A citator record provides an overview of the subsequent judicial consideration of your case:

   CaseBase (Lexis Advance) - Cases referring to this case;
   KeyCite (Westlaw New Zealand) - Citing references.

The most common annotations used to describe the subsequent judicial treatment of a judgment are:
41 | USING CASE CITATORS

Annotation     Definition

Disapproved    Used when both courts are of coordinate jurisdiction and the latter court has no power to

(Green)        jurisdiction.

Followed       Used when a court is bound by the previous decision of a court of superior jurisdiction in a case
(Green)        where the facts were the same or substantially the same.

Cited          Used when the primary case is merely mentioned by the court in the subsequent case, without
Considered     comment.
Referred
               Used when the court discusses a previous decision but does not actually apply, disapproved,
               follow, etc.

     Learning Outcomes

     After reading this chapter you will be able to:
           understand the two main types of legislation in Aotearoa New Zealand;
           identify the parts of an Act;
           identify the date on which an Act commences;
           understand the online and print sources of legislation in Aotearoa New Zealand;
           understand the process in which a Bill becomes an Act.

In New Zealand, the law is made in our courts by judges (case law) and by legislation made under the
authority of Parliament.
This chapter will focus on legislation and:

   finding New Zealand Acts and secondary legislation;
   developing an understanding of the legislative process.

There are two main types of legislation:

 1. Acts - laws passed by Parliament are known as Acts or statutes.
 2. Secondary legislation - laws made under a power that Parliament has formally delegated in a

      particular Act.
45 | WHAT IS AN ACT?

17.

WHAT IS AN ACT?

   Tracey Thomas and Theresa Buller

Acts are laws formally passed or enacted by Parliament that have received royal assent by the Governor-
General as the Sovereign's representative.

Acts are one of the primary sources of New Zealand's law and have greater authority than case law.
Sometimes Acts are referred to as statutes or enactments.

Acts made by Parliament are supreme law in New Zealand. A court cannot overturn an Act made by
Parliament.

Each new Act either creates new laws or makes changes to existing Acts by amending, replacing or repealing
existing legislation. Most legislation enacted each year amends existing legislation.

Although all Acts are the law of New Zealand, there are different types of Acts, which include:

   Public Acts - Acts that affects the public at large, eg New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990;
   Local Acts - Acts that deals with a matter of public interest but only affect a particular part of New

      Zealand, eg Auckland Domain Act 1987;
   Private Acts - Acts that deals with the particular interest or benefit of an identified person or body,

      eg Eden Park Trust Act 1955;
   Imperial Acts in force in New Zealand - Acts of the Parliaments of England, Great Britain and the

      United Kingdom that are part of the law of New Zealand under the Imperial Laws Application Act
      1988, eg Magna Carta 1297;
   Provincial Acts (or Provincial Ordinances) in force in New Zealand - Acts that date back to the time
      when New Zealand was a colony divided into provinces. Each province had the jurisdiction to pass
      legislation that only applied within that province, eg Christ's College Ordinance 1855 (C) - the (C)
      represents the Province of Canterbury.

18.

STRUCTURE OF AN ACT

   Tracey Thomas and Theresa Buller

The structure of most New Zealand Acts is consistent, starting with the preliminary section and separated
into parts, sections and sometimes schedules.

As an example, the image below shows part of the printed copy of the Legislation Act 2019.

Anatomy of a New Zealand Act by Kate Thompson. CC-BY-NC 4.0
47 | STRUCTURE OF AN ACT

The preliminary section of an Act generally follows the format set out in the example and provides useful
information about the Act.

Jurisdiction - this is apparent on the front page of the Act by the display of the New Zealand coat of arms.

Act number - a numbering system based on the calendar year. Eg, 2019 No 58 is the 58th public Act of
2019.

Title - this is the name of the Act together with the year it was passed by Parliament. This is usually stated
in section 1 of the Act.

Commencement date - usually found in section 2 and provides information about when the Act
becomes law. This is discussed in greater detail below.

Date of Assent - this is also referred to as Royal Assent and is generally published on the title page of the
Act when it is passed.

Commencement

Acts will not come into force until the commencement date. It is possible for an Act (or parts or sections)
to be passed in Parliament and enacted by Royal Assent and not yet commenced. Sometimes different
sections of an Act commence at different times. Knowing how to check whether an Act is in force and
which sections have commenced is an important legislative research skill.

Commencement information is often found in the Act itself within section 2; however, this may be a
general statement rather than a specific date, stating that the Act will commence:

   upon receiving Royal Assent from the Governor-General (the Sovereign's representative in New
      Zealand);

   on a specified date;
   on a date to be proclaimed (in the future);
   in relation to another piece of legislation;
   the default date of 28 days after receiving Royal Assent.

It can also be prudent to check towards the end of longer legislation for a part or sub-part of the Act labelled
"Transitionary Provisions" containing further specific dates for sections coming into force.

Currency and Versions

It is important to know how up to date an Act is when you are using it. Check for a date on the front page
of the Act that states "Version as at..."
                                                                                                                        STRUCTURE OF AN ACT | 48

During the currency of an Act, it may be changed by amending Acts passed by Parliament. When a version
of an Act is produced that incorporates these changes, it is referred to in various ways:

   version;
   consolidation;
   reprint.

If some time has passed since the compilation was prepared, amendments might have been made to the Act
that have not yet been incorporated into the version to which you are referring.

Acts as enacted are Acts in their original form. That is, as they were passed in the Parliament.

Amendment Act is an Act that alters the operation of an earlier Act (or sections of an Act) through
substitution, insertion, omission or repealing.

Principal Act refers to an Act that deals with a particular topic and whose main job is not to amend
another Act.

Consolidation (earlier known as Reprint) is a version of an Act that incorporates all amendments made to
it as at the date of publication of the consolidation.

Repealed Acts are no longer enforced as law. Acts can only be repealed by a subsequent new Act or an
amendment Act passed by Parliament that includes repealing sections.

Locating and using the latest updated official version of an Act in force is an important task for most legal-
research projects. Some legal-research projects may also require tracking the legislative history of an Act,
which involves locating the earlier versions and consolidations to find the version that was in force at a
particular date and comparing the differences.

Always check the currency of an Act by searching on the New Zealand legislation website and locating
the "Version as at ..." date at the top of the Act. This is a consolidation version of an Act incorporating
amendments made to the Act as at the date of publication of that version of the Act. Amendments that
are not yet in force might not yet be incorporated into the latest version that you are viewing, although
the official New Zealand Legislation website usually includes warnings on a principal Act when there are
amendments yet to commence at a future date. Newer legislation on the New Zealand legislation website
without the "Version as at..." date at the top of the Act indicates that it is the original "as enacted" version
without any amendments.

If looking at an Act on one of the subscription databases, the editorial notes also include warnings when
there are amendments yet to come into force.

FINDING AN ACT

   Tracey Thomas and Theresa Buller

To find a current New Zealand Act, the best online source is the official New Zealand Legislation website.
The New Zealand Legislation website provides free public access to up-to-date, in-force versions of New
Zealand Acts and secondary legislation drafted by the Parliamentary Counsel and has all versions and
amendments of New Zealand legislation in force or enacted since 2008.
Students and legal practitioners may also have access via their library's databases to subscription legal
databases that provide legislation and extra functionality to help with researching legislation. Examples of
subscription legal databases include:

   Westlaw New Zealand - provided by Thomson Reuters New Zealand Ltd;
   Lexis Advance - provided by LexisNexis New Zealand Ltd;
   CCH iKnowConnect - provided by Wolters Kluwer New Zealand.

Westlaw New Zealand, Lexis Advance and CCH iKnowConnect each have their own commentary (books,
journal articles and online commentaries, along with additional linked material). It can be advantageous to
check and compare each.
Legislation is still published in print, but it is important to check the currency of the print version as it
may not incorporate recent amendments. Print legislation is still useful for locating older legislation (before
2007) and especially for consolidations of the law at specific dates in the past.

Historic New Zealand Legislation

A free website useful for locating historic, as-enacted New Zealand legislation is NZLII. There are several
digitised collections of historic versions of legislation available through NZLII, including:

   New Zealand Acts;
   New Zealand Acts as enacted (1841-2007).

SEARCHING TIPS FOR ACTS

   Tracey Thomas and Theresa Buller

When searching for an Act, think about what you are looking for before searching. Are you looking for the
whole Act or a certain part, section or schedule? Or are you searching across all legislation to find the Acts
that are relevant to a topic?

You can search the New Zealand Legislation website or the subscription legal databases for current
legislation.

Official New Zealand Legislation

The New Zealand Legislation website is a free government website maintained by the Parliamentary
Counsel Office and has all versions and amendments of New Zealand legislation in force or enacted since
2008.

The New Zealand Legislation website has an online guide explaining how to search for legislation and Bills.

Subscription Databases

The subscription databases, such as Westlaw New Zealand, Lexis Advance and CCH iKnowConnect,
include links between the legal material, which will help you to find statutes and secondary legislation along
with cases and commentary that mention or discuss your statute. Some of this content is similar in each
subscription database, but because each is published by a different publisher, some content is different
(especially the commentary). As a good researcher you should check legislation in each database to see
which content is linked and whether any of the databases have material that will help with your research.

Each of the subscription databases has online training and help sections that explain how to use their
platforms and website:

21.

SECONDARY LEGISLATION

   Tracey Thomas and Theresa Buller

Parliament makes laws by enacting primary legislation (Acts). It is often not possible for an Act to include
all the details necessary for it to have its intended effect. For this reason, Parliament will often include in an
Act a provision that delegates to another person or body, often part of the Executive, the power to prescribe
these necessary details as secondary legislation. The Act that delegates this law-making power is known as
the empowering Act. The specific provision containing the power is the empowering provision. Secondary
legislation must be published in accordance with Part 3 of the Legislation Act 2019.

Parliament has traditionally delegated its legislation-making power by authorising the Governor-General
(on the advice of the Executive Council) to make secondary legislation. The Governor-General presides
at meetings of the Executive Council where Ministers of the Crown, who are also Executive Council
members, present secondary legislation for signature. Once promulgated, secondary legislation is notified
in the New Zealand Gazette. All secondary legislation is required to be tabled in Parliament and is subject
to post-promulgation scrutiny by the Regulations Review Committee.

Types of Secondary Legislation

There are different types of secondary legislation, including delegated legislation, subordinate legislation,
regulations, proclamations, rules, bylaws, codes and Orders in Council.

Revoked secondary legislation is no longer in force or has expired or is now disallowed.

Structure of Secondary Legislation

Secondary legislation includes a number in the top right corner, which is made up of the year and the
consecutive number of secondary legislation; for example, 2025/17 is the 17th secondary legislation
published in the year 2025.

When secondary legislation is published, there is an explanatory note or statement of reasons at the end of
the text.

Within secondary legislation each idea or topic is numbered and is called a clause or, depending on the type
of secondary legislation, each basic unit may be called a rule or regulation.
   53 | SECONDARY LEGISLATION

  Secondary legislation includes a commencement clause, which indicates the date it comes into force.

 Secondary Legislation Terminology

  Secondary legislation is sometimes referred to as delegated legislation because, even though it is authorised
  by an Act of Parliament, it is made by a body outside Parliament.
  Historically, secondary legislation was referred to as statutory regulations and legislative instruments. It is
  currently known as secondary legislation.
  Secondary legislation has also been referred to more broadly as subsidiary legislation, subordinate
  legislation, delegated legislation and regulations.
  The New Zealand Legislation website includes an overview of secondary legislation. For more in-depth
  authoritative information, refer to the Secondary Legislation chapter inParliamentary Practice in New
  Zealand.1

  Representatives, Wellington, 2023) at ch 41.

FINDING SECONDARY LEGISLATION

   Tracey Thomas and Theresa Buller

To find current New Zealand secondary legislation, the best online source is the official New Zealand
Legislation website. A useful method is to locate the relevant empowering Act (this is usually the principal
Act) and use the Secondary Legislation tab for a list of secondary legislation made under that Act, along
with its empowering provision and administering agency.

Some secondary legislation is published on the website of the administering department, ministry or other
agency responsible for the secondary legislation, in the New Zealand Gazette or not published at all.
Accordingly, there is not yet a single, authoritative source for all New Zealand's secondary legislation.

A common legal-research task is to find an Order in Council, which is a type of secondary legislation. Some
Acts include a commencement section stating that the Act or specific parts of the Act will come into force
on a date appointed by the Governor-General by an Order in Council. Orders in Council can be found on
the New Zealand Legislation website.

Secondary legislation is also available on the subscription legal databases Westlaw New Zealand, Lexis
Advance and CCH iKnowConnect. As with Acts, these subscription databases each have their own
commentary (books, journal articles and online commentaries, along with additional functionality
features) that may discuss the secondary legislation. It may be useful to check and compare each of the
subscription databases.

Historical Secondary Legislation

A free website useful for locating historical original "as made" New Zealand secondary legislation is NZLII.
There are several digitised collections of secondary legislation available through NZLII, including:

   New Zealand Regulations;
   New Zealand Regulations as made (1936-2007);
   New Zealand Repealed Regulations.
55 | BILLS

23.

BILLS

   Tracey Thomas and Theresa Buller

It is important to understand how legislation is made. This knowledge will assist you in research tasks, such
as:

   tracking proposed legislation prior to enactment;
   locating parliamentary documents needed in statutory interpretation;
   finding the source of ideas and debate on specific topics.

From a Bill to an Act

A proposed Act is called a Bill. Each Bill is debated and voted on (or "read") by MPs in the House
of Representatives on three occasions. The process is sometimes shorter if it is done under urgency in
Parliament.

Although they all follow the same process to become an Act, Bills are labelled as one of the following:

   Government Bill - proposed legislation that furthers the Government's legislative agenda. Often this
      is what the political party in government has campaigned on during an election cycle.

   Member's Bill - proposed legislation from any Member of Parliament (MP) who is not a
      Government minister. Members' Bills are a way in which:
          opposition parties can propose law changes while in opposition;
          any MP (whether in Government or opposition) can propose changes to legislation (often on
            controversial topics, such as the legislation on same-sex marriage or on assisted dying).

   Local Bill - proposed legislation related to a specific geographical area.
   Private Bill - proposed legislation to benefit a specific person or group; these are rare.

After being introduced into Parliament, an individual Bill is read and voted on three times before it can
become an Act. At the Committee Stage (ie, between 2nd and 3rd readings) any MP can propose to amend
or divide a Bill by lodging an Amendment Paper (AP; previously called a Supplementary Order Paper
(SOP)), which details the proposed changes.
                                                                                                                                                     BILLS | 56

  Each Bill, once it is introduced in Parliament, is given an individual Bill number1 and if changes are made
  to the Bill, a new version may be printed.
  The Bill number is printed on the footer of the front page of the Bill and consists of two parts. The second
  part of the number is the bar number; it is separated from the first number by a long dash or bar and tells
  you which version of the Bill you are engaging with. The bar number may be a -1, -2 or -3 .2 Note that
  Bills may be divided into two or more Bills at any stage.3
  Changes to Bills are detailed in Amendment Papers (APs).
  The legislative process for a Bill to become an Act is:4

    1. Introduction, First Reading, debate and vote in the House of Representatives

          If the Bill passes the First Reading, it is sent to a select committee for examination, submissions
         and improvements.

    2. Second Reading, debate and vote in the House of Representatives. This includes a vote on any
        amendments to the Bill recommended by the select committee.

          If the Bill passes the Second Reading, it is sent to the Committee of the whole House for
         consideration and debate.

    3. Third Reading and vote in the House of Representatives

          If the Bill passes the Third Reading, the Bill is then signed by the Sovereign's representative in
         New Zealand, the Governor-General, and receives Royal Assent (enacted) and becomes an Act and
         is law.
  The diagram below shows this process in further detail.

FINDING BILLS

   Tracey Thomas and Theresa Buller

Legal research may include researching the Bill related to an Act to aid in statutory interpretation. This
type of legal research is often referred to as a legislative history and is typically motivated by the need to
discover the source and influence of wording that exists in an Act. The legislative history may shine a light
on the context and options discussed at the time the legislation was passed.

All current Bills (from 2002 on) are available from the New Zealand Parliament website.

Current Bills

On the New Zealand Parliament website, each Bill has its own web page that provides links to each copy
of the Bill and any Amendment Papers (formerly called Supplementary Order Papers), along with links
to Hansard (a transcript of the daily parliamentary debates), submissions to the select committee and any
department reports discussing the Bill. In addition, Bills (from 2008 on) can also be found on the New
Zealand Legislation website.

As a Bill progresses through the legislative process, different versions of the Bill contain information to help
you understand the intent of Parliament in creating or amending legislation. This information is contained
within the text of the Bill itself and also in:

   the explanatory note in the -1 version of a Bill, which sets out the policy the Bill seeks to achieve;
   the select committee report in the -2 version of a Bill, which includes the recommendations and

      amendments agreed upon by the select committee;
   the Committee of the whole House -3 version of the Bill, which includes any amendments made

      during the Committee of the whole House debate of the Bill in Parliament.

A Bill contains numbered clauses; these are referred to as sections once the Bill is enacted.

Other material, such as Hansard (a transcript of the daily Parliamentary debates), submissions to the select
committee, legislative statements, disclosure statements, department reports and the Journals of the House
of Representatives, can assist in tracing the history of a Bill, seeing the reasons for a Bill's proposal and
understanding support for or against a Bill. Some of this material is linked to the Bill's web page on the
Parliament website and other material can be found elsewhere on the Parliament website and on NZLII:

Terminated Bills

A terminated Bill has failed to become an Act and refers to a Bill that has been defeated, discharged, vetoed,
withdrawn or has lapsed.

Historic Bills

Historic Bills (prior to 2002) can be found on NZLII. There are several digitised collections of Bills
available through NZLII, including:

   New Zealand Bills (1998-);
   New Zealand Historical Bills (1854-2008).

 INTRODUCTION TO SECONDARY
 SOURCES

     Kate Thompson and Melanie Lovich

       Learning Outcomes

       After reading this chapter you will be able to:
             identify different types of secondary sources needed for successful legal research;
             understand the authoritative hierarchy of secondary sources;
             understand the benefits and limitations of secondary sources;
             know how to find secondary sources for legal research.

  Secondary sources are a useful starting point when researching an unfamiliar area of law or legal concept.
  They broadly fall into two groups: commentary on the law and finding aids.1 This chapter will focus on the
  former. Secondary sources provide background information, context, topic and concept overviews, expert
  analysis and references to key primary sources. Although secondary sources are not authoritative versions
  of the law, they are beneficial for developing your understanding of legal concepts. Examples of secondary
  sources include:

      legal dictionaries and encyclopaedias;
      books;
      online commentaries (loose-leaf services);
      journal articles;
      government documents and law reform;
      newspaper articles, reports and some material found on websites, blogs and so forth.

Evaluating Secondary Sources

You are expected to use high-quality, reputable and scholarly information sources throughout your
university law study. Consequently, it is important to critically evaluate secondary sources, especially web-
based sources, to determine whether the information is credible and suitable for academic use. Currency,
authority and jurisdiction are of particular relevance for law resources. As a general rule, published sources,
such as books and journal articles, are the most reliable authority as they are written by experts from the
judiciary, academia or the profession and have been peer-reviewed.
   65 | DICTIONARIES AND ENCYCLOPAEDIAS

 DICTIONARIES AND ENCYCLOPAEDIAS

     Kate Thompson and Melanie Lovich

 Legal Dictionaries

  Legal dictionaries assist with clarifying the meaning of legal jargon and other terms and phrases. They may
  provide references to legislative provisions defining the term or to cases that have considered the term. Legal
  dictionaries can help you to:

      identify terms relevant to a particular area of law;
      understand specific legal meanings for everyday words;
      locate words and phrases defined in legislation or judicially interpreted in case law.
  Your university may prescribe an official dictionary to use as part of your law studies. Use your university
  library search to find other law dictionaries available in print or online, for example Peter Spiller's
  Dictionary of New Zealand Law.1
  The print edition is known as the New Zealand Law Dictionary.2
  A high-quality, generic dictionary can be helpful too, such as the Oxford English Dictionary.3

 Legal Encyclopaedias

  Legal encyclopaedias contain more extensive information than dictionaries and provide:
      a concise introduction to the topic;
      key legislation and case references;
      links to relevant legislation, judgments and secondary sources from other key jurisdictions.

1. Peter Spiller Dictionary of New Zealand Law (eBook ed, LexisNexis, 2019-).
2. Peter Spiller New Zealand Law Dictionary (10th ed, LexisNexis, Wellington, 2022).
3. Michael Proffitt (ed) Oxford English Dictionary (3rd ed, eBook ed, Oxford University Press, 2000-).

They are a useful starting point when researching an unfamiliar area of law or legal topic. The table of
contents is organised by title (field of law or subject) and then structured into chapters > subheadings >
[paragraphs]. Encyclopaedias provide basic overview information for legal concepts, including references
to key legislative provisions and case law in the notes area beneath each paragraph. To find information
in legal encyclopaedias, browse through the table of contents topics using the + symbols, search across an
entire encyclopaedia by keywords or limit a search to within headings/titles only.

The legal encyclopaedia for Aotearoa New Zealand is the Laws of New Zealand, published by LexisNexis
and available on the Lexis Advance platform.

BOOKS

   Kate Thompson and Melanie Lovich

Books are an invaluable source of authoritative information for legal research. Books can provide you with:

   an in-depth understanding of a particular practice area, topic or concept;
   leading case references;
   key legislation references;
   references to other secondary sources, particularly journal articles and books.

Use your university library search to find books by title, author or topic. Use filters, such as publication
date, to refine a large results list or use the advanced-search options. Consider currency and jurisdiction
when selecting books to use. For example, while current texts are important for current research, historical
research involves finding a book written closer to the time you are researching. Similarly, if the book is
several years old and on a topic of law that is volatile and prone to change, ensure you use other sources of
law, such as journal articles and online commentaries to identify more recent changes.

Some titles are available electronically as eBooks; however, publishers may set restrictions on the number of
simultaneous users and the permitted amount of printing and downloading.
     ONLINE COMMENTARIES (LOOSELEAF SERVICES) | 68

ONLINE COMMENTARIES (LOOSELEAF
SERVICES)

   Kate Thompson and Melanie Lovich

Online commentaries are publications that provide up-to-date analysis of statute law, written by legal
practitioners who specialise in a particular area of law. They are also known as loose-leafs and typically
include:

   legislative extracts;
   annotations to legislation;
   recent case law;
   commentary (an analysis of the law written in a similar style to a textbook).

       The term "loose-leaf" refers to the traditional print versions of these sources, which consist
       of loose leaves (pages) of paper in a folder or ring binder. This format enables regular
       updating throughout the year by removing, replacing or adding individual "leaves" to reflect
       changes in the law. Consequently, they are organised and referenced by paragraph numbers
       rather than by page numbers. Most law libraries subscribe to the online version of these,
       commonly called "commentaries", as their up-to-date nature suits an online environment.

The benefits of commentaries include:

   currency - updated to reflect new developments;
   insight - contains expert analysis of legal concepts and legislative provisions;
   comprehensive coverage -

          assemble important information relevant to a field of law within the one product;
          include relevant legislation and key case law in full-text or extract format (or link to these

            primary sources).
69 | ONLINE COMMENTARIES (LOOSELEAF SERVICES)

Using Online Commentaries

Check your university library for access to online commentaries. Access may only be via subscription law
databases. Online commentaries are regularly updated so they are a good source to check for any changes
to the law in a particular practice area. They are particularly useful for problem questions involving factual
scenarios; for example, for explanations of the elements of criminal offences, an outline of the effects of
specific contractual terms or discussion of the courts' interpretation or application of complex sections of
legislation.

To use online commentaries, browse the table of contents or index as a starting point and search across
these products using keywords. Online research using the main law databases in New Zealand may provide
direct linking to relevant commentary on that specific section of law.

JOURNAL ARTICLES

   Kate Thompson and Melanie Lovich

Journal articles provide a topical discussion of legal issues, cases and legislative developments. They are
published in journals, which may specialise in a jurisdiction, such as the New Zealand Law Journal, or
in a legal subject, such as the New Zealand Business Law Quarterly. Journals are published in regular
instalments, with each issue containing several individual articles. There are hundreds of law journals
varying by jurisdiction, subject focus and audience.

Practitioner Journals

Some journals are written for practitioners and are referred to as "practitioner journals". These can be
useful for understanding how a legal issue is managed from a practical perspective. They are usually short
pieces, perhaps with glossy pictures and with minimal references. Law Talk, published by the New Zealand
Law Society, is a good high-quality example.

Scholarly or Academic Journals

Scholarly law-journal articles are written by legal experts (academics, researchers, members of the judiciary
or legal profession) for an academic audience. They are usually longer pieces of research, backed up by
theory and have numerous references. They also go through a process of peer review.

Although scholarly journal articles can provide authoritative, high-quality and in-depth coverage of a legal
issue, they may not always reflect current law. It is important to pay special attention to the date of the
article - is it current?

Peer Review

At law school, a requirement for research assignments may be to use information from academic journal
articles that are peer-reviewed. Peer review is a process in which other scholars in the same field (peers)
evaluate the quality of an article and make suggestions for revision prior to publication. This is usually
done anonymously in an attempt to avoid bias. The aim is to ensure that the work is rigorous, coherent and
based on sound research.
71 | JOURNAL ARTICLES

Finding Known Journal Articles From a Citation

Correctly identifying the different parts of a journal citation is the first step to finding a journal article
Sometimes a journal article can be found simply by copying and pasting the article title into a search engine
or library database, but if that does not work, other strategies are required. Another good method to find
the article is to find the full journal title first and then search within the journal for the article. So being able
to identify and decode the journal title abbreviation is important.
The illustration below shows the different elements of the citation: M Roberts "Continuing
representations and agency" (2014) 20 NZBLQ 73. The elements are highlighted to show the article title
(Continuing representations and agency) and the journal title abbreviation (NZBLQ). NZBLQ is the
abbreviation for the New Zealand Business Law Quarterly.

Anatomy of an Article Citation by Kate Thompson. CC-BY-NC 4.0

Steps to Find a Journal Article

 1. Decode the journal title by using the Cardiff Index to Legal Abbreviations.
 2. Take the full title (eg, New Zealand Business Law Quarterly) and paste it into the library catalogue.
 3. Follow the prompts to the hardcopy version that might be on the shelves or click the link to the

      electronic journal.
 4. Look at your citation again to find the appropriate year or volume and then the start page.

The majority of legal journal articles are available online in databases, such as Lexis Advance, Westlaw New
Zealand or HeinOnline. If journal articles cannot be located using the steps above, try these legal databases.
Note that publishers will only host the journals they publish in their own databases, so if the article cannot
be found in one database, try another. Contact a law librarian for further guidance if required.

GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS

   Kate Thompson and Melanie Lovich

Law Reform Materials

The New Zealand Law Commission | Te Aka Matua o te Ture is an independent body whose function
is to review the law and make recommendations to the Government to improve it.1 "It has the power to
initiate proposals for the review, reform or development of any aspect of the law of New Zealand."2

The Law Commission's website is searchable and contains reports and publications since 1987. NZLII
also contains a New Zealand Law Reform Library, including historical materials dating from before the
Law Commission was formed. In certain circumstances, law-reform materials along with the relevant
parliamentary documents may be used to help interpret legislation.

The Law Commission reports and study papers are a rich source of information. Their extensive research
outputs include bibliographies, research in comparative jurisdictions and legal expert consultations. Some
reports are now quite old, so consider currency when you consult them for your research.

     Example of law reform in action

     The Commission's report Company Law: Reform and Restatement (NZLC R9, 1989)
     examined and reviewed the law relating to bodies incorporated under the Companies Act
     1955 and reported on the form and content of a new Companies Act. Their
     recommendations were implemented in the Companies Act 1993, the Receiverships Act 1993
     and in amendments to the Property Law Act 1952 and the Companies Act 1955. In 2024, the

       Minister of Justice asked the Commission to undertake a review of the Companies Act 1993
       directors' duties and liabilities.

Policy Documents

Public policy documents such as reports, discussion papers and working papers may reference key
legislation and statistical data and provide valuable background on matters relating to justice, social issues,
international relations, government regulation and more. You may find policy documents on government
and non-profit organisation websites. Many will have internal search engines to help you locate
publications; alternatively, use a Google site search, for example "mental health" adoption site:govt.nz will
only retrieve results regarding mental health and adoption from government departments in New Zealand.
Government department websites always focus on the most up-to-date information available, but for
researchers, looking at older policies can be a powerful way to understand decisions of the day. The
Wayback Machine, from the Internet Archive, has been scraping and saving specific pages from the internet
since the late 1990s and is an excellent tool to help locate older policy documents.

OTHER SOURCES

   Kate Thompson and Melanie Lovich

Depending on your assignment topic, your research may be enhanced by using non-legal sources. You may
find supporting data or information in other disciplines, for example, criminology, politics, statistics or
health science.

News

Newspaper articles, radio and media outlets report on and discuss the latest legal developments. Access
news articles via your university library, news websites and archives, such as Google News or Papers Past.

Company and Industry Information

Use company reports and industry profiles to locate information on the legal industry, law firms and legal
practice. This type of business and financial information also provides background information on clients
and competitors and is generally available on company websites and via your university library's databases.

Statistics

Statistical data can help you learn more about geographic regions and the current economic and social
climate. Stats NZ provides in-depth reports based on census data. Your university library can apply for
bespoke data sets on your behalf. There are many international government and non-profit organisations
that collect economic, industry and population data and make it freely available online. For example, the
OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) and the World Bank.

Theses and Dissertations

Many law schools provide access to previously completed Honours dissertations. While you cannot
completely rely on the quality of such documents, they can be an excellent source of ideas and references.
Masters and PhD theses are more rigorously tested and are therefore a more reliable source of information.
All universities in Aotearoa New Zealand have freely accessible institutional repositories containing theses.
Many New Zealand theses and dissertations are also accessible via NZ Research.
75 | OTHER SOURCES

Repositories and Open Access

Repositories1 are good sources of freely available, open-access materials, both current and historic. These
kinds of materials are mainly found online. Below is a small sample available to all:

                        software applications, audiovisual and print materials

Archives New Zealand

Government agencies create an immense volume of records, producing data, documents, correspondence
and so forth. Once these records are assessed and it is determined that they have long-term value, they are
transferred to Archives New Zealand and archived.

Archives date from about 1840 to the recent past. They come in a wide range of formats, including written
documents, photographs, moving images and sound.

Types of records you can find include:

   Coroners' inquests into deaths;
   Land registrations;
   Police and prison records;
   Court records, including divorce and bankruptcy files and probated wills;
   Politicians' papers;
   Maps and plans for public works.

Although the Archives New Zealand collections are large, only a small percentage of records created by the

New Zealand government is held there. Most records have not been kept as they were not believed to be
valuable or were lost or damaged by disaster or through human error.

Records can be viewed in person from the four main centres - Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch and
Dunedin - or online. Many records have been digitised and can be accessed online. Archives New Zealand
is a very useful source for locating original documents beyond law. It is available to all members of the
public.

Parliamentary Library

The Parliamentary Library is attached to the Parliament buildings in Wellington. It is a working library that
provides research services for Members of Parliament and parliamentary staff. The library also responds to
requests from the public for information on any aspect of Parliament.

The Parliamentary Library publishes the Monthly Economic Review and research papers on a wide range of
topics.

Much of the more recent information is available online via the Parliament website; however, older material
may be harder to obtain, so you may need to contact the Library and potentially prepare a visit in person
to Wellington.

REFERENCING IN LEGAL WRITING

   Melanie Lovich and Theresa Buller

     Learning Outcomes

     After reading this chapter, you will be able to:
           understand the reasons for the citation of legal authorities in student work;
           apply specific rules of the New Zealand Law Style Guide to correctly cite legal material.

Referencing is a key part of legal writing.
It is important that you show your reader (and marker) where they can find the legal authorities, quotes,
words and ideas you used to create your legal argument.
Within your written work you need to:

   correctly attribute where you found the material you used as evidence for your argument;
   apply a consistent referencing style so that others can find the material you used.
Not doing so can led to accusations of plagiarism and can affect your study or even your ability to practise
law in the future.

NZLSG 3RD EDITION

   Melanie Lovich and Theresa Buller

The New Zealand Law Style Guide (NZLSG) is used by "the judiciary, the universities and the profession
as the standard way to cite New Zealand law."1

NZLSG is available as a printed book or online through both the New Zealand Law Foundation and the
Australasian Legal Information Institute.

NZLSG is New Zealand-centric and differs from styles used in other jurisdictions such as the Australian
Guide to Legal Citation (AGLC),2 the Canadian Guide to Uniform Legal Citation,3 the Oxford University
Standard for Citation of Legal Authorities4 (OSCOLA, used for citing United Kingdom material) and The
Bluebook5 (used for citing material from the United States of America).

Generally, you must follow the rules and format of the rules in NZLSG to cite material in your assignments
(and later in the courts), although it can be helpful to consult the style guides of other jurisdictions
to understand how material is cited in its originating jurisdiction. This chapter discusses aspects of the
NZLSG that commonly attract questions from students of law. The NZLSG is the recognised authority
for legal citation in New Zealand.

36.

NZLSG FOOTNOTES

   Melanie Lovich and Theresa Buller

NZLSG is a footnoting style with a bibliography at the end rather than an in-text style such as APA.
It means your writing will look like this:

       This is my example.1 [where you use a footnote each and every time you use a quotation or idea from
       a case, piece of legislation, book, journal article or other material to support your argument]
       1 My citation is here. [then at the bottom of each page you enter the full reference of the source for
       your reader to locate if needed]
       Not
       This is my example (Author, 2024). [this author-date style is an in-text citation style and is not used
       in law]
To insert a footnote within Microsoft Word:

 1. Select the References tab;
 2. Click Insert Footnote.

At the end of your work you will need a bibliography listing all the material you have read, even if you have
not included them in a footnote to support a proposition within your argument.
Rule 2 of NZLSG provides guidance about the general format of footnotes.
NZLSG covers many different types of sources. Begin by identifying the type of source you need to
reference and then locate the associated rule in NZLSG's contents or index. Further information on how
to cite specific sources is listed on the following pages.

   Is the entire book written by one author or several authors in which each author has contributed to
      the writing of the whole book?

   Is each chapter written by an individual author or several authors?

Books in Which One Author or Several Authors Have
Written the Whole Book

If the whole book is written by one author or by several authors in which each author has contributed to
the writing of the whole book, you need to use rule 6.1 and include the following information:

   name of the author or authors as written on the book;
   title of the book, in italics;
   the edition of the book if it is the second or later edition;
   the publisher of the book;
   the place where the book was published;
   the year the book was published.

     Example: Peter Spiller The Disputes Tribunals of New Zealand (2nd ed, Brookers, Wellington,

83 | CITING BOOKS AND CHAPTERS IN BOOKS

You can find most of the information to cite a book from the book itself - look at the first few pages to find
the publishing information - or from your institution's library catalogue.

Note that all books - whether you access them in print or electronically - should be cited using rule 6.1
unless they have only been published electronically with no equivalent print version (rule 6.1.9(b)). This
occurs rarely with legal texts.

Authors' names

In the example above, the book had one author, but sometimes there is more than one author who has
contributed to the writing of the whole book. How you cite them depends on the number of authors. Note
that in NZLSG authors are cited in the order first name then last name, eg Peter Spiller rather than Spiller,
P. If an author uses their initials rather than their first name, use what is written on the book. In addition,
unless an author is a Law Lord or a Justice of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom (and referred to
as a Lord or Lady), omit any honorifics such as Dr, Professor, Justice, Judge or titles such as "the Hon" (see
rules 1.1.6 and 6.1.2(d)).

If you have more than one author (for example when one authorship team has written the entire book),
follow rule 6.1.2 and cite authors as follows:

       two authors - first name last name and first name last name, eg

               Elizabeth Toomey and Toni Collins

       three authors - first name last name, first name last name and first name last name , eg

               Elizabeth Toomey, Toni Collins and Adrienne Paul

       if there are four or more authors, provide the first-listed author followed by "and others", eg

               Elizabeth Toomey and others

Books in Which Each Chapter Has an Individual Named
Author or Authors

Sometimes each chapter within a book has a clearly named author or authors. This occurs when multiple
authors contribute to a book that is compiled by an overall editor or editors. The editor or editors may also
write their own chapter or chapters within the edited book.

When citing a chapter within a book, cite both the individual chapter and the book in which it was
published (so that your marker or reader can locate the chapter) using rule 6.2 and include the following
information:

   name of the chapter author or authors;
   title of the chapter, in quotation marks;
   an acknowledgment that the chapter is published in a book with the use of "in";
   name of the editor or editors as written on the book, indicating their role with the use of (ed) or

      (eds);
   title of the book, in italics;
   the edition of the book if it is the second or later edition;

CITING CASES

   Melanie Lovich and Theresa Buller

When citing a case, you will need to determine first:

   if your case has a neutral citation;
   if your case has been reported in a law report series.

Rule 3 of NZLSG covers how to cite cases.

Case citations include:

   the names of the parties involved;
   the year the case was heard (for neutral and unreported citations);
   the court the case was heard in;
   if it is a reported case: the year in which the case was reported, the volume, abbreviation of the law

      report series and starting page number of your case.

How you cite your case will depend on whether it has a neutral citation and whether it has been
reported in a law report series.

All cases have a unique citation. It is important that you include all the components within your citation to
help your reader find the case you are referring to. This is especially important if your case has been heard
multiple times or in multiple courts.

If you are unsure whether your case has a neutral citation or whether it has been reported, use your citation
or the information you have on your case to search within the legal databases and check the information
available within the databases.

If a Case Has a Neutral Citation and Has Not Been
Reported in a Law Report Series

When citing a case that has a neutral citation and has not been reported in a law report series, use the
neutral citation to cite the case (rule 3.3).
87 | CITING CASES

Neutral citations were progressively introduced in New Zealand from 2005 onwards. They are a sequential
numbering system used by each court to identify cases.

A case that has a neutral citation and has not been reported in a law report series will include the following:

   party names, in italics;
   the year the case was decided, inside square [ ] brackets;
   the court identifier;
   the unique sequential number given to the case by the court.

Format for Citing Cases With a Neutral Citation

Case Name        Year    Court Identifier  Judgment Number
Macken v Jervis  [2014]  NZHC              3408.

Example: Macken v Jervis [2014] NZHC 3408.

Macken v Jervis was heard by the High Court in 2014. It was the 3408th case issued by the
High Court in 2014. This case was never reported in a law report series.

If a Case Has a Neutral Citation and Has Also Been
Reported in a Law Report Series

If a case has a neutral citation, include both the neutral citation and the reported citation (rule 3.2). This
indicates to your reader that there is something significant enough for the case to have been reported in
a law report series. Before online databases existed, only reported cases could be accessed by lawyers (in
books) and so only the most significant cases were reported. Despite wider access today in online databases,
the significance of reporting cases continues.

A case that has a neutral citation and has also been reported in a law report series will include the following:

   party names, in italics;
   the year the case was decided, inside square [ ] brackets;
   the court identifier;
   the unique sequential number given to the case by the court;
   the year the case was reported [this may be different from when it was heard by the court!];
   the volume number in which the case was reported;
                                                                             CITING CASES | 88

 the abbreviation of the law report series in which the case was reported;
 the page on which the case starts.

Regal Castings Ltd v
Lightbody             [2008] NZSC 87, [2009] 2       NZLR

Example: Regal Castings Ltd v Lightbody [2008] NZSC 87, [2009] 2 NZLR 433.

Regal Castings Ltd v Lightbody was heard by the Supreme Court in 2008. It was the 87th
case heard by the Supreme Court in 2008. Then it was reported in the New Zealand Law
Reports in 2009. It was reported in volume two and this case starts on page 433.

If a Case Does Not Have a Neutral Citation But Has Been
Reported in a Law Report Series

If a case does not have a neutral citation (likely if it was heard by the courts before the mid-2000s) but it
was reported in a law report series, include only the reported citation (rule 3.2).

A case that does not have a neutral citation but was reported in a law report series includes the following:

   party names, in italics;
   the year the case was reported [this may be different from when it was heard by the court!];
   the volume number in which the case was reported;
   the abbreviation of the law report series in which the case was reported;
   the page on which your case starts;
   a court identifier.

Court identifiers are used when it is not clear from the reported citation which court the case was heard
in. If you have a neutral citation, you do not need to identify the court as the court is clear from the court
identifier within the neutral citation. A court identifier helps your reader to identify quickly which court
your case was heard in and is helpful when there are multiple iterations of a case in multiple courts.
89 | CITING CASES

                   Format for Citing Cases With a Reported Citation

Example: Fitzgerald v Muldoon [1976] 2 NZLR 615 (SC).

Fitzgerald v Muldoon is too early to have a neutral citation (it was heard by the then
Supreme Court, now the High Court, in 1976) but it was reported in volume 2 of the New
Zealand Law Reports in the same year, starting at page 615.

If a Case Does Not Have a Neutral Citation and Was
Never Reported in a Law Report Series

Finally, if a case does not have a neutral citation and was never reported in a law report series, cite it as an
unreported judgment using rule 3.4.

A case that does not have a neutral citation and is not reported in a law report series includes the following:

   party names, in italics;
   the court abbreviation;
   the registry location in which the case was heard (for cases in the High Court and below);
   the file number of the case;
   the date of the judgment.

For example, the case Potts v Anderson was heard in the High Court in Whanganui and the judgment was
delivered on the 5th April 2005. The courts have numbered it (No 1) to differentiate another instance of
the same parties with the same file number (CIV-2003-483-304).
                                                                   CITING CASES | 90

                         HC

Example: Potts v Anderson (No 1) HC Wanganui CIV-2003-483-304, 5 April 2005.

Note: the spelling of Whanganui matches the name of Registry as recorded on the
judgment.

Brackets

Case citations may use round ( ) or square [ ] brackets around the date. The shape of the brackets in a case
citation is very important and can be a clue to help you find your case.

Reported cases can use round brackets to show the date on which the case was decided but that the date is
not a key piece of information that you need in finding the case using the case citation. This usually occurs
when law report volumes include cases over a number of years or if the volume numbers increase over time
rather than resetting to volume 1 each year.

More frequently, square brackets are used to show the year in which the case was published in a law report
and that the date is a key piece of information to help find the case using the case citation. Square brackets
are also an indication that the law report series is primarily organised by year with individual volume
numbers restarting from 1 each year.

Neutral citations also use square brackets to show the year in which the case was decided. This may be
confusing at first; however, other elements of the neutral citation should readily differentiate it from a
reported citation.

NZLSG gives more guidance on whether to use round or square brackets at rule 3.2.3(a).
91 | CITING STATUTES AND SECONDARY LEGISLATION

39.

CITING STATUTES AND SECONDARY
LEGISLATION

   Melanie Lovich and Theresa Buller

When citing legislation, you will need to determine first:
   whether you wish to cite an Act or a particular section or sections of an Act;
   whether you wish to cite a piece of secondary legislation or a particular regulation, rule or clause
      within the piece of secondary legislation.

When citing New Zealand statutes and secondary legislation, follow rule 4.

Citing Statutes in Footnotes

When citing statutes, follow rule 4.1.

Citing a whole Act

When citing an Act, include the following information:
   name of the Act;
   the year the Act was enacted.

                  Format for Citing Acts

Name of the Act                  Year the Act Was Enacted
Constitution Act                 1986.

Example: Constitution Act 1986.
                                                                                   CITING STATUTES AND SECONDARY LEGISLATION | 92

Citing a section or sections of an Act

When citing a section or sections of an Act, include the following information:

   name of the Act;
   the year the Act was enacted;
   the section number or numbers [section is abbreviated to s - other abbreviations such as part are

      listed at rule 4.1(d)].

                  Format for Citing Sections of an Act

Name of the Act   Year the Act Was Enacted  Section (Pinpoint Reference)
Constitution Act  1986,                     s 16.

Example: Constitution Act 1986, s 16.

If you want to cite sequential sections, indicate the first and last sections in your citation. For example,
when citing ss 16 through 18 of the Constitution Act, note the first (16) and last (18) sections and link
them with an en dash (-).

       Constitution Act 1986, ss 16-18.
If you want to cite non-sequential sections, include each section number. For example, when citing ss 6 and
10 of the Constitution Act, note both sections and use a comma to indicate they are non-sequential.

       Constitution Act 1986, ss 6, 10.

Citing Secondary Legislation in Footnotes

Secondary legislation includes:

   Regulations;
   Rules;
   Orders;
   Instruments in their own right.

When citing secondary legislation, follow rule 4.3 and include the following information:
93 | CITING STATUTES AND SECONDARY LEGISLATION

   name of the regulation, rule, order or instrument;
   the year the regulation, rule, order or instrument was enacted;
   the regulation number or numbers [regulation is abbreviated to r - other abbreviations such as part

      are listed at rule 4.1(d)].

                  Format for Citing Secondary Legislation

Title             Year the Legislation Was Enacted  Pinpoint Reference (If Required)
High Court Rules  2016,                             r 1.16

Example: High Court Rules 2016, r 1.16.

Citing Statutes Within Your Text

When citing legislation or secondary legislation within the main text, you can give a full reference to the
statute or secondary legislation. Do not include a footnote reference as described above if the title and the
year the Act was enacted are already included in the text. A footnote may be needed, however, if you are
referring to a particular section, sections or regulation.

See rule 2.3.1(a)(ii) for an example of how to cite an Act within your text. This same example applies to
citing secondary legislation within your text.

40.

CITING JOURNAL ARTICLES

   Melanie Lovich and Theresa Buller

Scholarly and practitioner journal articles are cited using rule 6.4 of NZLSG. You do not need to indicate
whether you are citing an online or print version of a journal article.

Citing journal articles

When citing a journal article include the following information:

   name of the author or authors as written on the journal article;
   title of the journal article;

          the article title should be in quotation marks and should follow the formatting of the journal
            article title - italicise any case names or book titles as in the original journal article.

   the year the journal article was published;
          the year in round brackets unless the year is used as the volume number (which happens
            infrequently), then in square brackets - see rule 6.4.4;

   the volume of the journal in which the article was published;
          some journals do not have volume numbers, particularly if one volume is published each year.

   the issue number of the journal volume is usually omitted as redundant;
          most journals number pages consecutively throughout each volume's issues, and so the issue
            number is redundant. For example, the first issue starts with page 1 and the final page is page
            200, then the second issue starts with page 201 and so on throughout the volume.
          if each issue of a volume starts with page number 1, however, include the issue number
            alongside the volume number.

   the abbreviation of the journal title;
          generally you will find this on the article itself (check the second or third page), but if not, use
            the Cardiff Index to Legal Abbreviations to locate the abbreviation. The NZLSG does not use
            punctuation for abbreviations, eg NZULR rather than N.Z.U.L.R.

CITING ONLINE COMMENTARIES AND
LEGAL ENCYCLOPAEDIAS

   Melanie Lovich and Theresa Buller

The two main legal subscription databases (Westlaw New Zealand and Lexis Advance) include online
commentaries and legal encyclopaedias. Each type of source has a specific NZLSG rule.

Citing Online Commentaries

Online commentaries on Westlaw New Zealand and Lexis Advance are cited using rule 6.3 of NZLSG.

Online commentaries are cited differently from websites (even though they are online) as they used to
be accessible only in print, but now are integrated into the legal databases. Some firms and courts still
subscribe to print editions, so your citation needs to identify that you are using the online edition unless
you are using a print edition.

To cite an online commentary, include the following information:

   name of the author or editor if identified by the publisher;
          as with book citations, the role of editor is indicated with (ed) or (eds).
          many online commentaries do not have a named author or editor, and for these the citation
            begins with the title of the commentary.

   title of the online commentary in italics;
   that it is the online edition rather than print edition;
   who the publisher is;

          the three major legal publishers in Aotearoa New Zealand (and their databases) are: Thomson
            Reuters (Westlaw New Zealand), LexisNexis (Lexis Advance) and Wolters Kluwer (CCH
            iKnowConnect).

Example: John Burrows (ed) Land Law (online ed, Thomson Reuters).

Citing a Legal Encyclopaedia

Legal encyclopaedias are cited using rule 6.5, and you need to indicate whether you have used the online or
print version. Online versions are updated much more frequently than the print, and so at times print and
electronic are different - hence the need to identify which version you have used.

The Laws of New Zealand is cited using rule 6.6 as it has a different updating system than other legal
encyclopaedias. When citing the Laws of New Zealand, include the following information:

   the author as identified on the page you viewed;
   the title of the legal encyclopaedia;
   the topic (chapter) that you viewed;

          the easiest way to find this is to look at the file path at the top of the page.

CITING REPORTS AND GOVERNMENT
DOCUMENTS

   Melanie Lovich and Theresa Buller

Papers and reports are cited using rule 5.4. Use this rule to cite government papers and reports as well as
papers and reports from corporations and non-government organisations. These are often accessible online
as PDF documents.

Citing reports and Government documents

To cite a paper or report, include the following information:

   the author or authors;
          if the author is a corporation, government department or non-government organisation, use
            their English name, eg
            Ministry of Justice
            Amnesty International.

   the title in italics;
   the publisher;

          omit the name of the publisher if it is the same as the author.
   the official citation if there is one;
   the date of publication.

When citing papers or reports, include all of the information that you have about the paper or report so
that your reader can locate it if needed. If you are unable to find the author, official citation or date, omit
that element from the citation.

CITING WEBSITES AND SOCIAL MEDIA

   Melanie Lovich and Theresa Buller

Most legal research is conducted online. There are several rules within NZLSG for citing material that you
find online.

Unlike some other citation styles, NZLSG generally does not require you to identify whether you have
viewed a source in print or online, although there are exceptions to this. Your citation tells the reader where
you found the information for your argument, not how you accessed it.

When citing online material, you need to determine whether the material is:

   a case, legislation, a book, journal article, legal encyclopedia or online commentary - specific rules in
      NZLSG for each of these have been covered previously;

   a paper or report - rule 5.4;
   a website;
   social media, such as Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) or LinkedIn.

Citing Websites

If your online source is not covered by another specific rule (have a look at the contents and index pages to
see all the NZLSG rules), cite it as a website using rule 7.1.

To cite a website, include the following information:

   name of the author or authors;
   title of the web page or document;

          enclose the title in quotation marks and follow the formatting of the title on the source. If the
            title is in all capital letters, only capitalise the first letter of significant words.

   the date the document or web page was created within round brackets;
   the name of the website;
   the website address within angle brackets;

          use the top level web address of the website rather than the exact page, eg www.doc.govt.nz
            rather than www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/canterbury/places/weka-pass-
            historic-reserve.
101 | CITING WEBSITES AND SOCIAL MEDIA

Include all the information that you have about the web page or document. If you are unable to find the
author or date, leave it out of the citation. If the name of the website is identical to the author's name, omit
the website name from the citation.

             Format for Citing Websites

Authors      Document Title             Date         Website Name URL
                                                                           <www.justice.govt.nz>.

Justice      Requests"                  2023)

Example: Ministry of Justice "Official Information Act Requests" (8 December 2023)
<www.justice.govt.nz>.

Citing Social Media

The use of social-media sources such as X (formerly Twitter) is generally discouraged; however, rule 7.1.10
offers some assistance for citing social media if required.

To cite a social media, include the following information:

   name of the author or authors;
   social media handle in round brackets ( );
   the first sentence of the social media post in double quotation marks " ";
   the full URL.

Do not give a time stamp as this will differ across time zones.

SUBSEQUENT REFERENCES

   Melanie Lovich and Theresa Buller

Let's now look at how you can cite material a second time within your writing.

Generally your footnotes will be counted as part of your word count, and writing a reference in full every
time would use a significant portion of this. Fortunately, there is a rule in NZLSG for this situation! Rule
2.3 explains how to cite a reference a second or subsequent time within your writing. For university work
use the general style explained in rule 2.3.1(a).

The principle of rule 2.3.1(a) is:

   The first time you cite a source, give the full citation with a pinpoint citation (if needed).
   If you cite the source in the next footnote, just use the pinpoint citation as your reader will infer it is

      the same source.
   If you cite the source again later in your work, give a cross-reference to the first time you have cited

      the source rather than giving the full citation a second or subsequent time. A cross-reference is
      formatted as:
      party names/author surname, above n number of the first footnote of the source, pinpoint citation.

The document linked below explains rule 2.3.1(a) further and includes a number of different examples -
including how to cite legislation a second and subsequent time.

       For example, if I want to cite Regal Castings Ltd v Lightbody multiple times within my
       writing. The first time I cite Regal Castings Ltd v Lightbody the footnote has the full citation
       for the case (see 1 below). If I want to cite this case again immediately afterwards, I just
       include the pinpoint citation as my reader can infer I am talking about the same source (see
       2 below). Then if later in my writing I want to refer to Regal Castings Ltd v Lightbody again, I
       can use the `above n' cross-reference to direct my reader to the full citation earlier in my
       work (see 5 below).

 BIBLIOGRAPHIES

     Melanie Lovich and Theresa Buller

  Unless requested otherwise, include a bibliography at the end of your assignment. The bibliography should
  begin on a new page and have the same formatting (font and spacing) as the rest of your assignment.
  Appendix 7 of NZLSG gives an overview of what a bibliography should include:
  "Bibliographies perform a different function to footnotes... A bibliography notes all the sources used in the
  preparation of a piece, whether they are cited in the footnotes or not."1
  Your bibliography needs to include:

      Every source you have cited in your footnotes (exclude any pinpoint citations in the bibliography);
  and

      Every source you used in the preparation of your assignment, whether you cited them in your
        footnotes or not;
            This is a way to show your marker how widely you have read and the scope of your reading.
            It is also a way to demonstrate that you have read key texts, cases or legislation even if you have
              not cited them within your work.

REFERENCING SOFTWARE

   Melanie Lovich and Theresa Buller

If you are doing a substantial piece of legal research, you may wish to use referencing software to help you
manage your references and assist with formatting your citations.

While referencing software can be a time-saver, it does require an investment in time to set up and learn
its intricacies. It is also helpful to have a strong understanding of your chosen referencing style so you can
identify any output errors from the referencing software. For these reasons, it is best to consider using
referencing software only if you are doing a significant piece of legal research and writing, such as in
Honours or postgraduate study.

There are two main referencing software tools:

 1. EndNote is a subscription bibliographic management tool. Most New Zealand universities have a
      subscription to EndNote and provide substantial EndNote support to their users. Note that in order
      to format your citations in the NZLSG style, you will also need to download the NZLSG output
      style from the University of Canterbury.1

 2. Zotero / JurisM is an open-source referencing tool. Juris-M is free reference management software
      that is based on, but separate from, Zotero and is designed for legal researchers. The University of
      Canterbury has created a specific Zotero style for the third edition of the NZLSG.2 In addition,
      Victoria University of Wellington has guidance on the use of Zotero3 and JurisM.4
