                                 TESTIMONIALS

Global Corruption is the Canadian (and arguably US and UK) definitive text on ABAC. Like Hogg
on constitutional law, but for anticorruption. Throughout the day [of publication], my
counterparts from the other banks emailed back their thanks and great surprise at the sheer
wealth of the resource that Ferguson has provided.

Daryl Davis (H.B.A., B.C.L. & LLB.) - Chief Advisor Sanction and Anti-Corruption Program
Management National Bank of Canada

In Global Corruption, Ferguson provides a rich analysis of the nature, scope and extent of global
corruption by canvassing international requirements and UK, US and Canadian law on a vast
array of topics from the investigation, prosecution and sanctioning of corruption, money
laundering and the recovery of corruption proceeds to laws and policies on preventative
mechanisms such as the regulation of public procurement, lobbying, campaign financing,
whistleblowing and other corruption risks.

Dr. Leonardo Borlini - Department of Law Bocconi University & Co-author of Corruption: Economic
Analysis and Law

This book by Ferguson is an invaluable resource for the international community as he provides
an amazing wealth of information and analysis for students and practitioners on the scope and
details of the international standards against corruption, including the UN and OECD
conventions as well as the various ways in which the laws of US, UK and Canada attempt to
combat corruption.

Dr. Nikos Passas - Professor of Criminology & Criminal Justice, Northeaster University. Senior
Fellow of the Financial Integrity Institute, Case Western Reserve School of Law

The 2022 edition of Global Corruption, expanded and updated to include new content from a
variety of subject matter experts, provides impressive coverage of a range of issues spanning the
field of anti-corruption. It offers a comprehensive yet remarkably accessible set of resources for
those interested and engaged in tackling corruption. Whether you are approaching the topic of
corruption as an interested citizen, an affected businessperson, a seasoned advisor, or a
government policy-maker, you will find this book to be full of valuable material.

Anthony Cole, Partner, National Lead - White Collar Crime and Government Investigations, Dentons
Canada LLP and Chair of Legal Committee, Transparency International Canada

The 2022 edition of Global Corruption is a comprehensive view of the disastrous impact of
corruption on the most marginalized globally, under a Canadian political, legal and regulatory
lens. The practical comparisons between the applicable systems in Canada with other
jurisdictions puts the Canadian response to corruption into a global context. A handy reference
guide to anyone with an interest in how Canada's anticorruption framework stacks up globally.

                     PREFACE TO THE FOURTH EDITION

This fourth edition marks the transformation of Global Corruption: Its Regulation under
International Conventions, US, UK, and Canadian Law and Practice from a single-authored work
to a collectively authored one. I am excited to introduce 15 anti-corruption experts as authors
and co-authors of various chapters. The edition also contains two new chapters entitled
Collective Action (Chapter 15) and The Role of NGOs (Chapter 16). Many new and emerging
corruption topics are introduced into the updated, fourth edition.

                                                                                                    Gerry Ferguson

                      PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION

I am most grateful to Inba Kehoe, Copyright Officer & Scholarly Communication Librarian
at the University of Victoria Libraries, for suggesting that I produce an open-access print
version of my 2017 electronic version of Global Corruption: Law, Theory and Practice. This
edition includes a number of significant anti-corruption developments that have occurred
in the past year, but not all changes and developments. Thus this edition is comprehensively
updated to January 2017 and selectively updated to February 2018. This edition also adds a
new Chapter 13 entitled "Campaign Finance Laws: Controlling the Risks of Corruption and
Public Cynicism" and a Table of Acronyms.

                     PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION

It has only been 18 months since the first edition of this book was published. But the
frequency of corruption and the social, legal, economic and political responses to corruption
continue to increase at a dizzying pace.
While organized on the same model as the first edition, the second edition includes
references to up-to-date anti-corruption laws, policies, best practices and excellent research
resources such as books, articles and reports by NGOs, government bodies, academics and
practitioners. In addition, several topics have been either introduced or significantly
expanded in each chapter. The detailed Table of Contents following the Preface to the first
edition indicates the scope of the topics covered in this book.

                                                                                                    Gerry Ferguson
                                                                                                         January 2017

                             ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

As with the first edition, this book would not have seen the light of day without the
contributions of a dedicated team of legal research assistants. This is especially true in the
case of the chief editor, Mary Wallace, who painstakingly reviewed and edited the entire
book. I am deeply indebted to the following students who researched and updated various
chapters: Connor Bildfell, Sarah Chaster, Dmytro Galagan, David Gill, Laura Ashley
MacDonald, Madeline Reid and Matthew Spencer. I am also very grateful to Dmytro
Galagan and Jeremy Henderson who added new sections to Chapters 7 and 12 and to
Victoria Luxford, Joseph Mooney and Jeremy Sapers who updated their Chapters (9, 10 and
12). Finally I am very grateful to the CBA Law for the Future Fund, the Law Foundation of
British Columbia and the Foundation for Legal Research who generously funded my
research assistants for this book.

                                                                                                         xxxi
                       PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION

In the beginning there was no corruption but Adam got greedy, abused his position of
privilege by going for the apple and things have gone downhill ever since. Corruption is
now an inescapable reality of modern life.

Purpose of this Book

No Canadian law school (prior to UVic Law in September, 2015) had a course on global
corruption, and relatively few law schools around the world have such a course. This book
has been specifically created to make it easier for professors to offer a law school course on
global corruption. This book is issued under a creative commons license and can be used for
free in whole or in part for non-commercial purposes. The first chapter sets out the general
context of global corruption: its nature and extent, and some views on its historical, social,
economic and political dimensions. Each subsequent chapter sets out international
standards and requirements in respect to combating corruption - mainly in the UN
Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC) and the OECD Bribery of Foreign Officials
Convention (OECD Convention). The laws of the United States and United Kingdom are
then set out as examples of how those Convention standards and requirements are met in
two influential jurisdictions. Finally, the law of Canada is set out. Thus, a professor from
Africa, Australia, New Zealand or English speaking countries in Asia and Europe has a
nearly complete coursebook - for example, that professor can delete the Canadian sections
of this book and insert the law and practices of his or her home country in their place.

While primarily directed to a law school course on global corruption, I expect that this
coursebook, or parts of it, will be of interest and use to professors teaching courses on
corruption from other academic disciplines and to lawyers and other anti-corruption
practitioners.

Genesis of this Book

The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) is responsible for promoting the
adoption of and compliance with UNCAC. Chapter II of UNCAC is focused on Prevention
of Corruption. Educating the lawyers, public officials and business persons of tomorrow on
anti-corruption laws and strategies is one preventative strategy. Recognizing this, the
UNODC set up an Anti-Corruption Academic Initiative (ACAD) to promote the teaching of
corruption in academic institutions by collecting and distributing materials on corruption.
As a member of the ACAD team, this coursebook is my contribution to that worthy goal.

Where to Next

As a first edition, there is room for improvement in this book. I hope to update and repost
this book annually. In future editions, I would like, for example,

     · to provide an index
     · to expand chapter 8 on the "Role of Lawyers in Advising Business Clients on

          Corruption and Anti-Corruption Issues"

xxxii
     · to include a chapter on corruption and political parties and campaign financing
     · and perhaps to add a few chapters on corruption in specific business sectors such as

          extractive industries, infra-structure projects etc.

I would be very pleased to hear from users of this book especially in regard to the inevitable
errors and omissions that I have made in trying to describe and comment on the vast field
of global corruption under UNCAC and the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention, and the laws
of United States, United Kingdom and Canada.

Finally, I would like to thank the many NGOs and government agencies that have produced
an incredible volume of excellent studies and reports on corruption/anti-corruption issues
and for making those studies and reports, many of which are used in this book, publicly
available.

                                                                                                    Gerry Ferguson
                                                                                                     September 2015

not have been possible without the excellent research and writing of Joseph Mooney, Jeremy
Sapers, Mollie Deyong, Erin Halma and Victoria Luxford. Other indispensable angels
included Laura MacDonald, Courtney Barnes, Lauryn Kerr and Ryan Solcz. I would like to
sincerely thank the following organizations for helping to fund the research students: Law

Corruption, according to former World Bank President Jim Yong Kim, is "public enemy
number one" in the developing world, and "every dollar that a corrupt official or corrupt
business person puts in his or her pockets is a dollar stolen from a pregnant woman who
needs healthcare, or from a girl or boy who deserves an education, or from communities that
need water, roads and schools."1 Recently, it has been estimated that as much as $1 trillion
annually is siphoned off from developing countries by corruption, tax evasion, and other
large financial crimes.2 The World Bank has estimated that as much as $40 billion in foreign
aid to the world's poorest countries has been lost to corruption in recent years.3 And it is
estimated that 3.6 million people die from inadequate health care and living conditions each
year in part because corruption has resulted in the theft of significant amounts of
development aid.4 Volkan Bozkir, the President of the UN General Assembly, commented
that "corruption corrodes public trust, weakens the rule of law, seeds conflict, destabilizes
peacebuilding efforts, undermines human rights, impedes progress on gender equality and
hinders efforts to achieve the targets of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. It
also hits the poor, the marginalized and the most vulnerable the hardest. For all those
reasons, the world cannot -- and will not -- allow corruption to continue."5 On June 2, 2021,
the G7 foreign ministers stated that they "recognize that corruption is a pressing global
issue"6 which they fully intend to address. And on June 10, 2021 Integrity Initiatives
International, an NGO, announced that "more than 100 world leaders from over 40

countries"7 have signed a declaration for the creation of an International Anti-Corruption
Court to prosecute, punish and deter kleptocrats and others engaged in grand corruption.

During his tenure as Vice President in 2014, Joe Biden declared that "corruption is a cancer,
a cancer that eats away at a citizen's faith in democracy. [It] diminishes the instinct for
innovation and creativity, already-tight national budgets, crowding out important national
investments. It wastes the talent of entire generations. It scares away investments and jobs."8
He then added "most importantly it denies the people their dignity. It saps the collective
strength and resolve of a nation. Corruption is just another form of tyranny."9 Former UK
Prime Minister David Cameron also stated in 2014 "don't let anyone keep corruption out of
how we tackle poverty."10 In 2016, the former US Secretary of State John Kerry warned about
the dangers of corruption, stating "[c]orruption is not just a disgrace and a crime. It is also
dangerous. There is nothing more demoralizing, more destructive, more disempowering to
a citizen than the belief that the system is rigged against them, the belief that the system is
designed to fail them, and that people in positions of power, to use a diplomatic term, are
`crooks' -- crooks who are embezzling the future of their own people."11 In his first year in
office, President Biden has reaffirmed his stance against corruption by issuing a
memorandum setting out anti-corruption efforts as a national security concern; in doing so,
he also noted that "corruption ... contributes to national fragility, extremism, and migration;
and provides authoritarian leaders a means to undermine democracy worldwide."12 In light
of all the above, there should be little doubt that corruption is a pressing global issue that
needs much more attention in all parts of the world.

country and the safety of thousands of poor Bangladesh citizens who cross the Padma River
daily in crowded, unsafe boats. The World Bank cancelled funding for the bridge project
because very senior politicians and officials in the Bangladesh government allegedly
solicited bribes from bidding companies. SNC-Lavalin allegedly agreed to pay those bribes
in order to get the engineering contract (worth $50 million) to supervise the bridge
construction. SNC-Lavalin, a Canadian-based company, operates in over 100 other countries
and was at that time one of the five largest, international engineering firms in the world.

Background on Padma Bridge Corruption Scandal

When allegations of bribery concerning the awarding of the engineering contract to SNC-
Lavalin arose, the World Bank (WB) instituted an investigation by an external evaluation
panel in the Fall of 2012. According to the WB Panel report, there was evidence that in late
March of 2011 two members of the Bangladesh Bridge Project Evaluation Committee (BPEC)
unlawfully informed senior SNC-Lavalin officers in Bangladesh that SNC-Lavalin was
second behind another firm, Halcrow, in the bidding process, but that no final
recommendation had been made. In addition to BPEC's recommendation, the awarding of
the engineering contract would also have to be approved by Minister Syed Abul Hossain of
the Bangladesh government. SNC-Lavalin officers allegedly took several steps to improve
the company's ranking on BPEC's list. Mohammad Ismail, Director of a SNC-Lavalin
subsidiary in Bangladesh was the main representative in the bidding process, along with
SNC-Lavalin local consultant Md Mostafa. Ismail and Mostafa dealt directly with Zulfiquar
Bhuiyan, Secretary of the Bridge Authority, as well as a member of BPEC and Minister
Hossain. Bhuiyan indicated that he and the Minister expected to have a face-to-face meeting
with a top SNC-Lavalin executive to "seal the project." Ramesh Shah was a Vice-President
of SNC-Lavalin International Inc. (SLII) and reported to Kevin Wallace, Senior Vice-
President of SLII and the executive assigned to the Padma Bridge project. SLII was a
relatively small subsidiary or division of the SNC-Lavalin Group of companies. Its head
office was located in Oakville, Ontario.

In May 2011, Ramesh Shah and Kevin Wallace flew to Bangladesh for a face-to-face meeting
with Bhuiyan and Minister Hossain. The meeting was facilitated by an influential
government Minister, Abul Hasan Chowdhury, whom the prosecution alleges was also an
agent of SNC-Lavalin. After the meeting, Ramesh Shah wrote in his notebook, "PADMA
PCC ... 4% Min ... 1% Secretary" in respect to the $50 million bridge supervision contract.
"PCC" was SNC-Lavalin's internal notation for "project consultancy or commercial costs"
which apparently was used in SLII's accounts to refer to bribery payments.14 "Min"
presumably referred to Minister Hossain and "Secretary" presumably referred to Secretary
Bhuiyan. Two weeks later, SNC-Lavalin International Inc. was awarded the contract.

As noted, the World Bank "suspended" its funding for Padma Bridge in 2012 pending an
external evaluation of alleged corruption by a WB Investigative Panel. After completing its
initial evaluation, the WB panel recommended corruption charges be laid against several
persons, including Minister Hossain. Bangladesh's Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) laid

conspiracy to bribe charges against seven persons, but they adamantly refused to include
Minister Hossain. The World Bank threatened to cancel the Padma Bridge loan agreement
due to this refusal to conduct a "full and fair" corruption inquiry of all suspects. In January
2013, before the World Bank formally cancelled its loan, Bangladesh "withdrew" its formal
request to the World Bank for funding of the bridge.

Meanwhile the Bangladesh ACC continued to investigate the charge of conspiracy to bribe
by seven persons: three Bangladesh officials (including the Prime Minister's nephew,
Ferdous, Zaber and Bhuiyan), three SNC officials (Wallace, Shah, and Mohammad Ismail),
and SNC's local agent Mostafa. Remarkably, the ACC, in its final report in September 2014,
concluded that there was not sufficient evidence to proceed with a charge of conspiracy to
bribe against any of these men. The ACC also reported that Ministers Hossain and
Chowdhury had no involvement in the alleged bribery scheme (see Chapter 6, Section 3.2
for further discussion on the Bangladesh ACC). The ACC report was then filed with the
Bangladesh court and on October 30, 2014, the Court acquitted all seven persons of
conspiracy to bribe.

The bridge was originally scheduled for completion in 2014. According to Bangladesh news
sources, work on the bridge began again in 2015 using domestic financing and apparently a
$2 billion investment from China. The government of Bangladesh initially claimed the
bridge would be complete by 2018. In January of 2016, the Executive Committee of the
National Economic Council (ECNEC) approved a third revision to the Padma Bridge project
raising the total project cost to more than Tk80 billion (roughly $1.02 billion) over budget.
As of June 2021, the bridge is said to be 87 percent finished, the estimated cost has now
ballooned to over $8 billion15 and the expected completion date is now set for somewhere
between April and June 2022.16 The Bangladesh Bridge Authority claimed that the increased
budget is due to delayed implementation and associated factors including rising costs for
construction materials, consultancy services, land, and the recruitment of more people to
speed up the process.17 Independent sources have suggested that the climbing costs were
also at least in part due to further bribery and corruption, and that in order to fund the
project the Bangladesh government had to divert resources from essential services like
health care.18

15 It has been reported that "[t]he bridge's road section, which costs U.S. $3.87 billion, is being funded
by Bangladesh's government and being built by China Railway Major Bridge Engineering, a state-
run company. The Chinese government agreed to finance 85 percent of the cost of the $4.8 billion rail
portion through a loan to Bangladesh": "Bangladesh Installs Last Span of Ambitious Chinese-Backed

Adverse Consequences for Citizens of Bangladesh

Cancellation of funding from the World Bank meant that construction of the Padma Bridge
was halted. The bridge was at that time estimated to cost $3 billion and was to be completed
in 2014. Due to the discovery of the bribery agreement between SNC and Bangladesh
officials, there has been at least a seven-year delay in constructing the bridge. Due to this
delay, hundreds of poor Bangladesh citizens continue to drown trying to cross the Padma
River in unsafe boats.19 The construction delay has also prevented the promises of economic
growth for the poor people of this region. And who will pay for the increased costs of the
bridge, now estimated at more than double its original cost? Ultimately the citizens of
Bangladesh will! They are already paying by reason of the government's diversion of
resources for public services, such as healthcare to pay for the inflated cost of the bridge due
to bribery, and they will also have to eventually repay the inflated loan the government took
out to build the bridge. In addition, the ACC's adamant refusal to charge Minister Hossain
with conspiracy to bribe and the conclusion by the ACC and the court in Bangladesh that
there was insufficient evidence to try the Bangladesh officials and the SNC officials involved
in the bribery scheme, leaves the citizens of Bangladesh more cynical than ever as to the
impartiality, honesty, and fairness of its leaders, its ACC, and its courts. The severe adverse
consequences of the World Bank withdrawal of its funding for the Padma Bridge has
resulted in some commentators suggesting that the World Bank should have carried on with
its funding, despite the bribery, and simply increased its integrity supervision of the bridge
going forward.20

individuals and injuring others. The Guardian also mentions "construction work has slowed ferry
transport on the river, prompting many to take the journey on less safe speedboats, which take only
about 15 minutes to make the crossing in contrast to up to two hours on safer ferries." Julfikar Ali
Manik, "27 Killed as Cargo Ship Collides with Ferry in Bangladesh", New York Times (05 April 2021),
online: <https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/05/world/asia/bangladesh-ferry-crash.html> reported that
"hundreds of people have died in accidents on Bangladesh's rivers in recent decades. More than 30
people drowned in June after two ferries collided in Dhaka. In 2015, a cargo ship struck a ferry east
of the capital, killing 69 people. In 2014, an overloaded ferry capsized in the Padma River, killing
more than 100 people."
20 For example, Daniel Binette presents some of the arguments supporting the view that the World
Bank should have continued its financial support for the Padma Bridge project despite the SNC
Lavalin corruption:

            First, as indicated by the mounting costs and delays in the bridge's construction, the World
            Bank's total disengagement may have had the adverse effect of simply substituting SNC
            Lavalin with a more corrupt enterprise. Perhaps the World Bank's additional level of
            oversight, and commitment to fighting corruption, could have reduced the scale of
            corruption, even if that meant accepting some degree of graft.

            Second, even putting the corruption issue to one side, the delay in constructing the Padma
            Bridge due to the World Bank's disengagement has a significant human cost. Bangladesh is

                                                                                                             7
GLOBAL CORRUPTION

Back Home in Canada

The Padma Bridge bribery scandal has also created cynicism in the eyes of Canadians and
other global citizens in respect to the extent of foreign bribery engaged in by Canadian
corporate giants, by the reluctance of Canadian governments to investigate and prosecute
them, and by the widespread public feeling that even in Canada, economically powerful
persons and organizations somehow find ways to avoid conviction for their corporate
crimes. That cynicism has been multiplied many times over in respect to SNC-Lavalin's ten
years of corruption in Libya involving the Gaddafi family. The Libya corruption case
demonstrates the outrageous behaviour of SNC executives, the ineffectiveness of Canadian
law enforcement personnel, and Prime Minister Trudeau's improper efforts to influence
Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould to offer SNC-Lavalin a remediation agreement
instead of proceeding with criminal charges of fraud and foreign bribery.21

Based on the evidence of alleged corruption in regards to the Padma Bridge contract
collected by the World Bank, SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. and the World Bank signed a
Negotiated Resolution Agreement in April 2013, in which SNC-Lavalin International Inc.
(SLII) and over 100 SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. affiliates were debarred from bidding on World
Bank funded projects for ten years.22 The Agreement also provides that the remainder of
SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. will be debarred if SNC-Lavalin does not comply with the terms of
the settlement in relation to improving their internal compliance program. It is hard to
determine what portion of total SNC-Lavalin work is likely to be affected by the World Bank

   an extremely poor country. The Padma Bridge, once completed, would be a boon to the
   economy, linking the capital city, Dhaka, to the poor and underserved southwest of the
   country. At present, the Padma River, which is five kilometers wide, is a significant barrier
   to developing the southwest of the country, as freight and passenger transportation to the
   rest of the country is grossly inadequate at present. The World Bank's mission is first and
   foremost to end extreme poverty. While fighting corruption is another priority of the World
   Bank, to the extent that continued World Bank involvement would have seen the bridge
   constructed sooner, and presumably at a lower cost, one can view the disengagement as a
   mistake.

Binette did, however, conclude that "the Bank ultimately did the right thing in pulling out of the
Padma Bridge project": Daniel Binette, "When Should Corruption be Tolerated? The Case of the
Padma Bridge" (6 November 2015), online (blog): The Global Anticorruption Blog

debarment; however, SNC-Lavalin stated that World Bank-funded projects made up less
than one percent of its revenues at that time.23

The World Bank also alerted the RCMP to evidence of possible corruption it had uncovered.
After its investigation, the RCMP initially laid bribery charges against two top SLII
executives, Mohammad Ismail and Ramesh Shah. They are both Canadian citizens. Then, in
September 2013, the RCMP laid bribery charges against three more persons: Canadian
citizens, Wallace and Bhuiyan and former Minister Abul Hassan Chowdhury, a Bangladeshi
national. One can legitimately ask why the public prosecutor's office did not also charge
SNC-Lavalin, as a separate legal entity, with similar offences, or at least explain why they
did not. A preferred indictment was filed on October 28, 2013, alleging one count of bribery
by all five men committed between December 1, 2009 and September 1, 2011, contrary to
section 3(1)(b) of the Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act (CFPOA). Chowdhury brought
an action to stay the proceedings against him on the grounds that there was no jurisdiction
to prosecute him, a Bangladeshi citizen who had never been in Canada, and whose alleged
unlawful conduct occurred in Bangladesh. Canada has no extradition treaty with
Bangladesh and had not attempted to have Bangladesh surrender Chowdhury for
prosecution in Canada.24 Chowdhury was successful in his court challenge and the charges
against him were stayed.25 Charges against Mohammad Ismail were subsequently dropped,
while the remaining three continued to await trial on the bribery charge.26

In an important pre-trial issue in World Bank Group v Wallace, the Supreme Court of Canada
unanimously ruled that the World Bank does not have to disclose its investigative reports
and similar matters to the four accused.27 The SCC held that any other result would have

27 World Bank Group v Wallace, 2016 SCC 15 [Wallace (2016)]. The World Bank received emails from
tipsters suggesting that there had been corruption in regard to the bridge supervision contract. The
World Bank did its investigation and found evidence of corruption. After SNC-Lavalin Group Inc.
agreed to be debarred from bidding on World Bank-sponsored projects for ten years, the World Bank
shared the tipsters' emails, its own investigative reports and other documents with the RCMP. The
RCMP used that information to obtain a warrant to intercept private communication (a wiretap
warrant) and a search warrant to obtain certain documents from SNC-Lavalin offices. After the
conspiracy to corrupt charge was laid, the accused persons brought an application before an Ontario
Superior Court trial judge to quash the wiretap authorization and thereby exclude from trial the
evidence collected by wiretap. As part of the wiretap challenge, the accused sought an order
requiring production of certain World Bank investigative documents to them. The trial judge
concluded that certain World Bank documents were "likely relevant" to the accused's right to a fair
trial and therefore ordered those documents be produced for review before the court. However, on
further application to the Supreme Court of Canada, the production order was quashed by the SCC

hampered the investigation and would have been a significant blow to future cooperation
from agencies such as the World Bank.

A Shocking Conclusion

On January 6, 2017 the trial judge, Justice Nordheimer, threw out all the wiretap evidence in
the case against Wallace, Bhuiyan, and Shah on the basis, amongst others, that the
information provided in the Information to Obtain (ITO) was nothing more than
"speculation, gossip and rumour."28 If that was true, what does that say about the experience
and competence of the senior RCMP officers who sought the wiretap, and of any prosecutor
who may have assisted in obtaining it?29 If the trial judge's overall characterization of the
ITO was incorrect, why didn't the Public Prosecution Service of Canada (PPSC) appeal that
decision? Barely one month later, the Crown elected to not call any witnesses at the trial on
the grounds that "we had no reasonable prospect of conviction based on the evidence."30 As
a result, all three accused were acquitted.31 If the wiretap evidence was as legally suspect as
Justice Nordheimer found, why didn't the PPSC pursue the other available evidence before
the trial began that would have supported the continuation of the prosecution. The PPSC
had already dropped charges against Mohammad Ismail in exchange for his testimony in
respect to the bribe.32 In addition, the PPSC could have pursued a plea agreement or a non-
prosecution agreement with one of the original conspirators in exchange for their
cooperation and testimony? It is in the public interest to ask whether the RCMP officers and
prosecutors were up to the task of investigating and prosecuting this foreign bribery case?
A judicial inquiry and subsequent public explanation of why this important CFPOA case fell

on two grounds. First, the World Bank was granted immunity from such disclosure under the
Articles of Agreement setting up the World Bank, Articles which Canada and some 185 countries

apart should have been demanded by all anti-corruption supporters. Such an inquiry would
not only be very helpful in uncovering weaknesses in the current investigations and
prosecutions of foreign corruption in Canada, but may also help reduce the damage done to
Canada's reputation by the dismissal of all charges against all persons involved in the
Padma Bridge corruption case. But sadly, there have been no public voices demanding an
inquiry, and therefore, no inquiry has been established. Indeed, a second judicial inquiry is
needed even more into the "three-ring circus" surrounding the charges that SNC-Lavalin
engaged in ten years of bribery of members of the Gaddafi regime in Libya.33

Criticism of World Bank

It should be noted that some commentators are highly critical of the World Bank's lending
practices. For example, Paul Sarlo34 argues that the World Bank facilitates large scale
corruption by making huge development loans to notoriously corrupt governments without
imposing a regime of adequate due diligence to ensure the loan is used for the intended
project.35 This lack of due diligence opens the door to theft of 20-40% of loans by corrupt
leaders or through the companies they hire to complete the project. Ultimately it is the
citizens of the corrupt borrowing country who pay. They are responsible for full repayment
of the loan with interest, even if part of the loan is stolen.

The next several sections of this chapter will look at the nature, causes, and consequences of
corruption that have motivated world leaders to denounce, and to varying degrees, take
action to fight corruption at both national and global levels.

organization's CleanGovBiz: Integrity in Practice Initiative.36 The initiative seeks to involve
civil society and the private sector in anti-corruption strategies. The brief provides an
overview of the reasons why everyone should be concerned about corruption. The text of
this brief is set out in the following excerpt:

                                                            BEGINNING OF EXCERPT

 The Rational for Fighting Corruption

 The costs of corruption for economic, political and social development are becoming
 increasingly evident. But many of the most convincing arguments in support of the fight
 against corruption are little known to the public and remain unused in political debates.
 This brief provides evidence that reveals the true cost and to explain why governments
 and business must prioritise the fight against corruption.

 What is Corruption?

 Corruption is the abuse of public or private office for personal gain. It includes acts of
 bribery, embezzlement, nepotism or state capture. It is often associated with and
 reinforced by other illegal practices, such as bid rigging, fraud or money laundering.
 [Transparency International describes corruption as "the abuse of entrusted power for
 private gain."]

 What does Corruption Look Like?

 It could be a multinational company that pays a bribe to win the public contract to build
 the local highway, despite proposing a sub-standard offer. It could be the politician
 redirecting public investments to his hometown rather than to the region most in need. It
 could be the public official embezzling funds for school renovations to build his private
 villa. It could be the manager recruiting an ill-suited friend for a high-level position. Or,
 it could be the local official demanding bribes from ordinary citizens to get access to a
 new water pipe. At the end of the day, those hurt most by corruption are the world's
 weakest and most vulnerable.

 Why Fight Corruption?

 Corruption is one of the main obstacles to sustainable economic, political and social
 development, for developing, emerging and developed economies alike.

 Overall, corruption reduces efficiency and increases inequality. Estimates show that the
 cost of corruption equals more than 5% of global GDP (US$ 2.6 trillion, World Economic
 Forum) with over US$ 1 trillion paid in bribes each year (World Bank). It is not only a
 question of ethics; we simply cannot afford such waste.

1. Corruption increases the cost of doing business

First, bribes and drawn-out negotiations to bargain them add additional costs to a
transaction. Second, corruption brings with it the risk of prosecution, important penalties,
blacklisting and reputational damage. Third, engaging in bribery creates business
uncertainty, as such behaviour does not necessarily guarantee business to a company;
there can always be another competing company willing to offer a higher bribe to tilt the
business in its favour.

On the macro level, corruption distorts market mechanisms, like fair competition and
deters domestic and foreign investments, thus stifling growth and future business
opportunities for all stakeholders. IMF research has shown that investment in corrupt
countries is almost 5% less than in countries that are relatively corruption-free. The World
Economic Forum estimates that corruption increases the cost of doing business by up to
10% on average. Siemens, the German engineering giant, had to pay penalties of US$ 1.6
billion in 2008 to settle charges that it routinely engaged in bribery around the world. A
significant negative impact of corruption on a country's capital productivity has been
proven.

2. Corruption leads to waste or the inefficient use of public resources

As a result of corruption, investments are not allocated to sectors and programmes which
present the best value for money or where needs are highest, but to those which offer the
best prospects for personal enrichment of corrupt politicians. Thus resources go into big
infrastructure projects or military procurement where kickbacks are high, to the detriment
of sectors like education and health care. Moreover, public tenders are assigned to the
highest bribe payer, neglecting better qualified companies not willing to bribe, which
undermines the quality of the projects carried out. In some instances public funds are
simply diverted from their intended use, embezzled and exploited for private enrichment.
Corruption also slows down bureaucratic processes, as inefficient bureaucracies offer
more leverage for corrupt public officials: the longer the queue for a service, the higher
the incentive for citizens to bribe to get what they want. Finally, nepotism - in both private
and public organisations - brings incompetent people into power, weakening
performance and governance.

Several studies provide evidence of the negative correlation between corruption and the
quality of government investments, services and regulations. For example, child mortality
rates in countries with high levels of corruption are about one third higher than in
countries with low corruption, infant mortality rates are almost twice as high and student
dropout rates are five times as high (Gupta et al. 2011). Numbers on the monetary loss
due to corruption vary, but are alarming. The African Union (2002) estimates that 25% of
the GDP of African states, amounting to US$148 billion, is lost to corruption every year.
The US health care programmes Medicare and Medicaid estimate that 5% to 10% of their
annual budget is wasted as a result of corruption.

3. Corruption excludes poor people from public services and perpetuates poverty

                                                                                                          13
GLOBAL CORRUPTION

 The poor generally lack privileged access to decision makers, which is necessary in
 corrupt societies to obtain certain goods and services. Resources and benefits are thus
 exchanged among the rich and well connected, excluding the less privileged. Moreover,
 the poor bear the largest burden [proportionate to their income] of higher tariffs in public
 services imposed by the costs of corruption.... They might also be completely excluded
 from basic services like health care or education, if they cannot afford to pay bribes which
 are requested illegally. The embezzlement or diversion of public funds further reduces
 the government's resources available for development and poverty reduction spending.

 The significant impact of corruption on income inequality and the negative effect of
 corruption on income growth for the poorest 20% of a country have been proven
 empirically (Gupta et al. 2002). The World Bank (Baker 2005) estimates that each year US$
 20 to US$ 40 billion, corresponding to 20% to 40% of official development assistance, is
 stolen through high-level corruption from public budgets in developing countries and
 hidden overseas. Transparency International (Global Corruption Report 2006) found that
 about 35% of births in rural areas in Azerbaijan take place at home, because poor people
 cannot afford to pay the high charges for care in facilities where care was supposed to be
 free. [The relationship between corruption and poverty is further analyzed in this chapter
 at Section 1.5.]

 4. Corruption corrodes public trust, undermines the rule of law and ultimately
 delegitimizes the state

 Rules and regulations are circumvented by bribes, public budget control is undermined
 by illicit money flows and political critics and the media are silenced through bribes
 levering out democratic systems of checks and balances. Corruption in political processes
 like elections or party financing undermines the rule of the people and thus the very
 foundation of democracy. If basic public services are not delivered to citizens due to
 corruption, the state eventually loses its credibility and legitimacy.

 As a result, disappointed citizens might turn away from the state, retreat from political
 processes, migrate - or - stand up against what they perceive to be the corrupt political
 and economic elites. The global uprisings from the Arab world to India, Brazil and occupy
 Wall Street are proving that business as usual can no longer be an option for a number of
 countries. [footnotes omitted]

1.4 Additional Concerns

In addition to the four concerns described in the excerpt, several other concerns are worthy
of specific note, namely corruption's impact on (i) gender equality, (ii) climate change and
environmental degradation, (iii) global security and (iv) human rights.

      1.4.1 Gender Equality

Corruption affects women differently than men and carries adverse implications for gender
equality. According to the UNDP report Corruption, Accountability and Gender: Understanding
the Connections, corruption "exacerbates gender-based asymmetries in empowerment, access
to resources and enjoyment of rights."37 Reasons for corruption's disproportionate effects
include the fact that women make up most of the global poor, who suffer most from
corruption, and the fact that women have lower levels of literacy and education in most
parts of the world, which can adversely affect their knowledge of their rights. The report
summarizes the effects of corruption on women as follows:

          The data suggests that `petty' or `retail' corruption (when basic public
          services are sold instead of provided by right) affects poor women in
          particular and that the currency of corruption is frequently sexualized -
          women and girls are often asked to pay bribes in the form of sexual favours.
          Women's disempowerment and their dependence on public service
          delivery mechanisms for access to essential services (e.g., health, water and
          education) increases their vulnerability to the consequences of corruption-
          related service delivery deficits. In addition, women's limited access to
          public officials and low income levels diminishes their ability to pay bribes,
          further restricting their access to basic services. Therefore, corruption
          disproportionately affects poor women because their low levels of economic
          and political empowerment constrain their ability to change the status quo
          or to hold states accountable to deliver services that are their right.38

The report provides more specific examples of the ways women and girls experience
corruption in various countries and settings. For example, in many countries, women and
girls bear water-gathering responsibilities--corruption prevents the construction of more
convenient water infrastructure. In the arena of education, women and girls might face
sexual extortion in order to be graded fairly or pay for school, as illustrated in Botswana.39
The report also describes the disproportionate impact of corruption on women
entrepreneurs, who often lack the resources to make bribe payments for licences and permits
to start a business. Other corruption-related issues for women include increased
vulnerability to sexual violence in the context of police and judicial corruption and blocked
access to maternity hospitals when staff members demand bribes. Sextortion, in particular,
is a specific form of corruption involving an abuse of authority and an exchange of sexual
activities under the influence of coercion.40 Sextortion is markedly common. TI's Global

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

Corruption Barometer 2019, in both the Latin America region and the Middle East and North
Africa region, found that "one in five people experienced or knows someone who
experienced sexual extortion when accessing government services."41

Lower literacy rates among women facilitate a weaker understanding of their legal rights
and put them at a greater risk of situations involving corruption and sextortion.42 Women
also face further adversity when they attempt to report corruption; for example, respondents
in the Dominican Republic, Honduras, and Guatemala believe that corruption complaints
are taken more seriously when filed by men.43 In India, the state of Jammu and Kashmir
became one of the first administrations to introduce sextortion as a unique offence in its
criminal code.44 Although legislative recognition of the gendered effects of corruption
promises progress for affected individuals, the typical barriers related to reporting
corruption and seeking redress remain in place. In fact, as of 2020, there has not been a single
sextortion case prosecuted in Jammu and Kashmir.45

      1.4.2 Climate Change and Environmental Degradation

Corruption in the area of climate change holds the potential to cause wide-ranging effects.
Corrupt avoidance of climate change standards can sap projects of their effectiveness in
mitigating climate change, leading to adverse consequences for future generations. The
resultant failure or reduced success of mechanisms designed to mitigate the impacts of
climate change will also disproportionately affect vulnerable, poor populations, who are
expected to bear the brunt of the effects of climate change.

Enforcement of heightened climate change standards will require good governance at both
international and national levels. As stated by TI in Global Corruption Report: Climate Change:

          [a] robust system of climate governance - meaning the processes and
          relationships at the international, national, corporate and local levels to
          address the causes and effects of climate change - will be essential for
          ensuring that the enormous political, social and financial investments by
          both the public sector and the private sector made in climate change
          mitigation and adaptation are properly and equitably managed, so that
          responses to climate change are successful.46

TI explains why climate change initiatives are uniquely vulnerable to corruption. Responses
to climate change will involve massive amounts of money (investment in mitigation efforts
should reach an estimated $90 trillion by 203047), which will "flow through new and untested
financial markets and mechanisms,"48 creating fertile ground for corruption. Many climate
issues are complex, new and uncertain, yet require speedy solutions, which also increases
the risk of corruption, for example by leaving "regulatory grey zones and loopholes."49

Patrick Alley points out that rife corruption in the forestry sector has already subverted
efforts to use reforestation and forest management to slow climate change.50 According to
the World Bank, timber worth an estimated $30-157 billion is illegally logged or produced
from suspicious sources every year.51 This illegal harvesting of timber is facilitated by
"deeply engrained corruption schemes"52 in the industry. The forestry sector is particularly
prone to corruption because most tropical forests are on public land and therefore
susceptible to control by a small group of politicians or public servants. Timber operations
are also generally located in remote areas, far from scrutiny. A news release published by
the International Criminal Police Organization notes that illegal timber is responsible for up
to 90 percent of tropical deforestation in certain countries.53 Despite recent legislative efforts
at banning the importation of illegally sourced timber in the US,54 the EU,55 and China,56
illegal timber remains easy to launder on the international market.

Bangladesh is one of the most vulnerable states for climate change-related effects. In his
article "Governance Matters: Climate Change, Corruption and Livelihoods in Bangladesh,"
Md. Ashiqur Rahman notes the deep roots corruption has in nearly all branches of

government and society. Using the Sundarbans forest as a case study, Rahman describes
how bribery is simply a reality of "doing business" for individuals like woodcutters and
honey collectors, who rely on the forest for their livelihood.57 Further, Rahman notes how
the presence of bribery facilitates excessive resource extraction, as the bribe-payers will
collect more than their permits allow.58 Bribery also impacts the local population's capacity
to respond to climate change-related disasters: rather than saving to increase their adaptive
capacity in the face of global warming, 56% of individuals surveyed find themselves
spending part of their income on bribes.59 The cycle of bribery and extortion fuels further
resource extraction and simultaneously impairs the population's adaptive capacity, thus
putting the already vulnerable population at an even greater risk. Corruption also hinders
the state's adaptive capacity: a recent working paper published by TI Bangladesh notes that
an estimated 35% of funds meant for climate change mitigation projects are embezzled.60

Corruption threatens climate change action in many other ways. For example, undue
influence and policy capture are current and future risks to effective climate change policy,
as demonstrated by powerful energy sector lobby groups in the US.61 According to TI,
carbon markets are also vulnerable to undue influence, which might have contributed to
over-allocation of carbon permits and huge windfall profits for European power producers
in 2005-2007. Carbon markets suffer from a lack of measuring, reporting, and verification of
emissions. Other problems include the current lack of transparency and accountability in
climate policy both internationally and nationally. For example, Shahanaz Mueller points
out that, in Austria, the lack of transparency in implementation of aspirational policies has
led to disappointing performance and slow progress.62 Corruption in the construction sector
also poses a huge risk to future adaptation projects; "[a]daptation without oversight presents
a two-fold risk of diverted funds and substandard work ... which may put populations at
even more risk of climate extremes."63 There has also been a detailed economic analysis done
by Athanasios Lapatinas et al., which conclude that administrations undertake
technologically advanced climate projects in states with widespread corruption to maximize
rent-seeking, rather than the mitigation of environmental risks.64 Lapatinas et al. further note
that these types of projects reduce public funds as citizens aware of deficient environmental
policies are more likely to evade taxes.65

TI points out that the corruption spawned by climate change is not limited to familiar forms
of corruption, such as misappropriation of funds and bribery, but rather "transcends the
established typologies of corruption."66 TI argues that its definition of corruption, the abuse
of entrusted power for private gain, must be expanded in the context of climate change to
include "the power that future generations have vested in all of us, in our stewardship role
for the planet," and abuses of power such as "distortion of scientific facts, the breach of
principles of fair representation and false claims about the green credentials of consumer
products."67

      1.4.3 Global Security

When former Secretary of State John Kerry was speaking in Nigeria, he commented on the
relationship between state security and corruption, declaring that "[b]ribery, fraud, and
other forms of venality endanger everything that you value. They feed organized crime.
They gnaw away at nation-states. They take away the legitimacy of a nation-state. They
contribute to human trafficking. They discourage honest and accountable investment and
they undermine entire communities."68 In Thieves of State, Sarah Chayes argues that
corruption fuels threats to international security. Chayes ties endemic corruption by elites
to national and international revolution and violence in the Arab world, Nigeria, Ukraine,
and various historical settings.69 The author draws attention to Al-Qaeda's assertions that
the main rationale behind the 9/11 attacks was President George W. Bush's cozy relationship
with kleptocratic Arab heads of state. To demonstrate a pattern of association between
corruption and destructive, terroristic acts, Chayes compares the example of contemporary
jihadists to Dutch Protestants who ransacked property of the corrupt Catholic Church
during the Reformation. Similar to these early Protestants, the jihadists "articulate their
struggle, at least in part, as a reaction to the kleptocratic practices of local rulers."70 Chayes
also cites other threats to global security fueled by corruption, such as uprisings leading to
government collapse. Building off of Chayes' analysis, this has also been illustrated in
Afghanistan, South Africa and Brazil, as well as Syria and Lebanon and other countries
involved in the Arab Spring.71 Additionally, Chayes discusses the ease of trafficking in

conflict minerals and other illegal goods in corrupt countries like Zimbabwe, and unreliable
military regimes.72

Although Chayes' first-hand experience leads to the conclusion that terrorism is, in part, a
reaction to corrupt regimes in certain countries, other empirical research undermines the
idea that corruption is a motivating factor for terrorism in general. Research by Jessica C.
Teets and Erica Chenoweth suggest that "[c]orruption does not motivate terrorism because
of grievances against corrupt states, but rather it facilitates terrorism ... corruption lowers
the barriers to terrorist attacks, probably because obtaining illicit materials to conduct
attacks is more difficult in less corrupt or transparent countries."73 In an article titled
"Terrorism and Corruption: Alternatives for Goal Attainment Within Political Opportunity
Structures," Matthew Simpson "cast[s] doubt on the notion that terrorist violence is the
expression of grievances developed in response to perceived corruption within the political
process."74 Rather, Simpson's research indicates that organizations turn to terrorism when
other extralegal avenues, like corruption, are blocked; "[i]n instances where the particular
path of corruption could not be employed to gain political influence, these organizations
used alternative strategies - terrorism being high on the list - to fill the gap."75 However,
Simpson recognizes that more research is required to determine when the relationship
between corruption control and terrorism might vary due to other factors like inequality and
development.

In Corruption: Global Security and World Order, Robert I. Rotberg and Kelly M. Greenhill
further explore the connection between corruption, trafficking and global security:

          The durable ties between corrupt regimes and transnational crime and
          transnational trafficking pose major global security problems because of the
          ability of criminal organizations to subvert stability and growth in poor
          countries, by their skill at sapping such impoverished places of revenue and
          legitimate modernization, by their undermining the fabric of weak and
          fragile societies, and by their negative reinforcement of the least favorable
          kinds of leadership in developing countries ... these unholy partnerships ...
          by facilitating the spread of small arms and light weapons make civil wars
          possible and lethal.76

Adding to the issue of global security, Matthew Bunn describes the link between corruption
and nuclear proliferation, pointing out that "[c]orruption has been a critical enabling
element of the nuclear weapons programs in Pakistan, Iraq, Libya, and Iran."77 Bunn

obtain materials, and if these means are insufficient, "illicit contributions from foreign
sources motivated by cash will be central to a nuclear program's success."78

For an exploration of the need for anti-corruption measures and good governance to
promote sustainable peace in post-conflict nations, see Bertram I. Spector, Negotiating Peace
and Confronting Corruption: Challenges for Post-Conflict Societies.79 Spector argues that
negotiated cease-fires and other short-term measures are not enough to establish long-
lasting peace; rather, good governance is needed to end the corruption that fuels conflict in
the first place.

      1.4.4 Treating Corruption as a Human Rights Violation

Human rights are an increasingly broad and all-encompassing concept. Laws that concern
human rights are found both nationally and internationally. With regard to global
corruption in particular, the focus is on human rights at a global level. No one definition of
human rights exists; however, the overarching goal of human rights law is to recognize and
affirm the dignity of human life.

Human rights has taken on great international significance since the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights was proclaimed in 1948.80 In the ensuing period, a wide range of documents
has emerged to provide greater protections for the global population as a whole, as well as
specific marginalized groups.81 However, international human rights law has faced
criticism. The leading critique focuses on the fact that Western capitalist economies were the
driving force behind the creation of legal instruments making up the body of human rights
law. Accordingly, these laws represent the views and values of the industrialized countries,
which are then imposed on the developing world. For a similar discussion of Western
ideological imposition in international law, see Section 2.2.

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

Human rights are often categorized into civil and political rights and economic, social, and
cultural rights. These human rights include, amongst others, gender equality, the right to
life and liberty and the right to a healthy environment. Without describing all the ways
corruption can impact human rights, corruption violates the right to life, liberty, and security
of the person. Corruption perpetuates the cycle of poverty and poverty prevents people from
exercising their human rights.

In Corruption: Economic Analysis and International Law, Marco Arnone and Leonardo S. Borlini
elaborate on the impact of corruption on the rule of law and human rights:

          Massive corrupt dynamics, indeed, weaken the basic foundations both of
          the representative mechanisms underlying the separation of powers and of
          human rights.... Since corruption generates discrimination and inequality,
          this relationship [between human rights and government corruption] ...
          bears on civil and political rights. For instance, it strengthens the
          misappropriation of property in violation of legal rights ... it likely leads to
          the rise of monopolies which either wipe out or gravely vitiate freedom to
          trade. Corruption strikes at economic and social rights as well: the
          commissioning by a public entity of useless or overpriced goods or services,
          and the choice of poorly performing undertakings through perverted public
          procurement mechanisms are mere examples of how corruption can
          endanger the second generation of human rights.

          The relationship between fundamental HR and corruption could not be
          expressed more vividly than in the words of the UN High Commissioner
          for Human Rights, Navy Pillay: "Let us be clear. Corruption kills. The
          money stolen is enough to feed the world's hungry every night, many of
          them children; corruption denies them their right to food, and in some cases,
          their right to life".... The departure point and organizational principle of the
          2004 [UN Development Program's] analyst study is that "Corruption affects
          the poor disproportionately, due to their powerlessness to change the status
          quo and inability to pay bribes, creating inequalities that violate their
          human rights."82

In their article "The International Legal Framework Against Corruption: Achievements and
Challenges," Jan Wouters et al. note the increasing tendency to frame corruption as a human
rights issue.83 To help understand the link between corruption and human rights, the
International Council on Human Rights Policy divides corruption-based human rights
violations into direct, indirect, and remote violations. For example, bribing a judge directly
violates the right to a fair trial, while embezzling public funds needed for social programs
indirectly violates economic and social rights. Many commentators hope this focus on

human rights will create new human rights-based remedies and assist in anti-corruption
efforts.

The coupling of corruption and human rights remains an increasingly popular trend. In
April 2015, at the 13th United Nations Congress on Crime Prevention and International
Justice in Doha, Dean and Executive Secretary of the International Anti-Corruption
Academy Martin Kreutner, stated, "All the universal goals run the risk of being severely
undermined by corruption.... Corruption is the antithesis vis-à-vis human rights, the venom
vis-à-vis the rule of law, the poison for prosperity and development and the reverse of equity
and equality."84 While recognizing the important connection between corruption and
human rights, recently some authors have further analyzed the potential dangers and
limitations of confining discussions of corruption to the language of human rights.85

Recent publications have also taken a closer look at the connection between corruption and
human rights in particular geographic areas.86 Anne Peters in her paper "Corruption and
Human Rights" and subsequent article "Corruption as a Violation of International Human
Rights" examines the various ways corruption can be conceptualized as a human rights
violation and the advantages and disadvantages of doing so. Peters also examines whether
it is a good idea to conceptualize corruption as a human rights violation and concludes, with
some limitations, that it is.87 In regard to this latter point, Peters states that this approach will
lend a political and moral slant to the anti-corruption agenda.88 As individuals begin to
understand how corruption impacts their rights, they become empowered to take action
against corrupt actors. In turn, this strengthens the anti-corruption agenda.89 The UN
Human Rights Council asserts two additional advantages for this framing: first, the central
focus is on the state rather than individual perpetrators, and second, it strengthens the
position of victims.90

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

Peters discusses a leading criticism of the movement to consider corruption as a form of
human rights violations--that this conceptualization promotes neoliberal biases that
undermine values and customs held in the Global South. Critics assert that this framework
perpetuates contemporary imperialism and has a biased focus on the Global South, where
petty corruption is more prevalent.91 Nevertheless, Peters posits that the framework
advances a "modern rule-of-law-based state"92 that responds to citizens' needs.
Additionally, Peters notes that elites vulnerable to claims of corruption and human rights
violations take up these arguments as a defensive mechanism.93

Peters concludes by asserting that there is a need for "human rights mainstreaming of anti-
corruption efforts."94 The author argues that integrating a human rights-based approach to
anti-corruption measures and vice versa furthers both efforts--promoting universal
empowerment, as well as greater monitoring and remedies. The recently proposed
International Anti-Corruption Court, discussed in Section 1.1 of this chapter, could serve as
a next step in integrating and mainstreaming human rights on a global scale.95

1.5 Relationship Between Corruption, Reduced Economic Growth, and

       Poverty: An Economic and Governance Perspective

In Corruption and Poverty: A Review of Recent Literature, Chetwynd et al. summarize the
different theories and research connecting corruption with poverty.96 While the authors'
summary is now dated (2003), I believe it still accurately reflects the basic relationship
between corruption and poverty. Their research reveals an indirect relationship between
poverty and corruption explained by two main theories. Persons who attach themselves to
the "economic model" argue that corruption negatively impacts indicia of economic growth,
which exacerbates poverty. Chetwynd et al. refer to the second theory as the "governance
model." Proponents of this theory argue that there is evidence that corruption negatively
affects governance and poor governance negatively affects levels of poverty.

The following excerpt from Chetwynd et al.'s report, Corruption and Poverty, explains the
relationship between corruption and poverty:97

 countries. Corruption in the public sector is often viewed as exacerbating conditions of

 poverty in countries already struggling with the strains of economic growth and
 democratic transition. Alternatively, countries experiencing chronic poverty are seen as
 natural breeding grounds for systemic corruption due to social and income inequalities
 and perverse economic incentives. This report summarizes recent research on the
 relationship between poverty and corruption to clarify the ways in which these
 phenomena interact. This understanding can inform USAID planning and programming
 in democracy and governance, as well as in poverty reduction strategies.

 The development literature is rich with theoretical insights on this relationship, many of
 them founded on practical experience and careful observation. The World Bank's World
 Development Report for 2000/01: Attacking Poverty summarized current thinking on the
 corruption-poverty linkage as follows:

            The burden of petty corruption falls disproportionately on poor people
            ... For those without money and connections, petty corruption in public
            health or police services can have debilitating consequences. Corruption
            affects the lives of poor people through many other channels as well. It
            biases government spending away from socially valuable goods, such as
            education. It diverts public resources from infrastructure investments
            that could benefit poor people, such as health clinics, and tends to
            increase public spending on capital-intensive investments that offer more
            opportunities for kickbacks, such as defense contracts. It lowers the
            quality of infrastructure, since kickbacks are more lucrative on
            equipment purchases. Corruption also undermines public service
            delivery (World Bank, 2001: 201).

 Many of these relationships have been examined using empirical research methods.98
 Much of this literature is recent -- from the mid-1990s -- when major international donor
 institutions began to focus attention on corruption issues and researchers initiated cross-
 country measurement of the corruption phenomenon. This report integrates this literature
 to present the major themes that are hypothesized and tested.

 ...

 2 Examining the Relationship Between Corruption and Poverty

 This review found that few studies examine or establish a direct relationship between
 corruption and poverty.99 Corruption, by itself, does not produce poverty. Rather,
 corruption has direct consequences on economic and governance factors, intermediaries

98 [1] Many studies address the issue indirectly; few address it directly. See Annex 1, Bibliographic
Table.
99 [4] One group of researchers, Gupta et al (1998), found a statistically significant positive association
directly between corruption and poverty. Tests for directionality showed that it appears to be
corruption that increases poverty.

                                                                                                            25
GLOBAL CORRUPTION

that in turn produce poverty. Thus, the relationship examined by researchers is an indirect
one.

Two models emerge from the research literature. The "economic model" postulates that
corruption affects poverty by first impacting economic growth factors, which, in turn,
impact poverty levels. In other words, increased corruption reduces economic
investment, distorts markets, hinders competition, creates inefficiencies by increasing the
costs of doing business, and increases income inequalities. By undermining these key
economic factors, poverty is exacerbated.

                    increased income
                        inequality

The "governance model" asserts that corruption affects poverty by first influencing
governance factors, which, in turn, impact poverty levels. So, for example, corruption
erodes the institutional capacity of government to deliver quality public services, diverts
public investment away from major public needs into capital projects (where bribes can
be sought), lowers compliance with safety and health regulations, and increases
budgetary pressures on government. Through these serious challenges to governance
practices and outcomes, poverty is affected.

          Corruption Impedes Economic Growth

The relationship between corruption and economic growth is complex. Economic theory
supports the notion that corruption hinders economic growth in the following ways:

     · Corruption discourages foreign and domestic investment: rent taking increases costs
          and creates uncertainty, reducing incentives to both foreign and domestic
          investors.

     · Corruption taxes entrepreneurship: entrepreneurs and innovators require licenses
          and permits and paying bribes for these goods cuts into profit margins.

     · Corruption lowers the quality of public infrastructure: public resources are diverted
          to private uses, standards are waived; funds for operations and maintenance are
          diverted in favor of more rent seeking activity.

26                                                                                            2022
                                                            CHAPTER 1 CORRUPTION IN CONTEXT

       · Corruption decreases tax revenue: firms and activities are driven into the informal
            or gray sector by excessive rent taking and taxes are reduced in exchange for
            payoffs to tax officials.

       · Corruption diverts talent into rent seeking: officials who otherwise would be
            engaged in productive activity become pre-occupied with rent taking, in which
            increasing returns encourage more rent taking.

        Corruption distorts the composition of public expenditure: rent seekers will pursue
            those projects for which rent seeking is easiest and best disguised, diverting
            funding from other sectors such as education and health.100

 These theoretical propositions are supported by a number of empirical studies. They
 demonstrate that high levels of corruption are associated with low levels of investment
 and low levels of aggregate economic growth. For example, the results of several World
 Bank corruption surveys illustrate this inverse relationship between corruption and
 economic growth.

        Corruption discourages domestic investment. In Bulgaria, about one in four
            businesses in the entrepreneur sample had planned to expand (mostly through
            acquiring new equipment) but failed to do so, and corruption was an important
            factor in their change of plans. The Latvia study surveyed enterprises that had
            dropped planned investments. It found that the high cost of complying with
            regulations and the uncertainty surrounding them, including uncertainty
            regarding unofficial payments, were important factors for 28% of businesses
            foregoing new investments.

        Corruption hurts entrepreneurship especially among small businesses. Several studies
            reported that small businesses tend to pay the most bribes as a percentage of
            total revenue (especially in Bosnia, Ghana, and Slovakia). In Poland, businesses
            have to deal with a large number of economic activities that are licensed,
            making them more prone to extortion.

        Corruption decreases revenue from taxes and fees. In Bangladesh, more than 30% of
            urban household respondents reduced electric and/or water bills by bribing the
            meter reader. In several studies, respondents were so frustrated that they
            indicated a willingness to pay more taxes if corruption could be controlled
            (Cambodia, Indonesia, Romania).101

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

 [Note: The empirical data cited by Chetwynd et al. is from the 1990s and early 2000s.
 Subsequent empirical research has cast doubt on the claim that high levels of corruption
 adversely affect economic growth in terms of GDP. In fact, corruption might increase
 economic growth in the short run under certain circumstances (for example, by allowing
 corporations to avoid meeting expensive environmental requirements). However, Toke
 S. Aidt argues that corruption still impedes sustainable economic growth in the long run
 in his article "Corruption and Sustainable Development," discussed at page 33-35 of this
 chapter.]

            Corruption Exacerbates Income Inequality

 Several studies have demonstrated a relationship between corruption and income
 inequality. The theoretical foundations for this relationship are derived from rent theory
 and draw on the ideas of Rose-Ackerman (1978) and Krueger (1974), among others.
 Propositions include:

        Corruption may create permanent distortions from which some groups or
            individuals can benefit more than others.

        The distributional consequences of corruption are likely to be more severe the
            more persistent the corruption.

        The impact of corruption on income distribution is in part a function of
            government involvement in allocating and financing scarce goods and services
            (Gupta, Davoodi, and Alonso-Terme, 1998).

 ...

 How does corruption exacerbate income inequality? Evidence from diagnostic surveys of
 corruption in several countries suggests that corruption aggravates income inequality
 because lower income households pay a higher proportion of their income in bribes.

 In conclusion, the literature establishes clearly that corruption impedes economic growth
 and augments income inequalities. How does reduced economic growth, in turn, increase
 poverty?

            Reduced Economic Growth Rates Increase Poverty

 There is evidence that the absence of economic growth (or negative growth) increases
 poverty. Quibria's study (2002) suggests that the burden of rapid economic retrenchment,
 such as seen recently in Thailand and Indonesia, hurts the poor most heavily. Similarly,
 in the transition countries of the former Soviet Union (FSU), the changeover to a market
 system was associated with a sharp initial drop in output and significantly higher levels
 of poverty. The expansion of poverty was initiated by the collapse of GDP, which fell by
 50 percent in the FSU countries and 15 percent in Central and Eastern Europe. Poverty
 was found to be highly correlated with administrative corruption and corruption was
 empirically associated with lower economic growth rates (World Bank, 2000a).

                                                            CHAPTER 1 CORRUPTION IN CONTEXT

 Using a poverty model, the Gupta et al. (1998) study conducted a cross-national analysis
 of up to 56 countries to examine the relationship between growth and poverty.... The
 authors found that higher growth is associated with poverty alleviation.

 ...

 In his comprehensive study of the so-called Asian Tigers, Quibria (2002) gives a good
 example of rapid economic growth (during the 1980s and 1990s) leading to a substantial
 decrease in those living below a poverty line of $1.25 per day.102 Further, in those countries
 with a more equitable distribution of income at the outset, the decrease in poverty tended
 to be more robust. However, even in this special case of multiple country rapid growth in
 a particular region, income distribution remained more or less constant over the period
 of growth. Similarly, Ravallion and Chen (in Easterly, 2001: 13-14) examined 65
 developing countries between 1981 and 1999. They found that the number of people
 below the poverty line of $1 per day was reduced in countries with positive economic
 growth. However, they concluded that "measures of inequality show no tendency to get
 either better or worse with economic growth."103

 In conclusion, these studies show conclusively that income rises with economic growth
 and vice versa. It should be noted that economic growth does not necessarily lead to more
 equal income distribution; an increase in income may benefit the better-off rather than
 bringing the poor out of poverty. Income distribution seems to be an important
 moderating factor in the relationship between economic growth and poverty reduction.

       2.1 Governance Model

 The governance model postulates that increased corruption reduces governance capacity,
 which, in turn, increases poverty conditions. Kaufmann et al. (1999) define governance as,

            "the traditions and institutions by which authority in a country is
            exercised. This includes (1) the process by which governments are
            selected, monitored and replaced, (2) the capacity of the government to
            effectively formulate and implement sound policies, and (3) the respect
            of citizens and the state for the institutions that govern economic and
            social interactions among them."

 Corruption disrupts governance practices, destabilizes governance institutions, reduces
 the provision of services by government, reduces respect for the rule of law, and reduces
 public trust in government and its institutions. Impaired governance, in turn, reduces

102 [13] Quibria (2002). Quibria suggests that a factor in this growth was the containment of
corruption to the centralized type which he considers less costly to growth than more generalized or
chaotic corruption.
103 [14] Easterly (2001) at 13-14. In severe economic retraction, the poor suffer appreciably greater loss
in income than the population's average. Easterly quotes from Martin Ravillion and Shaohua Chen,
Distribution and Poverty in Developing and Transition Economies (World Bank Economic Review
No.11 May 1997).

                                                                                                            29
GLOBAL CORRUPTION

 social capital and public trust in governance institutions; this reduces the public funds
 available to support effective economic growth programs and reduces the capability of
 government to help its citizens and the poor, in particular.

            Corruption Degrades Governance

 Johnston (2000) suggests that serious corruption threatens democracy and governance by
 weakening political institutions and mass participation, and by delaying and distorting
 the economic development needed to sustain democracy. In a study of 83 countries,
 Johnston compares Transparency International's CPI with an index of political
 competitiveness and finds that well-institutionalized and decisive political competition is
 correlated with lower levels of corruption. These results were confirmed, even when
 controlling for GDP and examining the relationship over time.

 Diagnostic surveys of corruption in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Ghana, Honduras, Indonesia
 and Latvia report that government institutions with the highest levels of corruption tend
 to provide lower quality services. The converse is also true: in Romania, the survey shows
 that state sector entities with better systems of public administration tend to have lower
 levels of corruption.

 The literature shows that corruption impacts the quality of government services and
 infrastructure and that through these channels it has an impact on the poor. This is
 particularly the case in the health and education sectors. Enhanced education and
 healthcare services and population longevity are usually associated with higher economic
 growth. But under conditions of extensive corruption, when public services, such as
 health and basic education expenditures that especially benefit the poor, are given lower
 priority in favor of capital intensive programs that offer more opportunities for high-level
 rent taking, lower income groups lose services on which they depend. As government
 revenues decline through leakage brought on by corruption, public funds for poverty
 programs and programs to stimulate growth also become more scarce.

 ...

            Impaired Governance Increases Poverty

 Pioneering research on the relationship among corruption, governance and poverty has
 been conducted at the World Bank by the team of Kaufmann, Kraay and Zoido-Lobaton.
 Their studies suggest an association between good governance (with control of corruption
 as an important component) and poverty alleviation.

 Kaufmann et al. (1999) studied the effect of governance on per capita income in 173
 countries, treating "control of corruption" as one of the components of good
 governance.... Analysis showed a strong positive causal relationship running from
 improved governance to better development outcomes as measured by per capita

30                                                                                             2022

 income.104 A one standard deviation improvement in governance raised per capita
 incomes 2.5 to 4 times. Analysis of updated indicators for 2000-2001 did not change these
 conclusions.105

 Kaufmann and Kraay (2002) used updated governance indicators to gain a more nuanced
 understanding of the role of good governance in the relationship between corruption and
 growth in per capita incomes.106 Using governance data for 2000/01, the authors establish
 empirically that for Latin American and Caribbean countries (i) better governance tends
 to yield higher per capita incomes, but (ii) higher per capita incomes tend to produce
 reduced governance capacity. The authors attribute this second finding to state capture.
 In short, the authors suggest that corruption (in the form of state capture) may interfere
 with the expected relationship between economic growth (higher per capita incomes) and
 better governance. The authors note that an empirical in-depth examination of the
 phenomenon of state capture in the Latin American and The Caribbean (LAC) region is
 part of the upcoming research agenda.107

 The effect of governance on corruption and poverty is illuminated by another World Bank
 study (2000a). The deterioration in governance discussed in this study was accompanied
 by an increase in both corruption and poverty. Thus, as seen earlier, increases in

104 [16] Kaufmann, Kraay and Zoido-Lobaton (1999) at 15. Although the relationship held for most of
the aggregate indicators, the test of the relationship between the aggregate indicator for corruption
and increase in per capita income did not hold up. Specification tests reported the p -value associated
with the null hypothesis that the instruments affect income only through their effects on governance.
For five out of the six aggregate indicators, the null hypothesis was not rejected, which was evidence
in favor of the identifying assumptions. Corruption was the aggregate indicator for which the null
hypothesis was rejected. This suggested that the aggregate indicator was not an adequate
independent measure of corruption. "This is not to say that graft is unimportant for economic
outcomes. Rather, in this set of countries, we have found it difficult to find exogenous variations in
the causes of graft which make it possible to identify the effects of graft on per capita incomes." P.16
n. 15.
105 [17] Kaufmann, Kraay and Zoido-Lobaton (2002). In an April, 2002, presentation at the US
Department of State, Dr. Kaufmann summarized this work on governance and the demonstrated link
to better development outcomes such as higher per capita income, lower infant mortality and higher
literacy. He expects that donors will pay much more attention to governance, and that the link
between good governance and poverty alleviation is now a mainstream concept. Kaufmann (2002),

<http://info.worldbank.org/beeps.kkz/>.
106 [18] Kaufmann and Kraay (2002). In a forthcoming study that draws on a survey of public officials
in Bolivia, Kaufmann, Mehrez and Gurgur conclude (using a theoretical model for econometric
analysis) that external voice and transparency have a larger effect on corruption (and quality of
service) than conventional public sector management variables (such as civil servant wages, internal
enforcement of rules, etc.).

(BEEPS), developed jointly by the World Bank and the EBRD, which generated comparative
measurements on corruption and state capture in the transition economies of the CIS and CEE. See

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

 corruption tend to deteriorate governance practices, but the reverse holds true as well -
 reduction in governance capacity increases the opportunities for corruption.

            Reduced Public Trust in Government Increases Vulnerability of the Poor

 Corruption that reduces governance capacity also may inflict critical collateral damage:
 reduced public trust in government institutions. As trust--an important element of
 social capital--declines, research has shown that vulnerability of the poor increases as
 their economic productivity is affected. The concept of social capital refers to social
 structures that enable people to work collectively for the good of the group.108 One of the
 most important and widely discussed elements of social capital is trust, both
 interpersonal trust and trust in institutions of government.109

 ...

 One of the effects of widespread corruption in government services is that it appears to
 contribute to disaffection and distrust, and this appears to impact particularly heavily on
 the poor.110 This is not surprising, because low income people are the ones who are most
 likely to be dependent on government services for assistance with basic needs, such as
 education and healthcare, and least likely to be able to pay bribes to cut through complex
 and unresponsive bureaucracies. Lack of trust has economic consequences: when people
 perceive that the social system is untrustworthy and inequitable, this can affect incentives
 to engage in productive activities.111

 3 Conclusion

 Overall, the literature reviewed in this paper demonstrates that corruption does
 exacerbate and promote poverty, but this pattern is complex and moderated by economic
 and governance factors. Table 1 summarizes the major findings of this report.

      · Inequality slows growth
      · Corruption decreases progressivity of the tax system
      · Corruption acts as a regressive tax
      · Low income households pay more in bribes as percent of income
      · Better governance, including lower graft level, effects economic growth dramatically
      · Better governance is associated with lower corruption and lower poverty levels.
      · High state capture makes it difficult to reduce inequality
      · Extensive, organized, well institutionalized and decisive political competition is
            associated with lower corruption
      · Trust is a component of social capital. Higher social capital is associated with lower
            poverty. Corruption undermines trust (in government and other institutions) and
            thereby undermines social capital.

The 2015 OECD report, Consequences of Corruption at the Sector Level and Implications for
Economic Growth and Development, explores the correlation between corruption and economic
growth by focusing on four sectors that are key in promoting economic growth and
development but also vulnerable to corruption: extractive industries, utilities and
infrastructure, health, and education.112 The report investigates how corruption "distorts
sector performance"113 and the consequences for economic growth and development. For
example, in extractive industries, the report finds that corruption can siphon funds away
from populations and render dependence on natural resources counterproductive for the
economy. The analysis concludes that corruption in these four sectors directly affects the
cost of public and private sector projects, while indirectly damaging public institutions,
eroding public trust in government and increasing inequality.

In "Corruption and Sustainable Development," Toke S. Aidt takes a new approach to
analyzing the relationship between growth and corruption.114 Aidt points out that "[m]ost

real GDP per capita,"115 which has led to ambiguous and contradictory results regarding
causal directions. The author argues that research focused on GDP is "barking up the wrong
tree."116 Since "development is concerned with sustainable improvements in human
welfare,"117 Aidt's research focuses instead on the relationship between corruption and
sustainable development, and indicates that "corruption is a major obstacle to sustainable
development."118 Aidt defines sustainable development as "present economic paths that do
not compromise the well-being of future generations."119 The following excerpt summarizes
Aidt's findings on the relationship between corruption and sustainable development:

          Corruption has the potential to undermine sustainable development in
          many ways ... sustainable development requires suitable investment in the
          economy's capital assets. A vast empirical literature strongly suggests that
          corruption is one reason why many societies do not make sufficient
          investments in their productive base. Take, for example, education, that is,
          investment in the stock of human capital. Since education is associated with
          positive externalities, the social value of these investments exceeds the
          private return, and public funding is justified from a social point of view, in
          particular for primary education. But do the funds committed always reach
          the schools? Expenditure tracking surveys undertaken by the World Bank
          in Africa suggest that the answer is no: corrupt officials manage to divert
          the flow of funds to other purposes, most likely to private consumption or
          political patronage ... the macroeconomic evidence presented by Mauro
          (1998), Tanzi (1998) and many others shows how corruption distorts the
          portfolio of public spending by shifting resources away from education and
          towards public [sic] consumption. In short, there are good reasons to believe
          that corruption undermines the accumulation of human capital and may
          thus be a cause of unsustainable development.

          Another example is investment in manufactured capital. A large theoretical
          literature highlights different reasons why corruption reduces the incentive
          to invest. The basic point is that corruption, through the sale of investment
          licenses or simply through creation of red tape and rent-seeking, serves as
          a tax on investment. The macroeconomic evidence strongly confirms that
          investment does not thrive in a corrupt environment.... Tanzi and Davoodi
          (1998), for example, show that corruption tends to increase public
          investment, but that it is associated with low operation and maintenance
          expenditures and with poor quality of infrastructure, that is, with
          investments of lower quality. Moreover, Wei (2000) demonstrates that
          corruption acts like a tax on international investments.... Along similar lines,
          Rose-Ackerman (1999, ch. 3), argues that corrupt politicians favor
          investment projects with inefficiently high capital intensity (`white
          elephants') because the stream of bribe income generated by such projects

          is front-loaded. As a consequence of this bias, too little investment is
          subsequently made in maintaining the capital.

          ...

          The final example relates to the management of natural capital. Leite and
          Weidmann (2002) and many others provide macroeconomic evidence on
          the close association between extraction of natural resources, resource rents,
          and corruption. Anecdotal evidence linking the exploitation of natural
          resources to corruption is also abundant, ranging from kickbacks associated
          with logging concessions in Malaysia and Indonesia to oil concessions in
          Nigeria.... The consequence of these distortions is environmental
          degradation. This is directly related to a vast literature on the so-called
          `resource curse'. Economic logic suggests that abundance of natural
          resources should be beneficial for economic development.... Yet, as first
          demonstrated by Sachs and Warner (1997), despite this apparent advantage,
          resource-rich countries tend to grow at a slower rate than other countries.
          One often-cited reason for this curse is that resource abundance fosters a
          `rentier' economy with rampant corruption and poorly developed
          institutions.... Such an environment not only encourages overuse of the
          natural resource base; it also crowds out investment in manufactured and
          human capital (Gylfason, 2001; Papyrakis and Gerlagh, 2006), misallocates
          talent away from innovative activities to rent-seeking (Acemoglu and
          Verdier, 1998) and encourages growth-harming increases in government
          consumption (Atkinson and Hamilton, 2003) ... the general message from
          this literature is that resource rents induce corruption where institutions are
          weak, and that corruption and weak institutions encourage overuse of
          natural capital. The implied net result is a significant fall in genuine
          investment.

          These examples show that corruption can be a threat to sustainable
          development through the effect it has on investment in an economy's
          productive base. However, they also demonstrate another basic point. The
          effect of corruption on economic growth, defined in terms of GDP per
          capita, is likely to be smaller than the corresponding effect of corruption on
          genuine investment and sustainability, at least over the medium term.

Corrupt Nations.122 Mr. Cullen, a former member of the Parliament of Canada, is also a
founding member of the Global Organization of Parliamentarians Against Corruption.123 In
his book, he finds a strong correlation between low GDP per capita and corruption (or more
accurately "perceptions of corruption," based on TI's Corruption Perceptions Index). The
following excerpts illustrate some connections between corruption and poverty:124

 Nations where corruption is rampant also tend to have a large proportion of the
 population living in poverty - such as the people in this shanty town - while the
 countries' leaders may be diverting millions from national wealth to Swiss bank accounts
 for their personal benefit.

...

What I will attempt to demonstrate in this book is that while bribery and corruption may
have cultural connotations and roots, they are morally and economically indefensible.
This book places its focus on the relationship between corruption and poverty. It has two
major themes.

First, there is the need for world leaders to address the growing disparities between the
rich and poor nations. How big is this gap and what are the trends? As David Landes
highlights in The Wealth and Poverty of Nations, "The difference in income per head
between the richest industrial nation, say Switzerland, and the poorest non­industrial
country, Mozambique, is about 400 to 1. Two hundred and fifty years ago, this gap
between richest and poorest was perhaps 5 to 1.... It is estimated that in today's world,
20,000 people perish every day from extreme poverty (some argue that the figure is 50,000
daily deaths from poverty-related causes).

[Note: The enormous gulf globally between the rich and the poor continues to grow. For
a more nuanced analysis of income inequality and the dangers it creates, see: World Social
Report 2020, UNDESA, 2020, ST/ESA/372 and Facundo et al, "The Elephant Curve of
Global Inequality and Growth" (2018) 108 AEA Papers and Proceedings at 103.]

Second, there is a need to deal with bribery and corruption, a growing activity that is
getting completely out of hand, and one of the key factors that is slowing growth and
reducing economic opportunities in the developing world.

I then argue that conventional approaches to battling poverty and corruption have not
worked and need to be examined. We need to begin thinking and acting creatively to
develop a new paradigm. Executing corrupt officials (25 officials have met this fate in
China in the past four years) is not the answer for progressive nations with a respect for
human rights and the rule of law.

The two themes mentioned above are closely interconnected. The poverty of the world's
poor nations is significantly exacerbated through bribery and corruption. Later on, I will
describe the high degree of correlation between poverty and corruption. Not only do the
problems of income distribution amongst the political elites, the working poor, and the
poverty-stricken become more exaggerated, but it saps hope. Corruption also leads to
political instability, donor fatigue, and the disappearance of much needed investment
capital in the affected countries.

...

We know that disparities between the rich and poor nations are not a function of poverty
alone. In fact, corruption is not an unknown phenomenon in the so-called developed

                                                                                                          37

 world.... There are many underlying reasons for the wealth and income disparities. Some
 of these factors are not controllable, whereas corruption, with political will, can be
 controlled.

 ...

 Quite clearly, corruption is a disease that affects every functioning aspect of governments.
 To better understand the correlation between corruption and good governance,
 researcher Tony Hahn created an Index of Public Governance (IPG). Hahn uses three
 levels of measurement to compute the index, drawing on data from the Freedom House's
 2004 indices of political rights and civil liberties, Transparency International's 2004
 Corruptions Perceptions Index, and the Economic Freedom of the World's 2004 annual
 report [these indices are further discussed in Section 4]. Each set of data represents a
 democratic and capitalist perspective of government based on the fundamentals that
 good governance ensures the ability of citizens to vote, encourages free enterprise,
 improves quality of life, and allows citizens to exercise their civil liberties.

 Hahn's Index ranks 114 countries, revealing New Zealand at the top of the list with the
 highest model of good governance with a ranking of 9.45 out of 10. Following closely
 behind are Finland, Switzerland, Iceland, and Denmark. Also included in the top 10 are
 the United Kingdom, with a ranking of 9.2, and Australia and Canada, each of which have
 a perfect score in the areas of political rights and civil liberties. Surprisingly the United
 States missed the top 10 by one, ranking eleventh with a score of only 8.2 on economic
 freedom.

 Most importantly, however, are the results for Africa. The first of the African countries to
 make the list is Botswana, which ranks 29th with a score of 7.52, with Mauritius and South
 Africa following closely behind. What is interesting about this, as Hahn points out, is that
 unemployment in Botswana is over 20 per cent and a third of the population is living with
 HIV/AIDS. Comparing the Index rankings with indicators of development such as life
 expectancy and literacy, Botswana is gravely behind South Africa and Mauritius, with a
 life expectancy at 33.38 years--less than half the expected age of Mauritians. Another
 African nation worth noting is war-torn Sierra Leone, which ranks 74th on the Index of
 Public Governance, ahead of both Russia (91st place) and China (99th place). Yet in
 comparison to indicators of development, China and Russia also greatly surpass Sierra
 Leone.

 Hahn points to history and culture to explain why a country can have a positive ranking
 in the Index of Public Governance and a low incidence of development. He argues that if
 countries that have the foundations of good governance continue with their efforts,
 development will follow. This means if countries like Sierra Leone stick to the path of
 comparatively good governance, while countries like Russia do not, then the indicator of
 development should rise for Sierra Leone in comparison with Russia.

 In fact, Hahn's hypothesis on the relationship between corruption and poverty appears
 to be supported in a correlation analysis between Hahn's IPG and GDP per capita.

...

However, good governance is not the only indicator of corruption--poverty plays a role
as well. Governance, Corruption, and Economic Performance recently published by the IMF,
includes studies on the impact of corruption on economic performance. Amongst the
findings are the following:

     · social indicators (e.g. child mortality rate, school drop-out rates) are worse
          where corruption is high;

     · countries with higher corruption tend to have lower per capita income, a higher
          incidence of poverty and greater income inequality;

     · tax revenue is lower in more corrupt countries;
     · transition economies that have made more progress on structural reform tend to

          be less corrupt; and
     · decentralization of taxation and spending improves governance.

...

Corruption and Society

In a December 2005 document, "Controlling Corruption: A Handbook for Arab
Politicians," a number of negative impacts of corruption on society were identified ...

     · Substitutes personal gain for public good;
     · Prevents or makes it more difficult for governments to implement laws and

          policies;
     · Changes the image of politicians and encourages people to go into politics for

          the wrong reasons;
     · Undermines public trust in politicians and in political institutions and

          processes;
     · Erodes international confidence in the government;
     · Encourages cynicism and discourages political participation;
     · Can contribute to political instability, provoke coups d'état, and lead to civil

          wars;
     · Perverts the conduct and results of elections, where they exist;
     · Keeps the poor politically marginalized;
     · Consolidates political power and reduces political competition;
     · Delays and distorts political development and sustains political activity based

          on patronage, clienteles and money;
     · Limits political access to the advantage of the rich;
     · Reduces the transparency of political decision-making.

                                                                                                          39
GLOBAL CORRUPTION

 ...

 For politicians in Mexico, when it comes to dealing with the drug lords, the choices are
 very clear--take the money and run and turn a blind eye; or have you and your family
 face the consequences of violence turned against you. It becomes even more difficult for
 a politician attempting to fight the drug lords when the police themselves are corrupt,
 and when judges are also bribed. It takes a brave politician to buck this trend.

 Corruption is not only related to regular crime, however; the downing of a Russian
 passenger airliner in August 2004 by terrorists highlights how corruption and terrorism
 can be linked. It is alleged that the terrorist who blew up one of the planes was initially
 denied boarding the aircraft because of some irregularities with her documentation.
 However, a bribe approximating US $50 was paid--allowing her to board the aircraft and
 eventually blow it up, causing the death of 46 people.

 In conclusion, corruption has enormous implications for developing countries. It
 undermines democratic processes, carries with it a huge economic cost, and corruption
 can lead to political unrest. But corruption also impacts countries with more developed
 economies and it is [to this] aspect that we now turn our attention.

 ...

 Developed countries are not immune from corruption--it is more a question of order of
 magnitude, and the level of damage that corruption can cause in the respective
 jurisdictions. Many or all the negative consequences associated with corruption for
 developing countries apply to the more developed economies. There are, however, some
 additional and unique considerations for the industrialized world. There is an economic
 cost of bribery that is reflected in a higher cost of doing business in corrupt countries. This
 limits levels of foreign direct investment by developed countries in developing and
 emerging economies. Corruption in developing countries has undoubtedly changed
 world migration patterns as people flee their home countries out of disgust and/or the
 desire to improve the quality of their lives. They may flee their country of birth if they are
 being persecuted for exposing corrupt practices, or when bribery has caused greater
 health, safety, and environmental risks. [footnotes omitted]

2. THE MANY FACES OF CORRUPTION

2.1 No Universal Definition

Corruption is not a singular concept;125 it comes in many forms and occurs in both hidden
and open places. It is truly a global phenomenon; no country is corruption free. Although
global in its nature, there is no global consensus on a universal definition of corruption. The
definition and public perception of what behaviour constitutes corruption will vary to some
extent depending on both the past and present social, political, economic, and cultural
structure of each society.126 For example, the line between lawful gift-giving and unlawful
bribery is nearly impossible to pinpoint. Some countries have more prevalent social,
political, and economic customs of gift-giving. In many Asian countries, for example, gift-
giving is, or until recently has been, part of a complex socio-economic custom. In China, that
custom is called guanxi.127 The line between gifts and bribes can also change over time within
a country. Indeed, over the past 50-75 years, this has taken place rapidly in many countries
with the unrelenting march of the market economy into so-called "developing countries."128
Adam Graycar and David Jancsics in "Gift Giving and Corruption" provide a very useful
four-part typology to distinguish between gifts and bribes in the public administration
context. 129

125 For an introduction to the illusive nature of corruption as a concept, see Jonathan Rose, "The
Meaning of Corruption: Testing the Coherence and Adequacy of Corruption Definitions" (2018) 20:3
Public Integrity 220; Joseph Pozsgai-Alvarez, "The Abuse of Entrusted Power for Private Gain:
Meaning, Nature and Theoretical Evolution" (2020) 74 Crime L & Soc Change 433.
126 Perhaps the leading text on the history throughout the ages is JT Noonan, Bribes: The Intellectual
History of Moral Ideas (New York: MacMillan, 1984).
127 A Smart, "Gifts, Bribes and Guanxi: A Reconsideration of Bourdieu's Social Capital" (1993) 8:3
Cultural Anthropology 388.
128 For example, P Verhezen, in "Gifts and Alliances in Java" (2002) 9:1 J Eur Ethics Network 56,
argues that the traditional Javanese norms of harmony and respect have been replaced by economic
values encouraging individualistic consumption and accumulation rather than sharing of communal
wealth. He states that "the [traditional Javanese] logic of the gift and its inherent three-fold structure
of obligation [harmony, hierarchy, respect and reciprocity] are [now] used for personal gain, not
maintaining a social order.... The rhetoric and ceremonial forms of a traditional culture are used to
camouflage what are in fact business or commercial, and in extreme cases even extortionary
relationships." This example is cited by Douglas W Thompson, A Merry Chase Around the Gift/Bribe
Boundary (LLM Thesis, University of Victoria, Faculty of Law, 2008) at 54-56. Thompson (in Chapter
2 of their thesis) also describes a somewhat similar shift in ancient Athens, whereby some
traditionally proper gifting became unethical and illegal as Athens society changed.
129 Adam Graycar & David Jancsics, "Gift Giving and Corruption" (2017) 40 Intl J Pub Admin 1013-
1023. Their four-part typology is divided into social gift, social bribe, bureaucratic gift and
bureaucratic bribe. They apply (at page 1020) a series of questions to help distinguish the four
different types of exchanges:

            The variables that we would consider for each of these are: what is the primary
            function of the exchange; what is it that is being transacted; what is expected in
            return; does the organizational affiliation of the participants matter; are they
            exchanging their own resources, or somebody else's (the organization's); is there

                                                                                                            41
GLOBAL CORRUPTION

Although cultural differences may affect the nature, extent, and kinds of "corruption" in
different states, this absence of universal agreement on the exact meaning of corruption does
not mean there is no consensus at all on its meaning. The United Nations Convention
Against Corruption (UNCAC) does not define the word corruption. Instead, it adopts the
pragmatic approach of describing a number of specific behaviours that parties to the
Convention must criminalize as corrupt, and other specific behaviours that State Parties
should at least consider criminalizing. Thus, all countries that are parties to UNCAC agree
that at least the conduct of the mandatory offences in UNCAC fall within the meaning of
corruption. Therefore, in a legal sense, corruption is the type of behaviour that a state has
defined as corrupt. Other behaviour a vast majority of people may consider morally corrupt,
but is not specified in law as corrupt, is legally permissible behaviour regardless of its moral
offensiveness. This form of behaviour is sometimes disparagingly referred to as "legal
corruption." Chapter 2 is devoted to an examination of the forms of conduct that have been
defined as crimes of bribery or corruption.

"Corruption" is best seen as a broad, generic concept. TI's definition of corruption best
captures this generic flavour: "corruption is the abuse of entrusted power for private
gain."130 The essence of corruption in the TI definition is the combination of three elements:
abuse, entrusted power, and private gain. The abuse of entrusted power must be more than
accidental or negligent; it must be intentional or knowing. TI's definition includes abuse of
power by public officials (sometimes called public corruption) as well as abuse of entrusted
power by private citizens in business (also called private corruption).131 Private corruption
is often dealt with through offences like theft, embezzlement or the offering and accepting
of secret commissions. When describing corruption, adjectives are often used to indicate the
context or form of the corruption in question, such as:

      grand corruption and petty corruption;

      public or private corruption;
      domestic or local corruption versus foreign corruption;

      systemic versus occasional corruption;
      supply-side corruption (i.e. offering or giving bribes) versus demand-side

           corruption (i.e. requesting or receiving bribes), which are also sometimes called
           active corruption (for the briber) and passive corruption (for the bribed official);

            transparency in the transaction; who are the winners and who are the losers; what
            is the primary means of regulation of the transaction.

130 For a more detailed discussion on this specific definition, see Joseph Pozsgai-Alvarez, "The Abuse
of Entrusted Power for Private Gain: Meaning, Nature and Theoretical Evolution" (2020) 74 Crime L
& Soc Change, 433; Jonathan Rose, "The Meaning of Corruption: Testing the Coherence and
Adequacy of Corruption Definitions" (2018) 20:3 Pub Integrity, 220.
131 In "The Law and Economics of Bribery and Extortion" (2010) 6:1 Ann Rev L & Soc Sci 217, Susan
Rose-Ackerman notes that many jurisdictions do not criminalize private-to-private bribery unless
accompanied by some other offence like extortion. In spite of this lack of criminalization, Rose
Ackerman is clear that private-to-private bribery has the potential for broader negative impacts, such
as the development of monopolies harmful to consumers and suppliers, diluted product quality and
limited entry for new businesses.

      administrative corruption versus state capture;132
      political corruption as a species of public corruption, including some forms of

          financial contributions to political parties and election campaigns, patronage,
          cronyism and various forms of vote buying;
      books and records offences which are accounting offences designed to hide the
          giving or accepting of bribes.

Adam Graycar and Tim Prenzler, in their very readable primer on corruption, Understanding
and Preventing Corruption, further suggest that corruption should be examined in the context
of four components: types, activities, sectors, and places (TASP).133 They describe the nature
and meaning of each of these components. For example, types of corruption include bribery,
abuse of discretion, and trading in influence and patronage.

Another analytic tool for describing corruption is the 4 W's--who, what, where and why.
The "who" describes the various actors (e.g., political leaders, government employees,
corporate agents, and executives) involved in corruption events, and the "what" describes
the size (petty or grand), the frequency (rare or common) and the type of corruption offences
being committed (e.g., bribery of a government official to obtain a government procurement
contract or influence peddling in appointments to administrative boards and tribunals). The
"where" describes both the place (national or international) and the sector (public works,
law enforcement, etc.). Finally, the "why" deals with the purposes or motives for engaging
in corruption (including financial need, the need for acceptance and friendship, competition,
and the desire to succeed, promotion of perceived efficiency, greed, etc.).

In a more global sense, the 2014 OECD Foreign Bribery Report provides a glimpse into the
prevalence and characteristics of the corruption of foreign public officials.134 The Report
examines enforcement actions (207 bribery schemes) against 263 individuals and 164 entities
for the offence of bribery of foreign public officials in international business transactions.
The vast majority of the enforcement actions took place in the US (62%) and Germany
(12.5%), with a sprinkling of enforcement actions in Korea (5%), the UK (2.8%), Canada
(1.9%) and other countries. The sanctioned offences occurred all over the world. According
to the report, the majority of bribes (or at least the majority of bribes targeted by law

132 Arnone & Borlini, supra note 82 at 2, explain that administrative corruption "concerns all public
employees' or public officials' actions for private gain that distort the application and enforcement of
existing laws or rules; generally, these actions grant exemptions or tax allowances to specific agents.
Alternatively, they are aimed at giving priority access to public services to an elite of agents." State
capture, according to Arnone and Borlini, encompasses "all illegal actions aimed at influencing the
decision-making process of policy making in the different spheres of the life of a country." Instead of
being held accountable through public scrutiny and opinion, authorities in a situation of state
capture exploit "illegal and secret channels that aim at favoring the interests of specific groups at the
expense of everybody else. These channels are clearly accessible only to a limited group of `insiders'
at the expense of those who are `outsiders' and do not participate in bribery." State capture is also
briefly discussed in Chapter 12, Section 1.1.

enforcement officials) came from large companies with more than 250 employees. Senior
management were involved in over 50% of cases. 80% of bribes were directed towards
officials of state-owned enterprises, followed by heads of state (6.97%), ministers (4%) and
defence officials (3%). The values of the bribes were only available in 224 cases, but totaled
$3.1 billion in those cases. At least 71% of bribes involved an intermediary such as an agent,
corporate vehicle, lawyer or family member. Interestingly, almost half of the cases involved
the bribery of officials in countries with high or very high human development scores,
casting doubt on the idea that most bribery of public officials occurs in developing countries.
In terms of sectors, 57% of cases involved bribes to secure public procurement contracts.

This description reveals some of the many faces of corruption. Recognition of corruption's
many forms and an accurate description of those various forms is essential to finding
appropriate responses and mechanisms in fighting corruption. The most effective anti-
corruption mechanisms are varied and multi-faceted. They vary with the type of corruption
being targeted and the social, political and economic context in which that corruption occurs.
There are no "one size fits all" solutions to corruption. Remedies must be tailor-made and
evaluated on an ongoing basis.

2.2 Imposing Western Definitions Globally

Some commentators claim that the developed Western countries have imposed their
conception of corruption on the rest of the world via international anti-corruption
instruments.135 These instruments are heavily focused on the Western economic priorities of
fostering international trade and leveling the playing field for competing businesses. As a
result, the international conventions focus on economic corruption of foreign officials rather
than subtler yet venomous forms of political corruption, such as corrupt party and campaign
financing, cronyism or vote-buying (see Chapter 13).

The history of UNCAC and the OECD Convention (outlined in more detail in Section 6)
explains why those conventions focus primarily on the grand corruption of political leaders
in foreign states when securing lucrative contracts as opposed to political corruption. The
concern over grand corruption in foreign countries is relatively recent. The history of that
concern is recounted in Section 6. In short, the Watergate investigation led to the revelation
of large, illegal presidential campaign contributions by prominent corporations through
offshore subsidiaries. Further, the investigation revealed a systemic practice of corporate
bribery of foreign public officials. Public outrage led to the enactment of the 1977 US Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which made it an offence for US corporations to bribe foreign
officials in order to obtain contracts abroad. Surprisingly, bribery of foreign officials was not
an offence in any other country. Bribes paid in a foreign country to a foreign official were
viewed as a matter for that foreign country. Indeed, bribes to foreign officials were tax

135 See, for example, T Polzer, "Corruption: Deconstructing the World Bank Discourse" (2001)

Polzer notes that the word "corruption" has no equivalent in many languages. See also A Gupta,

deductible as an expense of doing business. Not surprisingly, American companies
complained loudly that the FCPA put them at a serious competitive disadvantage in
obtaining foreign government contracts, since other industrial countries were continuing to
bribe foreign officials. Rather than reverse course and decriminalize bribery of foreign public
officials, the American government undertook an intense international campaign to bring
the major economic countries of the world into line with the American position. The US
succeeded with the coming into force of the OECD Convention in 1999, followed by the
broader UNCAC in 2005.

As this history demonstrates, the international conventions on corruption were born from
American concerns about loss of international business and the absence of fair competition.
As discussed further in Section 6.3.6, during UNCAC's negotiation, Austria, France, and
the Netherlands advocated for regulations to increase the transparency of elections
and campaign financing, but the US opposed this inclusion. Instead, Article 6 of the
Convention merely requires State Parties to consider implementing measures to increase
transparency in elections and campaign financing.

Related to this claim is the argument that anti-corruption discourse is predominantly
focused on the developing world. Gabriel O. Apata's recent article "Corruption and the
Postocolonial [sic] State: How the West Invented African Corruption" counters the narrative
of Africa as an inherently corrupt continent.136 In doing so, Apata asserts that corruption is
a product of colonization.137 Further, Apata posits that the discourse surrounding African
corruption reflects a Western invention of a markedly corrupt region that emerged in full
force during the period of decolonization to contest new independent governments.138
Rather than focusing on the morally charged concerns of the rampant corruption in Africa,
Apata argues that the more pressing issues lie in the aftermath of colonialism.139

Few commentators argue that grand corruption of foreign public officials should not be
criminalized. However, there is merit to the observation that the international conventions
focus too exclusively on Western concerns regarding economic trade. One could argue that
Western countries display a double standard by roundly denouncing foreign economic
bribery while failing to promote global standards regarding political corruption.

2.3 The Ubiquitousness of Corruption

Corruption is ubiquitous--it can occur at anytime and anywhere. It can take place through
a wide variety of activities: the making of public appointments, the procurement of public
goods, the delivery of public services, as well as the regulation and auditing of

construction, extractive industries, municipal governance, immigration, education, health
care, sports (especially at the international level), and law enforcement. And finally,

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

corruption can take place internationally, nationally, regionally, and locally; in workplaces,
governments, and corporate offices. The discussion in Section 4 relates to the difficulty in
measuring the perceptions and actual prevalence of corruption nationally and globally.
However, one does not need sophisticated measuring devices to know that corruption is
rampant worldwide. One need only peruse the news over the past few years to see the
variety of people, places, and activities involved in corruption. This section briefly sets out
some of these corruption scandals.

Most corruption, especially in poorer countries, can be referred to as "petty corruption." It
is petty in the amount of the bribe, its frequency, and the reluctant acceptance by the public
in general of the attitude, "there's nothing we can do about it." However, it is definitely not
petty to its victims. Examples of petty corruption include a police officer who demands (or
is offered) a small bribe in exchange for not issuing a traffic ticket to a motorist. Or when an
electric, gas or telephone employee demands a small bribe before agreeing to hook up the
required service. It takes place when a parent is required to pay a small bribe before their
child is enrolled in school or when they are required to buy a school uniform at five times
its normal cost. Access to "free" medical or hospital services may not be provided unless a
bribe is paid. This list could go on and on.

Other forms of large-scale corruption and bribery arise in all societies, whether rich or poor.
For example, nine US Navy officers were charged with accepting cash, hotel expenses, and
the services of prostitutes in exchange for providing classified US Navy information to a
defence contractor in Singapore.140 In May 2015, BHP Billiton, a mining giant, agreed to pay
$25 million to settle charges laid by the US Securities Exchange Commission after BHP paid
for government officials from various countries to attend the 2008 Olympics in Beijing. The
officials were connected to pending contract negotiations or regulatory issues involving
BHP.141 Malawi's "cashgate" has been unfolding since 2013, when investigations into the
siphoning of millions of dollars by civil servants began. In another instance, two top
Malawian army officers were arrested for their involvement in the siphoning of $40 million
under the guise of ordering new military uniforms that never materialized.142 In June 2015,
a New Jersey cardiologists' practice agreed to pay $3.6 million to settle allegations that it had
falsely billed federal healthcare programs for medically unnecessary tests.143 In another
example, Haitian Senator Rony Célestin and Canada's anti-money laundering legislation
came under fire in 2021. Célestin, who owns a $3.4 million mansion in Quebec, faces an
investigation by a Haitian anti-corruption inquiry after being accused of using fraud and

corruption to gain his fortune.144 The New York Times reports that as per Canadian anti-
money-laundering legislation, the February 2021 purchase of the mansion should have
triggered mandatory due diligence on behalf of Canadian financial institutions involved in
the real estate transaction.145 The RCMP has not revealed whether there is an ongoing
investigation.146

In addition to the somewhat large-scale examples of bribery and corruption, there are other
shocking examples of grand corruption and kleptocracy committed by autocrats,
oligarchies, democratic leaders, and some of the largest and "most respected" corporations,
banks and financial organizations.147 Grand corruption occurs at the highest levels of our
political and corporate structures. It has the most massive adverse impact, trickling down to
all sectors of society. The rationale for these devastating crimes is greed--plain and simple!

Many of the world's most well-known corporations and organizations have found
themselves in hot water due to corruption-related scandals. The most infamous is likely the
Enron scandal, but plenty of others are ongoing. For example, the multinational oil
corporation Royal Dutch Shell and its Italian partner Eni have been embroiled in a decade-
long investigation concerning a Nigerian oil block licence granted in 2011. Global Witness
reported that the two oil companies paid $1.1 billion--roughly equating to 80% of the
projected Nigerian health budget for 2015--to Malabu Oil and Gas, a company beneficially
owned by Dan Etete, the former Nigerian energy minister.148 A leaked email sent to Shell's
former CEO Peter Voser declared that "Etete can smell the money. If, at nearly 70 years old,
he does turn his nose up at nearly $1.2 [billion] he is completely certifiable. But I think he
knows it's his for the taking."149 The "sweetheart deal" orchestrated by Shell and Eni would
have cost Nigeria $5.86 billion in potential revenues.150 Nigerian President Buhari, however,
refused requests to develop the oil block until the end of the legal proceedings and the
licence expired in May of 2021.151 In March 2021, Shell and Eni were acquitted of all

144 The New York Times investigated three businesses from which the senator proclaims to have
amassed his wealth from, but was unable to verify the existence of two. The third seems to
contravene constitutional provisions barring Haitian politicians from benefitting from state-
sponsored contracts. For more information, see Dan Bilefsky & Catherine Porter, "Who Paid for That

on the ruling, stating that it was "a huge blow for natural resource governance and
transparency in Nigeria ... [and] will continue to sting."153 Shell continues to face legal action
with outstanding prosecutions in Nigeria and the Netherlands.154

And nearly the whole world knows about the corruption charges laid against senior FIFA
officials by the US.155 FIFA officials were indicted based on allegations that they took part in
accepting bribes and kickbacks over the course of 24 years. The officials allegedly accepted
bribes in relation to past bidding processes for hosting rights and the awarding of
broadcasting and marketing rights for various tournaments. Former FIFA President Sepp
Blatter resigned just four days after his re-election in June 2015 and has since been suspended
from football until 2028, fined 1 million Swiss francs for violating the organization's code of
ethics, and is now facing a "criminal mismanagement" complaint related to the FIFA
museum project in Zurich.156 Gianni Infantino, former General Secretary of UEFA, took over
from Blatter as President of FIFA following his election in February 2016.157

In March 2016, FIFA filed a victim statement and request for restitution. In the restitution
claim, FIFA argued that its organization as a whole was not corrupt, but rather only its
leaders were. As such, it claimed that some of the $290 million seized or frozen by US
prosecutors should be used to compensate the victims of the corruption: FIFA and its
member associations.158 A US court awarded FIFA a mere $108,268 of its original $28 million
restitution request.159 At least 17 people and two entities plead guilty to charges in
connection with the American FIFA investigation.160

In June 2015, Switzerland announced they were investigating 53 "suspicious activity
reports" concerning the possible laundering of bribes in connection to the hosting of the
Russia and Qatar World Cups. By September 2015, former Swiss Attorney General Michael
Lauber stated that Swiss authorities were investigating 121 suspicious banking transactions.
Since then, a spokesman for the Attorney General's office stated that the number of incidents
under investigation had surpassed 200. As of 2021, criminal proceedings are still ongoing.

The world's biggest banks often are no better: in November 2016, JPMorgan Chase agreed
to pay $246 million in fines in a settlement with US officials for hiring unqualified children
of China's ruling elite in exchange for gaining lucrative business.161 Moreover, in May 2015,
four of the world's largest banks (JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Barclays, and the Royal Bank
of Scotland) pled guilty to systematic rigging of the currency markets for profit between
2007 and 2013. While paying a total of more than $11 billion in fines,162 the impact and size
of that fine can be put in perspective by noting that JPMorgan Chase earned $4.1 billion from
its currency business in the first quarter of 2015.163

There are many examples of rulers and elite officials involved in grand corruption scandals.
In March 2016, the South African Supreme Court ruled that former President Jacob Zuma
had breached the constitution by failing to pay back the $23 million of taxpayers' money he
used to fund additions to his home in Nkandla. Since then, further allegations of corruption
against Zuma have surfaced. In June 2021, Zuma received a 15-month prison sentence for
contempt of court after failing to present himself before a corruption inquiry.164 The inquiry
is investigating 16 different charges of "fraud, graft and racketeering relating to the 1999
purchase of fighter jets, patrol boats and military gear from five European arms firms for 30
billion rand, then the equivalent of nearly US$5 billion."165 A series of riots have broken out

following Zuma's imprisonment, resulting in the death of over 70 individuals.166

In Brazil, a major corruption scandal has been unfolding since 2014 involving Brazil's state-
owned oil company, Petrobras, and billions in bribery and kickback schemes. Petrobras'
former engineering director Renato Duque, was sentenced to more than 20 years in 2015 for
taking over $9 million in bribes in exchange for favouring companies' bids for Petrobras
contracts.167 The former CEO of Petrobras and five other executives resigned in February
2015, and millions of people protested across Brazil in response to the scandal. In May of
2016, President Dilma Rouseff was suspended from her position to face an impeachment
trial. In August 2016, in a 61 to 20 vote of the Senate, Rousseff was convicted of manipulating
the federal budget to conceal the country's financial problems--resulting in Rousseff's
impeachment and removal from office.168

After Rousseff's successor Michel Temer, and his conservative government came to power,
another scandal came to light. Brazilian police launched an investigation into fraudulent
investments made by large pension funds of state-run companies with board members
appointed by politicians. The pension funds implicated in the investigation controlled 280
billion reais (approximately $87 billion) in assets in 2015, and the fraud scheme was valued
at approximately 8 billion reals ($2.5 billion). Many of the politicians under investigation are
those already under investigation in connection with the Petrobras scandal.169 Forty senior
financiers and executives were ordered to temporarily step down from their positions,
abstain from capital market activity, and forfeit their passports.170 The most noteworthy of
such executives was the chief executive of JBS, the world's largest beef exporter.171 On March
21, 2019, Temer, who by then was no longer President, was arrested and indicted on charges
concerning a separate corruption investigation: Temer, the former energy minister and six
aides were allegedly involved in a 1.8 billion reais ($346 million) bribery scheme related to
the construction of a nuclear power plant.172

As of February 2021, the government of Brazil's "Operation Car Wash" anti-corruption task
force secured 174 convictions and recovered $5 billion.173 In the fall of 2020, President Jair
Bolsonaro began shutting down Operation Car Wash, proclaiming that there was "no more
corruption in the government."174

Significant controversy has also surrounded the 1MDB affair. 1MDB is a Malaysian state
investment firm launched in 2009, the same year Najib Razak became Prime Minister of
Malaysia. The fund was supposed to be used to increase economic development in the
country. By 2014, the company was over $11 billion in debt. In 2015, information surfaced
about a suspicious $700 million payment made in 2013 to Najib's bank accounts. This
information led to investigations into 1MDB in at least six countries. Najib claimed that the
transfer was a legal donation from a Saudi benefactor.175

On July 20, 2016, the United States Department of Justice filed lawsuits alleging that between
2009 and 2015, over $3.5 billion had been taken from the fund by 1MDB officials and
associates.176 The lawsuits outline three separate phases of the theft: the first $1 billion was
allegedly obtained fraudulently through a fictitious joint venture between 1MDB and
PetroSaudi. The following two phases focus on $2.7 billion in funds that Goldman Sachs
raised and diverted into a Swiss offshore company and a Singapore bank account.177 The
proceedings commenced by the US Justice Department sought to seize over $1 billion in
assets including luxury properties, art by Van Gogh and Monet, and a jet. The money from
1MDB was also reportedly used to finance production of the film "The Wolf of Wall Street."
Riza Aziz, the stepson of former Prime Minister Najib Razak, co-founded the company that
produced the movie. Razak was among the several individuals mentioned in the lawsuit.178
In 2018, Mahathir Mohamad defeated Razak in a general election--the first majority win by
the opposition in six decades.179 Razak is now serving a 12-year sentence following a guilty
verdict in the first of several ongoing corruption trials.180 Goldman Sachs has also faced
repercussions for its involvement: the US proceedings resulted in the largest American

also struck a $3.9 billion settlement with Malaysian officials.182

Authorities in Switzerland and Singapore undertook separate investigations into the 1MDB
scandal. On July 21, 2016, Singapore authorities reported having frozen or seized
approximately $175 million in its investigations into transactions linked to 1MDB.183 They
also announced that two Swiss banks had been ordered to cease their operations in the
country and that fines had been laid against DBS and UBS for their inadequate attempts to
prevent money laundering.184 In July 2018, Switzerland's Office of the Attorney General
announced that it froze $404 million and opened investigations concerning two banks, as
well as former representatives of 1MDB, Abu Dhabi sovereign funds, and PetroSaudi
International.185

Elsewhere, the Panama Papers prompted widespread shock and concern about tax evasion,
laundering of proceeds of corruption, and other secretive financial dealings facilitated by
offshore accounts and shell companies. In 2014, Bastian Obermayer, a journalist with the
German newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung, received an anonymous telephone call. Shortly
thereafter, Bastian Obermayer and his colleague Frederik Obermaier received the 11.5
million documents, now known as the Panama Papers.186 The leaked documents came from
the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca, which specializes in secretive offshore banking
for the wealthy.187 The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) managed
a team of 370 journalists from roughly 100 media organizations across 70 countries, which
finally published the first coverage of the Panama Papers in April of 2016.188 Of course, not
all offshore accounts are used for illegal activities, but because of their secrecy they are often
used for money laundering, hiding the proceeds of bribery, and tax evasion.189 Evidence in
the Panama Papers of legal, but perhaps immoral, tax avoidance has prompted backlash
against some of the world's most powerful and wealthy individuals and companies.

Internationally, revelations in the Panama Papers instigated proposals for tax reform and
calls for sanctions against countries that operate as tax havens. In April 2021, the CBC
reported that the CRA identified $21 million in unpaid taxes; however, no criminal charges
have been laid.190 At the time of writing, the breaking Pandora Papers story appears to be
the largest leak of offshore data. The Pandora Papers reveal that the outcry generated by the
Panama Papers largely failed to inhibit the growth and success of offshore accounts and
shell companies.

The Panama Papers contain information about a multitude of politicians, such as Ukrainian
President Petro Poroshenko and King Salman of Saudi Arabia. Russian President Vladimir
Putin's associates and family members of Chinese President Xi Jinping are also mentioned.191
On April 5, 2016, Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson stepped down from his position as Prime
Minister of Iceland in response to protests following the release of the Panama Papers. The
documents showed that Gunnlaugsson's wife owned an offshore company that held
millions of dollars in debt from collapsed Icelandic banks.192 Shortly after he took over as
President of FIFA, Gianni Infantino became the subject of an investigation by the Swiss
Federal Police because the Panama Papers included a contract signed by Infantino when he
was at UEFA. The contract suggests that Infantino may have sold broadcast rights below
market price only to have them sold later at a far higher price.193 While serving as Prime
Minister of the United Kingdom, David Cameron came under scrutiny because the Panama
Papers revealed that his late father owned an offshore investment fund called Blairmore
Holdings. While he initially denied having profited from the investments, on April 7, 2016,
Cameron admitted that he had sold shares in the company for more than £30,000 shortly
before becoming Prime Minister. Although there is no suggestion that the fund facilitated
any illegal activity, Cameron's lack of transparency was criticized.194 The Papers further
revealed that three of Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's children owned offshore
assets not included on his family's wealth statement.195 In 2018, Sharif received a 10-year
prison sentence and a $10.6 million fine.196 The Panama Papers also revealed that
entrepreneurs and corrupt public officials in several African countries such as Nigeria,
Algeria, and Sierra Leone, used shell companies to hide profits from the sale of natural

resources and bribes paid to gain access to the resources.197 The sprawling nature of the
Panama Papers illustrates how truly "global" this category of super grand corruption can
be.

3. DRIVERS OF CORRUPTION

Attempting to determine the causes of corruption is a complicated task. In their book
Corruption: Economic Analysis and International Law, Arnone and Borlini note that "[a]ny
attempt to isolate and distinguish causes [of corruption] from effects suffers from the
limitations imposed by the presence of multi-directional causal chains."198 For example,
although bad governance has been shown to contribute to corruption, corruption can also
contribute to bad governance.

Some factors that enable or drive corruption can, however, be articulated. A good starting
point is Arnone and Borlini's observation that decision-making that involves discretion and
conflict of interest are the breeding grounds for corruption. Bad governance can strengthen
the presence of these "preconditions." If lack of accountability is added to the mix,
particularly where officials have "monopoly power over discretionary decisions,"199
opportunities for corruption will be rife. Complex and opaque systems of rules tend to foster
this lack of accountability, along with insufficient stigma and enforcement surrounding
corruption offences.

In a study for the World Bank entitled Drivers of Corruption, Tina Soreide enumerates other,
more specific drivers of corruption.200 She begins by describing factors which increase
opportunities for "grabbing" by public officials. When officials have the power to control
the supply of scarce goods or services, opportunities to create shortages and demand high
payments will increase. This is particularly problematic if citizens cannot choose between
officials. Soreide maintains that facilitation of financial secrecy and secret ownership also
drives corruption, along with information imbalances between principals and agents. For
example, principals might not be informed regarding corruption in foreign markets, leaving
openings for agents to exploit this ignorance by promoting bribery and pocketing a portion
of the proceeds. Soreide also points out that revenues from natural resource exports and
development aid are vulnerable to grabbing. In the context of aid development, both donor
and recipient countries contribute to misuse of aid funds:

          The more urgent the development needs, the more the aid-offering entity
          pays, and the weaker the recipient government's incentives to perform
          better, because better performance will eventually cut the level of aid
          received. The desire to offer financial and other forms of support is

           particularly strong in emergency situations and in the most-fragile states....
           Such sets of circumstances are vulnerable to theft and corruption because
           oversight systems are weak and funds pour in from many sources,
           continuing as long as the needs are dire.

           ...

           Many authors have pointed at incentive problems of donor agencies, and
           there are a number of examples where representatives of donor agencies
           have been involved in illegal transactions or activities that violate their
           organization's rules and the recipient country's legislation. Although donor
           agencies are aware of the potentially troubling impact of such cases on the
           legitimacy of their operations, they, like other bureaucracies, have
           encountered difficulties eradicating the challenges completely and
           handling revealed cases of fraud and corruption effectively.... Jansen [2014]
           explains a donor-government's disincentive to react partly as a trade-off
           between the cost of exercising control and the ease of referring to recipient
           responsibilities. Among the factors is the low propensity among donor
           representatives to procure independent reviews and audits of aid-financed
           projects and programs. Sometimes these are driven by the need to seize
           opportunities for new projects ... this tendency is intensified by heavy
           workloads and "pipeline problems"; that is, when funds have to be
           allocated within the timeframe of a financial year regardless of the status of
           preparatory work or controls. [footnotes omitted]201

Soreide moves on to consider the factors that encourage people to exploit opportunities for
corruption. Included are lack of sanction for individuals or organizations, widespread
tolerance, condonement by management, lack of protection for whistleblowers, and the
failure of political systems and their accountability safeguards.

In his article "Eight Questions about Corruption" (discussed in Section 5), Jakob Svensson
points out that the countries with the highest levels of corruption, according to corruption
ranking results, are those with low income and developing, and closed and transition
economies.202

In his book Combating Corruption: Legal Approaches to Supporting Good Governance and Integrity
in Africa, John Hatchard discusses the root causes of widespread corruption in Africa:

           Many writers have sought to explain the bad governance/corruption
           phenomenon in Africa. Blundo has argued that the colonial legacy was
           instrumental in creating a climate of corruption: here the new elite simply
           copied the example from their former colonial masters,203 although Atyittey
           argues against this thesis going as far as to accuse Africans of `carping'

          about colonial exploitation.204 Others have linked bad governance with the
          development of opportunities for corruption. For example, Collier
          attributes this to four factors: overregulation of private activity; expanded
          public sector employment; expanded public procurement; and weakened
          scrutiny.205 To these may be added issues such as increased access to
          development aid, privatization programmes, and the ability to launder the
          proceeds of corruption through the international financial system quickly
          and efficiently.206

          Allen has argued that the constitutional models adopted by the Anglophone
          and Francophone African states at independence concentrated undue
          political power in the hands of the Executive and that this resulted in weak
          accountability mechanisms.207 This power was then enhanced and further
          entrenched by the establishment of a one-party system in many states and
          often largely retained despite a return to multi-party democracy and the
          making of new constitutions.208 This argument is taken up by Raditlhokwa
          who blames the spread of corruption almost solely on a crisis of leadership,
          accusing African leaders of a lack of self-discipline209 and a resultant `crisis
          in leadership'210 leading to dysfunctional or failed institutions which
          facilitates the abuse of governmental power.211 212

Hatchard also explains some motives behind the corrupt acts of public officials. First on the
list is financial gain, followed by the belief that corruption will not be prosecuted. Next,
Hatchard describes the "[p]ressure to carry out or condone the activity"213 when lower-level
officials are threatened or bribed into assisting the corrupt acts of higher-level officials. The
presence of traditional gift-giving practices can also motivate corrupt practices, along with
the standard business practice of "[b]ona fide payments to public officials, such as gifts or
hospitality, provided by a company in order to promote its image."214 In addition, the desire
to circumvent inefficient bureaucracy, through facilitation payments, for example, motivates
corruption.

Recent scholarship has found a relationship between corruption and populism. Pipa Norris
explains the link between the two, describing how populism "focuses power in the
individual leader versus the party. It destroys and erodes ... political trust.... It also weakens
accountability of the electorate. When you don't have accountability, that often leads [sic] it
open to other forms of power being abused and misused."215 Jose Ugaz, chairman of TI's
board, has also commented on the role populism has played as a driver. In doing so, Ugaz
noted the importance of strong institutions, stating that:

          [In] countries with populist or autocratic leaders, we often see democracies
          in decline and a disturbing pattern of attempts to crack down on civil
          society, limit press freedom, and weaken the independence of the judiciary.
          Instead of tackling crony capitalism, those leaders usually install even
          worse forms of corrupt systems.... Only where there is freedom of
          expression, transparency in all political processes and strong democratic
          institutions, can civil society and the media hold those in power to account
          and corruption be fought successfully.216

The above few pages have listed a significant number of factors that encourage, facilitate or
drive corruption--no doubt there are more. The factors or drivers include:

      Decision-making by officials involving discretion
      Conflicts of interest
      Poor governance structures and the rise of populist leaders
      Poverty and a low-income economy
      Lack of accountability and oversight
      Unchecked monopoly powers
      Complex and opaque systems of rules for obtaining government goods and services
      Insufficient stigma and enforcement of corruption laws
      Weak sanctions for corruption violations
      Widespread tolerance of corruption by public or government
      Lack of independent and free press, and an independent judiciary and effective

          whistle-blower laws
      Financial secrecy laws
      Anonymous beneficial ownership

Based just on the drivers described above, consider the complexity of trying to establish an
economic, political, and social strategy and framework to control or reduce corruption and

bribery. No wonder corruption levels do not appear to be falling when reform efforts are
only directed at one or two drivers. This point is well illustrated in the following piece on
the significance, complexity, and multifaceted nature of the relationship between freedom
of the press and corruption.

       Freedom of the Press and Corruption: Exploring its Multifaceted Relationship

                                              by Rachael Carlson217

 A considerable amount of literature suggests that press freedom plays a significant role
 in fighting corruption.218 Indeed, the OECD states that, "[m]edia reporting is an
 essential--albeit untapped--source of detection in corruption cases."219 UNCAC also
 recognizes the importance of press freedom in Article 13: Participation of Society. Article 13
 requires states to take measures to promote active participation of individuals and groups
 outside the public sector in preventing and fighting corruption, including through
 "respecting, promoting and protecting the freedom to seek, receive, publish and
 disseminate information concerning corruption."220

 Generally, the press is seen as a strong accountability mechanism, or "watchdog," that
 may monitor the actions of public officials and communicate their transgressions to the
 general public (or authorities). While the OECD reports that only 2% of foreign bribery
 cases are detected through media reports, this statistic should not undermine the critical
 role journalists have held in a number of significant corruption cases. Jennifer Kline
 provides a few key examples:

            In 2011, the Los Angeles Times revealed that officials in a small California
            city improperly paid themselves exorbitant salaries, and the subsequent
            court cases ordered restitution awards nearing $20 million. In 2012, the
            New York Times exposed Walmart's widespread bribery in Mexico, and
            the company ultimately agreed to pay $282 million to settle the resulting
            seven-year investigation into whether Walmart had violated the Foreign
            Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). In 2017, the International Consortium of
            Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) shocked the world when its affiliated
            journalists broke the Panama Papers scandal, exposing extensive fraud
            and tax evasion by world leaders, drug traffickers, and celebrities alike.
            As a result of the ICIJ's investigation, governments around the world
            have managed to claw back $1.28 billion from perpetrators thus far. A
            Malaysian-born British journalist's investigations (prompted by a
            whistleblower who provided her with more than 200,000 documents)
            produced the first hard evidence of what became known as Malaysia's
            1MDB scandal, the world's largest kleptocracy scheme to date, which has
            produced, among other things, a nearly $2.9 billion settlement for FCPA
            violations.221

 Press Freedom and Corruption Perception

 Section 4 in this chapter reviews the approaches used in "quantifying" corruption levels.
 Due to its clandestine nature, corruption levels within a state are notoriously difficult to
 measure. A common measure of corruption is corruption perception. Prevailing literature
 on corruption demonstrates that corruption perception is lower in areas where there is
 more press freedom. However, the extent to which free media actually lowers corruption
 is less definitive.

 Firstly, freedom of the press is not an isolated factor; that is, it does not exist within a
 vacuum. Press freedom will interact with other drivers of corruption, which may inhibit
 or enhance its capacity to root out and remedy corruption. For example, Basyouni
 Hamada et al. acknowledge the theory that press freedom only lowers corruption levels
 when paired with a democratic state, stating "[w]ithout a democratic environment that
 encourages the rule of law (RL), press freedom will not do more than report corruption
 events and create awareness."222 They conclude that, while democracy and press freedom
 have a "magnifying effect" on one another in combatting corruption, "the magnitude of
 influence of RL in fighting corruption is not sensitive to the level of press freedom."223
 Their findings also suggest that "corruption level is sensitive to the level of press freedom,

so any effort that reduces political and commercial influences on the press may be an
important step towards curbing corruption levels," but that "policy reforms in countries
that want to fight corruption have to focus more on establishing a well-functioning legal
system than on democracy and press freedom," given that the RL is such a "powerful
mechanism"224 to limit abuse of power. Christine Kalenborn and Christian Lessman's
research suggests that "democratic elections only work in controlling corruption, if there
is a certain degree of press freedom in a country, vice versa" and that "democratic reforms
are more effective, if they are accompanied by institutional reforms strengthening the
monitoring of politicians."225 TI also recognizes the importance of pairing freedom of
association with freedom of the media in fighting corruption:

          and influence public policy, is vital to anti-corruption. CSOs play a key
          role in denouncing violations of rights or speaking out against breaches
          of law. Similarly, a free and independent media serves an important
          function in investigating and reporting incidences of corruption. The
          voices of both civil society and journalists put a spotlight on bad actors
          and can help trigger action by law enforcement and the court system.226

These observations highlight the complexity of the "corruption ecosystem."

Secondly, press freedom at the state-level may be impaired by operational realities within
the state. Investigative journalism may be condoned by law, but severely impaired by
physical and legal threats to journalists or media outlets. This is explored more fully
below.

Thirdly, the relationship drawn between press freedom and the perception of lower rates
of corruption may at times also be the result of a "reputational premium." Michael Breen
and Robert Gillanders explore the possibility that "corruption experts may use press
freedom as a mental shortcut, or heuristic device, when compiling corruption perceptions
indices. If experts do this routinely, then press freedom may improve corruption
perceptions irrespective of actual corruption levels."227 They sum up their study and
findings as follows:

          In this article, we explore whether cross-country corruption perception
          indices based on expert assessments reward states with a freer press more
          than one might expect given levels of experienced corruption. We find
          that press freedom improves a country's reputation, creating a

            reputational premium. In other words, whilst a free press may reduce
            corrupt behavior directly, we find that it also reduces corruption
            perceptions, irrespective of actual corruption levels. In particular, we find
            that the developed world is the main beneficiary of this reputational
            premium, as it is strongest in countries with low to moderate levels of
            corruption by global standards.228

 Breen and Gillanders note that the artificial inflation or deflation of corruption perception
 based on this "reputational premium" has important ramifications: perception of high
 corruption levels can "harm national wellbeing by repelling foreign direct investment and
 undermining important outcomes such as GDP growth and interpersonal and
 institutional trust" (in turn affecting "trust in the state and its agents and [undermining]
 support for democracy, even in the developed world"229).

 Lucia Rizzica and Marco Tonello have similar concerns:

            Corruption perceptions drive individuals' choices in many critical
            contexts. They affect citizens' voting choices, entrepreneurs' investment
            decisions, and also workers' occupational sorting. Moreover, they are
            used to build most international indicators of corruption on which cross-
            country comparisons and rankings are based. For these reasons, it is
            imperative to understand how accurate these perceptions are and what
            drives them.230

 Their study, set in Italy, analyzes "the impact of news content on individuals' perceptions
 about the extent of corruption in their country." One of their conclusions may have a
 striking impact on the reliability of corruption perceptions indexes:

            Our finding that corruption perceptions respond to media content in a
            very volatile [and often shortlived] way, moreover, suggests that in order
            to achieve a reliable measure of perceived corruption in a given year one
            should randomize the dates of the interviews so as to make sure that the
            indicator is not flawed by idiosyncratic shocks in media content.231

 Rizzica and Tonello's findings add nuance to the perception conversation: perceptions of
 corruption are prone to significant and "volatile" fluctuation that ought to be accounted
 for in corruption measurements. This latter finding also demonstrates the complexity in
 the relationship between press freedom and corruption. While press freedom may help
 root out corruption through investigative journalism, it also has a pivotal role in shaping

 Impediments to Investigative Journalism in the Corruption Landscape

 As suggested, physical and legal threats are an ongoing hurdle for the work of
 investigative journalists. TI reports that countries with higher rates of corruption tend to
 have the fewest protections for media and journalists, and in highly corrupt countries, one
 journalist is killed each week on average.232 One in five journalists that die as a result of
 their occupation do so while covering a corruption-related story.233 The physical threat to
 journalists is increasing at a rapid pace, doubling from 2019-2020.234

 Journalists may also be subject to civil or criminal proceedings (the latter which may result
 in fines or imprisonment) when attempting to expose corruption or cover certain
 politically-sensitive topics.235 For example, TI writes that "strategic lawsuits against public

December 2020), online: <https://cpj.org/reports/2020/12/murders-journalists-more-than-doubled-

            The global climate of impunity and dangerous anti-press rhetoric comes amid the US's
            abdication of global leadership on the defense of press freedom under President Trump.
            Instead of defending journalists and press freedom in principle, the Trump administration's
            approach is opportunistic: speaking out about Iran's actions but glaringly failing to
            condemn the Saudi government and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for their role in
            the 2018 murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi is the most egregious
            example. Last month, CPJ published a proposal to the incoming Biden administration on
            restoring U.S. leadership, including appointing a special presidential envoy for press
            freedom who would be empowered to speak out about violations around the world;
            rebuilding State Department institutions that have traditionally supported press freedom;
            and sending a directive to US embassies that press freedom is a foreign policy priority.

This theory also highlights the complexity of the impact of press freedom on corruption at an
international level: various socio-political factors may enhance or impair the ability of the press to
combat corruption.
235 See Rebecca Redelmeier, "`Like an Open-Air Cage': Police Restrict Reporters' Access to Canadian
Anti-Logging Protests" (28 June 2021), online: CPJ <https://cpj.org/2021/06/police-restrict-reporters-
access-canadian-anti-logging-protests/>:

            Journalists say the injunction [to cover the anti-logging protects] violates their right to
            report: the RCMP has denied journalists access to the demonstration sites; demanded that
            members of the press stay within areas that are often out of earshot and only provide a
            partial view of what's going on; and threatened journalists with arrest, according to local
            news reports, journalist accounts on Twitter, and a statement from the Canadian
            Association of Journalists (CAJ).

 participation" or "SLAPP suits" are filed often with the "sole intention of intimidating
 and censoring journalists or activists." This may occur even in countries with relatively
 high levels of press freedom.236 States may also be inclined to use events like the COVID-
 19 pandemic as a rationale to "justifiably" limit the ambit of press freedom (subjecting
 investigative journalists to a greater likelihood of criminal or civil proceedings, and
 undermining their role as an accountability mechanism).237

 Apart from physical and legal threats, there is a third significant deterrent for journalists
 pursuing corruption-related reporting: "investigative journalism is a risky investment for
 media outlets."238 It often-times amounts to nothing, despite being significantly time and
 resource intensive. Media outlets may find it difficult to justify the legal and political risks
 alongside the economic costs of engaging in the investigation altogether. Kline writes,
 "even though media outlets can reap substantial rewards from successful investigations--
 in the form of clicks, subscriptions, and prestige--media outlets faced with declining
 revenues and an increasingly hostile environment may not invest nearly as much in
 investigations into corruption as would be socially optimal."239

            Jerome Turner, a reporter at Ricochet, covered the demonstrations freely before police
            began enforcing the injunction, but has since faced restrictions at the site, he told CPJ via
            phone. The scene, he said, is reminiscent of last year in Wet'suwet'en territory in northern
            British Columbia, where police set up an "exclusion zone" where press were not allowed to
            enter as Wet'suwet'en hereditary leadership and supporters opposed the construction of a
            natural gas pipeline on the land, according to news reports. Turner was detained for eight
            hours, as CPJ documented at the time.

239 Kline, ibid, proposes a media rewards program, where media outlets who expose corruption are
paid a percentage of the asset recovery:

            [A media reward] program could go a long way toward providing subsidies to media
            outlets that provide the invaluable public service by exposing corruption, as well as giving
            news organizations a powerful incentive to allocate a larger share of their resources towards
            the kinds of investigative journalism that are likely to produce such stories.

                                                                                                            63
GLOBAL CORRUPTION

 Finally, the OECD also reports that lack of effective whistleblower and source protection
 laws are significant obstacles in uncovering corruption:

            Whistleblower protection was considered the second most valuable
            support for journalists investigating corruption (63%), behind strong
            editorial board backing (77%). Journalists also noted that their sources
            can also work for law enforcement agencies, and considered that these
            sources should be protected as any other whistleblower. The media plays
            a potentially vital role in de-stigmatising whistleblower reporting. For
            example, referring to a "leak" when breaking a story based on
            information provided by a whistleblower (particularly an insider), can
            serve to reinforce perceptions that the whistleblower was acting
            unethically or illegally in providing such information.240

 Social Media and Corruption

 A discussion of investigative journalism's impact on corruption would not be complete
 without acknowledging the burgeoning role of social media in the press landscape.
 Zhenya Tang et al. write, "understanding the relationship between [Information and
 Communication Technologies] use and corruption reduction presents a promising area of
 research at the intersection of information systems, social science and public policy."241
 With 4.48 billion social media users in July 2021, who spend an average of 2.5 hours/day
 using social media,242 it is undoubtable that social media has a role to play in the complex
 socio-political ecosystem that seeks to deter (or promulgate) corruption. Study of this area

Disha Verma endorses Kline's proposition in their post, "Why Paying the Media to Uncover
Corruption Would Work in India" (16 July 2021), online (blog): The Global Anticorruption Blog
<https://globalanticorruptionblog.com/2021/07/16/why-paying-the-media-to-uncover-corruption-
would-work-in-india/>, explaining four reasons why such a scheme would be particularly well-
suited to combatting corruption in India: (1) despite being endemic in India, corruption is under-
reported, with media focusing on only the most "sensational" scams. A reward system would
provide an incentive to cover "more prosaic" corruption incidents; (2) a rewards program would
financially support media outlets who face lawsuits, lose commercial revenue and face regulatory
scrutiny in uncovering corruption. Further, strict laws against false claims in India, combined with
the risk and cost of uncovering corruption, mean that it is less likely that there will be "reckless
allegations" of corruption in India [Note: This interaction of corruption drivers--a media rewards
program for uncovering corruption may be more likely to maintain its integrity when coupled with a
strong false claims deterrent]; (3) monetary rewards may provide journalists with the ability to buy
better security or offer "a sense of justice to journalists and their families" when they are faced with
significant risks (including "death threats, rape threats, physical attacks and false arrests") in
exposing corruption; and (4) rewards programs may incentivize greater longevity in reporting each
corruption incident, placing more pressure on the government to seek prosecution.

 is in its relative infancy.243 However, the limited data suggests that social media may be
 significant for combatting corruption, particularly in regions with limited press
 freedom.244 Indeed, even anecdotal examples are illustrative of social media's potential
 for disseminating corruption-related news and prompting accountability mechanisms:

            [T]here are some dramatic examples of social media playing a role in the
            fight against corruption [in the Philippines]. For instance, as details of a
            major scheme involving misappropriation of public money began to
            surface in 2013, social media platforms exploded with photos and videos
            pulled from the Instagram and Facebook account of Jeane Napoles,
            whose mother, Janet, had orchestrated the scheme. Filipinos were
            shocked and appalled by all that ill-gotten wealth could buy--private
            planes, expensive handbags, multimillion-dollar apartments, and even a
            new car detailed with a Hermes leather exterior (yes, exterior). Even after
            these accounts were taken down, photos of the Napoles' lavish lifestyle
            continued to circulate. These images made people far more aggressive in
            condemning the actions of those involved, and even inspired the Million
            People March, when protestors called for complete elimination of the
            fund used in the scheme. More recently, Facebook posts about sightings
            of the younger Napoles helped the media to discover that Jeane, who fled
            the country in 2013, had in fact returned. She has since been charged with
            tax evasion.245

 Beatriz Paterno writes that those who are "optimistic" about the potential impact of social
 media on corruption argue that it serves two main functions:

            First, it allows more members of the public to actively participate in
            monitoring and reporting. The oft-cited website I Paid A Bribe in India is
            an example of how social media can encourage broader reporting of
            bribery.... Second, social media may have the potential to mobilize
            groups, as Facebook and Twitter did during the Arab Spring in 2011, and
            as the same platforms did during the Philippines' Million People March
            in 2013. Thus, social media can play a pivotal role in areas where the

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

            government exercises tight control over the press, and where apathy and
            isolation hinder mass mobilization.246

 Paterno also writes that social media has the advantages of addressing day to day
 corruption (i.e. individuals broadcasting instances of petty or everyday bribery), allowing
 instant reporting, inspiring long-term activism, and utilizing mixed media to further deter
 corrupt acts (i.e. "reputations will be harder hit if photographs of politicians' corrupt acts
 begin to circulate on social media"247). Despite these advantages, Paterno asserts:

            While social media may amplify many of the benefits traditionally
            associated with a free press and free speech, it's important to remember
            that those principles have so far failed to curb corruption over the long
            term. More often than not, the elites use their resources to take back
            power. Real, lasting change will require recalibrating the existing social,
            political, and economic disparities that have always allowed elites to
            escape punishment.248

 Again, we are reminded that each "driver" of corruption is limited in its influence, and
 always exists in a relationship with other "drivers."

 Media Corruption

 As mentioned, media cannot only function to root out corruption, but it also plays a
 pivotal role in our perception of the current socio-political climate. While there is not
 enough space to explore this topic fully, it is worth noting that this second role makes
 media corruption itself a significant concern. In his book, Media Corruption in the Age of
 Information, Edward H. Spence presents a systematic theoretical study on how and why
 media corruption manifests. He writes:

            Whereas much has been written on other forms of corruption, including
            corporate, political, financial, sports corruption, and police corruption,
            media corruption has been largely overlooked. Although identified as
            unethical within the general corpus of media ethics, practices such as
            cash-for-comment and media release journalism, including video news

            releases (VNRs), fake news, staged news, advertorials, and infomercials,
            among others, have not been commonly defined as corrupt practices.249

 If the media and the press are to be useful in combatting corruption, its own integrity is
 vital.

4. PERCEPTIONS AND MEASUREMENTS

As pointed out by Graycar and Prenzler, measuring corruption can guide remedial measures
and provide "an indicator of how well a society is performing in terms of a government's
contract with its citizens."250 However, measuring corruption is challenging due to the lack
of a uniform definition and the covert nature of corruption. A variety of methods deal with
these problems in different ways. Measurements might address the level of risk of
corruption or the extent of actual corruption using various indicators, or the cost of
corruption. Measurement might require creative techniques. For example, to reveal the
amount of aid funding that had been skimmed in road-building projects in Indonesia,
Benjamin Olken dug up chunks of road and measured the difference between funding and
amounts of materials actually used. Because of the inevitable uncertainty involved in any
one measurement method, Graycar and Prenzler recommend that measurements
"triangulate as many indicators as possible."251

4.1 Commonly-Cited Indexes

(i) Transparency International's Indexes

TI is the world's largest anti-corruption NGO. TI has been very influential in raising the
profile of the problem of corruption, in part through its research and surveys regarding the
prevalence of corruption-related activities worldwide. The three main indexes and surveys
published by TI are the Corruption Perceptions Index (the "CPI"), the Global Corruption
Barometer (the "GCB") and the Bribe Payers Index (the "BPI").

author divides media corruption into three categories based on the "nature of their rent-seeking
behaviour and the scale involved in their daily practice" (at 299): (1) paid for news (or "individual

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

          (a) The Corruption Perceptions Index252

          The CPI is the most commonly cited corruption index worldwide. As its title
          indicates, the CPI measures perceptions rather than actual rates of
          corruption. The index is an aggregate of a variety of different data sources.
          It reports on levels of public sector corruption, as perceived by
          businesspersons and country experts who deal with the country in
          question. Despite some limitations, it is generally acknowledged as a
          reliable, though not precise, indicator of the perception of public sector
          corruption levels. The CPI is published annually and its release gets
          significant media attention. The 2020 edition includes information on 180
          countries and territories. Denmark and New Zealand, closely followed by
          Finland, Singapore, Sweden, and Switzerland topped the list with the
          lowest levels of perceived corruption, while Somalia, South Sudan, Syria,
          Yemen and Venezuela had the highest perceived corruption levels.

          Table 1.1 examines Canada, the US and the UK's CPI scores from 2015 to
          2020. Table 1.2 gives a sample of the TI corruption perception scores from

out of the top ten in 2020. The US follows a similar downward trend. (3) Conversely,
Singapore, Germany, and the UK have all improved their rankings.

           (b) The Global Corruption Barometer255

          The GCB measures both lived experiences with corruption and perceptions
          on corruption amongst the general public. According to TI, it is the world's
          largest public opinion survey on corruption. The 2020 edition included
          responses from citizens in 119 countries. It asked respondents questions
          regarding both their experiences with corruption in major public services
          and their perceptions on items such as the effectiveness of government
          efforts to control corruption and corruption trends and rates. The GCB is
          published every few years. The survey indicates that nearly one in four
          people worldwide (25%) report having paid a bribe to a major public
          institution. This increases to more than three out of every four people (75%)
          in Yemen. In comparison, one percent of people in countries, such as
          Denmark and Finland, and two percent in Japan, report having done so.

          Over the course of 2019-2021, TI has released the 10th edition of the GCB,
          which is now released in five separate regional surveys256 covering Africa,
          the Middle East and North Africa, the European Union, Asia, and Latin
          America and the Caribbean.257 They show, in particular, that in Europe and

          Central Asia bribery rates vary considerably between the countries of the
          region. For instance, while less than one percent of households in Denmark
          reported paying a bribe when accessing basic services, this figure was as
          high as 20 percent in Romania and 19 percent in Bulgaria.258
          (c) The Bribe Payers Index259
          The BPI is based on a TI survey of business executives in 28 of the countries
          around the world that are most heavily involved in receiving imports and
          foreign investment. The index is not published on a regular schedule.
          Unfortunately, the 2011 BPI is the latest edition at this time. The 2011 survey
          focuses on the supply side of bribery and measures perceptions on how
          often foreign companies from the largest economies engage in bribery while
          conducting business abroad versus at home. Of the countries surveyed,
          Chinese and Russian companies were perceived as the most likely to engage
          in bribery while doing business abroad, while firms from the Netherlands
          and Switzerland were perceived as least likely to do so. Sadly, China and
          Russia have yet to prosecute a domestic firm for foreign bribery. The BPI
          results are also categorized by sector. The public works construction sector
          was perceived as the industry sector most likely to involve bribes. Table 1.3
          illustrates the data from the 2008 and 2011 BPI surveys.

(ii) The World Bank's Worldwide Governance Indicators Project261
The Worldwide Governance Indicators project (WGI) reports on six indicators of good
governance, one of which is control of corruption. The WGI is an aggregate of data from a
large number of surveys conducted between 1996 and 2019, and includes data on more than
200 countries and territories. The WGI may be used to compare data over time or between
countries. The Control of Corruption Indicator measures perceptions of the extent to which
public power is exercised for private gain. The Rule of Law Indicator measures perceptions
on how people believe in and follow the rules of society. For a view of how a select number
of countries perform on these two indicators and TI's CPI index, see Table 1.4.
In August 2013, the Hertie School of Governance released a report titled "Global
Comparative Trend Analysis Report."262 The report, using data from the World Bank's
control of corruption indicator, compares control of corruption scores among eight world
regions between 1996 and 2011. The regions of North America, Western Europe and Oceania
were consistently ranked as the leading regions in controlling corruption. Few countries
showed significant change in their control of corruption scores over the fifteen-year period.

(iii) Freedom House Publications

Freedom House is a US-based watchdog organization committed to promoting democracy
and political and civil liberties globally. It publishes a number of research reports and
publications relating to indicators of good democratic governance. Two major publications
which deal specifically with corruption are Nations in Transit and Countries at the Crossroads.

          (a) Nations in Transit

          Nations in Transit is an annually published report that studies the reforms
          taking place within 29 of the former communist countries of Europe and
          Eurasia. The report covers seven categories relating to democratic change,
          one of which is corruption. Its corruption index reflects "public perceptions
          of corruption, the business interests of top policymakers, laws on financial
          disclosure and conflict of interest, and the efficacy of anti-corruption
          initiatives." 264

          (b) Countries at the Crossroads

          Countries at the Crossroads, published between 2004 and 2012, was an
          annual publication examining government performance in 70 countries at a
          crossroads in determining their political future. Its anti-corruption and
          transparency section included four measurements:

                     (a) environment to protect against corruption (bureaucratic
                           regulations and red tape, state activity in economy, revenue
                           collection, separation of public and private interests, and
                           financial disclosure);

                     (b) anti-corruption framework and enforcement (anti-corruption
                           framework and processes, anti-corruption bodies,
                           prosecution);

                     (c) citizen protections against corruption (media coverage;
                           whistleblower protection; redress for victims, and corruption
                           in education); and

                     (d) governmental transparency (general transparency, legal right
                           to information, budget-making process, expenditure
                           accounting, government procurement, and distribution of
                           foreign assistance).265

support. TRACE Compliance, Inc. offers risk-based due diligence, anti-bribery training and
advisory services to both members and non-members.266 In collaboration with the RAND
Corporation, TRACE International developed the TRACE Matrix, a global business bribery
risk index for compliance professionals, which scores 194 countries in four domains--
business interactions with the government, anti-bribery deterrence and enforcement,
government and civil service transparency, and capacity for civil society oversight.267
Published since 2014, a new edition is released every year.

(v) The World Justice Project Rule of Law Index268

The World Justice Project (WJP) is a US-based independent and multidisciplinary
organization that seeks to advance the rule of law globally. Its overall Rule of Law Index
assesses performance of governments on the basis of 44 indicators organized in eight
categories, including absence of corruption in the executive branch, the judiciary, the
military and police, and the legislature.269 The 2020 edition of the WJP Rule of Law Index,
which covers 128 countries and territories, places Denmark, Norway, Singapore, Sweden,
and Finland on top of the list in the "absence of corruption" category.270

4.2 Limitations Associated with Indexes Based on Perceptions

Although the indexes included above are useful in understanding the prevalence of
corruption around the globe, most do not include objective measures of corruption. There is
little empirical data measuring corruption. Any empirical research that exists is not well-
developed and is generally small in scope. This is because quantifying actual rates of
corruption on a large scale is difficult. Objective measures, such as the number of bribery
prosecutions, are not reliable indicators; a large number of prosecutions may simply reflect
a well-resourced and effective policing system and judiciary rather than a comparatively
high prevalence of bribery. Because of the limitations of objective measurements, TI views
perceptions of public sector corruption as the most reliable method of comparing levels of
corruption across countries.

Despite the convenience and widespread use of perception measurements, indexes such as
TI's CPI have also received significant criticism. There is no guarantee that perceptions of
corruption accurately reflect actual rates, and some commentators suggest that perceptions
of corruption are not well-correlated with reality. The CPI in particular has been criticized
for being western-centric, as it focuses on the perceptions of western business people rather
than local lived experiences with corruption (although TI's Global Corruption Barometer
measures the latter).

Comparing perceptions across countries can also be difficult, as people from different
regions may have different understandings about what constitutes corruption. For example,
some election financing and lobbying activities in Western countries are designed to
influence public officials in subtle, implicit ways--and in that sense, are corrupt--yet these
practices are not legally defined as corruption.271

Perception measurements raise the issue of how corruption is defined. Definitions of
corruption are not universally agreed upon and different definitions may produce differing
results. Some definitions include many types of corruption while others focus primarily on
bribery. The common focus on corruption in public institutions has also been criticized as
being western-centric. Corruption is often portrayed as a trans-cultural disease. However, it
is important to consider the different cultural contexts in which it exists.

The authors of the major indexes generally caution that results are not definitive indicators
of actual corruption and should not be used to allocate development aid or develop country-
specific corruption responses. However, with an understanding of their limitations, these
index measurements can provide important information about corruption trends around the
globe.

For criticism of CPI scores and rankings as "uni-dimensional" or "seen in monochrome," see
Michael Johnston and Scott Fritzen's recent book entitled The Conundrum of Corruption:
Reform for Social Justice.272 For a detailed, multidisciplinary and cross-sectoral examination of
corruption research and practice, see Graycar and Smith's Handbook of Global Research and
Practice in Corruption.273 Chapter 3 (Finn Heinrich and Robin Hodess, "Measuring
Corruption") provides an overview of recent developments and trends in measuring
corruption. Chapter 4 (Francesca Recanatini, "Assessing Corruption at the Country Level")
analyzes an alternative approach to measuring corruption, promoted by practitioners at the
World Bank, that assesses a country's governance structures and institutions from various
perspectives, which are briefly discussed in Section 4.1(ii). For further information, see also

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

4.3 Are Quantitative Estimates of Global Corruption Reliable?

Matthew Stephenson, creator of The Global Anticorruption Blog (GAB), in a May 6, 2021
blog post, states that it has become common place for articles, reports and speeches to open
with frequently cited estimates of the amount of global corruption, "including, for example,
the claim that $1 trillion in bribes are paid each year, the claim that corruption costs the
global economy $2.6 trillion annually [based on an estimate that corruption costs amount to
five percent of global GDP], and the claim that each year 10-25% of government procurement
spending is lost to corruption."275 Where do these estimates come from and are they reliable?

Stephenson and Cecilie Wathne, a former senior director of Measurement and Evaluation at
U4 (a non-profit, multi-disciplinary research institute), prepared a paper entitled
"Credibility of Corruption Statistics: A Critical Review of Ten Global Estimates."276 The
results of their review of ten widely-cited estimates of global corruption, including the three
statistics already mentioned, are disturbing. The paper summarizes some of their main
points as follows:

          We analysed ten global corruption statistics, attempting to trace each back
          to its origin and to assess its credibility and reliability. These statistics
          concern the amount of bribes paid worldwide, the amount of public funds
          stolen/embezzled, the costs of corruption to the global economy, and the
          percentage of development aid lost to corruption, among other things.

          Of the ten statistics we assessed, none could be classified as credible, and
          only two came close to credibility. Six of the ten statistics are problematic,
          and the other four appear to be entirely unfounded.

          The widespread citation of unreliable statistics undermines efforts to
          understand the nature of the corruption problem. Organisations calling for
          evidence-based anti- corruption strategies should be more careful about the
          quality of the evidence that they present.

          To improve the use of corruption statistics, organisations should trace them
          to their original source; read the original source carefully; distinguish
          between claims of individual authors and of their institutions; use
          qualifying language to avoid imputing undue certainty and precision to
          gross estimates; and focus on evidence of significant effects or associations
          rather than statistics that merely sound impressive.277

The ten commonly used estimates of global corruption and the authors' conclusions on each
are summarized in Table 1 of their paper. The most widely cited estimate is probably $2.6

trillion/5% of GDP. According to the authors, this estimate appears to have no basis
whatsoever and may have been based on a misreading of a problematic analysis on a
different matter. "No organization or advocate should cite this statistic under any
circumstances."278 The 5% figure is sometimes cited as a range between 2 to 5% of GDP.
While still unreliable, the 2 to 5 % range at least makes the point that we do not really know,
very precisely, how much corruption there actually is. The lack of knowledge results in the
creation of a very wide range for the estimates. The highest estimate of corruption (5% of
GDP) produces a figure of $2.6 trillion, whereas if the lowest estimate of corruption is used
(2% of GDP) it produces a figure of $1 trillion. There is obviously a huge difference between
corruption which amounts to $1 trillion and corruption which amounts to $2.6 trillion. The
bottom line is that having "precise" estimates of the total amount of corruption may be very
useful for advocates or policymakers to use to reinforce their point that "there is a lot of
global corruption," but these estimates should be recognized for what they really are--
unproven and often widely exaggerated.

5. MEASURING AND UNDERSTANDING CORRUPTION

Svensson has reviewed literature and data on eight topics involved in understanding
corruption.279 For non-economists and non-statisticians, the data and analysis in Svensson's
article are sometimes dense. What follows is a brief summary of parts of Svensson's review.
Although based on available data as of 2005, more recent data does not significantly alter
the main observations in the article.

Svensson notes that the most common definition of public corruption is the misuse of public
office for private gain. He also notes that no "definition of corruption is completely clear-
cut."280 The data in his article focuses on public corruption.

5.1 Common Characteristics of Countries with High Corruption

Based on the corruption ranking results, Svensson states:

          All of the countries with the highest levels of corruption are developing or
          transition countries. Strikingly, many are governed, or have recently been
          governed, by socialist governments. With few exceptions, the most corrupt
          countries have low income levels. Of the countries assigned an openness
          score by Sachs and Warner (1995), all of the most corrupt economies are
          considered closed economies, except Indonesia. [footnotes omitted]281

Svensson's analysis also shows that richer countries generally have lower corruption.
However, corruption levels vary widely across countries, even controlling for income. For
example, he notes that Argentina, Russia, and Venezuela are ranked as relatively corrupt

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

given their level of income. On the other hand, rankings of countries in sub-Saharan Africa
often match the expected levels of corruption given their GDP. Svensson notes that levels of
income are a stronger predictor of levels of corruption when combined with levels of
schooling, forms of governance, and freedom of the press.

On the other hand, Susan Rose-Ackerman and Bonnie Palifka argue that states emerging
from conflict are especially susceptible to corruption, making reconstruction challenging.282
Rose-Ackerman and Palifka observe that these post conflict states have many of the factors
that create incentive to engage in corruption: widespread destruction, weak controls, lack of
trust in law enforcement, poverty, and a poorly functioning judiciary.283

5.2 Will Higher Wages for Bureaucrats Reduce Corruption?

Svensson then reviews empirical research on the impact of certain corruption control
measures on actual corruption levels. First, Svensson looks at the relationship between
higher wages for public servants and corruption and concludes that:

          wage incentives can reduce bribery, but only under certain conditions. This
          strategy requires a well-functioning enforcement apparatus; the bribe being
          offered (or demanded) must not be a function of the official's wage; and the
          cost of paying higher wages must not be too high. In many poor developing
          countries where corruption is institutionalized, these requirements appear
          unlikely to hold.284

5.3 Can Competition Reduce Corruption?

Svensson also analyzes data related to the relationship between competition and corruption:

          Another common approach to control corruption is to increase competition
          among firms. One argument is that as firms' profits are driven down by
          competitive pressure, there are no excess profits from which to pay bribes
          (Ades and Di Tella, 1999). In reality, however, the connections between
          competition, profits and corruption are complex and not always analytically
          clear.285

For further discussion of this point, see Alison Taylor's article "Does Competition Cause
Corruption."286

According to Svensson, some evidence shows that deregulation does not reduce corruption
by increasing competition, but rather by reducing the discretion and power of public
officials. Svensson concludes:

          A variety of evidence suggests that increased competition, due to
          deregulation and simplification of rules and laws, is negatively correlated
          with corruption. But it can be a difficult task to strike the right balance
          between enacting and designing beneficial rules and laws to constrain
          private misconduct while also limiting the possibilities that such laws open
          the door for public corruption (Djankov, Glaeser, La Porta, Lopez-de-
          Silanes and Shleifer, 2003).287

5.4 Attempts to Fight Corruption

Svensson notes that many anti-corruption programs provide resources to existing
enforcement institutions. Often, these institutions are corrupt themselves. Svensson states
that, "[t]o date, little evidence exists that devoting additional resources to the existing legal
and financial government monitoring institutions will reduce corruption."288 Although
Hong Kong and Singapore are considered exceptions, both countries also implemented
other wide-ranging reforms in their anti-corruption efforts.

Svensson then lists some alternative approaches to combating corruption, such as turning to
private or citizen enforcement, providing citizens with access to information and delegating
work to private firms. The issue of designing more effective anti-corruption institutions and
practices is further addressed in Section 9.

Michael Johnston and Scott Fritzen provide a detailed, thoughtful analysis to the question
of "why have we made such little progress in the fight against corruption in spite of the
significant resources poured into the fight over the past 30 years?"289 The authors first review
the anti-corruption approaches and developments over the past 30-year period, indicating
how most of these plans, strategies, and actions are based on questionable assumptions
about the real facilitators of corruption. Consequently, the existing anti-corruption activities
focus on the wrong end of the corruption problem. The authors go on to identify the all-
encompassing power imbalances existing in the economic, political, and social systems in

286 Alison Taylor argues that a competitive corporate atmosphere encourages corrupt conduct.
According to Taylor, the promotion of a "narrative of intense rivalry and urgency" is "an integral
part of a corrupt [corporate] culture." Taylor explains that "employees need to be socialized into
paying bribes and encouraged to believe that corruption is an inevitable and necessary response to
the hard commercial realities." See Alison Taylor, "Does Competition Cause Corruption?" (22 June
2015), online (blog): The FCPA Blog <http://www.fcpablog.com/blog/2015/6/22/alison-taylor-does-
competition-cause-corruption.html>.

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

virtually all countries as the most significant enabler, driver, and sustainer of widespread
corruption. Reforms that don't address this power imbalance are likely to have little or no
effect on the continued occurrence of corruption. Finally, the authors spend the last three
chapters of their book discussing the types of reforms needed to fight corruption.290

6. HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF INTERNATIONAL LAWS

6.1 From Antiquity to the OECD Convention

Tim Martin's 1999 article, "The Development of International Bribery Law," (portions
excerpted below) details the development of anti-bribery laws in the west up to the 1997
signing of the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in
International Business Transactions (OECD Convention).291 The OECD Convention was
ratified by Canada in December 1998 and came into force in February 1999. The OECD
Convention paved the way for further international actions to combat corruption, including
the more expansive United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC), which
entered into force in 2005.

                                                            BEGINNING OF EXCERPT

 Corruption [as we know it] was not a problem at the beginning of history. Rather than
 use bribes, people made "offerings" to their gods and leaders in the hope of receiving
 favors. In a sense, such reciprocities provided a social glue that allowed cultures and
 civilizations to develop. But with civilization came religious and civil institutions that
 needed rules of fairness and good governance to ensure the loyalty and trust of the
 populace. Kings and pharaohs had to demonstrate that the rule of law was above the
 influence of greasy palms. Thus, began the distinction between gifts and bribes.

 After presenting the Ten Commandments to Moses on Mount Sinai, God instructed the
 Israelites not to take shohadh, which is loosely translated from Hebrew as "offering."

            You shall not take shohadh, which makes the clear-eyed blind and the
            words of the just crooked. (Exodus 23:1-3, 6-8)

 Given that the Old Testament was breaking new ground, it was only natural that this
 distinction started a bit ambiguously. However, even after several millennia of lawyers
 trying to define bribery, a certain amount of haze shrouds the issue.

 There are records of bribes and bribery laws from ancient times. Archaeologists have
 recently found an Assyrian archive which is 3400 years old that listed the names of

 "employees accepting bribes." An Egyptian pharaoh, Horemheb (1342-1314 BC), issued
 the first recorded law of a secular penalty for bribetaking. The Edict of Horemheb
 proclaimed that any judge who took a reward from one litigant and failed to hear the
 adversary was guilty of a "crime against justice" and subject to capital punishment. His
 threat apparently did not stop the practice of bribing the judiciary from spreading beyond
 Egypt.

 The Greek historian Pausanius relates that before beginning each Olympic Games, all the
 umpires, athletes, their relatives and trainers swore over boars' flesh that they would
 uphold Olympic rules intended to prevent corrupt activity. Similar to present times, not
 everyone played by the rules. Pausanius recorded in his Description of Greece (5.21.5) that
 Calippus of Athens bought off fellow competitors with bribes, as did many other
 contestants. This practice continued unabated until the Roman Emperor Theodosius
 eventually abolished the Olympic Games in 394 AD because of rampant corruption and
 brutality.

 ...

 People's view of corruption has evolved and become more negative as the institutions of
 government have developed. Instead of being ambivalent about the giving of gifts to
 officials in a position of public trust, modern society has enacted and prosecuted laws that
 make such payments illegal. Over time, a bribe has come to mean "an inducement
 improperly influencing the performance of a public function meant to be gratuitously
 exercised." (For an illuminating history of bribes, please refer to J. T. Noonan, BRIBES
 (1984).) [See also Douglas Thompson's LLM thesis.292] Even though it is usually opposed
 on moral grounds, bribery has become a legal concept analyzed and prosecuted by
 lawyers. Thus in understanding how the world has grappled with corruption, one must
 consider the history of bribery laws.

 For King and Country (And a little bit for me, too)

 Francis Bacon was one of the most brilliant lawyers, judges, and philosophers in English
 history. He was also one of its most corrupt Lord Chancellors. Bacon was first Solicitor
 General, then Attorney General, and finally, in 1618, Lord Chancellor. Even though he
 was an extremely capable jurist who honestly and fairly dispensed justice, he was too
 detached and philosophical to take notice of the bribes flowing to his servants who used
 his good office to benefit themselves. Caught up in the byzantine politics of the court of
 King James I, Bacon was accused of accepting bribes to affect cases in the Court of
 Chancery. His enemies in Parliament impeached him with twenty-three charges of

292 [Douglas Thompson's University of Victoria LLM thesis, A Merry Chase Around the Gift/Bribe
Boundary (2008), written under the co-supervision of Gerry Ferguson, explains how the English
word "bribe," which originally had the altruistic meaning of a morsel of bread given as alms to
beggars, became associated with the distasteful practice of selling indulgences in medieval England.
That practice, carried out by pardoners licensed by the Church, was soon seen as a type of theft or
extortion inflicted on those who felt compelled to buy indulgences to reduce the time spent in
Purgatory by their deceased loved ones. With the abolition of the selling of indulgences at the time of
the Reformation (1538), the word bribe took on its modern meaning.]

 bribery and corruption. Bacon first replied with a qualified admission of guilt. The House
 immediately rejected his submission, whereupon Bacon caved in: "I do plainly and
 ingenuously confess that I am guilty of corruption, and do renounce all defence."

 Sir John Trevor was probably the most corrupt Speaker in the history of Parliament. The
 East India Company was rumored to have bribed him to exert influence over laws
 affecting it. He also apparently accepted a large payment from the City of London
 Corporation. Indeed, a House Committee investigation discovered a written record of the
 City's instructions and an endorsement of the payment to Trevor. The Members of
 Parliament drew up a resolution in 1694 which convicted the Speaker of a "high crime
 and misdemeanour." Ironically, it was the responsibility of Sir John, as the Commons
 Speaker, to put the motion to the House, which he did in a shameless way. The motion
 was overwhelmingly acclaimed and Sir John slunk out of the House of Parliament. He
 did not return but rather sent a sicknote to the House who responded by expelling the
 Speaker. (These and other stories can be found in Matthew Parris, GREAT PARLIAMENTARY
 SCANDALS (1995).)

 The English common law first dealt with foreign bribery in the trial of Warren Hastings
 who went to India at eighteen as a clerk of the East India Company and quickly rose
 through the ranks until he was appointed the British Governor of Bengal in 1772. During
 his tenure as Governor, he amassed a great fortune that could not be accounted for by his
 salary alone. Edmund Burke, a member of the House of Commons, accused the Company
 of great abuses in India and gradually those accusations focused on Hastings, who
 allegedly received large bribes while Governor. As a result of his investigations, Burke
 and his fellow Parliamentarians drafted Articles of Impeachment against Hastings that
 asserted various abuses of authority constituting "high crimes and misdemeanours"
 including "Corruption, Peculation and Extortion." After winning the support of the
 House of Commons, the impeachment trial of Hastings commenced in the House of Lords
 in 1787. See Peter J. Marshall, THE IMPEACHMENT OF WARREN HASTINGS (1965).

 The leading case of the time (1725) concerned Thomas Earl of Macclesfield, a Lord
 Chancellor who was accused of selling jobs in Chancery. In that case, the House of Lords
 held that the sale of an office which related "to the administrations of justice" was not an
 offense at common law. This was reflected in the definition of bribery provided by
 Blackstone in his COMMENTARIES ON THE LAWS OF ENGLAND of 1765. A bribe was a crime
 committed by "a judge or other person concerned in the administration of justice." The
 definition was thus restricted to acts involving a judicial decree or its execution. By 1769
 the law had expanded to make the offering of money for a government office a crime. In
 this environment, Hastings launched his defence which consisted of showing that he had
 not offered any money himself as bribes and that any presents he had received were not
 for himself but for the Company. To be on the safe side, he also launched personal attacks
 on Burke throughout the trial. Hastings' strategy was successful and resulted in the Lords
 deciding on April 23, 1795, after seven years of deliberation that he was not guilty. It
 would take another 180 years before anyone would again try to prosecute an act of foreign
 bribery. However, the next attempt would be in America rather than England.

New Law in the New World

America has a long tradition of being concerned about corruption. Public offices have
been bought, judges were monetarily influenced, and the nation's infrastructure was
sometimes built on the back of bribes. But America is a country where government is
expected to be for the benefit of the people. Public officials and their decisions were not
to be bought and sold by a few wealthy individuals or corporations. Bribes were seen as
immoral and against the founding principles of the United States of America. Something
had to be done about corruption and lawmakers were more than willing to fill the breach.
A multitude of approaches was thus pursued to address the problem.

The U.S. Founding Fathers clearly had corruption on their minds when they drafted the
Constitution. Their first concern was Executive Branch corruption but they expanded the
concept to include the Judiciary. The mechanism they built into the Constitution to
remedy this problem was impeachment. The Constitutional Convention of 1787 first
specified that the grounds for impeachment would be "Treason, Bribery, or Corruption."
They later dropped "Corruption" as superfluous but added "other high crimes and
misdemeanours" using the language from the Hastings trial in Parliament. This
amendment supposedly provided Congress sufficient flexibility in the future to prosecute
corrupt judges and Presidents. Unfortunately, the Constitution did not provide that
Congressional members were subject to impeachment based upon the argument of James
Madison that it was harder to corrupt a multitude than an individual. How wrong he
proved to be! Bribing Congressmen became a national pastime. Eventually, Congress
passed An Act to Prevent Frauds upon the Treasury of the United States in 1853 which
made it illegal to bribe a member of Congress. It was not used much (possibly because of
its misleading title). Indeed, during the first 150 years of the American Republic, no high
ranking government leader was convicted for bribery. The Teapot Dome Scandal in the
1920s changed this complacency.

...

Throughout this period [1770s-1970s], all of the industrialized countries and most of the
developing world had their own laws which made the bribery of public officials illegal.
England had the Public Bodies Corrupt Act of 1889 and the Prevention of Corruption Acts
of 1906 and 1916. Countries such as Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, the
Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland had prohibited the bribery of public officials under
their respective Criminal Codes for many years. Some, such as France, as early as 1810.
But similar to the United States, all these laws addressed the bribery of domestic officials,
i.e., judges, politicians, and government officials within the country's boundaries. No one
ever contemplated looking beyond their own borders. All that changed as a result of some
unrelated but extraordinary events investigated by several committees of the U.S. Senate.

A Leap into Foreign Waters

In 1972 the Democratic National Committee headquarters located at the Watergate
complex in Washington, D. C., was burglarized. The Senate formed a select committee the
next year to investigate the burglary and found that many U.S. corporations had made

                                                                                                          85
GLOBAL CORRUPTION

 illegal contributions to Richard Nixon's Committee to Re-Elect the President. The result
 was that fifteen prominent corporations pleaded guilty to making illegal campaign
 contributions and were fined. One of the corporations, Gulf Oil, provided an amazing
 report to the Senate committee that detailed an elaborate overseas network to siphon
 political bribes back to the States and to other countries. Gulf had apparently distributed
 more than $5 million to influential politicians from overseas bank accounts over the years.
 See THE GREAT OIL SPILL (1976).

 [The Watergate Inquiry led to several other Senate Inquiries, which revealed widespread
 foreign corruption and that no law specifically prohibited American persons or
 corporations from paying a bribe overseas. One of the biggest foreign bribery schemes
 involved a Lockheed Aircraft Corporation CEO.]

 ...

 As it turned out, Lockheed had been engaged in a massive program of overseas bribes to
 government officials who bought their planes.... The Senate Banking Committee ... found
 that Lockheed had paid hundreds of millions of dollars through consultants to
 government officials in Saudi Arabia, Japan, Italy, and the Netherlands. When asked if he
 had paid a one million dollar bribe to Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands, the president
 of Lockheed, A. Carl Kotchian, replied:

            I think, sir, that as my understanding of a bribe is a quid pro quo for a
            specific item in return. I would characterize this more as a gift. But I don't
            want to quibble with you, sir.

 It appeared that even a sophisticated jet-setting business executive was unable to
 distinguish a gift from a bribe.

 ...

 To the great chagrin of the Committee, no specific law explicitly prohibited an American
 from paying a bribe overseas. Something had to be done to prevent the abuses perpetrated
 by Lockheed, Gulf Oil, and others so inclined. Senator Proxmire's Committee thus
 recommended that a new law be enacted to prevent overseas bribery based on their
 reasoning that (1) foreign governments friendly to the United States had come under
 "intense pressure from their own people," (2) the "image of American Democracy" had
 been "tarnished," (3) confidence in the financial integrity of American corporations had
 been impaired, and (4) the efficient functioning of capital markets had been hampered.

 After very little debate in either the House or Senate, both Houses unanimously approved
 the Committee's bill on December 7, 1977, and President Carter subsequently signed it
 into law on December 19, 1977. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) was thus born.
 This law was the first of its kind in the world. A new era of global bribery prevention had
 begun. The United States, like no other country before it, had decided to make the
 payment of bribes to foreign officials illegal and imposed rigorous record keeping
 requirements on U.S. companies and their overseas subsidiaries to ensure that bribes

could not be hidden. However, when the dust settled and the United States surveyed the
global landscape, it found itself standing alone.

All For One and One For All

American companies immediately recognized that they were at a disadvantage to their
foreign competitors. They would thereafter constantly claim that they lost overseas
contracts because they could not pay the bribes that foreign companies allegedly did.
(This view has been reinforced in some recent studies. See U.S. Department of Commerce,
UNCLASSIFIED SUMMARY OF FOREIGN COMPETITIVE PRACTICES REPORT (Oct. 12, 1995); James
R. Hines, Jr., FORBIDDEN PAYMENT: FOREIGN BRIBERY AND AMERICAN BUSINESS AFTER 1977
(Nat'l Bureau of Econ. Res. Working Paper No. 5266, 1995). The American government
believed that its companies were competing on an unlevel playing field and therefore
began seeking multilateral co-operation on global bribery.

...

Having failed at the United Nations, the U.S. moved to another forum, the Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). The American government lobbied
the OECD in 1981 to implement an illicit payments agreement. However, several
countries expressed the view that differences among their legal systems would make such
an agreement difficult to implement. Another attempt was made at the insistence of
Congress when they amended the FCPA in 1988. Nothing resulted from either of these
efforts. See U.S. Department of State, ILLICIT PAYMENTS: PAST AND PRESENT U.S.
INITIATIVES.

The multilateral approach of the U.S. government was shelved at that point.... [But] ...
the Clinton administration had decided in late 1993 to renew a multilateral effort. Since
the Cold War had ended, the U.S. focused its attention on global economics and the
problem of foreign bribes was given high priority in this new war. The American
government carefully considered the supply and demand sides of the corruption equation
in forging its strategy. It primarily focused on the supply side (or active part of bribery)
and the multilateral organization that received most of its attention was the OECD.

The OECD Convention

In May 1994, a majority of the OECD countries agreed upon a suite of recommendations
entitled OECD RECOMMENDATIONS ON BRIBERY IN INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
TRANSACTIONS. However, it was not binding and was well below the objectives set by the
United States. No specific measures were recommended; rather, it offered a broad list of
"meaningful steps." Subsequently, after intensive lobbying by the United States and after
overcoming the resistance of some European countries (especially France), the OECD
Council on April 11, 1996, approved a recommendation to eliminate the tax deductibility
of bribes among its member states. At the next OECD meeting in May 1997, the American
government pushed for a resolution committing governments to outlaw foreign bribery
in their domestic legislation by the end of 1998 and to establish a monitoring system to
ensure that it was being enforced. In opposition, France and Germany, with the support

                                                                                                          87

of Japan and Spain, maintained that "you need an international convention for
criminalizing corruption, because the legal framework in each country is different. The
U.S. and its supporters viewed this as a stalling tactic since such treaties take many years
to negotiate and ratify.

After much negotiation [in 1997], a compromise was struck. The ministers endorsed the
REVISED RECOMMENDATION ON COMBATTING BRIBERY IN INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
TRANSACTIONS. They recommended that member countries would submit criminalization
proposals to their legislative bodies by April 1, 1998, and seek their enactment by the end
of 1998. The ministers also decided to open negotiations promptly on a convention to be
completed by the end of 1997, with a view to its entry into force as soon as possible within
1998, and urged the prompt implementation of the 1996 recommendation on the tax
deductibility of such bribes.

After six months of intensive discussions, all twenty-nine member countries of the OECD
and five non-member countries agreed to sign the CONVENTION ON COMBATTING BRIBERY
OF FOREIGN PUBLIC OFFICIALS IN INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS (the OECD
Convention) in Paris on December 17, 1997, reprinted at 37 I.L.M. 1 (1998). This Convention
provided the framework under which all the signatory governments undertook to
prohibit and act against the bribery of foreign public officials on an equivalent basis
without requiring uniformity or changes in the fundamental principles of each
government's legal system. The OECD Convention entered into force on the 60th day
following the date upon which 5 of the 10 countries with the largest shares of OECD
exports, representing at least 60% of the combined total exports of those 10 countries,
deposited their instruments of acceptance, approval, or ratification. Such ratification had
to occur by December 31, 1998, to be binding upon all signatory countries. Canada's
deposit of its instrument on December 17, 1998, met the pass mark and resulted in the
OECD Convention's entering into force on February 15, 1999.... [As of August 1, 2021
there are 44 signatories to the Convention, 38 of which are OECD members and six are
non-members.]

The Convention has a clearly defined scope. It provides that each government "shall
establish that it is a criminal offence under its law for any person intentionally to offer,
promise or give any undue pecuniary or other advantage, whether directly or through
intermediaries to a foreign public official, for that official or for a third party, in order that
the official act or refrain from acting in relation to the performance of official duties, in
order to obtain or retain business or other improper advantage in the conduct of
international business." The Convention makes it an offence for nationals of signatory
countries to give a bribe to a foreign public official. In other words, it is directed against
offences committed by the bribegiver and not the public official receiving the bribe.

...

[Between 1990 and 2006] the United States has mounted a massive global campaign in
every conceivable multilateral organization in the world [e.g. World Bank, International
Monetary Fund and Foreign Multilateral Government Associations].... A lot of this
campaign is motivated by self-interest, but there is also a genuine desire to make the

 world a better place to do business. The U.S. government has relentlessly pursued the
 simple goal of having other countries' multinationals play by the same rules applicable to
 U.S. companies. Its strategy is clearly laid out in the 1996 Annual Report to Congress of
 the Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee....

 There is a dawning realization that bribes eliminate competition, create inefficiencies, and
 ultimately cost countries and their consumers money.

6.2 Meaning and Effect of International Conventions

In Handbook of Global Research and Practice in Corruption, Graycar and Smith note some
reasons why corruption has increasingly been seen as a significant global concern:

          International trade has been a feature of human behavior for millennia. But
          in recent centuries new transport mechanisms and new technologies have
          made for economic interdependence. Compounded by digital technologies
          which move money around the world at the speed of light, and global
          business moguls who seek advantage opportunistically and capriciously,
          corruption takes on a new dimension. Political instability has also taken on
          a cross-national dimension, and it is often fuelled by, and in turn fuels
          corruption.293

In international law, a convention (or treaty) is a statement of principles, rules and
procedures on a specific topic which is adopted by international bodies such as the United
Nations. The adoption of a convention by the UN does not automatically bind all UN
members to comply with the convention. At the time a convention is adopted, a number of
countries will sign (become signatories) to the convention. By becoming signatories, those
countries indicate their general agreement with the principles and purposes of the
convention. However, countries are only bound by a convention or treaty by ratifying it.
Ratification signals that a country has laws and practices in place that are in compliance with
the convention and that the country is ready to be bound by the treaty under international
law. Once ratified, the particular state becomes a "Party" or "State Party" to the convention.

In countries such as England, Canada, and Australia, ratification is a power exercised by the
Executive (i.e., the elected government and, more specifically, the cabinet). Parliamentary
approval is not required, although all treaties and conventions are tabled in Parliament
before ratification by Canada. In the US, ratification takes place through the combined
actions of the Executive and a two-thirds vote of the Senate.

Some conventions have protocols. A protocol is an addition or a supplement to an existing
convention. State Parties are not automatically required to adopt protocols and for that
reason protocols are often referred to as "optional protocols." For example, in the case of the

293 Graycar & Smith, supra note 273 at 3.

                                                                                                            89
GLOBAL CORRUPTION

OECD Convention (discussed in Section 6.3.2), there have been three subsequent
instruments, called "Recommendations," which are also optional.

If states disagree on the interpretation of a convention or treaty provision, the dispute can
be referred to an international tribunal or arbiter for resolution. Conventions and treaties
frequently have specific provisions allowing countries to withdraw from (or denounce) the
convention (e.g., Article 70 of UNCAC and Article 17 of the OECD Convention).

On the topic of enforcement of conventions and treaties, Canada's Approach to Treaty Making,
a publication from Canada's Library of Parliament, states:

          Compliance with and the enforceability of international treaties is a broad
          topic that cannot be dealt with in any comprehensive manner in a few
          paragraphs. Ultimately, there are multiple forms of international treaties,
          multiple levels of enforceability, and multiple mechanisms for enforcement.
          Various bodies are available to assist with the enforcement of international
          treaties and conventions at the international and regional levels. For
          example, trade treaties may be subject to enforcement under the NAFTA or
          through the World Trade Organization, which have various levels of
          tribunals to ensure compliance with their standards. Other trade treaties are
          subject to enforcement by arbitral tribunals that can impose financial
          penalties on parties to the agreement. By contrast, human rights treaties are
          often subject to some form of oversight through the United Nations treaty
          bodies. The Concluding Observations issued with respect to country
          compliance under these UN treaty bodies are not legally binding, but they
          do carry significant moral suasion. Breaches of humanitarian law, such as
          war crimes and crimes against humanity, are dealt with by the International
          Criminal Court, which has the power to sentence individuals to
          imprisonment. The International Court of Justice is also charged with
          settling legal disputes submitted to it by states in accordance with
          international law generally, and with giving advisory opinions on legal
          questions referred to it by UN organs and specialized agencies. [footnotes
          omitted]294

On a practical level, enforcement of conventions such as UNCAC and the OECD Convention
is dependent on the implementation monitoring process which the State Parties have agreed
to in each Convention.295

295 Monitoring and compliance are challenging tasks in relation to international conventions. Fletcher
and Hermann describe the difficulty of enforcement, supra note 36 at 73: "[t]heoretically, when a
treaty comes into existence, ratifying states are legally bound to comply with it.... As we have seen,
however, in the contemporary international system there is no single political authority above the
state. In practical terms, therefore, states cannot be forced to comply." Fletcher and Hermann also
point out that monitoring without infringing on state sovereignty is problematic, while compliance
with UNCAC and the OECD Convention is further jeopardized by the challenges of pursuing

6.3 International Instruments

Philippa Webb, in "The United Nations Convention Against Corruption," describes the
major international anti-corruption instruments developed between 1997 and the enactment
of UNCAC.296 The brief summaries below of the major international instruments developed
between 1996 and 2005 are largely derived from Webb's article.

6.3.1  The Organization of American States Inter-American Convention
       Against Corruption (1996)

The Organization of American States Inter-American Convention Against Corruption (OAS
Convention) was signed by 22 countries in 1996, including the US. Canada signed the
convention in 1999 and as of August 1, 2021, 34 countries have ratified and deposited the
Convention. The OAS Convention was the first binding international instrument on
corruption. Venezuela led the group of Latin-American countries that lobbied for its
creation. The United States was also a strong supporter of the Convention. The OAS
Convention has a broader scope than the OECD Convention. Besides criminalizing the
bribery of foreign officials, the OAS Convention requires that signatory states also
criminalize the acceptance or solicitation of bribes. It therefore addresses both active bribery
(the giving of a bribe) as well as passive bribery (the receiving of a bribe). Since the OAS
Convention prohibits any bribe paid in relation to "any act or omission in the performance
of that official's public function" (Article VIII, OAS Convention), it is broader than the
equivalent OECD Convention provision, which only criminalizes bribery when it relates to
a business transaction or contract. In addition, the OAS Convention encourages signatory
states to criminalize other acts of corruption not strictly covered under anti-bribery laws,
such as the misuse of confidential information by public officials.

As Philippa Webb notes, the OAS Convention's greatest weakness is its lack of a strong
enforcement mechanism. In 2001 the Conference of State Parties established a peer review
system to monitor implementation of the Convention. Under this system a Committee of
Experts selects a state for review and then prepares a preliminary report on that country's
implementation of the Convention. This report is then made available for review by the
subject state. The final report is then submitted to the Conference of States Parties and
published. The Committee of Experts can only make recommendations for improvements
and cannot recommend sanctions for states who fail to meet their international obligations
under the Convention.

complex and expensive corruption cases within states. Further, as seen in the BAE case (described in
more detail at Section 10), compliance with UNCAC and the OECD Convention also depends on
political will in each ratifying state. For Rose-Ackerman and Palifka's analysis of feasible options
available to international bodies in fighting corruption see Chapter 14 of Rose-Ackerman & Palifka,
supra note 273.

    6.3.2  OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in
           International Business Transactions (1997)

As discussed in the excerpt from Martin's article, "The Development of International Bribery
Law," the OECD Convention was a key development in the international fight against
corruption. The Convention has now been ratified by 38 OECD member states and six non-
member countries (Argentina, Brazil, Bulgaria, Peru, Russia, and South Africa).297 While the
OECD Convention initially seemed to come with a more rigorous review process than the
OAS Convention, Webb writes that the monitoring mechanism had "mixed results."298
Implementation of the OECD Convention is monitored by the OECD Working Group on
Bribery, which uses a multi-phase peer-review system to evaluate and report on State
Parties' implementation of the Convention. The review system has worked slowly at times
and has not always been well-funded. In many countries the introduction of new anti-
corruption legislation has not had a significant impact domestically. Webb concludes that
"[d]espite its focused scope, widespread ratification, and well developed monitory system,
it [the OECD Convention] is yet to produce significant changes on the ground."299 Some
other commentators have a more positive view of the impacts of the OECD Convention. In
my view, the OECD Convention's review system has prompted more government attention
(and funding) for anti-corruption activities and, at least for Canada and the UK, has
prompted some legislative and practice improvements. For example, in Canada, new federal
money was directed towards enforcement of the Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act
(CFPOA) and amendments were made to the Act due to criticisms and suggestions from the
OECD review. Pressure for creation of the new UK Bribery Act, 2010 arose from many
sources including the OECD review.

In accordance with Article 12 of the OECD Convention, a detailed monitoring program of
each State Party is done under a framework developed and conducted by its Working Group
on Bribery (see the 2009 Recommendation of the Council for Further Combating Bribery of Foreign
Public Officials, Recommendations XIV and XV). The Working Group's Evaluation and
Monitoring Reports for each country can be viewed on their website.300 Once the
enforcement recommendations set out in the Country Evaluation Report are made public
that country is under political and moral pressure to comply with the recommendations. A
detailed review of the activities of the OECD Working Group on Bribery can be found in

      6.3.3 Council of Europe's Criminal and Civil Law Conventions (1999)

(i) Council of Europe's Criminal Law Convention on Corruption

This multilateral instrument--COE Criminal Law Convention on Corruption (COE
Criminal Law Convention)--was adopted by the Council of Europe (COE) in 1999. The COE
is a political organization composed of 47 European nations, including many from Central
and Eastern Europe. The COE Criminal Law Convention may also be adopted by non-
European states. Indeed, both Mexico and the United States are signatories to the
Convention. The Convention applies to private sector and public sector bribery. The
Convention requires that member states prohibit active and passive bribery, but does not
require that signatory states criminalize other forms of corruption. The COE Criminal Law
Convention also provides support mechanisms for parties fighting corruption, such as the
requirement that signatory countries protect informants. In addition, although the
facilitation of the tracing and seizing of assets is addressed, the Convention does not deal
with the return of stolen assets exported out of the country of origin.

(ii) Council of Europe's Civil Law Convention on Corruption

The COE Civil Law Convention on Corruption (COE Civil Law Convention) is the first
international instrument to address civil law legal remedies for those affected by corruption.
Like the COE Criminal Law Convention, the COE Civil Law Convention may also be
adopted by non-COE member states. As of May 2013, 33 states had ratified the Convention.
The COE Civil Law Convention focuses on the act of bribery and requires that signatory
states provide domestic legal avenues for victims of corruption to recover damages against
those who participated in acts of corruption, as well as those who failed to take reasonable
care to prevent corruption. The COE Civil Law Convention addresses the protection of
whistleblowers and allows courts to declare a contract invalid if its validity was
"undermined by an act of corruption" (Article 8). Although civil law mechanisms may allow
victims of corruption to participate in the enforcement of anti-corruption laws on their own
initiative, Webb notes that there are several disadvantages with addressing corruption
through civil law means. Civil enforcement of anti-corruption laws could lead to a reduced
ability of government agencies to control the overall anti-corruption strategy. As well, many
victims of corruption may not have the means to take a civil claim to court.

(iii) Group of States against Corruption

The Group of States against Corruption (GRECO) is a monitoring organization that was
established in 1999 by the Council of Europe. It monitors compliance with the Council of
Europe's anti-corruption standards. All states that are party to either the Criminal or Civil
Law Conventions on Corruption are subject to GRECO's compliance monitoring. As of
August 2021, GRECO includes 48 European States, as well as the US and Kazakhstan.

A team of experts nominated by GRECO members evaluates State Parties' implementation
of the Council of Europe's anti-corruption conventions. Each evaluation round assesses
member states on a different corruption subtopic. First, member states are evaluated and
recommendations are issued on how the state could improve its compliance. Next, a
compliance report that evaluates how well the country complied with the recommendations
of the earlier evaluation report is completed. All evaluation and compliance reports are
made public and are available on GRECO's website.302

    6.3.4  Convention of the European Union on the Fight Against Corruption
           Involving Officials of the European Communities or Officials of Member
           States (1997)

The Convention of the European Union on the Fight Against Corruption Involving Officials
of the European Communities or Officials of Member States (EU Convention) builds on the
1995 Convention on the Protection of the European Communities Financial Interests and the
1996 and 1997 Protocols. The EU Convention is focused on addressing bribery of officials. It
is limited to acts that are harmful to the EU's economic interests and only addresses
corruption occurring within EU member nations. Following the EU Convention, the EU
addressed private sector corruption in the 1998 EU Joint Action Act. The 2003
Communication on a Comprehensive EU Policy against Corruption encouraged member
states to act on their multilateral anti-corruption obligations; however, it was drafted in non-
binding language.

    6.3.5 African Union Convention on Preventing and Combating Corruption (2003)

The African Union Convention on Preventing and Combating Corruption (AU Convention)
is a broadly conceived, regional anti-corruption agreement. It was adopted in 2003,
potentially covering 55 states. It required 15 states to ratify before coming into force and this

was achieved in 2006. As of June 18, 2020, 49 states were signatories and 44 states had ratified
and deposited the Convention.304 While the AU Convention is very comprehensive and is
generally phrased in mandatory language, its enforcement mechanism relies on self-
reporting. State Parties are required to report on their implementation of the AU Convention
to an Advisory Board elected by the Executive Council. However, there is no obligation on
the part of the Advisory Board to check the veracity of the country reports. Webb states that
the lack of follow-up mechanisms to monitor enforcement may allow State Parties to avoid
fully implementing the Convention. However, Indira Carr takes a more optimistic view of
the AU Convention. She states that the "AU Convention is progressing in the right direction
and with more harmonisation on the way through international and inter-regional
agreements on various strengthening measures, such as codes of conduct for public officials
and protection of informants, the war [against corruption] should ease in intensity."305

      6.3.6 United Nations Convention Against Corruption (2003)

The United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC) was adopted by the General
Assembly in December 2003 and came into force in 2005 (with 140 state signatories). As of
August 11, 2021, 188 states are parties to UNCAC.306 For a comprehensive overview of the
articles of UNCAC, see Cecily Rose, Michael Kubiciel & Oliver Landwehr, eds., United Nations
Convention Against Corruption: A Commentary.307

Webb notes that the negotiating process leading to UNCAC grew out of negotiation of the
United Nations Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (UNCTOC, 2000). As
part of its strategy to curb organized crime, UNCTOC also requires that signatory states
criminalize active and passive bribery relating to public officials. For a good description of
the negotiations behind, and the content of, UNCTOC, see Dimitri Vlassis, "The United

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and its Protocols: A New Era
in International Cooperation."308

By December 2000, however, the United Nations General Assembly decided that a more
comprehensive international agreement on anti-corruption was needed. Over seven
sessions, in 2002 and 2003, the Ad Hoc Committee for the Negotiation of the Convention
against Corruption negotiated the text of the Convention. The draft version of UNCAC was
adopted by the General Assembly in October 2003 and was officially signed at Merida,
Mexico in December 2003.

The UNCAC is broader in scope than the OECD Convention and many of the earlier,
regional anti-bribery agreements. As Webb notes, the Convention addresses the following
three main anti-corruption strategies:

     · Prevention: The provisions of Chapter II of UNCAC contain preventative measures
          which target both the public and private sectors. These non-mandatory provisions
          propose the establishment of anti-corruption organizations and lay out measures
          for preventing corruption in the judiciary and public procurement. Member states
          are encouraged to involve nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in uncovering
          and stopping corruption. (See UNCAC Articles 11, 9 and 6).

     · Criminalization: Chapter III of UNCAC requires member states to criminalize a wide
          array of corruption activities, including bribery, embezzlement of public funds,
          trading in influence, concealing corruption and money laundering related to
          corruption. Though these measures are mandatory, the UNCAC adds qualifying
          clauses allowing member states some flexibility in adopting criminal legislation "in
          accordance with fundamental principles of domestic law" or "to the greatest extent
          possible within [the state's] domestic legal system" (See UNCAC Articles 23 and 31).
          Resistant government officials could potentially use these clauses to justify inaction.

     · International Cooperation: Chapter IV mandates that member states cooperate in
          preventing, investigating and prosecuting corruption. Signatories of UNCAC agree
          to give mutual legal assistance through gathering and transferring evidence for
          court trials and extraditing accused offenders. Furthermore, member states must
          also support each other in tracing, freezing, seizing, and confiscating proceeds of
          corruption.309

The negotiation process was not without controversy. According to Webb, the topics that
generated the most disagreement among negotiating parties were the provisions addressing
asset recovery, private sector corruption, political corruption, and implementation of the
Convention.

                                                            CHAPTER 1 CORRUPTION IN CONTEXT

Asset Recovery: A key aspect of UNCAC is the fact that it addresses the recovery of state
assets exported from state coffers by corrupt officials. In this regard Webb states:

          Asset recovery therefore became a sort of `litmus test' for the success of the
          negotiating process as a whole. Although there were intense debates on
          how to reconcile the needs of the countries seeking the return of the assets
          with the legal and procedural safeguards of the countries whose assistance
          is needed, the representatives always emphasized its importance
          throughout the negotiations. The high priority of the issue was bolstered by
          the Security Council resolution deciding that all UN member states should
          take steps to freeze funds removed from Iraq by the Saddam Hussein or his
          senior officials and immediately transfer them to the Development Fund for
          Iraq, and take steps to facilitate the safe return to Iraqi institutions of Iraqi
          cultural property that had been illegally removed. The African
          representative, in particular, believed that the words and spirit of this
          resolution should be incorporated into the UNCAC.

          In the end, provisions on asset recovery formed an entire chapter of the
          UNCAC. The provisions have been hailed as `ground-breaking'. But this
          overstates their true impact. [footnotes omitted]310

Asset Recovery is dealt with in detail in Chapter 5.

Private Sector: Considering the economic strength of many multinational corporations,
private sector corruption was also considered during the UNCAC negotiating process. The
European Union was strongly in favour of including the criminalization of private sector
bribery during the UNCAC negotiations. The United States was opposed as it viewed this
initiative as an undesirable constraint on private sector business dealing. The final version
of UNCAC only includes non-binding articles relating to the criminalization of private
sector bribery and embezzlement. UNCAC does, however, require that State Parties take
steps to prevent private sector corruption. As well, the Convention requires State Parties to
ensure that individuals and other legal entities that suffered damages as a result of
corruption have the right to bring civil cases against those who are responsible. Due in part
to the American business community's fears of a plethora of lawsuits being brought against
American companies by overseas litigants, each state has the ability to determine under
what circumstances these types of claims will be permitted.

In regard to private-to-public sphere corruption, UNCAC is more comprehensive than the
OECD Convention in several respects. UNCAC criminalizes the bribery of domestic officials
as well as foreign officials. Also UNCAC mandates that State Parties prohibit bribes from
being tax deductible; in comparison, this step is only a recommendation in the OECD
Convention.

Financing of Political Parties: At one point in the negotiating process Austria, France, and the
Netherlands proposed an article (Article 10) that mandated signatory countries adopt
regulations aimed at addressing corruption and increasing transparency in elections and

310 Ibid at 208-209.

                                                                                                            97
GLOBAL CORRUPTION

campaign financing. The United States voiced strong opposition to the mandatory language
of the article. This was a reversal from the American stance on the same issue during the
OECD Convention negotiations 20 years earlier. Eventually a compromise was struck and
the mandatory directions in Article 10 were replaced with Article 6, which only asks that
states "consider" taking steps to enhance transparency in elections and campaign financing.
As Webb writes, "[t]he Ad Hoc Committee ultimately had to recognize that campaign
contributions are a crucial part of the election systems in many countries and it had to tread
carefully in order to avoid the Convention coming into conflict with a core aspect of
democratic politics."311 Despite strong public concern on this issue, the UNCAC negotiating
committee failed to reach agreement on a binding article addressing corruption in campaign
financing.

Campaign finance laws are discussed in detail in Chapter 14.

Implementation, Enforcement, and Monitoring: Despite stronger proposals by several
delegations, the final version of UNCAC was criticized for not establishing stronger
monitoring mechanisms to ensure that signatory states comply with the Convention.
UNCAC established a "Conference of State Parties," meant to enable the exchange of
information and cooperation among signatory states, but no formal review mechanism was
agreed upon.

Article 63 of UNCAC leaves the issue of monitoring State Parties compliance to the
Conference of State Parties who are directed to agree upon activities, procedures, and
methods of work to achieve the Convention's objectives, including (in Article 63(4)(e))
periodic review of the "implementation of the Convention by its State Parties." UNCAC
adopted a review mechanism during the 3rd Conference of State Parties in Doha in 2009
(Resolution 3/1). Under the review mechanism, each State Party is reviewed by two peer
states under the coordination of the UNODC Secretariat. The terms of reference, guidelines
and blueprint for UNCAC reviews can be found in the 2011 UNODC publication Mechanisms
for the Review of Implementation of the United Nations Convention against Corruption: Basic
Documents. In short, peer reviews of all states are to begin over a four-year time frame
beginning in 2010, with a country's year of review being determined by lottery.312 The two
peer review countries are made up of one review country from the same region as the
country being reviewed and another review country from a different region. The first step
of the review is the completion and submission of a detailed self-assessment report by the
country under review, followed by electronic communication; then (normally) a site visit
and the writing of the review report (the executive summary is made public, but not the
report itself). For more information on the progress of the UNCAC review mechanism, see
the March 31, 2021 Performance of the Mechanism for the Review of Implementation of the United

Nations Convention against Corruption.313 Each evaluation cycle of the review mechanism lasts
four years. The Progress Report from the seventh session of the Implementation Review
Group, which occurred in April 2016, provides information on the first review cycle. At this
seventh session, country pairings for the second cycle of reviews were drawn.314 As of March
2021, the progress of the second cycle of reviews has run into delays and has now been
extended until June 2024.315

UNCAC has influenced global cooperation in fighting corruption. In "The United Nations
Convention Against Corruption," Jousten highlights UNCAC's impact in three areas:

           as a global convention it has considerably expanded the geographical
                scope of cooperation,

           it provides common definitions of certain key offences, and requires
                (or, in some cases, at least encourages) States Parties to criminalize
                these acts, and

           it has standardized, and contributed to, the development of
                procedural forms of co-operation.316

The UNODC developed materials for a university-level course on UNCAC. The course
materials have been available on the UNODC's webportal TRACK. As of August 1, 2021,
UNODC is migrating the TRACK webportal to a new platform which should become
publicly accessible in the near future. One can anticipate that the Education section of
TRACK, which contains a Menu of Resources identifying 20 anti-corruption topics and
providing a list of relevant academic articles, books, reports, etc. on each topic will be

6.4 Development and Revision of National Laws

      6.4.1 US and UK

Following the multilateral agreements reached in the international forum, many countries
have enacted or revised domestic laws to comply with their international convention
obligations. As already noted, the United States' Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (1977) was an
influential example of a rigorous anti-corruption law long before the international
instruments were established. The United Kingdom's Bribery Act (2010) is the latest
illustration of a strong and broad domestic anti-corruption law. Both the US and UK laws
have broad extra-territorial provisions, and therefore foreign companies and persons
conducting global businesses with a link to either country must comply with these two
"domestic" laws. Both US and UK corruption laws will be examined throughout this book
as illustrations of how other countries could comply with UNCAC and other anti-corruption
conventions.

Unfortunately, compliance by State Parties with international anti-corruption obligations
remains inconsistent. The 2020 TI report Exporting Corruption Progress Report 2020: Assessing
Enforcement of the OECD Convention indicates that of the 47 leading global exporters, 43 of
which are signatories to the OECD Convention, only four (Israel, Switzerland, the UK, and
the US) are actively enforcing the OECD Convention, while nine countries have moderate
enforcement, 15 others (including Canada) have limited enforcement, and 19 have little or
no enforcement.318 TI views the "Active Enforcement" ranking as a necessary step to
effectively deterring companies and individuals from bribing foreign public officials.

      6.4.2 Canada

Canadian corruption and bribery laws will be examined in detail in subsequent chapters. In
short, the 1998 Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act (CFPOA) was enacted in order to
fulfill Canada's obligations under the OECD Convention. The CFPOA makes it a criminal
offence in Canada for Canadian corporations or individuals to bribe or offer a bribe to a
foreign official in order to win business or gain an improper advantage. In 2013, the federal
government amended the CFPOA in several ways to increase its scope and effectiveness.

Canada currently meets its anti-corruption international obligations under UNCAC by a
combination of provisions in its Criminal Code and CFPOA.

Enforcement of the CFPOA was nearly non-existent prior to 2008-2009 since there were no
police resources specifically allocated to CFPOA enforcement.319 Canada was criticized by
many commentators and eventually by the OECD Working Group on Bribery for its non-
enforcement of CFPOA provisions. As a consequence of this criticism, the federal
government, in 2008, funded the creation of two new seven-person RCMP foreign
corruption units, one located in Ottawa and the other in Calgary. These two units were
disbanded in 2012 and the officers were assigned to the newly created "Sensitive and
International Investigation Section," which now includes the investigation of foreign
corruption offences. It appears that this new national section spends very little resources on
the investigation of CFPOA offences. Since the enactment of the CFPOA, there have been
only eight convictions for foreign bribery, three of which are under appeal. It is unclear how
many other cases are under active investigation, although that number is rumoured to be
very small. TI currently ranks Canada's enforcement of the OECD Convention as "Limited
Enforcement" two levels below "Active Enforcement"320 which is considered the
appropriate level.

7. POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, AND SOCIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES

7.1 Libertarians, Cultural Ethnographers, and Liberal Democrats

In "Corruption: Greed, Culture and the State," Rose-Ackerman reviews how both free-
market libertarians and cultural ethnographers have drawn on a distrust of the modern state
to legitimize, excuse, and explain corruption.321 She further argues that these views are
overly simplistic and are at times internally inconsistent. Instead, she advocates for an
approach to anti-corruption theory that acknowledges the importance of the modern state
and seeks to build transparency and accountability in government institutions.

Libertarians

Rose-Ackerman describes the libertarian view of corruption "as a symptom of an intrusive,
meddling state that systematically reins in the free market and undermines entrepreneurial
activity and competition ... [Libertarians] argue that market actors who pay bribes to avoid
complying with the rules, to lower tax bills, or to get favours, limit the harm that the state
can do, and consequently enhance the benevolent operation of the free market as a locus of
individual freedom."322 As an example, Rose-Ackerman submits that a libertarian would not

319 In fact, in 2005, the RCMP appointed one commissioned officer to provide oversight of all RCMP
anti-corruption programs. This was not an enforcement position. See Chapter 6, Section 3.3.3, under
the heading "Canada."

be concerned about, but would instead approve the illegality of using a bribe to get around
a costly regulation.

Furthermore, Rose-Ackerman describes the extreme libertarian views of Geoffrey Brennan
and James Buchanan, who perceive state taxation and regulation as equivalent to theft.323
Rose-Ackerman argues that Brennan and Buchanan's view would allow government
officials to act in self-interest and extract private benefits, initiating the government's
devolution into a kleptocratic monster. Critiquing this libertarian view, Rose-Ackerman
maintains that although democracies are not completely efficient or perfect, they remain the
best available way to reflect the will of the people. Indeed, as long as the government follows
the rules of the constitution and respects human rights, Rose-Ackerman argues that using
government inefficiency or bad laws as a way to justify bribery "trivializes and undermines
democratic institutions."324

Ethnography

Rose-Ackerman also asserts that cultural anthropologists and ethnographers excuse the
corrupt giving of gifts and favours, but do so by employing different justifications than
libertarians. Cultural anthropologists, Rose-Ackerman argues, privilege traditions that
emphasize payments, gifts or favours to friends and family over formal rules and laws.
Indeed, Rose-Ackerman states, "scholars in this tradition often refuse to label transactions
as corrupt if they are based on affective ties, or they claim that, even if formally illegal, the
practices are socially acceptable, economically beneficial, and compensate for the
imperfections of government and of electoral institutions."325

The author suggests that cultural anthropologists blame corruption on the mismatch of
traditional practices with the development of impartial bureaucratic and democratic
systems. Thus, if a society is transitioning from personal transactions to a formal set of rules
and laws, cultural feelings of duty may clash with professional obligations and lead to
corrupt acts. Additionally, Rose-Ackerman asserts that in some cultures, many
ethnographers find the dominant conception of corruption a part of everyday life in a
citizen's social interactions with the state. In instances where paying a fee to avoid taxes or
bribing a judge for the "loss" of a key legal document, the social norms justify the behaviour,
even though they mix economic motives and social practices. As examples of these
anthropologic assertions, Rose-Ackerman relies on the work of JP Olivier de Sardan,326
Jennifer Hasty,327 and Daniel Smith328 who developed these themes in the African context.
Furthermore, Rose-Ackerman submits that in Africa, many people recognize and criticize

corruption even though "they themselves participate in networks that socially reproduce
corruption."329 The author also acknowledges a similar cultural norm of ambiguity
regarding bribes to friends and family in China, termed guanxi, or as it translates, "social
connections."

While sympathetic to the position of those who find their social obligations conflict with
their professional ones, Rose-Ackerman reasons that "deeply embedded and self-
reinforcing, ... norms must change ... if a society is ever to build a legitimate democracy."330
Rose-Ackerman further argues that the current condemnation of corruption by citizens
leaves openings for potential reform.

In summary, Rose-Ackerman believes libertarians and ethnographers share very similar
normative positions: "both stress the way payoffs to public officials permit nonstate
institutions to flourish in spite of a set of formal rules that constrain private behaviour.
However, each gives a different set of institutions priority - the market for one and social
ties for the other."331 In addition, Rose-Ackerman argues both groups perceive corruption as
a response to a dysfunctional reality.

Grand Corruption

In instances of grand corruption, those at the top of the state hierarchy participate in corrupt
acts in return for funds. The problem with this, Rose-Ackerman argues, is that grand
corruption leads to distortions in the quality and quantity of government decisions, diverts
funds to public officials' private accounts, and creates unfair electoral advantages.
Multinational firms sometimes initiate grand corruption and, as Rose-Ackerman contends,
invoke cultural norms as their justification for giving bribes to public officials. For example,
Rose-Ackerman cites the 2006 international arbitration dispute where a firm paid a two-
million-dollar bribe to the President of Kenya and tried to argue the payment was to satisfy
the local custom of harambee. The Kenyan government, under new leadership, argued that
there was no valid contract because of the bribe; the arbitration tribunal agreed.332

Rose-Ackerman analyzes multiple justifications she believes others use to excuse grand
corruption.333 First, multinational firms argue that presenting bribes is simply an attempt to
be culturally sensitive. The author points out this excuse is invalid--the unfavourable terms
of the contract, obtained through the bribe, negatively affect the nation's citizens. Second,
Rose-Ackerman critiques the argument used by high-ranking officials that a bribe is simply
a tribute to their prestigious status, in line with cultural traditions. This argument conflicts
with established tradition in many societies, where bribes go from higher-status to lower-
status individuals. Rose-Ackerman claims that high-ranking officials following tradition
would be insulted by these bribes and reject them. Third, Rose-Ackerman states culturalists

increase its cost, see Chapters 3, 4 and 5 of Rose-Ackerman & Palifka, supra note 273.

                                                                                                          103
GLOBAL CORRUPTION

argue that grand corruption is imported from wealthy, capitalist countries where businesses
have profit-maximization as their goal. In Rose-Akerman's assessment, this argument is too
simple: both parties, including the political leaders, must agree to make a corrupt deal; some
are willing to use the excuse of culture to justify self-gain. Thus, the author asserts that "one
needs to be cautious in accepting at face value assertions that seemingly corrupt transactions
reflect entrenched cultural practices acceptable to most people."334

Democratic Legitimacy and Control

Rose-Ackerman asserts that democratic states exercise coercive power in decision-making.
This may have a greater cost on some individuals over others, but remains acceptable as
long as the state publicly justifies its exercise of power. Broadly speaking, the author believes
a properly functioning democracy is a legitimate way to organize society, but argues that
when elected officials or bureaucrats engage in self-interested behaviour such as corruption,
it undermines the state's claim to legitimacy. Rose-Ackerman acknowledges that it may be
difficult to separate corrupt dealings from local practices in situations where public power
is bound up with paternalistic obligations. Nevertheless, the author argues that if corruption
is allowed in government, state agents will likely rewrite rules to increase their self-gain,
creating a feedback loop that weakens the government's legitimacy. Furthermore, she notes
that "tensions between the democratic welfare state and the private market and between
that state and a country's traditional cultural practices are all but inevitable."335

Therefore, Rose-Ackerman suggests that anti-corruption policy can take three paths: first,
accepting cultural norms and channelling them into less destructive paths; second,
bypassing cultural norms by substituting institutions that require other skills and values; or
third, transforming these cultural norms. The author cautions that aggressive anti-
corruption approaches may destroy the goodwill and loyalty of citizens. Acknowledging
that there is no easy solution to the critiques of anti-corruption efforts, Rose-Ackerman
provides eight potential areas of reform.

          1. Simple Transparency is Necessary

          2. External Oversight of Government Activity is Essential

          3. Transparent and Competitive Processes for Large-Scale Procurement
                Should Exist

          4. The State Should Enforce Bribery Laws Against Major Offenders both
                Inside and Outside of Government

          5. Creation of a Complaint Mechanism Process to Report Bribes

          6. Reforms Should Be Made to Improve Government Function and
                Reduce Corruption

          7. The Working Conditions of Civil Servants and the Judiciary Should be
                Improved

          8. Electoral Law May Need Reform

In conclusion, Rose-Ackerman acknowledges that while international treaties and civil
society initiatives aimed at curbing global corruption are a step in the right direction, their
effects do not, however, have the same "bite as hard law" and only complement much-
needed domestic reform. In addition, Rose-Ackerman urges anti-corruption advocates and
others to move away from simplistic claims that corruption is inevitable because of
dysfunctional government.336 Instead, realistic domestic reforms, such as increasing the
effectiveness of public services and ensuring conflicts are resolved fairly can be
implemented to reduce corruption.337

7.2 The Three Authority Systems: Traditional, Patrimonial, and

       Rational-Legal

In "Corruption in the Broad Sweep of History," Marcus Felson uses Max Weber's three
categories of historical authority systems to conceptualize corruption and place it within its
political and economic context. The post-colonial critique that anti-corruption and human
rights efforts and literature focus overly on developing countries has been discussed earlier
in this chapter. Felson's article provides a counterpoint to this narrative: he argues that the
modern rational-legal authority system provides the greatest opportunity for corruption to
transpire. In doing so, he casts a spotlight, in the following excerpt, on the different forms of
institutional corruption that fester in Western states.338

                                                            BEGINNING OF EXCERPT

 Corruption is a product of the interplay between (a) primary human imperatives and (b)
 an economic and social system trying to control and channel those imperatives. Primary
 human imperatives include both looking after one's personal interests and meeting social
 commitments to friends and relatives. A strong tension is inherent between these primary
 human imperatives and the larger economic and social system. That tension is strongest
 with the modern form of economic organization. Hence corruption, despite its ancient
 presence, becomes especially relevant in a modern world. Although corruption becomes
 especially an issue as developing nations move towards a modern world, we should not
 assume that the tension will go away once they are developed.

 ...

 [Max] Weber synthesized information about the broad sweep of economic and social
 history with three authority systems: (a) traditional, (b) patrimonial, and (c) rational-legal.
 This chapter explains his general categories, then shows why they help us to understand
 and conceptualize corruption.

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

 Within a traditional system, individuals are constrained by the rules and mores of society,
 but those constraints do not stand between primary human imperatives and productivity.
 Thus a traditional hunting and gathering society follows the teachings of the past and the
 social ties of kinship, whether or not these lead to greater efficiency. Traditional systems
 often apply in agrarian societies with small village life, and are not oriented towards a
 modern society. However, traditional systems may persist into the modern era. A prime
 example of a traditional system is the interplay of the Hindu religion and the economy in
 India. Each economic role is largely defined by caste and hence by tradition, within
 minimal economic flexibility and little regard to efficiency. Within a traditional system,
 many economic behaviours that we might regard as corrupt from an outside viewpoint
 are actually part of the rules. Thus assigning jobs by caste and village is intrinsic to the
 way of life, and should not be viewed as corrupt behavior as a matter of personal
 deviance, except when those collective obligations are circumvented.

 The patrimonial system is very distinct from the traditional system because of its reliance
 on personal rule. In this system the ruler does not distinguish between personal and
 public life, treating state resources and decisions as his personal affair. The agents of the
 ruler act in his name and on his behalf. It is still possible for those agents to be corrupt
 only in the sense that they cheat the ruler of his due. If the ruler's agents mistreat the
 citizens, they are acting within the rules of the system--so long as they send the proceeds
 back to the ruler and do not take more than their allotted share. This is quite evident in
 the history of tax farmers whose job was to demand tribute and payments from the
 provinces. They would be perceived as corrupt to us today, but they were not corrupt in
 terms of their system, unless they hid the proceeds from the ruler in their own selfish
 interest. Examples of patrimony range from Roman emperors to President Ferdinand
 Marcos in the Philippines and Colonel Khadaffi in Libya--reflecting extension of
 authority beyond a local area.

 ...

 The rational-legal system of economic and social organization has an entirely different set
 of expectations from the traditional and patrimonial systems.... Under this system, all
 persons follow rules and fit into formal roles that are separate from the personal, family,
 and friendship interests of their incumbents. The rulers and role incumbents are
 substitutable, so that a formal organization persists over time, pursuing goals beyond the
 individual. This impersonality includes hiring based on competence and certification, and
 promotion based on ability and productivity. The role incumbents must follow rules, and
 must be oriented towards goal achievement beyond themselves. They are also supposed
 to treat each client equally, according to the rules, ignoring personal ties and predilections.
 Thus modern life conflicts fundamentally with primary human imperatives. Bureaucracy
 in Weber's terms is like a machine, since it separates personal interests (including family
 and friend commitments) from interests, facilitating the latter. Yet this form of economic
 and social organization only emerged in the past 200 years or less in Europe, and in most
 of the world did not begin to spread until after 1950. In many parts of the world, the
 rational-legal form is only beginning to emerge

106                                                                                               2022
                                                           CHAPTER 1 CORRUPTION IN CONTEXT

...

Of course, Weber's concept of rational formal organization is an ideal type.... The
corruption potential of a rational-legal system is dramatically greater mainly because that
system conflicts with basic human tendencies. If human beings are both selfish and social,
then the modern form conflicts with each. It conflicts with the selfish tendencies because
each individual has something to gain from evading less pleasant role assignments or
taking resources beyond entitlement. It conflicts with social tendencies because each
individual feels commitment to friends, family and those with less social distance and
wants to help them more than strangers. Hence treating everybody alike under the rules
is unnatural for real people.

Given its conflict with human selfishness and human sociability, the rational-legal system
should have died an early death. Yet it survives and spreads for a simple reason: this
strange and hardly human form of social and economic organization is extremely
productive in material terms. It makes more cars. It processes more customers and clients.
It shortens lines and puts a chicken in every pot. And so the least human of social and
economic systems is also the most productive. Thus our selfish and social interests are
torn between the immediate gains from violating the rules and the more general gains
from following them. The best individual solution is to break the rules yourself but get
everybody else to follow them, yielding a productive society as a whole that you can then
exploit. However, if too many people do that then the productivity of the whole system
declines and the rational-legal system becomes a figment of the imagination.

Imaginary rational-legal systems are all too common. In a way the real lesson of the 2000
Presidential election and the case of Gore vs Bush in Florida is the corruption and
mismanagement of state and local governments in the United States. In Weber's terms,
each occupational role is assigned to a specialist, with overlapping roles minimized. Those
familiar with corruption issues will immediately recognize this as a flaw, for the lack of
overlap makes it easier for one person to corrupt the system and avoid discovery. In
contrast, overlapping makes it possible for someone else to check, or more generally for
the people to check one another.

...

The theory of checks and balances may be the essential general theory of corruption
control. In both government and business, checks and balances are employed to protect
responsible decisions and actions. Rival political parties, parliamentary question periods,
a free press, regulatory agencies, free competition in the marketplace, overlapping roles,
auditors and accountants--each of these is a special example of the general rule that
checks and balances are needed to prevent personal and social interests from impairing
efficiency and productivity.

...

In fighting corruption, we must always remember what we are asking of people: to set
aside personal interest and personal ties and to follow rules for the greater impersonal

                                                                                                        107
GLOBAL CORRUPTION

 good. But we must also understand that we can never completely win the war against
 corruption, nor can we give it up. We can never win it because primary human
 imperatives always outweigh impersonal goals. We can never give up the struggle
 because our modern prosperity depends on containing these personal and social goals
 while on the job. But if we don't contain it, it grows and takes over. Like housekeeping,
 no vacuum sweeper works permanently but the failure to vacuum lets a home get dirtier
 and dirtier.

 Yet corruption cannot be controlled by assuming that people can be trained in ethics
 alone, since it is impossible to talk people out of being people. But it is possible to train
 people to supervise one another and hence to provide a system of checks and balances.
 Such a system works best when criminalization and punishment work only at the
 extreme, when the system operates on a normal basis without getting to that point.
 Control depends on designing more secure systems, efficient supervision, and effective
 checks and balances. As technology takes new forms, it brings new opportunities for
 corruption and hence demands new checking and balancing. With the march of
 technology, more and more value is intangible--contained in electronic data that are not
 easily watched with the naked eye. But systems can be designed to keep track of electronic
 data, too, thus interfering with the opportunities for corruption. As society becomes more
 complex in technology, corrupt practices can more easily escape notice, at least for a while.
 But in time we learn to use technology to reduce the complexity of supervision and thence
 to create methods for managing, checking, and balancing so that formal organization
 keeps personal and social needs under a reasonable degree of containment. An
 organization must find simplicity and accountability to avoid corruption. That means
 overcoming organizational and technical complexity with new forms of simple checks
 and balances. When that is achieved, modern society can achieve simple monitoring while
 requiring complex conspiring, and corruption will diminish. Developing nations face the
 same principles but at an earlier stage, with formal organization replacing family and
 patrimonial systems in places not yet ready for that to happen. But, of course, no place is
 fully ready to give up its personal and social tendencies, and so the work of reducing
 corruption is never complete.

                                                                 END OF EXCERPT

Empirical data reflects Felson's contention that the rational-legal system holds the greatest
potential for corruption. In their article "Democracy and Corruption: a Complex
Relationship," Shrabani Saha et al. use sophisticated econometric models to show the rise in
corruption in countries that have transitioned from autocratic regimes to electoral
democracies (the ultimate rational-legal system).339 The authors conclude that electoral
democracy and political rights alone are insufficient to reduce corruption; in fact, electoral
democracy on its own aggravates widespread corruption because there are fewer checks and
balances against corruption in an electoral democracy than in an autocratic regime. Effective
democratic institutions, such as an independent judiciary, a free press, an economic system
promoting the rule of law and the distribution of social benefits, and respect for civil rights

are crucial to reducing corruption. These institutions deter corruption by increasing the
probability that corrupt acts will be detected and punished.

For a counterpoint to "economistic" understandings of corruption, see Barry Hindess,
"Good Government and Corruption."340 Hindess argues that a narrow focus on economic
corruption obscures other, more general forms of corruption in government. By ignoring
other forms of corruption, we fail to see the damaging effects of party politics, police
corruption, and other insidious problems of political life in western democracies.

For an analysis of the institutionalization of unethical, yet technically legal, quid pro quos in
professional environments and how this affects the independence of politics and
professions, see Garry Gray's article on, "Insider Accounts of Institutional Corruption:
Examining the Social Organization of Unethical Behaviour."341

7.3 Institutional Corruption: A Sociological Perspective

The following brief commentary, prepared for this book, provides a sociological perspective
on institutional corruption.

                                                  by Garry Gray342

 As conventional wisdom would have it, corruption and illegality go hand in hand.
 Tacitus' famed words, Corruptissima re publica plurimae leges, often translated as `the more
 corrupt the state, the more numerous the laws,' evokes multiple meanings, but one
 rendering elucidates on the expansiveness of corruption beyond the law.343 Bribery and
 other direct quid pro quo conflict of interest exchanges involving public officials and
 fiduciaries are well recognized as indictable offences in many countries, but corruption
 also operates on an invisible level, embedded within the social norms and institutional
 practices of professional environments. This form of corruption can be referred to as
 institutional corruption. Conceptually it requires that we go beyond the focus on illegal
 behaviour to also include unethical and professional activities that violate public trust.
 Institutional corruption therefore requires a shift in focus towards examining "influences
 that implicitly or purposively serve to distort the independence of a professional in a
 position of public trust."344

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

 In summarizing an account from a confidential interview that I conducted with a
 consultant for a multilateral development institution who was also a tenured professor,
 we can observe distinctions between traditional corruption and institutional
 corruption.345 Over more than a decade, Anthony had taken on consulting assignments
 that required him to evaluate projects being considered for grant funding from a multi-
 lateral donor.346 On more than one occasion while abroad on assignment, he had been
 offered bribes in return for writing favorable reports. He said these bribes could involve
 very large sums of money. In one case the bribe was perhaps five percent of the grant
 total, amounting to more than double the annual salary that he was earning as a tenured
 professor. Anthony acknowledged that these overtly illegal and at times threatening
 experiences fit the traditional conceptualization of corruption.

 Following this discussion I asked Anthony if he had experienced other kinds of conflicts,
 namely situations that caused him to wrestle with what to do in his work for the
 multilateral donor. Anthony recounted a situation where his research findings and
 recommendations in a commissioned report did not fit with the ideological perspective
 held by his manager at the multilateral development institution. After some careful
 consideration he felt he could not compromise, because of the impact the alternative could
 potentially have for the country in question. Anthony recalled having a lengthy
 conversation over the phone with that manager and being asked to change the report. He
 refused, and acknowledged in that phone call that his contract was coming up for renewal
 and that he knew this disagreement could affect it. He saw this possible consequence as
 an expected, even logical outcome given the norms of consulting. There was nothing
 illegal about the situation, but the `corrupting' effect of the earlier bribery examples and
 the threat of reduced hours is the same: both were influences intended to alter the
 outcomes of Anthony's reports.

 Looking back on that exchange, Anthony is convinced that he would have been offered
 more consulting hours in the subsequent year had he submitted a report that fit with his
 manager's desired outcome. He also questioned what he would have done had he not
 held a tenured professorship, and if consulting had been his primary mode of
 employment. He was convinced that his professorship had structurally enabled him to
 stand behind his report. In this case, he was able to resist institutional corruption, but
 acknowledges that he still felt pressured to `go along, to get along.'

 The concept of public trust is an important element of institutional corruption theory. If
 Anthony was not a university professor, but instead was a full-time consultant who
 depended on the availability of future consulting opportunities, should we be less
 trusting of Anthony's ability to remain independent? Would the possibility of missing out
 on future consulting opportunities lead to subtle forms of dependency within Anthony's
 social and professional networks? If so, then what other subtle improper influences may

 exist in professional environments that could compromise the independence of
 professionals in positions of public trust?

 From Bribery to Political Corruption

 While the United States, since the enactment of the FCPA in 1977, has been a driving force
 behind global attempts to regulate quid-pro-quo corruption and in particular, bribery,
 (c.f., the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention in 1999 and the UNCAC in 2005), it has been
 reluctant to impose similar regulations on political corruption. During the UNCAC
 negotiations, the United States resisted proposals from Austria, France, and the
 Netherlands to impose mandatory regulations that would address issues of corruption in
 campaign finance. While campaign finance reform, and the issue of money in politics, is
 a contentious policy issue in the United States347 it also provides a good example of the
 value of an institutional corruption approach.348

 Political Corruption: The Case of Jack Abramoff

 Prior to being convicted of fraud and being sent to prison, Jack Abramoff was one of the
 most influential lobbyists in the United States.349 Upon release from prison, Abramoff now
 spends his time exposing the role that institutional corruption plays in political decision-
 making and campaign financing. During one public interview, Abramoff told the
 interviewer the following: "We know a bribe is when you show up with a stack of cash
 and say, `Here's $10,000 in cash, and can you do this for me?' But if I show up with 10
 $1,000 campaign contributions and say the same thing, that's not a bribe in Washington.
 Outside of Washington, everybody gets this... but inside Washington, that's the way it's
 done... We have institutionalized corruption in Washington. It's perfectly accepted, and
 it's acceptable to virtually everybody, and that's where things need to change."350

 The role of money in politics, in particular through campaign finances, is attracting
 increased international attention. For instance, in response to major corruption scandals
 in Brazil, the Supreme Court of Brazil declared on September 17, 2015, that corporate
 donations to election campaigns are unconstitutional.351 And, in the United States, several

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

 US politicians seeking the party nomination for leader of the Democratic Party, including
 Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, and Lawrence Lessig, campaigned for the November
 2016 election with campaign finance reform as a major component of their election
 platform. There is a growing narrative developing in the United States that politicians are
 becoming less dependent upon the people they represent and more dependent on those
 who support their campaign finance initiatives.

 However, rather than leading to direct quid-pro-quo corruption, the growing
 dependency on funders of campaigns in the United States is contributing to more subtle
 forms of institutionalized corruption through relational forms of dependency corruption.
 By creating situations where politicians become dependent on funders, it is suggested
 that integrity and independence are compromised. In turn, this leads to situations where
 self-censoring behaviour (such as deciding which policies or amendments to pursue, or
 alternatively, vote against) can begin to feel normal and perhaps even justified among
 politicians in positions of public trust. As Lawrence Lessig notes, "knowing that there are
 members of Congress dependent on campaign cash, private interests exploit that
 dependency, by seeking special benefits from the governments (`rents') and returning the
 favor ever so indirectly with campaign contributions. And knowing that they are so
 dependent upon private support, members of Congress will work to keep their fingers in
 as much of private life as possible... [And] because this is `just the way things are done',
 no one needs to feel guilty, or evil in this system."352

 Given that the corruption described here is institutional in nature and often rationalized
 as a normal part of politics, a sociological account of institutional corruption is timely. For
 instance, an analysis of the insider accounts of institutional corruption provided by Jack
 Abramoff after he was released from prison reveals the mechanics of how the
 independence of American politicians can be exploited by lobbyists. In particular,
 through various techniques such as campaign finance contributions, legal loopholes, and
 the manipulation of social networks that result in improper influences that while often
 legal, may lead to corrupting outcomes.

 Take for instance, the revolving door metaphor, where professionals holding jobs in
 congressional offices move into lobbying jobs and vice versa. Abramoff shows how this
 can contribute to institutionalized forms of corruption given the subtle and often hidden
 financial incentives that exist for public representatives.353 According to Abramoff,
 industry lobbyists are well aware of the importance of social relationships and social
 networks in a revolving door system. While there are cooling-off regulations in some
 countries that attempt to limit government employees from immediately going through
 the revolving door to a lobbying job, there still remains various corrupt ways that these
 regulations can be skirted. According to Abramoff, lobbyists are still able to informally
 capture individual members of the United States Congress, as well as their staff, even

 without offering a formal contract of employment. Improper influences can be quite
 insidious Abramoff states:

            As I started hiring staff, particularly chiefs of staff [to members of
            Congress], I would say `hey look when do you want to leave the hill?'
            `Well, I don't want to leave for two years.' `Ok, in two years I'll hire you.'
            I hired them right then. The minute they knew they were coming to work
            for me their whole job changed. They are human beings. If you have a job
            and you know you are going somewhere else you are at least going to be
            thinking about the next job. You don't want that business to go away....
            When I tell people this ... they don't understand that their staff becomes
            my staffer. For two years that staffer is not only my staffer ... but is better
            than my staffer. Because my staffer can't find the things that person is
            going to find and look out for our interests more than we could ... one of
            the real pernicious and corrupt parts of the system, and again completely
            legal, and unknown entirely.354

 According to Abramoff, he cultivated these kinds of improper influences in close to 100
 of the 435 United States congressional offices. He also noted that staffers were "perfect
 targets for revolving-door techniques."355 The impact of the revolving door is that it
 contributes to dependencies between lobbyists and government officials (dependence
 corruption) whereby "public officials might be more likely to insert legal content known
 as riders that are favourable to lobbying clients into bills that are to be voted on by
 members of Congress."356 As Abramoff notes:

            a lobbyist trying to enact his client's wishes needs to get his amendment
            onto a bill likely to pass both the House and the Senate, to then be signed
            by the president. No bill is more likely to pass than a reform bill ... so
            smart lobbyists always keep an eye out for reform bills. It's ironic, if not
            horrific, that this is the case. The very bills designed to limit corruption
            and improve our system of government sometimes serve as vehicles for
            special interests.357

 According to Abramoff, the technique of inserting corrupt riders into a reform bill is a
 common practice, one that is intertwined with problems of political corruption embedded
 in the revolving door between government and industry. While reform efforts attempt to
 prevent political corruption, in particular, gifts that represent an illegal and overt attempt
 to buy influence, they do not always capture or prevent the subtler forms of institutional
 corruption. Abramoff's insider accounts reveal that political contributions to campaigns
 "are a significant form of indirect gifting that can accomplish the same things [as quid-

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

 pro-quo corruption] but without the legal ramifications."358 As Abramoff commented in
 an interview:

            You can't take a congressman to lunch for $25 and buy him a hamburger
            or a steak or something like that. But you can take him to a fundraising
            lunch and not only buy him that steak but give him $25,000 extra and call
            it a fundraiser. And you have all the same access and all the same
            interaction with that congressman.359

 The insider accounts of structured and systematic corruption provided by Jack Abramoff
 illustrate the value of an institutional corruption approach to traditional studies of
 political corruption.360

 Conclusion

 Corruption, especially corruption that is specialized and intricately woven beyond the
 public eye, is often legal despite its potential for harm. Far too often, the general public
 has no choice but to trust that professionals will both recognize and resist corrupting
 influences when they arise in their professional environments. However, rather than
 simply trust that each individual professional will "do the right thing" and maintain
 integrity in the face of improper and potentially corrupting influences, institutional
 corruption theory offers an alternative. Examine institutional practices, structures, and
 relationships that bear on the trustworthiness and independence of public officials and
 professionals, and corrupting systems can be exposed, understood, and eventually
 mitigated.

8. TWO SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENTS IN CORPORATE
    GOVERNANCE

Corporate social responsibility (CSR) and environmental, social, and governance (ESG)
factors have become increasingly prominent in the discourse on corporate governance. The
former consists of a theoretical movement originating in mid-twentieth-century America,
concerning businesses' moral responsibilities to society. The latter is a recent movement
which uses ESG factors to inform investment strategies. In "Enhancing the Effectiveness of
the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Through Corporate Social Responsibility," Dan Heiss
discusses the integration of anti-corruption measures and CSR, stating "over the last decade,
combating corruption has taken a place alongside human rights, labour rights, and

environmental protection as one of the major issues in corporate social responsibility
(CSR)."361 Heiss further argues:

          [T]o be truly effective in reducing the level of bribery in international
          business, the FCPA must work to encourage corporations to be socially
          responsible. Thus, to reduce corruption, corporations should be encouraged
          to think about not just what they should not do, but also what they can do.
          That is, corporations need to consider what they can do to work with other
          businesses, home and host country governments, local communities, and
          civil society organizations to reduce the levels of corruption in any
          particular country. To assist in this process, ... the enforcement of the FCPA
          should be structured to support the various actors and major initiatives in
          the CSR field that combat corruption.362

8.1 Corporate Social Responsibility

      8.1.1 What is Corporate Social Responsibility?

Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is a broad and evolving concept.363 Its content is shaped
by shifting societal expectations which are dependent in part on the industrial context in
which it operates and the people who are impacted by its behaviour. Industry Canada, a
government department, defines CSR as "a company's environmental, social and economic
performance and the impacts of the company on its internal and external stakeholders."364
The UK Government describes CSR as "the voluntary actions that businesses can take over
and above legal requirements to manage and enhance economic, environmental and societal
impacts."365 Though definitions of CSR vary, international sources reflect consensus on the
following characteristics:

      CSR involves obligations apart from the formal requirements of law, and is instead
          a reflection of normative standards;

      CSR involves companies demonstrating varying degrees of commitment to
          concepts such as corporate citizenship, sustainable development, and
          environmental sustainability; and,

      governments, citizens, and investors now generally expect companies to adopt
          some form of internal CSR business strategy.366

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

While CSR is dynamic and still developing, it is clear that the global corporate community
has adopted CSR as an important item on the business agenda.367

      8.1.2 How Did CSR Develop?

Archie B. Carroll, in "Corporate Social Responsibility: Evolution of a Definitional
Construct," suggests that our contemporary notion of CSR is the product of an American
school of thought dating to the mid-twentieth century, perhaps originating with Howard R.
Bowen's 1953 seminal book Social Responsibilities of the Businessman.368 Bowen asks the
fundamental question, "What responsibilities to society may businessmen
[businesspersons] reasonably be expected to assume?"369 Businesspersons have a
responsibility, Carroll suggests, to act in accordance with society's values and best interests.
Carroll notes that the Committee for Economic Development (CED), which published Social
Responsibilities of Business Corporations in 1971, asserted that society expected businesses to
assume greater moral responsibility and "contribute to the quality of American life."370 In
1979, Carroll outlined three dimensions of CSR: corporate responsibilities, social issues of
business, and corporate actions.371 Otherwise put, corporate responsibilities lead
corporations to respond to certain social issues, as determined by societal and corporate
values and priorities.372 While Carroll's concept of CSR has evolved in subsequent decades,
it remains foundational for contemporary CSR theory.373 Today, CSR is one of many related
concepts that influence the role of businesses in society.374 These include corporate social
performance (CSP), corporate citizenship, inclusive business, social entrepreneurship,
sustainable development, and ESG.

There are also critics and skeptics of the notion of corporate social responsibility: for
example, in Dustin Gumpinger's article "Corporate Social Responsibility, Social Justice, and
the Politics of Difference: Towards a Participatory Model of the Corporation," the author
states:

          The problem is that the notion of corporate social responsibility, under the
          current corporate law framework, is an oxymoron. The corporation's legal
          mandate is to pursue its own best interests and thus to maximize the wealth
          of its shareholders. Hence, corporate social responsibility is illegal and
          impossible to the extent that it undermines a company's bottom line. Acting

          out of social concern can only be justified insofar as it tends to bolster the
          corporation's interests. It is not surprising then that critics have
          characterized corporate social responsibility as an "ideological movement"
          designed to legitimize the power of transnational corporations.

          In order to foster a world in which corporate decision-makers act genuinely
          in the interest of individuals and groups other than shareholders, the
          institutional nature of the corporate form must be reconceptualised. But if
          corporate social responsibility is an ineffective tool for evaluating corporate
          decisions, actions and outcomes, where should we turn? I shall argue that,
          as a dominant social institution, the corporation ought to be held to the same
          theoretical standards as other social institutions: namely, to the standard of
          social justice. [footnotes omitted]375

Gumpinger concludes with the following thoughts:

          Historically, corporations were public purpose institutions; today, they
          remain legal institutions in that they rely on legislation to create and enable
          them. Under this legal framework, corporations have come to govern
          virtually every aspect of our daily lives, despite the fact that they lack the
          democratic accountability of governments. This fusion of power and
          unaccountability has given rise to claims that the corporate form is
          inherently unjust and should be changed.

          ...

          The corporation's propensity to cause and reinforce dominations and
          oppression highlight the need to build democratic decision-making
          structures into the corporate form. To achieve this goal, corporate law
          theory needs to abandon its desire for political unity, which tends to exclude
          the perspectives of the oppressed and the disadvantaged. Rather, a theory
          of the firm ought to be based on a heterogeneous notion of the public which
          gives voice to those who are systematically excluded from corporate
          decision-making. Hence, corporate law ought to provide the means through
          which the distinct voices and perspectives of those who are oppressed and
          disadvantaged by the corporation may be recognized and represented. If
          the corporation proves unable to serve this goal in addition to its primary
          goal of accumulating and generating wealth then it may be time to
          conceptualize an institution that can.376

to consult commonly referenced international instruments. Though CSR is reflected in a vast

array of global policies and initiatives, the following standards are referred to across the
globe to aid businesses forming internal CSR strategies:

     · International Organization for Standardization ("ISO") 26000: Provides guidance
          on how businesses and organizations can operate in a socially responsible way
          and helps to clarify the concept of social responsibility.377 Other ISO standards,
          such as ISO 9000 on corporate quality management, ISO 14001 on environmental
          management, and the recent ISO/TC 322 on sustainable finance are also relevant.

     · Global Reporting Initiative G4 Guidelines ("GRI G4"): Promotes corporate
          transparency by providing guidance on how to disclose information and what
          types of information should be disclosed. Anti-corruption is addressed as an
          aspect of the "society" reporting category.378 TI's Business Principles for
          Countering Bribery (TI Principles): Provides a framework for companies to
          develop comprehensive anti-bribery programs.379

     · The World Economic Forum Partnering Against Corruption Principles for
          Countering Bribery (PACI Principles) is derived from the TI Principles.380 The TI
          and PACI Principles are discussed and critiqued in Adeyeye's book Corporate

enact, within their sphere of influence, a set of core values in the areas of human rights,
labour standards, the environment, and anti-corruption. These core values are expressed in
the form of ten principles:

          Human Rights

          Principle 1: Businesses should support and respect the protection of
          internationally proclaimed human rights; and

          Principle 2: make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses.
          Labour
          Principle 3: Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the
          effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining;
          Principle 4: the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour;
          Principle 5: the effective abolition of child labour; and
          Principle 6: the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and
          occupation.
          Environment
          Principle 7: Businesses should support a precautionary approach to
          environmental challenges;
          Principle 8: undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental
          responsibility; and
          Principle 9: encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally
          friendly technologies.
          Anti-Corruption
          Principle 10: Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms,
          including extortion and bribery.383

In regard to the 10th Principle, the UN Global Compact website, amongst other things,
provides the following commentary:

                                                            BEGINNING OF EXCERPT

 Why should companies care?

 There are many reasons why the elimination of corruption has become a priority within
 the business community. Confidence and trust in business among investors, customers,
 employees and the public have been eroded by recent waves of business ethics scandals
 around the globe. Companies are learning the hard way that they can be held responsible
 for not paying enough attention to the actions of their employees, associated companies,
 business partners and agents.

 The rapid development of rules of corporate governance around the world is also
 prompting companies to focus on anti-corruption measures as part of their mechanisms
 to express corporate sustainability and to protect their reputations and the interests of
 their stakeholders. Their anti-corruption systems are increasingly being extended to a
 range of ethics and integrity issues, and a growing number of investment managers are
 looking to these systems as evidence that the companies undertake good and well-
 managed business practice.

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

 Businesses face high ethical and business risks and potential costs when they fail to
 effectively combat corruption in all its forms. All companies, large and small, are
 vulnerable to corruption, and the potential for damage is considerable. Business can face:

       · Legal risks: not only are most forms of corruption illegal where they occur but it
            is also increasingly becoming illegal in a company's home country to engage in
            corrupt practices in another country;

       · Reputational risks: companies whose policies and practices fail to meet high
            ethical standards, or that take a relaxed attitude toward compliance with laws,
            are exposed to serious reputational risks. Often it is enough to be accused of
            malpractice for a company's reputation to be damaged even if a court
            subsequently determines the contrary;

       · Financial costs: there is clear evidence that many countries lose close to $1 trillion
            due to fraud, corruption and shady business transactions and in certain cases,
            corruption can cost a country up to 17% of its GDP, according to the UN
            Development Programme in 2014. This undermines business performance and
            diverts public resources from legitimate sustainable development;

       · Erosion of internal trust and confidence as unethical behaviour damages staff
            loyalty to the company as well as the overall ethical culture of the company.

 What can companies do?

 The UN Global Compact suggests that participants consider the following three elements
 when fighting corruption and implementing the 10th principle:

       · Internal: As a first and basic step, introduce anti-corruption policies and
            programmes within their organizations and their business operations;

       · External: Report on the work against corruption in the annual Communication
            on Progress; and share experiences and best practices through the submission of
            examples and case stories;

       · Collective Action: Join forces with industry peers and with other stakeholders to
            scale up anti-corruption efforts, level the playing field and create fair competition
            for all. Companies can use the Anti-Corruption Collective Action Hub to create a
            company profile, propose projects, find partners and on-going projects as well as
            resources on anti-corruption collective action;

       · Sign the "Anti-corruption Call to Action", which is a call from Business to
            Governments to address corruption and foster effective governance for a
            sustainable and inclusive global economy.384

                                                                 END OF EXCERPT

8.2 Environment, Social and Governance Movement

The Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) movement is the latest `big idea' and
buzzword in the corporate world. The following short piece, written expressly for this book,
describes various aspects of the movement.

                                               The ESG Movement

                                      by Daniela Chimisso dos Santos385

 1. Emergence of ESG

 Milton Freidman introduced the "shareholder value theory" in 1970, in writing "The
 Social Responsibility of Business is to Increase its Profits."386 As the title suggests, this
 view espouses that a business has no social obligation other than to make profits for its
 shareholders--a view that has dominated in the US. Conversely, it has had limited
 success in Canada and Great Britain, and barely influenced Continental Europe.
 Nevertheless, it is within this model that the principles of CSR and other efforts to imbue
 business with social responsibility have arisen. The latest movement is one based on ESG
 principles. First coined by UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan in 2004,387 ESG has taken
 over the business responsibility discourse and is now one of the fastest-growing areas of
 corporate action. In fact, ESG has been heralded as the business case for stakeholder
 capitalism, countering Freidman's views and making the needs of society at large at par
 with shareholders' interests and rights.388

 Though there are no set ESG factors, industry-specific ESG criteria have been created.389
 Generally, environmental factors reflect how the business interacts with the natural
 world, specifically its conservation. Social factors focus on the business' relationship with
 people, both internal and external to the company. Governance indicators relate to how
 the business is run; it is here that we find the connection with anti-corruption programs.

2. How Did ESG Develop and Why Has it Risen to Prominence?

ESG flows from three main spaces. The first is socially responsible investments (SRI)--
investments driven by particular ethical and moral guidelines. The second is impact
investments (IIs)--investment strategies based on their social or environmental impact,
also known as social return.392 Finally, ESG derives some of its content from CSR efforts.
It is important to note that SRIs and IIs are often exclusionary (i.e., non-compatible
investments are excluded from the pool of investment choices). In contrast, ESG-
compliant integrated investments can be defined as being within a spectrum of ESG
activity.

Figure 1.3 sets out the spectrum of responsible investment strategies and clarifies where
ESG metrics and methodologies may be at play.

 Note. From OECD393

 ESG criteria and investing has taken over capital markets and financial services. The
 OECD has set out three main factors that have made it a perfect storm for ESG growth:

            First, recent industry and academic studies suggest that ESG investing
            can, under certain conditions, help improve risk management and lead
            to returns that are not inferior to returns from traditional financial
            investments. Despite these studies there is a growing awareness of the
            complexity related to the measurement of ESG performances. Second,
            growing societal attention to the risks associated with climate change, the
            benefits of globally-accepted standards of responsible business conduct,
            and the need for diversity in the workplace and on boards, suggests that
            social values will increasingly influence investor and consumer choices
            and may increasingly impact corporate performance. Third, there is
            growing momentum for corporations and financial institutions to move
            away from short-term perspectives of risks and returns, so as to better
            reflect longer-term sustainability in investment performance. In this
            manner, some investors seek to enhance the sustainability of long-term
            returns, and others may wish to incorporate more formalised alignment
            with societal values. In either case, there is growing evidence that the
            sustainability of finance must incorporate broader external factors to
            maximise returns and profits over the long-term, while reducing the
            propensity for controversies that erode stakeholder trust.394

 3. Who Are the Main Players and How Does it Work?

 The question of what is ESG is still open to argument. ESG factors can be metrics, key
 performance indices, categories representing values or corporate priorities, aspirational

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

 goals linked to an organization's vision and mission, decision-making tools, disclosure
 parameters, compliance tools, and risk mitigation tools. In its most common iteration, ESG
 are factors or criteria that have a material financial impact which investors use to make
 investment decisions on capital availability and cost.

 As noted, ESG-integrated investments are not exclusionary but instead lie on a spectrum
 of assimilation, which is relevant for comparative purposes. For example, the UN
 Principles for Responsible Investment (UN PRI),395 has its members accede to voluntary,
 aspirational principles and provides for a "menu of possible actions for incorporating ESG
 issues into investment practice."396 The UN PRI defines "ESG integration" as "the explicit
 and systematic inclusion of ESG issues in investment analysis and investment
 decisions."397

 Furthermore, although an organization may be ESG-focused and compliant, it does not
 mean that it has a positive social impact or is necessarily good for society. For example,
 even though it remains the largest cigarette seller in the world, Philip Morris International
 was included for the first time in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index North America in
 2020.398 399

 The complexity of integrating ESG factors into investment strategies has created the need
 to explain it as a "financial ecosystem"--a cohesive group of players that feed the system
 and consume its output. Figure 1.4 is a depiction of the ESG financial ecosystem as
 described by the OECD.

395 In March 2020, the UN PRI had 3038 signatories, representing $86 trillion under management. For
more information, see Shruti Khairnar, "PRI Signatories Now Exceed $100 Trillion AUM", ESG

It begins with the financial issuer. Financial issuers are organizations that supply equity
or debt to the financial markets--either public or private--and demand capital from
investors. ESG are one of the sets of criteria investors may use to make their decisions.

ESG rating providers are key to the system. Similar to credit rating companies, ESG rating
providers are independent organizations that evaluate issuers based on their disclosure
of ESG factors. Key ESG rating companies include MSCI, Sustainalytics, Bloomberg,
Thomson Reuters, and RobecoSAM. Traditional rating companies also provide ESG
ratings (e.g., Moody's and S&P).401 Each rating provider has its own set of parameters and
metrics that it uses to evaluate issuers. See, for example, Figure 1.5, which sets out the
various ESG criteria measured by different ESG rating providers.

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

 Figure 1.5 ESG Metrics by ESG Rating Companies

Note. From OECD402

The OECD defines ESG index providers and users as follows:

          ESG index providers. A number of providers are also index providers,
          such as MSCI, FTSE Russell, Bloomberg, Thomson Reuters, Vigeo Eiris,
          etc. The use of such indices is growing rapidly as means to track relative
          performance of various ESG tilted market portfolios, from which
          institutional investors can benchmark performance. These index
          providers offer a range of stylised benchmarks that, in turn, allow for
          fund products to be developed for passive or active investment, and also
          for portfolio managers to utilise as a benchmark to compare their ability
          to generate excess risk-adjusted returns. Also, such indices are used by
          ESG funds and ETFs for passive and active investment management. By
          virtue of their growing use as benchmarks for ESG investing, the ways in
          which indices are created, including exclusion, extent of tilting portfolios
          toward issuers with higher ESG scores, and other forms such as thematic
          indices (e.g. high "S" issuers), is currently highly influential in guiding
          overall ESG portfolio management.

          ESG users: asset managers, institutional investors,[403] and public
          authorities. The users of ESG ratings and information include, at the very
          least, types of investors across private and public entities.

Disclosure organizations are also essential to the ESG ecosystem. They provide guidance
and set standards and frameworks for ESG integration and disclosure. For example, the
Sustainability Accounting Standards Board,404 the Global Reporting Initiative,405 and the
Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosure (TCFD)406 all provide frameworks

126                                                                                        2022
                                                            CHAPTER 1 CORRUPTION IN CONTEXT

 and/or standards that structure how an organization reports on the management of its
 ESG risks and results, and how they should disclose such efforts. Other framework
 developers include the United Nations Global Compact, the International Integrated
 Reporting Council (IIRC) and the Climate Disclosure Standards Board (CDSB).
 As noted, a key standard-setter is the UN PRI. Other important players, such as
 institutional investors, have also played a significant role in advancing ESG. For example,
 BlackRock, an American multinational management corporation with a record $9 trillion
 under management, has publicly endorsed ESG criteria and advocated for compliance
 with SASB and TCFD standards.407
 The lens of transparency and disclosure is another way of understanding how ESG criteria
 is created and used. Ultimately, the purpose of ESG parameters is to inform investors how
 issuers are performing against environmental, social and governance metrics. SASB,
 arguably one of the key disclosure organizations, frames ESG as part of a "sustainability
 reporting ecosystem." Figure 1.6 sets out how SASB describes the information flow--from
 creation to use--of a "sustainability reporting ecosystem."

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

Note. From SASB408

In this model, a significant player is the assurers/auditors, which include KPMG, PwC,
EY and Deloitte.409

One of the main criticisms of the ESG is that the parameters used to rate issuers are neither
standardized nor regulated. For example, the International Organization of Securities
Commission (IOSCO) states there is:

          a lack of transparency about the methodologies underpinning ratings or
          data products and an often uneven coverage of products offered across
          industries and geographical areas. IOSCO has observed that this could
          lead to gaps and inconsistencies when applied to investment strategies
          and raise concerns around the management of potential conflicts of
          interest, such as fee structures and insufficient separation of business
          lines that provide advisory services to issuers to improve their ratings
          performance.410

Furthermore, such a lack of standardization and regulation has resulted in an explosion
of greenwashing--the false appearance of a sustainable and ESG-focused issuer through
"green" promotion. As a successful marketing strategy, greenwashing is one of the
biggest concerns that investors have with ESG-integrated investments.411

4. Key ESG Policy and Initiatives

As the ESG movement accelerates, a rally for standardizing ESG metrics is underway,
with various initiatives taking place around the globe.412 It is expected that in the next few
years there will be many changes and much action within this space. The following is a
brief list of ESG policy and initiatives at the time of writing:

 CSA Staff Notice 51-358 - Reporting Climate Change-related Risks. Ontario's Capital
 Markets Modernization Taskforce recommended mandatory ESG disclosure for all non-
 investment fund issuers that comply with the TCFD.

 US

 The United States Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) has formed a task force to
 review ESG-related disclosure--the "Climate and ESG Task Force."413 In June 2021, the
 US House of Representatives passed HR 1187 (the Corporate Governance Improvement and
 Investor Protection Act). If passed by the Senate, the Act may require the SEC to issue rules
 requiring public companies to disclose certain ESG metrics, including ones related to
 climate action, board diversity, and employee management and welfare practices.414

 Europe

 Europe is leading the ESG movement and issued a comprehensive sustainable finance
 package, which includes the EU Taxonomy Climate Delegated Act, The Corporate
 Sustainability Reporting Directive, and amendments to six acts to strengthen fiduciary
 duties, investment and insurance product oversight, and governance practices.415 The EU
 also adopted the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation, which creates mandatory ESG
 disclosure obligations for manufacturers of financial products and financial advisors.416

 United Kingdom

 The UK announced a "roadmap" that will require TCFD-compliant disclosure by 2025
 across all issuers.417

 New Zealand

 The Financial Sector (Climate-related Disclosure and Other Matters) Amendment Bill is
 presently in the review stage. If passed, it will require certain members of the financial
 sector to disclose the impact of climate change on their businesses.

 4.2 Key Policy Initiatives for Standardization of ESG reporting

 Key standards are those set by TCFD, SASB, and GRI.418 Nevertheless, the push to
 homogenise ESG standards is also strong. The following are a few of the significant
 initiatives presently at play:

       · CDP Global, CDSB, GRI, IIRC, and SASB (the "group of five") announced in
            2020 that they are working to develop a "comprehensive corporate reporting
            system."419

       · The International Federation of Accountants called for the creation of an
            International Sustainability Standards Board.420

       · The World Economic Forum's International Business Council created the IBC
            Disclosure Project in conjunction with the Big Four accountancy firms (Deloitte,
            KPMG, EY, and PWC). The project creates "stakeholder capitalism metrics"421
            to be used by companies aligning their sustainability reporting and tracking
            their contributions to the UN Sustainable Development Goals.

 5. ESG and Anti-Corruption

 The "G" in ESG promotes good governance. Therefore, codes of business conduct,
 including codes of conduct, corruption and bribery programs, systems and procedures,
 as well reporting on breaches, etc. are all included within this metric. Another factor that
 is usually involved in governance, for example, is supply chain management, which
 incorporates a supplier's code of conduct.422 However, as reported by Gartner, a leading
 research and advisory company, after reviewing S&P 500 companies' ESG reporting, only
 eight percent of all reference metrics were governance-related.423 One of the issues
 includes how companies report on "G" metrics.

 The UN PRI specifically links anti-corruption commitments made under SDG 16, which
 calls for "peace, justice and strong institutions," indicator 16.5, which explicitly asks
 signatories to "substantially reduce corruption and bribery in all forms,"424 and the UN
 Global Compact's 10th principle against corruption. The WEF IBC Disclosure Project has
 also included SDG 16 as part of its governance disclosure requirements. But, again, the
 "how" to report remains an issue.

 In the spirit of filling the "guidance gap" in this area, Transparency International UK,
 published Open Business--Principles and Guidance for Anti-Corruption Corporate
 Transparency in 2020.425 Open Business is a guidance document on how to disclose
 corporate anti-corruption efforts across five key areas:

       · Anti-corruption programme transparency (including third parties and
            procurement)

       · Beneficial ownership transparency
       · Organisational structure transparency
       · Country-by-country reporting transparency

130                                                                                            2022

       · Corporate political engagement transparency

 6. For Compliance Practitioners

 Compliance executives and anti-corruption practitioners should remain keenly aware of
 ESG developments as the expectation is that ESG-related issues, beyond anti-corruption
 efforts, are headed their way. For example, in its Report on `connecting the business and
 human rights and the anti-corruption agenda,' the United Nations Working Group on the
 issue of human rights and transnational corporations and other business enterprises
 specifically calls for the end of silos within corporations and the merging of certain ESG
 responsibilities with the compliance function.426 Ultimately, the Working Group calls for
 the absorption of the role responsible for human rights by the anti-corruption and
 compliance function.427 Moreover, research by Kroll, a corporate investigations and risk
 consulting firm, has indicated that the expected trend is that ESG is and should be
 included in anti-bribery and corruption programs.428

8.3 Need for Increased Trust in Business

Barbara Kimmel in a FCPA Blog post reports on the Edelman 2017 Trust Barometer as follows:

                                                            BEGINNING OF EXCERPT

 Earlier today Edelman released the findings of its 17th annual Trust Barometer, a poll of
 33,000 respondents in 28 countries. This year's results were strikingly different from their
 2016 findings. In fact, trust to "do what is right" declined in all four major institutions:
 NGOs, Business, Media and Government.

 I had the good fortune of an invitation to a pre-release webinar hosted by Edelman on
 January 13, enabling me to report early on the 2017 Trust Barometer findings.

 As Trust Across America continues its mission to help build trust in business, the
 following are some of the key takeaways from the presentation:

        Only 37 percent of respondents trust the CEO as a credible spokesperson.
        CEO credibility dropped in all 28 markets, reflecting a global crisis of

            leadership.
        82 percent of respondents believe "Big Pharma" needs greater regulation.
        53 percent of respondents do not believe that financial institutions have been

            reined in "enough."
        The main opportunities for businesses to prove they are "doing no harm"

            include focus on bribery, executive compensation, tax havens, overcharging for
            products, and reducing costs by decreasing product quality.
        The ways business can best show they are "doing more" is through their
            treatment of employees, producing high quality products, listening to
            customers, paying their fair share of taxes, and employing ethical business
            practices.
        CEOs must engage in talking "with" not "at" people. They should be more
            spontaneous, blunt, include personal experience in dialogue, and participate in
            their company's social media.
        And finally, Edelman's survey results reflect a fundamental shift from the old
            "For the people" to the new "With the people."

 What actions must big business take?

 It is incumbent on Boards of Directors, CEOs and their C-Suites to:

        Acknowledge that they individually have a problem, and collectively are
            responsible for the growing crisis of trust in business.

        Recognize that trust is indeed a hard asset and a measurable currency, not an
            intangible to be taken for granted.

                                                            CHAPTER 1 CORRUPTION IN CONTEXT

        Find the courage and take action to elevate trust across and among all
            stakeholder groups.

 Through its *FACTS® Framework, Trust Across America's research focus picks up where
 Edelman's findings leave off. For the past eight years we have been measuring the trust
 "worthiness" or integrity of the largest 1,500 U.S. public companies.

 We find that industry is not destiny and a handful of corporate leaders are already
 reaping the rewards of high trust. Edelman's 2017 findings do, however, support our call
 for a different "way" of doing business, and perhaps that "way" will find increasing
 support from big business in 2017.429

                                                                 END OF EXCERPT

The recent 2021 Edelman Trust Barometer presents a slight counter to the 2017 narrative,
with an overall sense of increased trust in business. The 2021 results show that respondents
in 18 out of 27 countries surveyed trusted businesses more than government.430 Moreover,
businesses were the only institution viewed as competent and ethical.431 Nevertheless, CEO
credibility, while slightly increasing from a low rating in 2017, remains weak. Lastly, trust
in financial services has also decreased since 2017, and it remains the least trusted industry
surveyed.432

From a Canadian perspective, the University of Victoria's Gustavson School of Business
produces the Gustavson Brand Trust Index (GBTI) annually. The 2021 GBTI emphasizes
consumers' growing expectations for businesses to align with social and environmental
causes and, alternatively, the resulting loss in trust when a business fails to do so.433 Amazon,
in particular, demonstrates this trend: in 2020, the company lost 17 points in overall brand
trust due to the employment rights and sustainability-related controversies it has
encountered.434

8.4 A Critical View: Pretending CSR and ESG Will Alter `True' Corporate

       Personality

Thus far, the content in Section 8 suggests that CSR and ESG movements provide hope that
corporations will constrain both their illegal activities (such as bribery) and their activities
which are legal, but cause significant harm to basic social values. Skepticism is both
warranted and widely expressed in the public and academic literature on the suggestion
that corporations are likely to constrain, to any significant degree, their ingrained profit-
seeking goals for the sake of CSR and ESG values. While this issue is not addressed in this
chapter, various sources strongly critique the suggestion that corporate social virtue,
conscience or benevolence will ever prevail over profit-making.435

8.5 Legal Counsel and Guiding Corporate Policy

Chapter 8 considers the role of the corporate lawyer in anti-corruption initiatives. Legal
counsel should be prepared to provide corporate clients with guidance on developing
internal policies that will ensure fulfillment of legal and ethical obligations from both an
anti-corruption and CSR perspective. Chapter 8 provides guidance to corporate lawyers
who want to ensure that their clients' anti-corruption policy and programs are conforming
to national and international expectations for corporate behaviour.

9. SUCCESSES AND FAILURES IN INTERNATIONAL CONTROL

9.1 Ten Lessons in Designing Anti-Corruption Initiatives

In the 2011 report Contextual Choices in Fighting Corruption: Lessons Learned,436 prepared by
the Hertie School of Governance for the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation
(NORAD), Alina Mungiu-Pippidi et al. review the successes and failures of the international
community's anti-corruption initiatives and strategies in the previous fifteen years.437 From
this review, the authors extract the lessons learned to help guide future anti-corruption

initiatives. It should be noted that the authors' conclusions are not necessarily agreed upon
by all anti-corruption scholars and practitioners.

The following excerpts are from the Executive Summary and provide an overview of the
report's findings:

                                                            BEGINNING OF EXCERPT

 Why, despite unprecedented investment in anti-corruption in the last fifteen years and
 since the implementation of global monitoring instruments and global legislation, have
 so few countries managed to register progress? This new report commissioned by the
 Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (NORAD) to the Hertie School of
 Governance argues that conceptual flaws, imprecise measurement instruments and
 inadequate strategies are to blame. But it also argues that the quest for public integrity is
 a political one, between predatory elites in a society and its losers and fought primarily
 on domestic playgrounds. As such, the donor community can play only a limited part and
 it needs to play this part strategically in order to create results. Based on new statistical
 evidence, the report recommends cash-on-delivery/selectivity approaches for anti-
 corruption assistance [cash-on-delivery is a term used in the aid community to mean an
 aid scheme whereby funding is only delivered once progress on an agreed upon goal is
 achieved by the aid recipient]. Effective and sustainable policies for good governance
 need to diminish the political and material resources of corruption and build normative
 constraints in the form of domestic collective action. Most of the current anti-corruption
 strategies, on the contrary, focus on increasing legal constraints, which often fail because
 most interventions are localized in societies that lack the rule of law.

 ...

 Most corruption academic literature conceptualizes anti-corruption at the individual
 level, as do most current theories about anti-corruption. This presumes that corruption is
 a deviation from an otherwise established norm of ethical universalism, where every
 citizen is treated equally by the state and all public resources are distributed impartially.
 In fact, outside the developed world, the norm is not ethical universalism, since the
 process of modernization leading to an impersonal state autonomous from private
 interest was never completed in most countries. Most anti-corruption instruments that
 donors favour are norm-infringing instruments from the developed context, when they
 should be norm-building instruments for developing contexts. There is a gross
 inadequacy of institutional imports from developed countries which enjoy rule of law to
 developing contexts, shown in section 6 (Table 13 on page 56) of the report, where
 statistical evidence found no impact by anti-corruption agencies, Ombudsmen-like
 institutions and the ratification of the United Nations Convention against Corruption
 (UNCAC). What is presented in most anti-corruption literature as a principal-agent
 problem is in fact a collective action problem, since societies reach a sub-optimal
 equilibrium of poor governance with an insufficient domestic agency pushing for change.

  The report argues that the question "what causes corruption" is therefore absurd.
 Particularism exists by default, since most human societies have limited resources to

                                                                                                          135
GLOBAL CORRUPTION

 share, and people tend to share them in a particular way, most notably with their closest
 kin and not with everyone else. Modern states are based on universal citizenship, which
 entails fair treatment of every citizen by the government. But there are very few states
 that have thus far succeeded in moving from the natural state to this ideal of modernity.
 The question should change from "what causes corruption" to "what makes particularism
 evolve into universalism". What determines a change in the equilibrium?

 [The report concludes with a list of the ten lessons that can be learned from the fifteen
 years since the World Bank called for a global fight against corruption. Each lesson is
 described in more detail in the report; a brief overview of the lessons follows:]

 1. Although globalization has turned corruption into a global phenomenon ... the
 battlefield where this war is lost or won remains national.... [A] transformation has to
 be reflected in a new equilibrium of power at the society level for it to be both profound
 and sustainable.

 2. Transitions from corrupt regimes to regimes where ethical universalism is the norm
 are political and not technical-legal processes.... The main actors should be broad
 national coalitions, and the main role of the international community is to support
 them in becoming both broad and powerful.... Which windows of opportunities to use,
 what actors have more interest in changing the rules of the game and how to sequence
 the change depends on the diagnosis of each society and cannot be solved by a one-
 size-fits all solution.

 3. Lesson number three is that on this political front, the international community has
 often played an ambiguous and inconsistent role and has thus sabotaged its own
 efforts.... To minimize this in the future, good governance programs and particularly
 UNCAC implementation should be tied to assistance on a cash-by-delivery mechanism
 only.... Diplomacy should also act in concert with aid, promoting representative anti-
 corruption actors in societies and avoiding the `professionalization' of anti-corruption by
 limitation to a circle of `experts'.

 4. Lesson number four is that there are no silver bullets or maverick institutions in
 fighting corruption.

 ...

 5. Lesson number five is about the lack of significant impact (in statistical tests) by the
 UNCAC after five years.... UNCAC is a collection of institutional tools, not all
 similarly effective or useful, of which some have the potential to become effective
 weapons. This is true, however, only if local actors take them up and fight the long fight
 with them. What the international community can do, in any event, is to push UNCAC
 implementation and review as a mechanism to stir collective action. UNCAC will have
 an impact only if the entire society contributes to a check on the government. Such a
 permanent check could play a far more important role than the international review of
 UNCAC.... Accountability to the entire society regarding the implementation of
 UNCAC is a minimal requirement in building the general accountability of

136                                                                                           2022
                                                            CHAPTER 1 CORRUPTION IN CONTEXT

 governments. In this context, the ownership principle in anti-corruption must simply
 be interpreted as ownership by the society, not by the government.

 ...

 6. Lesson number six is about the importance of civil society, for which the report finds
 statistical and qualitative evidence. However, the kind of civil society needed to serve as
 a watchdog at the community as well as national level is frequently missing in many
 countries.... Any country ruled by particularism is bound to have many `losers' who are
 shortcut by networks of privilege. Without their collective action, there is no sustainable
 change in the rules of the game, and their empowerment becomes therefore the chief
 priority.

 ...

 7. Lesson seven is about developing indicators and measures to allow better monitoring
 of trends and impact of policies. The aggregate measures of corruption, particularly the
 WGI Control of Corruption, which allows measuring confidence error on top of
 perceptions of corruption, have played a great role by setting the stage for a global
 competition for integrity among countries. But once it comes to the process of change itself
 and the impact of certain policies, they become less helpful.

 ...

 8. Lesson eight is about the fit of repressive policies to various development contexts.
 It is very risky to fight corruption by repressive means whenever particularism is the
 main allocation norm because some people will be above the law and the selection of
 those to be prosecuted cannot be anything but biased.

 ...

 9. Lesson number nine is that policies of drying resources for corruption are essential,
 along with increasing normative constraints.

 ...

 10. The final lesson is about formalization, which plays an important role in explaining
 corruption.... Societies hide from predatory rulers to defend themselves, and this is
 why it is important that government and society work together for more transparency.
 Successful policies of formalization are based on bargaining, not repression, except in the
 area of criminal economy (smuggling, drugs, traffic, money laundering). Formalization,
 understood as a process of persuasion and incentivizing of property and business
 registration, is an essential step in reducing informality. [footnotes omitted]

Richard Heeks and Harald Mathisen, in "Understanding Success and Failure of Anti-
Corruption Initiatives," argue that anti-corruption initiatives often fail because of "design-

reality gaps," which they describe as "a mismatch between the expectations built into their
design as compared to on-the-ground realities in the context of their implementation.
Successful initiatives find ways to minimize or close these gaps. Effective design and
implementation processes enable gap closure and improve the likelihood of success."438

10. CASE STUDY: BAE ENGAGES IN LARGE-SCALE CORRUPTION IN
    SAUDI ARABIA

In the video "Black Money,"439 Lowell Bergman investigates an $80 billion arms deal
between BAE Systems, a British corporation, and Saudi Arabia. Details of the contract were
not released publicly. At the same time, members of the Saudi royal family and Saudi
government officials received huge personal payments and gifts from BAE. When British

against terrorism. The British prosecutors backed off. The video introduces some of the
major anti-corruption legal developments in international, as well as British and American
law. It highlights the scale with which multinational corporations have been involved in the
shadowy world of international bribery.

In 2010, BAE pled guilty in the US to charges of failing to keep accurate accounting records
and conspiring to make false statements to the US government. Although the charges related
to various cases of corruption, BAE did not, however, admit to actual bribery in the plea
bargain. BAE was required to pay $400 million to the US Treasury. The company avoided
further sanctions, such as debarment from public procurement in the US, because it did not
plead guilty to actual corruption offences. In the same plea deal, BAE was also required to
pay the UK and Tanzania a combined total of £30 million. The UK's Serious Fraud Office
was investigating allegations of corruption by BAE in seven or eight other countries, but
dropped the other cases after settling the Tanzania case.

In 2011, BAE was required to pay a further $79 million as a civil penalty to the US
Department of State for alleged violations of the Arms Export Control Act and the International
Traffic in Arms Regulations. The Department of State imposed a statutory debarment from the
US public procurement process but concurrently rescinded the debarment, implying that
BAE is "too big to debar."440

1. INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW

As noted in Chapter 1, corruption is a broad concept. In part, what counts as corruption is
shaped by social, political and economic beliefs and norms in a given society. While there
are legitimate disputes on whether certain forms of conduct are or should be classified as
corruption, there is a core of conduct which is almost unanimously viewed as corruption.
The fact that the periphery of corruption is grey does not provide any insurmountable
barrier to defining and criminalizing the core of corruption.

If the concept of corruption is generally understood to be, in the words of Transparency
International (TI), "the abuse of entrusted power for private gain,"1 it is readily apparent
that there are many types of behaviour that constitute corrupt abuse of public power for
private gain. For the most part, states create a number of separate offences to deal with
corruption, as opposed to creating a singular "corruption offence." These separate offences
can be defined narrowly to apply only to corrupt behaviour in the sense of the misuse of
public power or they may be defined to apply more broadly to all persons, whether or not
those persons are in positions of public power. For example:

     · Theft (embezzlement) is (in general) the unlawful taking of another's property.
          When that taking is by a public official in respect to public funds, that conduct is
          corrupt. States can treat this latter corrupt behaviour as simply one example of the
          general offence of theft, or can create a specific crime of corruption called theft by
          public officials in respect to their entrusted powers.

     · Fraud is (in general) the unlawful taking or use of another's property by dishonest
          means (i.e., lies, false pretences, omission of material information, etc.). When that
          fraud is committed by a public official in respect to their public functions that
          conduct is corrupt. States can treat this latter conduct as simply one example of the
          general offence of fraud, or they can create a specific crime of fraud by public
          officials carrying out their public duties. Bribes offered or received in the context of
          public procurement and bid rigging can be treated as offences of fraud or as specific
          corruption offences.

     · Extortion is a third example. It is (in general) a crime of theft which is committed by
          threatening economic or physical harm to another, unless the threatened person
          gives the person making the threat the money or other benefit or advantage being
          demanded. Once again, extortion can be committed by or in respect to a public
          official in the context of their public functions in which case the conduct can be
          criminalized under a specific crime of extortion by, or of, public officials, or it can
          be treated as one example of the general offence of extortion.

On the other hand, there are offences that are specifically created to deal with the corrupt
behaviour of public officials in respect to their public functions. For example:

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

     · Bribery is (in general) the asking or taking by a public official of a benefit or
          advantage for private gain in exchange for a misuse of the official's entrusted
          powers. Bribery is also a bilateral offence--it may criminalize the conduct of the
          public official and also the conduct of third-party bribers who have offered, given
          or agreed to give a bribe to a public official.

     · Buying or selling a public office or exercising or promising to exercise improper
          influence on an appointment to a public office is an offence of corruption and is a
          specific offence in the penal codes of many nations.

There are other offences relevant to corruption and bribery. These offences include money
laundering and books and records offences, which are seen as necessary to effectively fight
against the commission of large-scale bribery, as well as other economic crimes.

Susan Rose-Ackerman notes that enforcement and monitoring alone will not adequately
address corruption. She states:

          Reform should not be limited to the creation of "integrity systems" or
          "anticorruption agencies." Instead, fundamental changes in the way
          government operates ought to be at the heart of the reform agenda. The
          primary goal should be to reduce the underlying incentives to engage in
          corruption ex ante, not to tighten systems of ex post control. Enforcement and
          monitoring are needed, but they will have little long-term impact if reforms
          do not reduce the basic conditions that encourage payoffs. If these
          incentives and institutions remain, the elimination of one set of "bad
          apples" will soon lead to the creation of a new group of corrupt officials and
          private bribe payers.2

As noted in Chapter 1, the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC) has
been ratified by 187 countries across the globe.3 It is undoubtedly the most influential
international anti-corruption instrument. UNCAC contains both mandatory and optional
corruption offences and provisions. Signatories to UNCAC and members of the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Convention on Combating
Corruption of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions (OECD
Convention) are required to implement mandatory offences and to consider implementing
optional offences. Both types of provisions are listed below.

Mandatory Offences:

     (1) Bribery of National Public Officials;
     (2) Bribery of Foreign Public Officials;
     (3) Public Embezzlement;

     (9) Books and Records Offences.4

The OECD Convention is restricted to criminalizing bribery of foreign public officials in the
course of international business transactions. The OECD Convention does not contain
offence provisions on items (1), (3) and (5) listed above from UNCAC.

As you will see in the course of reading this chapter, domestic law in the US, UK, and Canada
incorporates all the mandatory provisions set out in the list above, albeit with
slightly different language and scope. Appendix 2.1 of this chapter references the exact
provisions in each country that correspond to the UNCAC provisions.

Optional Offences:

     (1) Foreign Official Taking a Bribe;
     (2) Giving a Bribe for Influence Peddling;
     (3) Accepting a Bribe for Influence Peddling;
     (4) Abuse of Public Function to Obtain a Bribe;
     (5) Illicit Enrichment;
     (6) Private Sector Bribery;
     (7) Embezzlement in the Private Sector; and
     (8) Concealing Bribery Property.

Apart from the offence of illicit enrichment, these optional offences can also be found in US,
UK and Canadian law.

While UNCAC and the OECD Convention include a number of corruption offences, this
chapter explores the two most commonly charged offences: (1) bribery of national and
foreign public officials and (2) books and records offences. The other Convention offences
are listed in Appendix 2.1 at the end of this chapter. The offence of money laundering
is explored in detail in Chapter 4. The remainder of this chapter involves a
description of the elements of and relevant defences to bribery and books and
records offences both domestically and in foreign countries under:

     (1) UNCAC;
     (2) OECD Convention;
     (3) US law, especially the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA);

4 UNCAC does not require State Parties to "criminalize" books and records offences per se but
instead requires signatories to take necessary steps to prevent the creation and use of improper and
fraudulent books and records.

                                                                                                          143
GLOBAL CORRUPTION

     (4) UK law, especially the Bribery Act 2010; and
     (5) Canadian law, especially the Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act (CFPOA).

Chapter 3 then continues with an analysis of several general criminal law principles that are
relevant to defining the scope of bribery and books and records offences, namely:

     (1) Extra-territorial jurisdiction for bribery offences;
     (2) Criminal liability of corporations and other legal entities;
     (3) Party or accomplice liability; and
     (4) Inchoate liability (attempts, conspiracy and solicitation).

An understanding of the foreign bribery laws of the US and UK is of particular importance
for lawyers and their corporate clients in other jurisdictions because these two countries
have broad extra-territorial jurisdiction provisions in their bribery statutes. Foreign persons
and companies can often be prosecuted under US or UK law. For example, a Canadian
company which offers a bribe to a public official in Bangladesh can be prosecuted not only
in Canada, but also in the US under the FCPA if the Canadian company's shares are listed
on the New York Stock Exchange (or any other US Stock Exchange).

2. DOMESTIC BRIBERY

2.1 UNCAC

      2.1.1 Bribery of a National Public Official

Article 15 of UNCAC requires State Parties to create a criminal offence in respect to "the
classic form of corruption"5: bribery of its public officials. Article 15 states:

          Article 15. Bribery of national public officials
          Each State Party shall adopt such legislative and other measures as may be
          necessary to establish as criminal offences, when committed intentionally:

                (a) The promise, offering or giving, to a public official, directly or
                     indirectly, of an undue advantage, for the official himself or
                     herself or another person or entity, in order that the official act or
                     refrain from acting in the exercise of his or her official duties;

                (b) The solicitation or acceptance by a public official, directly or
                     indirectly, of an undue advantage, for the official himself or
                     herself or another person or entity, in order that the official act or
                     refrain from acting in the exercise of his or her official duties.

Cecily Rose et al. describe why this prohibition is universally recognized as a core measure
to combatting corruption:

          [B]ribery not only influences a concrete act or a single decision of a public
          official, but also undermines public institutions and -- in the long run --
          the political architecture in general. Since a corrupt public official weakens
          both the functioning and the reputation of institutions, all states, whether
          they may be of a democratic or autocratic nature, have a rational interest in
          prohibiting bribery in the public sector. Therefore, all national criminal
          codes across the world include, in one form or another, the essential content
          of the provision.6

Further, Rose et al. comment on the purpose of Article 15, particularly given its
"comprehensive scope":

          [O]ne must keep in mind that UNCAC applies to a broad variety of states
          with different political systems, cultures, and levels of development ...
          Article 15 hence cannot be solely conceptualised as an instrument to
          safeguard democracy and the rule of law. Rather, Article 15 must be based
          on a common `minimum' valid for all states parties, irrespective of their
          social development and their political architecture.... In developing
          countries, criminalising the bribery of national public officials shall
          therefore help to establish well-functioning state institutions and good
          government practices. In states, however, with functioning democratic
          institutions and respect for the rule of law, the provision shall help to
          immunise the status quo against the plague of corruption.7

(i) Active and Passive Bribery

Article 15(a) is sometimes referred to as "active" bribery of a domestic public official, while
Article 15(b) is sometimes called "passive" bribery. "Active" bribery refers to the giving or
the offering of a bribe or other form of "undue advantage" to a national public official.
"Passive" bribery, though somewhat a misnomer, refers to the actions of the corrupt public
official who accepts, or in some cases, actively solicits, a bribe.

Marshet Tadesse Tessema and Raymond Koen note that "the mens rea for passive bribery
and active bribery is the same, that is, intentional commission of the material elements
comprising the actus reus ... [t]he material element which is unique to passive bribery is the
solicitation or acceptance of the undue advantage."8

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

(ii) Public Official

Bribery is an offence involving public officials. "Public official" is defined in Article 2(a) of
UNCAC as follows:

          "Public official" shall mean: (i) any person holding a legislative, executive,
          administrative or judicial office of a State Party, whether appointed or
          elected, whether permanent or temporary, whether paid or unpaid,
          irrespective of that person's seniority; (ii) any other person who performs a
          public function including for a public agency or public enterprise, or
          provides a public service as defined in the domestic law of the State Party
          and as applied in the pertinent area of law of that State Party; (iii) any other
          person defined as a "public official" in the domestic law of a State Party.

Michael Kubiciel notes that the UNCAC definition of "public official" is very broad.9 It
includes persons who do not hold official positions but perform a public function or provide
a public service (i.e. "public officials by status" such as "policemen, customs officers,
members of the armed forces, judges, [an]d public prosecutors" and "public officials by
function" such as those "working for a public agency or enterprise, or providing a public
service irrespective of their formal status"10). This definition is more expansive than the
definition prescribed by earlier multilateral conventions. The definition recognizes that even
those who do not occupy official positions may still exercise influence and be subject to
corruption.

(iii) Undue Advantage

Another key term in Article 15 is "undue advantage." The United Nations Office on Drugs
and Crime (UNODC)'s Legislative Guide for the Implementation of the United Nations Convention
against Corruption states that an "undue advantage may be something tangible or intangible,
whether pecuniary or non-pecuniary."11 As Kubiciel notes, the word "undue" is an
imprecise term, and Rose et al. note that UNCAC's wording provides for both "the strict and

9 Michael Kubiciel, "Core Criminal Law Provisions in the United Nations Convention Against
Corruption" (2009) 9 Intl Crim L Rev 139. Hannes Hechler, Mathias Huter & Ruggero Scaturro

Corruption Resource Centre, Chr Michelsen Institute, 2019), online:
<https://www.u4.no/publications/uncac-in-a-nutshell-2019>. Note also, that despite the apparent
breadth of the definition, the idea of the "public official" may nevertheless spark normative debates
and disputes in crafting the domestic law that is directed at criminalizing bribery in compliance with
UNCAC. See for example: Max Lesch, "Multiplicity, hybridity, and normativity: disputes about the
UN convention against corruption in Germany" (2020) International Relations, online:

more flexible interpretation"12 to be implemented into national laws (as indeed, it is national
law that will define what constitutes an "undue" advantage). According to a strict
interpretation, "undue advantage" could mean all types of advantages, even small,
culturally acceptable gifts. The word "undue" could also support a flexible interpretation
and exclude gifts of low value that are generally socially acceptable (e.g., a cup of coffee).
He warns, however, that the "line between an acceptable gift and corruption is thin."13 A
tradition of gift-giving should not necessarily be an automatic defence to a bribery charge.
Kubiciel argues that states should be careful to evaluate which behaviours are actually
cultural traditions, and moreover whether even those that can be characterized as cultural
traditions are nonetheless harmful to public confidence in the state. Some countries deal
with the issue by passing laws or regulations requiring all public officials to report (and
sometimes surrender) to an appropriate authority a) the receipt of any gift/advantage, or b)
the receipt of a gift/advantage over a specified monetary value.

Tessema and Koen state that undue advantage "may be corporeal or incorporeal, pecuniary
or non-pecuniary" and "need not be for the benefit of the bribee but can be directed at any
other person with whom the bribee has some affiliation."14 However, the conduct associated
with the undue advantage "must be aimed at inducing the bribee `to act or refrain from
acting', in breach of his or her duties, for the benefit of the briber."15 Additionally, legal
entities (broader than legal persons) can be the beneficiary of a bribe for the purposes of
Article 15.16

Further, Rose et al. write that, because "the provision ... does not relate to an act of a public
official that is illegal in itself[,] rather ... the crime of bribery derives its unlawfulness from
the mere fact that an act of a public official is being linked with an undue advantage[,] ...
Article 15 also covers a facilitation payment, that merely expedites the performance of duties
of non-discretionary nature, ie, lawful acts, which public officials are already bound to
perform."17

(iv) Offering, Promising or Giving

Article 15(a) criminalizes the "offering, promising or giving" of an undue advantage.
Therefore, the unilateral offer of a bribe, irrespective of whether the offer was accepted, must
be criminalized by State Parties. Further, because the briber need only make a `promise,'
they need not have the resources to provide an undue advantage or actually intend to give
the undue advantage to the public official.18

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

(v) Soliciting or Accepting

Similarly, a request for a bribe, whether or not a bribe is agreed to or is actually given is to
be criminalized (Article 15(b)). Rose et al. argue that the prohibition of an "acceptance" of
an "undue advantage" (Article 15(b)) should be interpreted to mean that an offence is
committed even if the public official acquiesces to the offer of a bribe, but subsequently
returns the bribe or does not follow through on performance of the corrupt agreement.19 The
latter circumstances would be, however, relevant to determining an appropriate sentence
for the public official. It also raises the issue of whether voluntary withdrawal from the
bribery scheme might be accepted as a defence as it is in the law of attempts in some
countries.

(vi) Intention

Article 15 clearly states that the prohibited conduct in that article must be committed
intentionally. Tessema and Koen posit that since UNCAC does not stipulate a required form
of intention for corruption, it "implies that any form of intention will suffice." 20

The phrase in subparagraphs (a) and (b) "in order to act or refrain from acting in matters
relevant to official duties" requires that "some link must be established between the offer or
advantage and inducing the official to act or refrain from acting in the course of his or her
official duties."21 In instances where the accused offers a bribe that is not accepted, the
accused must have intended to offer the advantage and must also have intended to influence
the behaviour of the recipient in the future.22 Kubiciel notes that this phrase does not
expressly prohibit instances where an undue advantage is offered or received by an official
after the official has acted or refrained from acting in the exercise of his or her official duties.
It could be argued that such conduct does constitute "indirectly" giving an undue advantage
if the parties know or reasonably suspect that an undue advantage will be given after the
fact. Alternatively, if courts do not adopt the interpretation of "indirectly," State Parties
could consider implementing legislation that criminalizes this type of behaviour. Rose et al.
note that a number of national criminal codes do cover these ex post facto payments, and that
these schemes "enhance prosecution in cases of repeated offences or when agreement has
been reached that the bribe would be paid after the accomplishment or omission of an
official act and the prosecutorial authorities have difficulties in proving the existence of such
a previous agreement."23

      2.1.2 Defences

There are no special defences for domestic bribery under UNCAC. Of course, the absence of
any elements of the offences in Articles 15 to 25 will constitute a defence.

Article 28 of UNCAC deals with knowledge, intent and purpose as elements of an offence.
The provision states that "[k]nowledge, intent or purpose [is] required as an element of an
offence established in accordance with this Convention may be inferred from objective
factual circumstances." Absence of these objective factual circumstances is a defence if the
knowledge, intent or purpose is not proven in another way. The Legislative Guide provides
that "national drafters should see that their evidentiary provisions enable such inference
with respect to the mental state of an offender, rather than requiring direct evidence, such
as a confession, before the mental state is deemed proven."24 Despite its non-mandatory
nature, most State Parties have adopted a similar evidentiary standard to Article 28.25 The
issue of whether facilitation payments are prohibited by UNCAC is discussed in Section 4.

      2.1.3 Limitation Periods

Article 29 of UNCAC sets out its requirements in respect to limitation periods. Article 29
states:

          Each State Party shall, where appropriate, establish under its domestic law
          a long statute of limitations period in which to commence proceedings for
          any offence established in accordance with this Convention and establish a
          longer statute of limitations period or provide for the suspension of the
          statute of limitations where the alleged offender has evaded the
          administration of justice.

The Legislative Guide notes "the concern underlying this provision is to strike a balance
between the interests of swift justice, closure and fairness to victims and defendants and the
recognition that corruption offences often take a long time to be discovered and
established."26 This justifies the wording of Article 29, which requires states to "introduce
long periods for all offences established in accordance with the Convention and longer
periods for alleged offenders that have evaded the administration of justice."27

The provisions under UNCAC with regard to limitation periods parallel those under the
OECD Convention, but with the additional option of suspending the limitation period when
the offender is found to have been evading the administration of justice. The Legislative Guide
suggests two ways that State Parties may implement Article 29. The first is to review the
length of time provided for by existing statutes of limitations. The second is to review the
way in which limitation periods are calculated. The Legislative Guide notes that "Article 29
does not require State Parties without statutes of limitation to introduce them."28

      2.1.4 Sanctions

UNCAC has very little in the way of requirements or guidance for sanctions and sentencing
in regard to corrupt conduct. It does not specify any maximum or minimum sentences for

corruption offences. Instead, Article 12(1) of UNCAC provides that "each State Party shall
take measures, in accordance with ... its domestic law ... to provide effective, proportionate
and dissuasive civil, administrative or criminal penalties" for violation of corruption
prevention standards and offences involving the private sector. In addition, Article 30(1)
provides that "each State Party shall make the commission of [corruption] offences ... liable
to sanctions that take into account the gravity of that offence." As an ancillary consequence,
Article 30(7) indicates that State Parties should consider disqualification of persons
convicted of corruption from holding public office for a period of time.

2.2 OECD Convention

As the name of the Convention implies, the OECD Convention on Combating Corruption of
Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions only deals with bribery of foreign
public officials, not domestic public officials.29 Thus the OECD Convention is not relevant to
this section on domestic bribery.

2.3 US

      2.3.1 Bribery of a National Public Official

Domestic bribery is criminalized under both state and federal criminal law. Federal law (18
USC, c 11) sets out a number of offenses dealing with bribery, graft and conflict of interest.
The principal federal section prohibiting both active and passive bribery is section 201 of 18
USC. Section 201(b)(1) criminalizes any person who "directly or indirectly, corruptly gives,
offers or promises anything of value" to--or for the benefit of--any public official--or
person nominated or selected to be a public official--with intent to influence any official act
or the commission of any act of fraud by that official on the US, or to induce a public official
to violate that official's lawful duties. Section 201(b)(2) creates similar offenses for a public
official to "corruptly demand, seek, receive, accept or agree to receive or accept anything of
value" in return for improper influence or use of his or her public powers and duties. Section
201(a) defines the terms "public official," "person selected as a public official," and "official
act." These offenses are similar to bribery offenses in most countries. The conduct (actus reus)
elements which need to be proven are: (1) the offering/giving or seeking/receiving of
"anything of value" to or by (2) a current or selected public official for (3) improper influence
of an official act or duty. The mental element (mens rea) is doing so "corruptly with intent to
influence an official act or duty." The expression "anything of value" is very wide and can
include many things other than money. Additionally, there is no minimum economic value
(or dollar figure) placed on a thing of value. For example, a prosecutor who offers an
accomplice immunity or leniency is offering a thing of value, but that is not bribery because
the offer is not for a corrupt purpose. "Public official" is also defined widely. The expression
"an official act" is defined in § 201(a) as follows:

29 OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business
Transactions, 17 December 1997, S Treaty Doc No 105-43 (entered into force 15 February 1999), online:
<http://www.oecd.org/daf/anti-bribery/oecdantibriberyconvention.htm>.

150                                                                                                    2022
                                                         CHAPTER 2 BRIBERY & OTHER OFFENCES

          (3) the term "official act" means any decision or action on any question,
          matter, cause, suit, proceeding or controversy, which may at any time be
          pending, or which may by law be brought before any public official, in such
          official's official capacity, or in such official's place of trust or profit.

In McDonnell v United States,30 the US Supreme Court interpreted the meaning of "official
act." The Court held that the prosecutor must "identify a question, matter, cause, suit,
proceeding or controversy involving the formal exercise of governmental power, that the
pertinent question, matter, cause, suit, proceeding or controversy was required to be
something specific and focused that was pending or could by law be brought before any
public official"31 and then prove the public official made a decision or took action on that
issue or agreed to do so. The action taken must involve formal exercise of governmental
power similar in nature to a lawsuit, determination before an agency or hearing before a
committee.32 In this regard, a typical meeting, call or event will not be an "official act." The
Court was critical of the prosecution's expansive definition of "official act" noting that
"White House counsel who worked in every administration from that of President Reagan
to President Obama warn that the Government's `breathtaking expansion of public
corruption law would likely chill federal officials' interactions with the people they serve
and thus damage their ability effectively to perform their duties.'"33

The US Supreme Court's decision has been widely criticized and has provoked calls for
reform.34 However, more recent commentators have suggested that McDonnell has had a
limited impact on subsequent litigation.35 In three subsequent cases, namely, Cordaro v
United States, 2017 WL 6311696 (MD Pa); United States v Lee 919 F (3d) 340 (6th Cir 2019); and

30 McDonnell v US, 2 136 S Ct 2355 (2016) [McDonnell]. For a brief summary of the case, see Richard L

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

Tanoos v State, 137 NE (3d) 1008 (Ind Ct App 2019), the Courts declined to extend McDonnell
beyond a very narrow interpretation. Jacques Singer-Emery comments:

          [The] initial indicators [i.e. that the decision triggered "a string of significant
          defeats for public integrity prosecutors] did not develop into a larger trend,
          and McDonnell has not turned out to be as much of an impediment to federal
          corruption prosecutions as some critics feared. Subsequent government
          prosecutions and court decisions have made this clear. Consider the
          following examples:

                · Although, as noted above, a federal appellate court vacated the
                     convictions of Sheldon Silver and Dean Skelos in light of McDonnell,
                     federal prosecutors retried both defendants, and both were
                     convicted by new juries that received instructions consistent with
                     McDonnell.

                · Similarly, another federal appeals court concluded that McDonnell
                     required it to vacate a jury verdict against Congressman Chaka
                     Fattah for five counts of corruption, but noted that several of the
                     charges could "be reconsidered by a properly instructed jury." This
                     reasoning was also used by a different federal appeals court in a
                     case called United States v. Van Buren.

                · Furthermore, in United States v. Conrad, a separate appellate court
                     held that merely "facilitating the award of government contracts"
                     was still an "official act." This approach was also accepted by
                     another federal appellate court in United States v. Repak.

                · Broadening this liability further, an appellate court in United States
                     v. Lee held that a defendant was still culpable if he "use[d] his
                     official position to exert pressure on another official to perform an
                     `official act,' or if an official `use[d] his position to provide advice to
                     another official, knowing or intending that such advice[] form the
                     basis for an `official act' by the other official.'"

                · Notwithstanding the De Blasio case, where prosecutors appear to
                     have decided not to press charges due in part to the difficulties of
                     proof under McDonnell's more demanding standard, it does not
                     seem that McDonnell has had a broader chilling effect on
                     anticorruption prosecutions, which have continued apace. For
                     example, federal prosecutors have brought multiple corruption
                     charges against Chicago Alderman Ed Burke, as part of an ongoing
                     probe into a Chicago political corruption ring, and have also
                     indicted and/or convicted public officials on corruption charges in
                     places like Atlanta and Philadelphia.

          This is only a partial list--the larger point is that the track record of federal
          corruption prosecutions after McDonnell is inconsistent with the strong
          predictions that the decision would make such prosecutions so difficult that
          bribery would be, as a practical matter, "legalized." Of course, this does not

152  2022
                                                         CHAPTER 2 BRIBERY & OTHER OFFENCES

          mean that McDonnell was rightly decided, or that the case had no impact.
          After all, other than the cases that were publicly dropped or reversed after
          McDonnell, it is almost impossible to know what investigations federal
          prosecutors did not pursue because of McDonnell, and it's entirely possible
          that the decision did dissuade federal prosecutors from pursuing more
          difficult cases. But on the whole, it appears that most federal courts have
          interpreted McDonnell narrowly rather than broadly, and, as a result,
          prosecutors are still able to pursue public corruption cases vigorously and
          often successfully.36

David Kwok notes that "[i]t is likely that public officials widely benefit from the improved
clarity of the McDonnell holding. They now know the bright-line rule. Thus, to the extent
they consider accepting any payment or gift in exchange for a meeting, they can safely make
the decision knowing that there is no threat of federal criminal liability."37

In regard to the mental element--a corrupt intent to influence, or be influenced in, the
commission of an official act--the US Supreme Court has held that the prosecution must
establish a quid pro quo, that is "specific intent to give or receive something of value in
exchange for an official act."38 This excludes vague expectations or generalized hope of some
future benefit and in this way excludes election campaign donations if they are not made in
exchange for a specific official act.39

Section 201(c) creates a separate offense sometimes referred to as giving or promising "illegal
gratuities." This provision is not punished as severely as violations of section 201(b).40
Section 201(c) involves giving or accepting a gratuity for or because of the performance of
an official act. There is no need to show the official act was conducted improperly or illegally,
nor any need to show a quid pro quo for the gratuity. In effect, the section provides that it is
an offense to give or accept a gratuity in respect to the official's public duties. As the US
Supreme Court said in Sun-Diamond Growers "[F]or bribery there must be a quid pro quo--a
specific intent to give or receive something of value in exchange for an official act. An illegal
gratuity, on the other hand, may constitute merely a reward for some future act that the

public official will take (and may already have determined to take), or for a past act that he
has already taken."41

      2.3.2 Defenses

A person charged with a domestic bribery or illegal gratuities offense is entitled to plead
any general defense that is applicable to any other crime. These defenses might include
claims of entrapment or abuse of due process, but both of these defenses have requirements
that will limit their availability in most bribery cases. If a person engages in bribery under
physical duress, that duress will constitute a defense if the general requirements for the
defense of duress exist. Likewise, necessity may be a defense, if there was no other
reasonable option but to pay a bribe. For example, paying a bribe (which was more than a
facilitation payment) to a customs officer who demands a bribe before allowing a shipload
of perishable goods to be lawfully unloaded may well be excused on the basis of necessity
(assuming there was no other reasonable option). Likewise, the general defenses of double
jeopardy, res judicata and incapacity are available. Also, prosecution of the offense is barred
if the prosecution violates an applicable state or federal statute of limitations.42

      2.3.3 Limitation Periods

No specific limitation periods are set out in US domestic bribery provisions. Accordingly,
the general statute of limitations of five years for non-capital offenses applies to the bribery
offences under the US Code.43 This five-year limitation can be extended by three more years
in certain circumstances (see Section 3.3.3).

      2.3.4 Sanctions

According to § 202(b)(4), whoever commits the offense of bribery under § 202(b) "shall be
fined under this title [a maximum of $250,000 for individuals or $500,000 for organizations]
or not more than three times the monetary equivalent of the thing of value, whichever is the
greater, or imprisoned for not more than fifteen years, or to both, and may be disqualified
from holding any office of honor, trust, or profit under the United States." Anyone
committing the offense of illegal gratuities under § 201(c) is "fined under this title [a
maximum of $250,000 for individuals or $500,000 for organizations] or imprisoned for not
more than two years, or both." The actual sentences imposed for both offenses are subject to
the US Federal Sentencing Guidelines.44 For a description of sentencing principles and
practices applicable to corruption offenses, see Chapter 7, Section 4.

2.4 UK

      2.4.1 Bribery Act 2010

The Bribery Act 2010 (Bribery Act) came into force on July 1, 2011. It is the culmination of 10
to 12 years of study, consultation and debate.45 The Bribery Act constitutes a codification of
the law of bribery in England which prior to that time was a complex amalgamation of
statute and common law.46 The Bribery Act creates four bribery offences. There are two
general offences: (1) offering or giving a bribe and (2) accepting a bribe. There is also a third
offence of bribing a foreign public official and a new fourth offence of failure of a
"commercial organization" to prevent bribery by one of its associates.

The Bribery Act is broad in several respects. Both domestic and foreign bribery are covered
in this one statute. And as will be discussed in Chapter 3, the extra-territorial reach of the
Bribery Act is quite extensive. Further, apart from the offence of bribing a foreign public
official, the other three offences apply to giving or taking a bribe in both the public and the
private sectors. This lack of distinction between public and private or commercial bribery has
been criticized by Stuart Green. Green advocates treating commercial bribery as a crime, but
also argues that its treatment should be distinguished from that of public bribery due to the
distinct "moral and political character"47 of public bribery. As explained by Peter Alldridge,
commercial or private bribery "distort[s] the operation of a legitimate market," while public
bribery creates "a market in things that should never be sold."48

With the exception of bribery of a foreign public official, the other three bribery offences
apply to both domestic and foreign activities over which the UK asserts fairly wide
jurisdiction. This section covers the latter three offences which apply both domestically and
to certain foreign activities. The offence of bribery of a foreign official will be dealt with in
Section 3.4.49

45 GR Sullivan notes in "The Bribery Act 2010: An Overview" (2011) Crim L Rev 87 at 87, n9, that "the
reform process was initiated by the publication of the Law Commission, Legislating the Criminal Code:

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

      2.4.2 Offences

(i) Offences of Bribing another Person: Section 1

Section 1 of the UK Bribery Act sets out two cases or scenarios in which a person will be
guilty of the offence of "bribing another person" or "active bribery." In both cases, section
1(5) specifies that it does not matter whether the bribe is made by a person directly or
through a third party. Furthermore, it does not matter if the bribe is actually completed; the
offer or promise is enough to make out the offence. The offence of bribing another person in
Case 1 (section 1(2)) occurs where a person "offers, promises or gives a financial or other
advantage to another person," and intends that advantage to either "induce a person to
perform improperly a relevant function or activity," or "reward a person for the improper
performance of such a function or activity." This means the parties must intend acts beyond
the offering or receiving of the bribe. Section 1(4) stipulates that it does not matter whether
the person who has been bribed is the same person who is to perform (or has already
performed) the activity in question. Section 1(3) describes Case 2 as a situation where a
person "offers, promises or gives a financial or other advantage to another person," and
"knows or believes that the acceptance of the advantage would itself constitute the improper
performance of a relevant function or activity." The receiver need not behave improperly
nor even intend to do so; in this case, the receipt of the advantage is itself improper. Note
also that "person," as defined by the UK Interpretation Act 1978, extends to "a body of
persons corporate or unincorporate" and thus a body corporate can be liable if its "directing
mind and will"50 was implicated in the wrongdoing.

The expression "a relevant function or activity," which is a component of the offence in all
cases, is described in section 3 of the Bribery Act as:

     (a) any function of a public nature,
     (b) any activity connected with a business [which includes a trade or profession],
     (c) any activity performed in the course of a person's employment, and
     (d) any activity performed by or on behalf of a body of persons (whether corporate or

          unincorporate).

The activity, if one of the above, must then meet one or more of the following conditions:

      Condition A is that a person performing the function or activity is expected to
          perform it in good faith.

      Condition B is that a person performing the function or activity is expected to
          perform it impartially.

      Condition C is that a person performing the function or activity is in a position of
          trust by virtue of performing it.

                                                         CHAPTER 2 BRIBERY & OTHER OFFENCES

A function or activity can be "relevant" even if it has no connection with the UK at all and
is performed outside of the UK. This question of the jurisdictional reach of the UK Bribery
Act is more fully examined in Chapter 3, Section 1.8.

Section 4 of the Bribery Act explains that a relevant function or activity is performed
"improperly" if it is performed in breach of a relevant expectation or where there is a failure
to perform the function in circumstances where that failure is itself a breach of a relevant
expectation. Relevant expectations are described in Conditions A, B and C. Therefore, a
person exercising a relevant function will be expected to act in good faith, to perform their
function impartially or to avoid breaching trust. This means that the performance of the
function in Case 1, or the mere acceptance of the financial advantage in Case 2, might be
improper if it demonstrates bad faith, partiality or a breach of trust.51

Finally, section 5(1) states that "the test of what is expected is a test of what a reasonable
person in the United Kingdom would expect in relation to the performance of the type of
function or activity concerned." Section 5(2) adds that if the performance is not part of the
law of the UK, then local customs and practices must be disregarded unless they are part of
the written law (either legislative or judicially created) applicable to the country or territory
in question. Ultimately this extends UK norms and standards to foreign sovereign nations,
a position which raises "the need for active collaboration between jurisdictions" and
furthermore "is likely to raise concerns for corporate legal advisers when advising their
corporate clients on whether or not to self-report."52 According to the Joint Committee on
the Draft Bribery Bill, the UK Government's deliberate intention is to "encourage a change
in culture in emerging markets" by eliminating local custom from a criminal court's
considerations.

(ii) Offences Relating to Being Bribed: Section 2

Section 2 of the Bribery Act sets out four cases in which a person will be guilty of offences
related to being bribed. The offence of "being bribed" is sometimes referred to as "passive
bribery" despite the fact that section 2 also includes active conduct on the part of a
government official or other person "requesting" a bribe. The offences are formulated in a
rather complex way and often appear to overlap, but the drafter's intention is to ensure that
the provisions will cover all the ways in which being bribed might occur.53 In all cases, it
does not matter if the person actually receives the bribe; the offence may be made out simply
by requesting or agreeing to receive the bribe.

51 GR Sullivan points out that such a finding would be easy to prove in cases where an individual
takes a bribe in advance of some decision he or she is due to make in their capacity as a judge, civil
servant, agent, etc., where the briber has an interest that may be affected by the individual's decision.
Evidence of taking this advantage may be proof in and of itself of improper performance even before
a decision is made; Sullivan, supra note 45 at 90, n 15.

                                                                                                          157
GLOBAL CORRUPTION

There are four possible routes to liability:

          Section 2(2): The first offence is described as "Case 3" (Cases 1 and 2 are
          dealt with in section 1). In this scenario, the person "requests, agrees to
          receive or accepts an advantage, whether or not he actually receives it;
          intending that, in consequence, a relevant function or activity should be
          performed improperly" (whether by [the person mentioned] or another
          person).54 The key in this case is that the recipient of the bribe intends
          improper performance to follow as a consequence of the bribe. The
          improper performance may be done by the receiver or by another person.

          Section 2(3): In Case 4, a person is guilty where he or she "requests, agrees
          to receive or accepts a financial or other advantage" and "the request,
          agreement or acceptance itself constitutes the improper performance by [the
          person] of a relevant function or activity."55 In this case, the taking of the
          bribe in and of itself amounts to improper performance of the relevant
          function. As described above with regard to Case 2, for this case to be made
          out the request, agreement or acceptance must itself prove bad faith,
          partiality, or a breach of trust. For example, the offence would be made out
          if a civil servant requested $1000 in order to process a routine application.56

          Section 2(4): Case 5 deals with a person who requests, agrees to receive or
          accepts the bribe "as a reward for the improper performance ... of a relevant
          function or activity."57 The performance can be done by the person being
          bribed or another person.

          Section 2(5): Finally, Case 6 deals with a situation where, "in anticipation of
          or in consequence of [a person] requesting, agreeing to receive or accepting
          a financial or other advantage, a relevant function or activity is performed
          improperly" (either by that person or by another person at the culpable
          receiver's request or with the receiver's assent or acquiescence).58 According
          to section 2(8), if a person performing the function or activity is someone
          other than the receiver, it "does not matter whether that performer knows
          or believes that the performance of the function or activity is improper."59

In all cases, it does not matter whether the bribe is accepted directly by the receiver or
through a third party, and it does not matter if the bribe is for the benefit of the receiver or
another person.

The descriptions in Section 2.4.2(i) pertaining to the definitions of "relevant function or
activity," "improper performance" and "expectation" apply equally to section 2 offences.

According to section 2(7), in Cases 4, 5, and 6, "it does not matter whether the person knows
or believes that the performance of the function or activity is improper." This section has
resulted in a lack of clarity concerning the mens rea for the various cases in both sections 1
and 2. Section 2(7) seems to create a distinction between sections 1 and 2: in section 1, the
"briber" must intend improper performance or improper receipt, whereas the "bribee" in
section 2 can be guilty even if he or she did not know his or her performance was improper.
G.R. Sullivan has considered the varying interpretations and suggests that section 2(7) was
included for the sake of certainty, in order to confirm that normative awareness of
wrongfulness is not necessary for those who accept advantages.60 The goal, according to the
Joint Committee on the Draft Bribery Bill, is to encourage people to "think twice" when
seeking or taking an advantage.61 Sullivan further suggests that the same concept can be
taken for granted in Cases 1-3, which would mean a briber is not required to know that the
behaviour they intend to induce in the bribee is improper. Put another way, ignorance of the
law is not a defence.

(iii) Commercial Organization Failing to Prevent Bribery: Section 7

Section 7 of the Bribery Act creates a new strict liability offence of failure of a commercial
organization to prevent bribery. Section 7 defines the scope of this new offence in the
following words:

                (1) A relevant commercial organisation ("C") is guilty of an offence
                     under this section if a person ("A") associated with C bribes
                     another person intending--
                     (a) to obtain or retain business for C, or
                     (b) to obtain or retain an advantage in the conduct of business for
                           C.62

For more information on section 7, refer to Chapter 3, Section 2.4.1.

(iv) Consent or Connivance of Senior Officers: Section 14

If any of the bribery offences under sections 1, 2 or 6 are committed by a body corporate or
a Scottish partnership, section 14 of the Bribery Act mandates that a "senior officer" or
someone purporting to act in that capacity will be personally criminally liable (as will the
body corporate) if the offence was committed with the officer's consent or connivance.

Senior officer is defined in section 14(14) as a "director, manager, secretary or other similar
officer." While the word "manager" is not defined and could be broadly interpreted,
Nicholls et al. note that it was narrowly defined in a somewhat similar provision in R v Boal
to include only "decision-makers within the company who have the power and
responsibility to decide corporate policy and strategy. It is to catch those responsible for

60 Sullivan, supra note 45.
61 Cited in Nicholls et al, supra note 45 at para 3.45.
62 Interestingly, there is no corresponding offence of failure to prevent the taking of a bribe. For more
on this offence, see Nicholls et al, supra note 45 at paras 3.88-3.117.

                                                                                                          159
GLOBAL CORRUPTION

putting proper procedures in place."63 I question whether the narrow Boal definition is
consistent with the purpose of putting a duty on "managers" in general to not consent or
connive in the commission of bribery by those under their supervision.

The words "consent and connive" are also not defined in the Bribery Act. Nicholls et al. note
that they will follow the model in the Fraud Act 2006, section 12,64 and suggest that section
14 will be satisfied by knowledge or "willful blindness" to the conduct that constitutes
bribery along with remaining silent or doing nothing to prevent that conduct from occurring
or continuing.65 See also Chapter 3, Section 3.4.

Finally, a "senior officer" will only be liable for a bribery offence committed by the
corporation if that senior officer has a "close connection" to the UK as defined in section
12(4) of the Bribery Act.

      2.4.3 Defences

Section 5(2) of the Bribery Act indicates that no bribery offence is committed if the payment
of a financial or other advantage "is permitted or required by the written law applicable to
the country or territory concerned." In some countries, the law or government policies
require the appointment of a commercial agent as a condition of doing business in that
country. The agent is appointed by or associated with persons in high places and demands
large agent fees for little or no work.66 The agent's fees are shared with the high officials.
This practice is a form of bribery, but it is not defined as corruption in such countries and is
in fact legally required in those countries.

Section 13 of the Bribery Act provides a defence for persons whose conduct, which would
otherwise constitute a bribery offence, is proven on a balance of probabilities to be necessary
for the proper exercise of intelligence or armed services functions. Where the conduct that
comprises the bribery offence is necessary for the proper exercise of any function pertaining
to UK intelligence or armed services, the defence is made out. The head of the intelligence
service or Defence Council must also ensure that arrangements are in place to ensure that
any conduct constituting an offence will be necessary. Subsection (5) provides that where a
bribe is paid by a member of the intelligence service or armed forces and they are able to
rely on the section 13 defence, the receiver of that bribe is also covered by the defence.67

Sullivan criticizes section 13 for its potential to provide space for "what may be highly
questionable conduct."68 Although Sullivan recognizes the utility of such a defence, he
worries "it might encourage payments made in circumstances far removed from matters of

vital national security,"69 especially since the duties of the Intelligence Service include
protecting the UK's economic wellbeing.

No other bribery-related defences are specifically set out in the Bribery Act, such as
committing bribery under duress or by necessity. While the requirements for these defences
are rather stringent, there is no reason why they should not apply if the defence
requirements are present. The Ministry of Justice Guidance states explicitly that duress may
be available if a bribery offence was committed to prevent loss of life, limb or liberty.70 Since
duress, which includes duress by threat or by circumstances, only applies when the
defendant is under threat of immediate or nearly immediate death or serious bodily harm,
the defence would not cover less pressing health and safety concerns.71 As a result, Sullivan
expresses concern regarding the potential of the Bribery Act to catch payments extracted
through extortion, especially in light of the Act's broad jurisdiction in areas where
extortionate demands are common.72 The defence of necessity has the potential to assist
defendants under the Act, but is still uncertain and relatively novel in the UK. Necessity acts
as a justification for the defendant's conduct in UK law, unlike duress, which is an excuse
for wrongful acts committed under pressure. Necessity is based on the idea that sometimes
the benefits of breaking the law outweigh the benefits of compliance. The defence is more
likely to succeed for property offences, such as bribery, than offences involving the infliction
of physical harm.73

Other defences such as honest mistake of fact, incapacity and diplomatic immunity should
also be available if the requirements for those defences are met. Immunity from the criminal
law applies to foreign visiting sovereigns, foreign diplomats and members of the foreign
armed forces. Entrapment is another defence available to a charge of bribery. The scope of
the entrapment defence in England is set out by the House of Lords in R v Loosely and
Attorney General's Reference (No 3 of 2000).74 It is a non-exculpatory defence and therefore
does not exonerate the accused. There is no verdict of not guilty, but rather a stay of
proceedings on the basis that the investigative activities of the state were unfair and that
prosecution of the offence would tarnish the integrity of the court and be an affront to the
public conscience. The test for entrapment is whether the state activity goes beyond
providing an opportunity to commit a crime and instead has actually instigated the offence.
The details of this test are set out in Loosely. Random-virtue testing (offering a person an
opportunity to commit a crime in circumstances in which there is no reasonable suspicion

that the person intended to engage in the commission of a crime) is not permitted.
Entrapment and integrity testing are also discussed in Chapter 6, Section 4.6.3.

(i) Section 7 - Adequate Procedures Defence

The "adequate procedures" defence applies to section 7 of the Bribery Act. Section 7(2) states
that a full defence to the charge is available if the commercial organization can prove on a
balance of probabilities that it had adequate procedures in place and followed those
procedures at the time the bribery occurred in order to prevent associated persons from
engaging in bribery. As is more fully argued by Stephen Gentle, this defence has proven to
be contentious.75

Section 9 requires the Secretary of State to publish guidance for commercial organizations
regarding the "adequate procedures" that companies should implement to prevent persons
associated with the company from bribing.

After much debate, lobbying and consultation, the Secretary of State for Justice (head of the
Ministry of Justice) on March 30, 2011 issued the Bribery Act 2010 Guidance (Guidance, or UK
Guidance where required for clarity).76 On the same day, the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) and
the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) published their Bribery Act 2010: Joint Prosecution
Guidance of the Director of the SFO and the DPP (Joint Guidance) to ensure consistency between
police and prosecutors and to indicate that police and prosecutors will have careful regard
for the Guidance issued by the Secretary of State.77

The Guidance is organized around six principles for establishing adequate procedures to
prevent corruption. After each principle is set out, the Guidance provides commentary on the
meaning and scope of each principle. The six principles are as follows:

Principle 1: Proportionate procedures

           A commercial organisation's procedures to prevent bribery by persons associated
           with it are proportionate to the bribery risks it faces and to the nature, scale and
           complexity of the commercial organisation's activities. They are also clear,
           practical, accessible, effectively implemented and enforced.

Principle 2: Top-level commitment

           The top-level management of a commercial organisation (be it a board of directors,
           the owners or any other equivalent body or person) are committed to preventing

          bribery by persons associated with it. They foster a culture within the organisation
          in which bribery is never acceptable.

Principle 3: Risk assessment

          The commercial organisation assesses the nature and extent of its exposure to
          potential external and internal risks of bribery on its behalf by persons associated
          with it. The assessment is periodic, informed and documented.

Principle 4: Due diligence

          The commercial organisation applies due diligence procedures, taking a
          proportionate and risk based approach, in respect of persons who perform or will
          perform services for or on behalf of the organisation, in order to mitigate identified
          bribery risks.

Principle 5: Communication (including training)

          The commercial organisation seeks to ensure that its bribery prevention policies
          and procedures are embedded and understood throughout the organisation
          through internal and external communication, including training, that is
          proportionate to the risks it faces.

Principle 6: Monitoring and Review

          The commercial organisation monitors and reviews procedures designed to
          prevent bribery by persons associated with it and makes improvements where
          necessary.

Appendix A of the Guidance is composed of eleven case studies for further illustration and
clarification of the six principles for "adequate procedures." For example, case study 1
focuses on the problem of facilitation payments and discusses what a company can do when
faced with demands for them.

documents are designed to assist companies in complying with the Bribery Act by providing
clear, practical advice on good practice anti-bribery systems that in TI's opinion constitute
"adequate procedures" for compliance with the Bribery Act.82 Other useful documents,
policies and recommended anti-bribery strategies exist and are outlined by Nicholls et al.83

Despite the guidance, emerging case law may suggest a limited ambit for the defence,
particularly for smaller or medium sized enterprises. For example, after the Skansen
Interiors case, Joanna Ludlum, Charles Thomson, and Henry Garfield commented as
follows:

          Skansen's defence sought to draw to the jury's attention the company's
          modest size (a workforce totalling approximately thirty) and limited
          geographical reach to argue that the company did not need sophisticated
          procedures to be in place for them to be "adequate". Skansen also argued
          that staff did not need a detailed policy to tell them not to pay bribes because
          such a prohibition was common sense and the company should be able to
          rely on the integrity and honesty of its employees to help avoid bribery.
          Skansen also sought to rely on broadly worded policies that enforced ethical
          conduct even though, at the relevant time, it had no specific anti-bribery
          policy. Existing financial controls, requiring transactions to be given the
          green light by numerous individuals and standard form clauses relating to
          bribery in contracts were also raised in support of the case for the defence.

          However, this was not enough to convince the jury that the company's
          procedures were adequate and a guilty verdict was returned.

          ...

          [T]he case provides an insight into what factors may and may not be taken
          into account by a jury when considering whether anti-bribery procedures
          are "adequate". The Ministry of Justice guidance accompanying the UKBA
          repeatedly makes clear that adequate bribery prevention procedures only
          need to be proportionate to the bribery risks that an organisation faces.
          More specifically, the guidance notes that if an organisation is small or
          medium sized "the application of the principles is likely to suggest
          procedures that are different from those that may be right for a large
          multinational organisation" and that "[t]o a certain extent the level of risk
          will be linked to the size of the organisation and the nature and complexity
          of its business, but size will not be the only determining factor." Clearly in
          this case the jury did not consider that the steps Skansen had taken to
          prevent bribery were adequate, despite the small size of the company and
          its limited geographical reach. The case therefore serves as a reminder to
          small and medium sized companies to ensure that a rigorous risk
          assessment is conducted in relation to bribery risks and robust procedures

          are in place to deal with those risks that comply with the six guiding
          principles set out in the Ministry of Justice's Guidance.... The case also
          highlights the importance of documenting steps taken to implement
          "adequate procedures", irrespective of the size of the organisation, even if
          the conclusion is that there is no need for a policy (although that conclusion
          is likely to be rare for most companies). For all companies, large and small,
          the case suggests that, when it comes to considering adequate procedures,
          juries will give short shrift to ineffective policies and procedures that are not
          designed to target the considered bribery risks faced by the company and/or
          are not properly documented and communicated.84

      2.4.4 Limitation Periods

In accordance with general principles of UK criminal law, the offences in the UK Bribery Act
are not subject to any limitation periods in respect to laying charges. Applicable human
rights legislation mandates that once charges have been laid, defendants are entitled to
receive a public hearing within a "reasonable time"--see for example the UK Human Rights
Act 1998 and the European Convention on Human Rights, Article 6(1).

      2.4.5 Sanctions

Section 11 of the Bribery Act describes the penalties for all of the above offences. It states:

          (1) An individual guilty of an offence under section 1, 2 or 6 is liable--
                (a) on summary conviction, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding
                     12 months, or to a fine not exceeding the statutory maximum, or to
                     both,
                (b) on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for a term not
                     exceeding 10 years, or to a fine, or to both.

          (2) Any other person guilty of an offence under section 1, 2 or 6 is liable--
                (a) on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding the statutory
                     maximum,
                (b) on conviction of indictment, to a fine.

          (3) A person guilty of an offence under section 7 is liable on conviction on
                indictment to a fine.

          (4) The reference in subsection (1)(a) to 12 months is to be read--
                (a) in its application to England and Wales in relation to an offence
                     committed before the commencement of paragraph 24(2) of
                     Schedule 22 to the Sentencing Act 2020, and

               (b) in its application to Northern Ireland, as a reference to 6 months.

The statutory maximum fine is £5000 in England and Wales or £10,000 in Scotland, if
the conviction is summary. If convicted on indictment, the amount of the fine is unlimited
under the Act. Companies convicted of bribery are also liable to exclusion from obtaining
future public contracts under the EC Regulations 2006 or the Public Contracts Regulations
2015 if the tender is made after February 26, 2015.85

A section 7 offence can only be tried on indictment, and thus an organization convicted of a
section 7 offence is subject to an unlimited fine, provided that fine is fair and
proportionate in the circumstances of each case.

offences, see Chapter 7, Section 5.

2.5 Canada

2.5.1 Offences

The Canadian Criminal Code contains eight specific offences relating to corruption and
bribery committed in Canada:

s. 119      Bribery of Judges or Members of Parliament or Provincial
            Legislative Assemblies
s. 120      Bribery of Police Officers or other Law Enforcement Officers
s. 121      Bribery/Corruption of Government Officials [Influence Peddling]
s. 122      Fraud or Breach of Trust by a Public Official
s. 123      Municipal Corruption
s. 124      Selling or Purchasing a Public Office
s. 125      Influencing or Negotiating Appointments to Public Offices
s. 426      Giving or Receiving Secret Commissions

The offences are in part overlapping, so the same conduct can sometimes constitute an
offence under more than one provision. The offences apply to both individuals and
corporations. The offences concerning bribery of judges, politicians and police officers
(sections 119-120) are considered to be the most serious offences and are punishable by a
maximum of 14 years imprisonment. The other bribery and corruption offences (sections
121-125 and 426) are punishable by a maximum of 5 years imprisonment. In 2019, sections
121(3)(b), 122 (b), 123(1), 124, 125 and 426(3)(b) were amended to provide that those guilty
of offences under sections 121-125, 426 may be found guilty of an offence punishable on
summary conviction.86 These offences are largely unchanged since their incorporation into

85 Nicholls et al, supra note 45 at 95-96.                                                       2022
86 Regarding sentencing these kinds of offences, the Court in R v Serré, 2013 ONSC 1732 (in the
context of immigration fraud) provides helpful remarks at paras 28-35.

Canada's first Criminal Code in 1892. Several of these offences are loosely related to the
common law offence of misconduct in public office. Canada abolished common law offences
in 1955 and therefore the common law offence of misconduct in public office is of no force
or effect in Canada.87 However, this common law offence recently underwent a major
resurgence in some common law jurisdictions88 such as Hong Kong, Victoria and New South
Wales in Australia, and the UK, even after the enactment of the UK's Bribery Act 2010.89

Note. The discussion of Canada's domestic bribery offences that follows largely originates
from Gerry Ferguson's "Legislative and Enforcement Framework for Corruption and
Bribery Offences in Canada," a paper presented at the First ASEM Prosecutors General
Conference (as part of the Canada-China Procuratorate Reform Cooperation Program) in
Shenzhen, China, December 9-12, 2005.

                                                            BEGINNING OF EXCERPT

 (i) Bribery of Judges, Members of Parliament or Provincial Legislative Assemblies

 Section 119 of the Criminal Code creates offences which apply both to the person who
 accepts or obtains a bribe and to the person who offers the bribe.

 Elements of the Offence: With regard to the person accepting or obtaining the bribe, the
 following elements constitute the full offence:

        The accused must be the holder of a judicial office, or be a member of
            Parliament or the legislature of a province;

        The accused must accept or obtain, agree to accept or attempt to obtain any
            money, valuable consideration, office, place of employment for himself or
            herself or another person;90

87 But see reference to it in R v Boulanger, [2006] 2 SCR 49 at paras 1, 52.

337.
89 Nicholls et al, supra note 45 at c 5.
90 The bribe must be proven in unequivocal terms: R v Philliponi, [1978] 4 WWR 173 (BCCA). Note
also the following comment from Christopher J Ramsay:

            The bribery provisions, set out in the Criminal Code, are often tempered by further federal
            and provincial legislation. For example, although the bribery provisions in the Criminal
            Code create a draconian landscape where "any valuable consideration" or "benefit" can be
            considered a bribe, federal, provincial and municipal governments are allowed to enact
            their own laws to determine which gifts are acceptable for officers. Nevertheless, gifts
            beyond a certain threshold, even if acceptable, must be disclosed. The threshold is
            determined by the level of government that has conduct over the public officer in question.

See Christopher J Ramsay, "Preface" in Mark F Mendelsohn, ed, The Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption
Review, 6th ed (London: Law Business Research Ltd, 2017) 53 at 54-55, online (pdf):

                                                                                                          167
GLOBAL CORRUPTION

        This must be done corruptly, and must relate to anything done or omitted or to
            be done or omitted by the accused in the accused's official capacity.

 The offence for the person offering the bribe is essentially the mirror-image of that outlined
 above: the accused must corruptly give or offer any money, valuable consideration, office,
 place or employment to the holder of a judicial office or a member of Parliament or of the
 legislature of a province. The bribe must relate to anything done or omitted by that person
 in their official capacity, and may be for that person or any other person.

 With respect to ministerial officers, the distinction between political and non-political
 officers has no significance, and includes ministers of the Crown.91

 "Corruptly"

 As noted, the only specifically required mental element is that the accused act corruptly.
 The Court in R v Kozitsyn,92 citing Regina v Brown, [1956] OJ No 573 stated that
 "`[c]orruptly' does not mean wickedly or dishonestly, but to refer to an act done mala fides
 designed wholly or partially for the purpose of bringing about the effect forbidden by the
 section." The accused's conduct need not amount to a bribe to perform a specific act, or a
 reward for its accomplishment. 93 The Court in R v Duffy stated that, "[c]orrupt intent can
 be inferred from circumstances of the agreement and acceptance, including the manner
 in which the agreement was struck and manner in which the money was transacted."94

 "Official Capacity"

 Provided the accused corruptly received money for influence "in his official capacity,"
 the use to be made of the money is irrelevant.95 It is not necessary that the corrupt act of
 a Member of Parliament relates to their legislative duties; rather, it may be connected to
 their participation in an administrative act of government.96 Similarly, a cabinet minister,
 in absence of contrary evidence, acts in their official capacity as a member of the
 legislature when taking ministerial actions connected with the administration of the
 ministry.97

 In a highly publicized trial, Senator Michael Duffy was charged with 31 counts relating
 to allegations of breach of trust, fraudulent practices and accepting a bribe, and was
 ultimately acquitted on all charges. A charge under section 119(a) of the Criminal Code

 involved allegations that Senator Duffy improperly claimed residency expenses and
 repaid $90,000 using corruptly received money (a bribe) received from Nigel Wright,
 Chief of Staff to then Prime Minister Harper ... Justice Vaillancourt found that Senator
 Duffy did not accept the funds voluntarily but was forced to accept them so the
 government could manage a political fiasco. Therefore, the acceptance of funds was not
 done corruptly. Thus, Senator Duffy was acquitted. Justice Vaillancourt also held that the
 charge would have otherwise been stayed as a result of an officially induced error.98

 (ii) Bribery of Police Officers or other Law Enforcement Officers

 Section 120 of the Criminal Code creates offences similar to those outlined in section 119,
 but in relation to a different group of public officers: police officers, justices, and others
 involved in the administration of criminal law. There are few decisions which discuss the
 scope or meaning of the offence.99

 Elements of the Offence: As in section 119, the offence can be committed in two general
 ways. First, the accused must be a justice, police commissioner, peace officer, public
 officer or officer of a juvenile court, or be employed in the administration of criminal law.
 The accused must corruptly accept or obtain, agree to accept, or attempt to obtain for
 himself or herself or any other person, any money, valuable consideration, office, place
 or employment.

 The offence may also be committed where the accused corruptly gives or offers any
 money, valuable consideration, office, place or employment to a justice, police
 commissioner, peace officer, public officer or officer of a juvenile court, or a person
 employed in the administration of justice. There must be an intention that the person
 bribed will interfere with the administration of justice, procure or facilitate the
 commission of an offence or protect from detection or punishment a person who has
 committed or who intends to commit the offence. Importantly, the individual bribing the
 officer must know or believe the person accepting the bribe is in fact an officer, or the
 requisite intent is not made out.100

 (iii) Frauds on the Government

 Section 121 of the Criminal Code outlines seven different offences relating to fraud on the
 government. Section 121 does not include municipal corruption, since section 118 states
 that "government" means federal or provincial government, and therefore does not
 include municipal governments. However, the definitions of "office" and "official" have
 been interpreted widely to include municipal offices and officials. Further, section 123

99 However, the Court in Melhi v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2018 CanLII 107568 (CA
IRB) provides an interesting comparison between the similar US and Canadian provision, and also
comments (at paras 51-52) on the meaning and significance of the offence of bribery.

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

 expressly criminalizes municipal corruption.101 The seven offences under section 121 are
 described below.

       (a) Giving or Accepting a Benefit

 Section 121(1)(a) provides that it is an offence for a government official102 to demand,
 accept, or offer to accept from any person a loan, reward, advantage or benefit of any
 kind103 as consideration in respect to the government official's duties.104 It also creates a
 reciprocal offence where a person gives, offers or agrees to give or offer to an official or
 any member of the official's family, or to anyone for the benefit of the official, an item of
 the same description.

 In either case, the action may be performed directly or indirectly, and must be done as
 consideration for cooperation, assistance, exercise of influence, or an act or omission.105
 This action must be in connection with the transaction of business with, or any other
 matter of business relating to, the government or a claim against Her Majesty or any other
 benefit that Her Majesty is entitled to bestow.106 It is legally irrelevant whether or not, in
 fact, the official is able to cooperate, render assistance, exercise influence or do or omit to

101 Further, the Court in R c Marcotte, 2015 QCCQ 7961 (CanLII) comes to the conclusion that s 121
does not apply to municipal officials (at paras 155-156). Additionally, the removal of s 121 from the
charges in R c Bergevin, 2017 QCCQ 21229 (CanLII) (which involved municipal corruption) may also
suggest that municipalities are not included in the scope of "government" in the s 121 offences. In
discussing s 118's definition of "government" as "the federal government, the government of a
province, or Her Majesty in right of Canada or a province", Graham Steele notes that "this is a
startling limitation", given the ubiquity of intricate infrastructure projects at the municipal level. For
more, see Graham Steele, "The Criminal Code's Procurement Crimes: Underused Tools in Canada's
Anti-Corruption Effort" (2017-2018) 65 Crim LQ 187 at 13 (in the Westlaw electronic version).
102 Section 118 of the Criminal Code defines an "official" as a person who holds an office (an office or
appointment under the government, a civil or military commission or a position of employment in a
public department) or is appointed to discharge a public duty.
103 For discussion of the scope of a benefit "of any kind" in s 121, see R v O'Brien, 2009 CanLII 100209
(ONSC) at paras 13-19.
104 "Commission" and "reward" connote compensation for services rendered. "Advantage" and
"benefit" are not so limited in scope and include gifts not related to any service provided by the
recipient. A government employee receives an "advantage" or "benefit" when the employee receives
something of value that, in all the circumstances, the trier of fact is satisfied constitutes a profit to the
employee (or family member), obtained at least in part because the employee is employed by the
government, or because of the nature of the employee's work for the government: R v Greenwood
(1991), 67 CCC (3d) 435 (Ont CA); R v Vandenbussche (1979), 50 CCC (2d) 15 (Ont Prov Ct).
105 "Influence" requires the actual affecting of a decision, such as the awarding of a contract.
"Cooperation" and "assistance" are broader in scope and include the opening of doors or arranging of
meetings (which would not constitute exercises of influence): R v Giguere, [1983] 2 SCR 448.
106 The Court in R v Carson, 2018 SCC 12 (CanLII) provides very important comments on the meaning
of two expressions: in ss 121(1)(a) and 121(1)(d), namely "in connection with ... any matter business
relating to the government" and "any matter of business relating to the government."

170                                                                                                            2022
                                                         CHAPTER 2 BRIBERY & OTHER OFFENCES

 do what is proposed, as the case may be. There is no requirement that the official be acting
 in their official capacity when contravening this section.107

 R v Cogger108 clarified the mens rea element of this offence: the accused must intentionally
 commit the prohibited act with knowledge of the circumstances that are necessary
 elements of the offence. Where the accused is an official, they must be aware that they are
 an official; they must intentionally demand or accept a loan, reward, advantage or benefit
 of any kind for themself or another person; and they must know that the reward is in
 consideration for their cooperation, assistance or exercise of influence in connection with
 the business transaction or in relation to the government.109 However, it is irrelevant that
 the accused did not know their act constituted a crime or that they did not intend to accept
 a bribe by their definition of that term.110 Furthermore, willful blindness is a sufficient
 substitute for knowledge.111

       (b) Commissions or Rewards

 Section 121(1)(b) of the Criminal Code provides that it is an offence for anyone having
 dealings of any kind with the government112 to directly or indirectly pay a commission or
 reward to or confer an advantage or benefit of any kind113 with respect to those dealings
 on an employee or official of the government with which the accused deals, or any
 member of their family, or anyone whose involvement will benefit the employee or
 official. Like section 121(1)(c), section 121(1)(b) is a "conduct offence," which means that
 "they do not require, as part of the actus reus, proof that any result flowed from the doing
 of the prohibited act,"114 and they are broader than the other s.121 crimes.115 Although no
 mental element is specified, the jurisprudence suggests that the accused must intend to
 confer a benefit with respect to the dealings with the government.116 It is an offence if a

107 Martineau v R, [1966] SCR 103.

109 In R v Terra Nova Fishery Co (1990), 84 Nfld & PEIR 13 (Nfld TD), the accused company was
acquitted since reasonable doubt existed as to whether the government official upon whom the
benefit was conferred was aware that it was in hope of his assistance in altering export certificates.
110 Cogger, supra note 108.
111 R v Greenwood (1991), 67 CCC (3d) 435 (Ont CA) [Greenwood].
112 Formerly, under section 110 the term "person dealing with the government" referred to a person
who, at the time of the commission of the alleged offence, had specific dealings or ongoing dealings
in the course of their business with the government, where the gift could have an effect on those
dealings: R v Reid, [1982] 3 WWR 77 (Man Prov Ct). The current, more expansive language, may
encompass a wider range of dealings. "Government" is defined in s 118 of the Criminal Code as the
Government of Canada, the government of a province, or Her Majesty in right of Canada or a
province.

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

 gift is given for an ulterior purpose, even if no return is ultimately given and even if there
 is no acceptance by the official.117

       (c) Officials and Employees

 Pursuant to section 121(1)(c) of the Criminal Code, it is an offence for an official or
 employee of the government118 to demand, accept or offer or agree to accept a
 commission, reward, advantage or benefit119 from a person who has dealings with the
 government.120 This may be accomplished directly or indirectly by the accused, or
 through a member of the accused's family121, or through anyone for the benefit of the
 accused.

 Although no mental element is specified, R v Greenwood122 held that the offence is
 committed where the employee makes a conscious decision to accept a gift, knowing at
 the time of receipt that the giver has dealings with the government. There is no
 requirement that the accused actually intended to exercise some undue influence in the
 giver's favour:

117 R v Pilarinos (2002), 167 CCC (3d) 97. See Cote J's dissent for a view on the relationship between
121(1)(b) and (c), particularly regarding why they do not require a quid pro quo:

     [61] The quid pro quo required for all others. 121 offences is the corrupt practice that
     carries the potential to undermine government integrity. This requirement signals
     Parliament's concern with actual government integrity. Conversely, its absence from s.
     121(1)(b) and (c) signals Parliament's unique concern, under those two provisions, with the
     appearance of impropriety in circumstances where no corrupt practice exists. This
     interpretation aligns with the analytical distinction between the two purposes, as described
     by this Court in Hinchey:

     For a government, actual integrity is achieved when its employees remain free of
     any type of corruption. On the other hand, it is not necessary for a corrupt practice
     to take place in order for the appearance of integrity to be harmed. [emphasis in
     original]

118 "Official ... of the government" is an officer of the executive who can be terminated by the
executive without reference to the legislature: Roncarelli v Duplessis, [1959] SCR 121; R v Despres
(1962), 40 CR 319 (SCQ).
119 These words are further described in Sun-Diamond Growers, supra note 38 at 404-405. The offence is
committed even where the benefit derived only represents the true value of services rendered
outside working hours: Dore v Canada (A-G) (1974), 17 CCC (2d) 359 (SCC).
120 R v Hinchey (1996), 3 CR (5th) 187 (SCC) held that section 121(1)(c) only applies where a person
with specific or ongoing commercial dealings with the government at the time of the offence confers
material or tangible gain on a government employee.

            Section 121(1)(c) does not contain the phrase "as consideration for" or any
            equivalent language. The absence of such language clearly indicates to
            me that the fault requirement in s. 121(1)(c) differs from that found in
            those other sections: see Dore v. Canada (Attorney General), supra, at p.
            780 S.C.R., p. 559 C.C.C. The difference rests in the absence of any
            requirement in s. 121(1)(c) that the recipient of a benefit intends to do
            something in return for the benefit. The corrupt state of mind inherent in
            the "something for something" nature of the offences created by s.
            121(1)(a), (d), (e) and (f) is not present in s. 121(1)(c). The primary position
            taken by the respondent in this case and the judgment in R. v. Reid, 1982
            CanLII 3924 (MB PC), [1982] 3 W.W.R. 77 (Man. Prov. Ct.), at pp. 87-89,
            require proof of a corrupt motive under s. 121(1)(c). That position is
            unsustainable in light of the clear distinction drawn in the language of s.
            121.123

       (d) Influence Peddling/Pretending to Have Influence

 Section 121(1)(d) of the Criminal Code relates to offers of influence in return for a benefit.
 In order to establish the elements of the offence, it must be shown that the accused had or
 pretended to have influence with the government or an official, and directly or indirectly
 demanded, accepted or offered or agreed to accept a reward, advantage or benefit of any
 kind for himself or herself or another person. This acceptance must be in consideration
 for cooperation, assistance, exercise of influence or an act or omission in connection with
 the transaction of business with, or any matter of business relating to, the government, a
 claim against Her Majesty or any benefit that Her Majesty is authorized or is entitled to
 bestow, or the appointment of any person, including the accused, to office. No mental
 element is specified, but as a true crime, there is a presumption of mens rea which can be
 established by proof of intent, recklessness, or wilful blindness.

 The Supreme Court of Canada in R v Giguere124 emphasized that this subsection is limited
 to persons who have (or pretend to have) a significant nexus with government.
 "Influence" involves being able to actually affect a decision (or pretending to be able to
 do so), such as influencing the awarding of a contract.

 The element that "the transaction of business with or any matter of business relating to
 the government" was considered in R v Carson.125 The accused, Carson, worked as a Senior
 Advisor to former Prime Minister Stephen Harper in the years 2006-2009. In 2010-2011,
 Carson attempted to influence the department of Indian and Northern Affairs Canada
 [INAC] to purchase water treatment products from a company called H20, in part to try
 to benefit a romantic partner. Carson admitted he had influence with the Government at
 the time of the alleged offence and used this influence to benefit his partner. Justice
 Warkentin found that INAC did not have power to purchase systems; that decision was
 left to individual First Nation communities. Therefore, the accused's conduct did not

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

 involve a matter of business relating to the government and the accused was acquitted.
 In a comment on the case, Steve Coughlan suggests, properly in my mind, that a
 conviction for attempting to commit the offence should have been entered instead.126

 A majority of the Court of Appeal set aside the acquittal and entered a verdict of guilty.
 The majority stated:

            Section 121 (1) provides that it matters not "whether or not, in fact, the
            official is able to cooperate, render assistance, exercise influence, or do or
            omit to do what is proposed." Accepting a benefit in exchange for
            exercising influence on government officials in order "to push through
            their water treatment products to First Nation Bands" is a "matter of
            business related to the government."127

 On further appeal, a majority of the Supreme Court of Canada dismissed Mr. Carson's
 appeal, stating:

            In my view, the offence under s. 121(1)(d) requires that the promised
            influence be in fact connected to a matter of business that relates to
            government. Furthermore, a matter of business relates to the government
            if it depends on or could be facilitated by the government, given its
            mandate. The phrase "any matter of business relating to the
            government" therefore includes publicly funded commercial
            transactions for which the government could impose or amend terms and
            conditions that would favour one vendor over others. Governments are
            not static entities - legislation, policies, and structures delimiting the
            scope of government activity evolve constantly. "Any matter of business
            relating to the government" must not be considered strictly with
            reference to existing government operational and funding structures.128

126 Steve Coughlan, Case Comment on R v Carson (2016), 25 CR (7th) 353. The Ontario Court of
Appeal did not discuss the issue of an impossible attempt in this case. A majority of the Supreme
Court (at paras 29 and 41) indicated a verdict of attempted influence peddling would have been
appropriate if they had held that Carson's conduct was not "related to government business." Côté J,
dissenting at the SCC (at para 83) declined to resolve that issue since "it was not raised in the lower
courts and the Crown confirmed before this Court that the offence of attempt did not form part of its
theory of the case."

     (e) Providing Reward

Section 121(1)(e) of the Criminal Code provides that it is an offence for anyone to give, offer
or agree to give or offer a reward, advantage or benefit of any kind to a minister of the
government or an official in consideration for cooperation, assistance, exercise of
influence or an act or omission. This conduct must be in connection with the transaction
of business with, or any matter of business relating to, the government, a claim against
Her Majesty or any benefit that Her Majesty is authorized or is entitled to bestow, or the
appointment of any person, including the accused, to office. No mental element is
specified, but the normal presumption that mens rea (intent, recklessness or wilful
blindness) is required for a true crime should apply to this offence.

     (f) Tender of Contract

Section 121(1)(f) of the Criminal Code relates to tenders to obtain contracts with the
government. The offence may be committed in two ways. First, it is an offence for anyone,
having made a tender to obtain a contract with the government, to give, offer or agree to
give or offer a reward, advantage or benefit of any kind to another person. That person
must be someone who has made a tender, or a member of their family, or another person
where that person's involvement will benefit someone who has made a tender. This must
be done as consideration for the withdrawal of the other person's tender.

The offence is also committed where the accused demands, accepts, or offers or agrees to
accept a reward, advantage or benefit of any kind from another person as consideration
for the withdrawal of the accused's tender.

No mental element is specified for either way of committing the offence, but once again
mens rea will be presumed.

     (g) Contractor with Government Contributing to an Election Campaign

Section 121(2) of the Criminal Code provides that it is an offence for anyone, in order to
obtain or retain a contract with the government, or as a term of any such contract, whether
express or implied, to directly or indirectly subscribe or give, or agree to subscribe or give,
to any person valuable consideration for one of the following purposes:

          (a) promoting the election of a candidate or a class or party of candidates
          to Parliament or the legislature of a province; or
          (b) to influence or affect in any way the result of an election conducted
          for the purpose of electing persons to serve in Parliament or the
          legislature of the province.

Consequently, the required mental element of the offence is to act with the purpose of
effecting one of the two objectives listed above. If the accused acts pursuant to a term of

                                                                                                        175
GLOBAL CORRUPTION

 a contract with the government, no further mental element is required. Otherwise, the
 accused must also act "in order to" obtain or retain a contract with the government.

 Section 121(1)(f) and 121(2) are public procurement offences, but they do not appear to be
 used. Instead, public procurement offences are prosecuted as frauds under the Criminal
 Code or as bid-rigging under section 47 of the federal Competition Act. Graham Steele
 suggests that sections 121(1)(f) and 121(2) are underutilized and need to be given "more
 bite."129

 Poonam Puri and Andrew Nichol also highlight the complementary role held by s 121(2)
 vis-a-vis Canada's foreign domestic bribery legislation:

            Note that unlike section 121(2) of the Criminal Code, which applies to
            payments made to a candidate for election or political party for the
            purposes of retaining a government contract, the CFPOA [reviewed later
            in this chapter] does not extend to payments made to candidates or
            political parties who do not subsequently enter public office.130

 (iv) Breach of Trust by Public Officer

 Section 122 is specifically directed at fraud or breach of trust committed by public
 officials.131 The term "official" is defined in section 118 and was interpreted in R v Sheets132
 to include:

            a position of duty, trust or authority, esp. in the public service or in some
            corporation, society or the like' (cf. The New Century Dictionary) or 'a
            position to which certain duties are attached, esp. a place of trust,
            authority or service under constituted authority' (cf. The Shorter Oxford
            Dictionary).133

 The Supreme Court of Canada in R v Boulanger134 reviewed the common law authorities
 relating to misfeasance in public office in order to clarify the elements of the section 122
 offence. Chief Justice McLachlin for the court concluded at para 58 that the Crown must
 prove the following elements:

                                                         CHAPTER 2 BRIBERY & OTHER OFFENCES

            (1) The accused was an official;135
            (2) The accused was acting in connection with the duties of his or her

                  office;
            (3) The accused breached the standard of responsibility and conduct

                  demanded of him or her by the nature of the office;136
            (4) The conduct of the accused represented a serious and marked

                  departure from the standards expected of an individual in the
                  accused's position of public trust;137
            (5) The accused acted with the intention to use his or her public office
                  for a purpose other than the public good, for example, for a
                  dishonest, partial, corrupt, or oppressive purpose.138

 The court's interpretation ultimately infuses section 122 with a subjective mens rea, adding
 that mere mistakes or errors of judgment do not suffice.139

135 It does not matter whether the official is elected, hired under contract or appointed: R c Cyr (1985),
44 CR (3d) 87 (CS Que). An accused who assists an officer with the breach of trust becomes a party to
the offence and can be found guilty of the offence even if he is not himself a public officer: R v
Robillard (1985), 18 CCC (3d) 266 (Que CA). A municipal official can be charged under this section:
Sheets, supra note 132; see also R v McCarthy, 2015 NLTD(G) 24 (town clerk's falsification of property
taxes she was in charge of receiving and depositing).
136 In order to determine the appropriate standard of conduct against which to assess the accused's
conduct, expert opinion may be tendered as evidence: R v Serré, 2011 ONSC 5778.
137 The court in Boulanger, supra note 134 adds at paragraph 52 that "[t]he conduct at issue ... must be
sufficiently serious to move it from the realm of administrative fault to that of criminal behaviour." In
para 54 they described the test as "analogous to the test for criminal negligence" but different in that
it involves a subjective mental element. Section 122 is often used when police officers engage in
dishonest or deceptive behaviour for personal gain, contrary to their duty to honestly uphold or
follow the law: see, e.g. R v Watson, 2015 ONSC 710 (appeal dismissed in R v Watson, 2017 ONCA
346); R v Whitney, 2015 BCPC 27; R v Mahoney-Bruer, 2015 ONSC 1224; and R v Kandola, 2014 BCCA
443 (border services officer facilitating importation of cocaine) (decision affirmed in R v Johal, 2015
BCCA 101).
138 "The fact that a public officer obtains a benefit is not conclusive of a culpable mens rea"; conversely,
"the offence may be made out where no personal benefit is involved": see Boulanger, supra note 134 at
para 57.
139 The Court in R c Comparelli, 2020 QCCQ 8885 (CanLII) provided the following on mens rea (note:
the following excerpt is a translation from Google Translate):

            [549] In the present matter, the mens rea of the offence, the fifth element in Boulanger,
            requires that I determine whether the accused used his «office for a purpose other than the
            public good, for example, for a dishonest, partial, corrupt, or oppressive purpose.» At a
            minimum, reckless indifference establishes the mens rea of improper purpose.

            [550] In R v Upjohn, 2018 ONCA 1059, the Ontario Court of Appeal noted that the examples
            of an «improper purpose» to establish the mens rea of corruption are not limited to those
            mentioned in Boulanger:

                                                                                                          177
GLOBAL CORRUPTION

     [17] I should not be taken to suggest that the improper purposes that will satisfy
     the mens rea requirement are restricted to dishonesty, partiality, corruptness or
     oppression. There are certainly other improper uses of one's public office that
     would satisfy the mens rea requirement

     [551] The fact that a public official uses his office for his own personal gain constitutes an
     improper purpose--or a purpose other than the public good--even if the work is done
     properly. For that matter, the fact that an official carried out his or her duties correctly in the
     interests of the public good does not preclude a finding that he or she also intended a non-
     public good purpose--that is, his or her own self-interest.

     [552] With respect to the mens rea, the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal in R v Probe, 2020
     SKCA 5 (CanLII), noted that when a public official deliberately uses his office, even in part,
     for a purpose other than the public good, the offence is made out (if the other elements are
     also proved):

     [77] In my view, s. 122 should be understood to require the Crown to prove that
     the official acted deliberately while specifically intending a non-public good
     purpose, not that the official had only that one non-public good purpose in mind.
     This is not only consistent with Boulanger, but also with a purposive interpretation
     of s. 122. Chief Justice McLachlin introduced the judgment in Boulanger by
     emphasizing the central role that the offence has in maintaining confidence in
     government:

                   [1] The crime of breach of trust by a public officer, embodied in s. 122 of
                   the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, is both ancient and important. It
                   gives concrete expression to the duty of holders of public office to use
                   their offices for the public good. This duty lies at the heart of good
                   governance a clear idea of what conduct the crime encompasses. It is
                   essential to retaining the confidence of the public in those who exercise
                   state power. Yet surprisingly, the elements of this crime remain uncertain.
                   This appeal requires us to clarify those elements so that citizens, police
                   and the courts have

     [78] An elected person who has a direct and substantial financial interest in a
     legislative matter will almost always be able to articulate public-good reasons for
     supporting or opposing the matter consistent with the advancement of the
     official's personal interests. The same reasoning would apply if the alleged breach
     of trust involved a non-elected official. Public confidence in those who exercise
     state power is undermined when a person is shown to have acted for a non-public
     good purpose, even if there is also a proper or good reason for their action.

     [...]

     [83] In summary, the inquiry under s. 122 is not whether the official had a positive
     or public good purpose in mind. Rather, the question is whether the Crown has
     proven, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the accused had a nonpublic good
     purpose for acting. Where the Crown proves beyond a reasonable doubt that an
     official has acted, even in part, with the intention to use his or her public office for
     a purpose other than the public good, and if the other elements of the offence are
     proven, a conviction should follow.

178                                                                                                       2022
                                                         CHAPTER 2 BRIBERY & OTHER OFFENCES

 In R v Vandenbussche, (1979) 50 CCC (2d) 15, the Ontario Court of Justice held that a
 municipal officer, although performing his official duties in an appropriate manner, was
 guilty of breach of trust because he still accepted benefits and rewards for his work. Using
 the language in Boulanger, this would constitute a breach of the standard of responsibility
 required of the officer. As the court succinctly put it, "Need I elaborate further on the
 erosion of public trust which would ensue if the proper duties of a municipal official were
 offered for sale on the block in the marketplace?" In R v Ellis, 2013 ONCA 739,140 the Court
 upheld a conviction for breach of trust where an Immigration and Refugee Board
 adjudicator strongly implied that he would change his preliminary negative decision on
 the applicant's refugee status to a positive decision if she entered into an intimate
 relationship with him.

 In R v Cosh, 2015 NSCA 76, the Court examined the meaning of "official", defined in
 section 118 within the context of section 122 of the Criminal Code. The accused worked as
 a paramedic for a private company that contracted its services with the government. After
 becoming addicted to narcotics, he stole morphine and falsified records to cover up his
 theft. He pled guilty to fraud, theft and unlawful possession of morphine but disputed
 the breach of trust charge. The Court held that as a paramedic employed by a private
 company, the accused was not an "official" within the meaning of sections 118 and 122 of
 the Criminal Code and upheld the accused's acquittal on this count.

 (v) Municipal Corruption

 Section 123 of the Criminal Code creates two offences relating to municipal corruption.
 Case law on section 123 is relatively sparse, but R c Marcotte (translated below from
 Google Translate) provides the following explanation of the provision:

            [40] In the Leblanc judgment , the Quebec Court of Appeal ruled that the mere
            fact for a municipal official to accept money in exchange for greater cooperation
            in favor of the payer constituted treatment. preferential and was sufficient to
            constitute the offense then provided for in s. 112 (1) (f) Cr. C. (corresponding to
            the current art. 123 (1) d) Cr. C.

            [553] In R. v. Mathur., the accused was an industrial technology adviser ("ITA") with the
            National Research Council of Canada ("NRC"). The accused allegedly received (directly
            and indirectly through his wife and son) a portion of fees paid to consulting firms who
            helped clients with applications for technology funding; funding which, in his role as an
            ITA, he could recommend they receive. The accused was found guilty of breach of trust (s.
            122 Cr.C.) and fraud on the government (s. 121 Cr.C.).

            [554] With respect to breach of trust, significantly, the Court held that it did not matter that
            the applications «were in all respects appropriate»; a breach of trust had nevertheless been
            committed...

See also R v Bissonnette, 2018 QCCA 2165, [2018] JQ no 12102, which held that breach of trust does
not need to be specified as general or specific intent; it must be clear, rather, that the accused had
intent to do something that is not in the public interest.
140 Notice for leave to appeal was refused on May 1, 2014: R v Ellis, 2014 SCC 5676.

                                                                                                          179
GLOBAL CORRUPTION

            ...
            [42] The Ontario Superior Court of Justice, reaffirming this principle, said that:

                       Section 123 does not require proof of an overtly corrupt action by a
                       municipal official. Like s.122, the offense of municipal corruption only
                       requires a municipal official to accept money in the course of his or her
                       lawful duties as a public official. In R v. Leblanc ... the Supreme Court of
                       Canada affirmed the Quebec Court of Appeal's finding that preferential
                       treatment exercised by a municipal official is sufficient on its own to
                       constitute an offense under this section.
            ...
            [44] Although the terms of this article are quite clear, the authors Nightingale
            and Senneck specify that the evidence does not need to establish that the
            consideration was in fact given. Evidence that by giving a benefit to a municipal
            official a person intended to influence his own affairs, or that the municipal
            official who receives a benefit does so with the same intention as the donor, is
            sufficient to satisfy the requirement. 'counterparty' requirement provided for in
            this article. [footnotes omitted]141

       (a) Loan/Reward/Advantage accepted by Municipal Officer

 Section 123(1) provides that it is an offence for a municipal official142 to, directly or
 indirectly, demand, accept, or offer, or agree to accept, a loan, reward, advantage or
 benefit of any kind from any person. Conversely, it is an offence for anyone to give, offer,
 or agree to give or offer, a loan, reward, advantage or benefit to any kind of municipal
 official.143

 In either case, the act must be done as consideration for the official performing one of four
 acts:

        abstaining from voting at a meeting of the municipal council or a committee
            thereof;

        voting in favour of or against a measure, motion or resolution;
        aiding in procuring or preventing the adoption of a measure, motion or

            resolution; or
        performing or failing to perform an official act.144

141 R c Marcotte, 2015 QCCQ 7961 (CanLII). For a discussion regarding the distinction between
sections 122 and 123 (and the elements of section 123 more generally), see R v Probe, 2018 SKQB 176.
142 R v Krupich (1991), 116 AR 67 (Prov Ct) held that the supervisor of the Property Standards Section
in the Buildings Regulation Division was a "municipal official," since he occupied a position under
the authority of the municipal government involving duties of authority and service.
143 R v Leblanc (1982), 44 NR 150 (SCC) held that preferential treatment of a town planner by a
municipal treasurer, in exchange for money, constituted an "advantage or benefit".
144 Acts performed by a "municipal official" in that capacity are "official acts": Belzberg v R (1961), 131
CCC 281 (SCC).

 No mental element is specified, but mens rea will be presumed.145

       (b) Influence a Municipal Officer

 Section 123(2) of the Criminal Code provides that it is an offence to influence or attempt to
 influence a municipal official to perform one of the four acts listed above by:

        suppression of the truth, in the case of a person who is under a duty to disclose
            the truth;

        threats or deceit; or
        by any unlawful means.

 No mental element is specified; therefore, subjective mens rea will be presumed (which
 includes intent, recklessness or willful blindness).

 (vi) Selling or Purchasing a Public Office

 Section 124 targets conduct that goes beyond purchasing the influence of an officer or
 municipal official, and instead seeks to purchase the "office" itself.146 The section
 criminalizes both the sale of an appointment or resignation from office or the receipt of a
 reward from such a sale, as well as the purchase or giving of a reward to secure such an
 appointment or resignation.

 (vii) Influencing or Negotiating Appointments to Public Offices

 Closely related to the above two offences is the offence of influencing or negotiating
 appointments to public offices. Section 125 involves the giving or receiving of bribes in
 order to cooperate, assist, exercise influence, solicit, recommend or negotiate with respect
 to the appointment or resignation of any person from office. It also prohibits keeping
 without lawful authority "a place for transacting or negotiating any business relating to
 (i) the filling of vacancies in offices, (ii) the sale or purchase of officers, or (iii)
 appointments to or resignations from offices."

145 The Court in Bergevin v R, 2020 QCCA 658 (CanLII) (leave to appeal at the SCC was dismissed) at
para 48 held that, for s 123, "the intention of the offender to enrich himself or to benefit his own
affairs does not have to be demonstrated." The same case also states that acceptance of the bribe is
not an element of the offence (see discussion at paras 40-51.) For examination of the sentencing
principles applicable to a corporation convicted of section 123, see R c BPR Triax inc, 2017 QCCQ 4191
at paras 54-64. For sentencing involving an individual, see R c Trudel, 2017 QCCQ 4190 (CanLII),
where the Court at para 61 notes, "the case law, although abundant in matters of fraud, is rather
timid as regards the charge of attempting to influence municipal officials from which the accused did
not derive any benefit. The Tribunal is therefore wary of drawing inspiration from inadequate case
law."

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

 The acts of the accused should include something of a corrupt nature, as discussed
 above. 147

 (viii) Section 425.1 - Threats and Retaliations Against Employees

 Section 425.1, enacted in 2004, makes it an offence for an employer or a person acting on
 behalf of an employer to "take a disciplinary measure against, demote, terminate or
 otherwise adversely affect the employment of an employee" who has provided or is going
 to provide information with respect to any offence committed or going to be committed
 by the employer (or an officer, employee, or corporate director of the employer). The
 information has to be reported or will be reported to a person whose duties include the
 enforcement of federal or provincial law. The purpose of the section is essentially to
 encourage employees to assist the state in the suppression of unlawful conduct and to
 protect employees who do report information about offences from being disciplined for
 doing so.148

 (ix) Offering or Accepting Secret Commissions

 Section 426 of the Criminal Code, Part X deals with "fraudulent transactions" making it an
 offence for an agent or employee149 to corruptly (i.e. secretly) offer, give or accept a
 reward, advantage or benefit in respect to the affairs or business of their principal (the
 principal can be either a government or a private company or business). Thus this
 corruption offence can relate solely to the private sphere, with no government official
 involved. In that sense, it is sometimes referred to as private corruption as opposed to
 public corruption.

 The elements of the offence are summarized in R v Kelly (1992), 73 CCC (3d) 385 (SCC), at
 406 as follows:

            There are then three elements to the actus reus of the offence set out in s.
            426(1)(a)(ii) as they apply to an accused agent/taker with regard to the
            acceptance of a commission:

                  (1) the existence of an agency relationship;
                  (2) the accepting by an agent of a benefit as consideration for doing

                       or forbearing to do any act in relation to the affairs of the
                       agent's principal, and
                  (3) the failure by the agent to make adequate and timely disclosure
                       of the source, amount and nature of the benefit.

                                                         CHAPTER 2 BRIBERY & OTHER OFFENCES

            The requisite mens rea must be established for each element of the actus
            reus. Pursuant to s. 426(1)(a)(ii), an accused agent/ taker:

                  (1) must be aware of the agency relationship;

                  (2) must knowingly accept the benefit as consideration for an act to
                       be undertaken in relation to the affairs of the principal, and

                  (3) must be aware of the extent of the disclosure to the principal or
                       lack thereof.

            If the accused was aware that some disclosure was made then it will be
            for the court to determine whether, in all the circumstances of the
            particular case, it was in fact adequate and timely.

            The word "corruptly" in the context of secret commissions means
            "secretly" or "without the requisite disclosure". There is no "corrupt
            bargain" requirement. Thus, it is possible to convict a taker of a reward
            or benefit despite the innocence of the giver of the reward or benefit.
            Non-disclosure will be established for the purposes of the section if the
            Crown demonstrates that adequate and timely disclosure of the source,
            amount and nature of the benefit has not been made by the agent to the
            principal.150

 The offence is made out by the acceptance of the benefit; that acceptance need not actually
 influence the agent in the manner he or she conducted affairs with the principal. The
 offence is established where the agent has, by accepting the benefit in secret, placed his
 or herself in a position of a conflict of interest, without informing the principal.151
 Furthermore, the agent need not actually have a specific principal at the time the offer
 was made.152

 Section 426(2) elaborates that "every one commits an offence who is knowingly privy to
 the commission of an offence under subsection (1)". As the British Columbia Court of
 Appeal pointed out in R v Tran, the word "privy" in section 462(2) criminalizes conduct
 by "persons who through their own acts, participate in the prohibited conduct."153

                                                                 END OF EXCERPT

      2.5.2 Defences

An accused charged with one of the above mentioned bribery or corruption offences is
entitled to the same general defences as persons charged with other offences. This includes

150 See also the discussion of section 426 in Yellow Old Woman, supra note 133, where the Court
discusses whether the legal nexus required for the Kienapple principle (which "precludes multiple
convictions arising from the same delict" and requires "a sufficient nexus between both the
underlying facts and the offences must be demonstrated": para 17) could be demonstrated for
sections 122 and 426 at paras 22-25.

mistake of fact, officially induced error, incapacity due to mental disorder, duress, necessity,
entrapment, diplomatic immunity and res judicata.154 The scope and requirements of these
defences can be found in a standard Canadian criminal law textbook.155

      2.5.3 Limitation Periods

Where an offence is punishable by indictment in Canada, there is no limitation period. This
also applies where the offence is a hybrid offence and the Crown chooses to proceed
indictably. Where the offence is punishable on summary conviction, or the Crown chooses
to proceed summarily, the information must be laid within 12 months of the date of the
offence (see section 786 of the Criminal Code). Once a charge is laid, the accused is entitled to
a "trial within a reasonable time" under section 11(b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and
Freedoms. In R v Jordan, 2016 SCC 27, the Supreme Court of Canada established a new
framework for section 11(b) delay.156

      2.5.4 Sanctions

The Criminal Code classifies offences as indictable (i.e., major offence) or summary conviction
(i.e., less serious offence). Indictable offences are further classified into varying degrees of
seriousness based upon the maximum punishment available for each offence (life, 14, 10, 5-
or 2-years imprisonment). The maximum punishment is set at a very high level and is
designed to deal with the "worst imaginable case" for that type of offence. The Criminal Code
does not include any minimum punishment for corruption offences, nor does it indicate an
average or common punishment for the particular offence involved. Thus, individual judges
have a lot of discretion in determining an appropriate penalty for each case within the
bounds of the maximum penalty specified for each offence.

For a description of sentencing principles and practices applicable to corruption offences,
see Chapter 7, Section 6.

154 See for example R v Rouleau (1984), 14 CCC (3d) 14 (Qc CA), in which the accused deputy minister
was acquitted of breach of trust on the res judicata doctrine after being convicted of benefitting from
firms having dealings with the government.

Criminal Law, 5th ed (Lexis Nexis, 2015) chs 8-13; and E Colvin & S Anand, Principles of Criminal Law,
3rd rd ed (Carswell, 2007) at 553-584
156 R v Jordan, 2016 SCC 27 [Jordan]. Jordan establishes a presumptive ceiling for cases, 15 months in
summary matters and 30 months in indictable matters, after which delay is presumptively
unreasonable. The Crown must then rebut the presumption on the basis of exceptional circumstances
(at paras 46-47). Discussing exceptional circumstances, the Court notes where there is "voluminous
disclosure, a large number of witnesses, significant requirements for expert evidence, and charges
covering a long period of time" exceptional circumstances may be found (at para 77). As these types
of circumstances often occur in corruption cases, a trial may need to exceed the presumptive ceiling
by some measure before it could be subject to a stay of proceedings. The new framework will
encourage the Crown to consider carefully whether to bring multiple charges for the same conduct
and try multiple co-accused together (see generally para 79). Jordan has most recently been followed
in: R v Virk, 2021 BCCA 58; R v Earle, 2021 ONCA 34; and R v Phan, 2020 ABCA 370, and has since
been affirmed by the Supreme Court of Canada in both R v Cody, 2017 SCC 31 and R v KJM, 2019
SCC 55.

3. FOREIGN PUBLIC OFFICIALS

3.1 UNCAC

      3.1.1 Offences

Article 16 of UNCAC requires each State Party to create a criminal offence in respect to
bribery of foreign public officials. Article 16 states:

          Article 16. Bribery of foreign public officials and officials of public international
          organizations

                1) Each State Party shall adopt such legislative and other measures
                     as may be necessary to establish as a criminal offence, when
                     committed intentionally, the promise, offering or giving to a
                     foreign public official or an official of a public international
                     organization, directly or indirectly, of an undue advantage, for the
                     official himself or herself or another person or entity, in order that
                     the official act or refrain from acting in the exercise of his or her
                     official duties, in order to obtain or retain business or other undue
                     advantage in relation to the conduct of international business.

                2) Each State Party shall consider adopting such legislative and other
                     measures as may be necessary to establish as a criminal offence,
                     when committed intentionally, the solicitation or acceptance by a
                     foreign public official or an official of a public international
                     organization, directly or indirectly, of an undue advantage, for the
                     official himself or herself or another person or entity, in order that
                     the official act or refrain from acting in the exercise of his or her
                     official duties.

Rose et al. write that while Article 16 is based on the content of Article 15, "the requirements
of Article 16 are much less self-evident than the requirements of Article 15."157 Part of the
challenge can be attributed to its unusual "altruistic" use of criminal law: "While Article 15
obliges states parties to protect their own institutions and thereby serves their rational
interests, Article 16 requires states parties to protect the institutions of other states and
international organizations."158

(i) Foreign Public Official

Like the definition provided for "public official," the meaning of "foreign public official" is
broad and focuses on function and influence rather than official status. "Foreign public
official" is defined in Article 2(b) as meaning: "any person holding a legislative, executive,

157 Rose, Kubiciel & Landwehr, supra note 5 at 175.
158 Ibid. See 176 as well, where Rose, Kubiciel & Landwehr describe the justifications for the
provision, and at 177, which compares the scope of the provision to the OECD Convention and the
Europe Criminal Law Convention on Corruption.

                                                                                                          185
GLOBAL CORRUPTION

administrative or judicial office of a foreign country, whether appointed or elected; and any
person exercising a public function for a foreign country, including for a public agency or
public enterprise."159

(ii) Officials of IPOs

In addition to prohibiting bribery of foreign public officials, the bribery of officials of
international public organizations is also prohibited. An "official of a public international
organization" refers to international civil servants or other persons authorized to act on
behalf of public international organizations (Article 2(c)). This would include organizations
such as the World Bank or International Monetary Fund, but not FIFA or the International
Olympic Committee (which are private legal entities that are organized and financed by
private persons).160 Article 16(1) also applies to corruption in the context of international
aid.161

(iii) Active and Passive Bribery

While Article 16(1) requires criminalization of active bribery of foreign public officials,
Article 16(2) only requires a State to consider criminalization of passive bribery (i.e.,
solicitation or acceptance of a bribe by foreign public officials). In other words, Article 16(2)
does not require States to criminalize the corrupt behaviour of foreign public officials. Such
conduct by foreign public officials is, or should be, a criminal offence of bribery under that
public official's own state law, as required by Article 15(b) of UNCAC. However, a State's
failure to enact legislation reflecting Article 16(2) would result in that State being unable to
prosecute a foreign public official for passive bribery. For example, because Canada has not
enacted provisions reflecting Article 16(2), Canada is unable to prosecute foreign public
officials for soliciting or accepting bribes and can only prosecute Canadian legal entities for
bribing foreign public officials. Prosecution of foreign public officials must be left, if at all,
to the foreign public officials' State.

(iv) For Business or other Undue Advantage

Kubiciel notes another significant difference between Articles 15 and 16: namely, Article
16(1) only prohibits acts of bribery intended to "obtain or retain business or other undue
advantage in relation to the conduct of international business."162 Article 15(a) and (b) has

159 For further commentary, see ibid at 178. The implementation of Article 16 has proven difficult due
to the definition of "foreign public official" (ibid at 181):

     [T]he foreign bribery offence is strictly linked to the status of the foreign public official in
     his or her own jurisdiction. Problems also arose where states did not implement a stand-
     alone provision but simply clarified that their bribery offences also apply to public officials
     in a foreign state or within an international organization.

160 Ibid at 178.
161 Legislative Guide (2012), supra note 11 at 67.
162 Kubiciel, supra note 9 at 151. Rose, Kubiciel & Landwehr, supra note 5 at 179-180 write that
business should be interpreted broadly, including all commercial activity, and that the article does
not require that the advantage be linked to immediate profit.

186                                                                                                     2022

no similar clause. Similarly, Article 1 of the OECD Convention only requires State Parties to
criminalize the offering or giving of bribes "in order to obtain or retain business or other
improper advantage in the conduct of international business." For example, a Canadian
citizen who bribes a police officer in Mexico to avoid being charged with drunk driving in
Mexico is not subject to prosecution for bribing a foreign public official under Canada's
CFPOA.

(v) Undue Advantage

Kubiciel also highlights the vagueness of the term "undue advantage" which appears in
both Articles 15 and 16 of UNCAC (as well as Article 1 of the OECD Convention). Kubiciel
states:

          The interpretation of the term "undue advantage" is even more complicated
          when national courts and law enforcement agencies have to evaluate
          whether an advantage offered or granted abroad is undue or not. Generally
          speaking, courts can apply the standards of their own legal order, so that
          they are not bound to the perceptions abroad. Thus, local traditions or the
          tolerance by foreign authorities are no excuse per se for offering or giving
          advantages to foreign public officials or officials of international
          organizations. However, advantages whose acceptance is permitted or even
          required by the foreign law are not criminalized by Article 16. [footnotes

The defences available for bribery of a foreign public official are the same as those for bribery
of a domestic public official, discussed at Section 2.1.2.

      3.1.3 Limitation Periods
The limitation periods for bribery of a foreign public official are the same for bribery of a

The sanction provisions in UNCAC for foreign bribery are the same as the sanctions for
domestic bribery, discussed at Section 2.1.4.

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

3.2 OECD Convention

      3.2.1 Offences

Article 1(1) of the OECD Convention requires that State Parties make it a criminal offence
under domestic law for:

           any person intentionally to offer, promise or give any undue pecuniary or
           other advantage, whether directly or through intermediaries, to a foreign
           public official, for that official or for a third party, in order that the official
           act or refrain from acting in relation to the performance of official duties, in
           order to obtain or retain business or other improper advantage in the
           conduct of international business.

(i) Active but Not Passive Bribery

Like UNCAC, the OECD Convention requires State Parties to criminalize active bribery, but
not passive bribery. Similarly, the OECD Convention also requires that the bribe be in relation
to "the conduct of international business." However, the OECD Convention does not require
states to consider the criminalization of passive bribery like Article 16(2) of UNCAC.164

(ii) Liability for Accomplices, Attempts and Conspiracy

Article 1(2) mandates that "complicity in, including incitement, aiding and abetting, or
authorisation of an act of bribery of a foreign public official shall be a criminal offence." The
Commentaries on the Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in
International Business Transactions (OECD Commentary), clarify that a foreign company
that pays a bribe while bidding for a foreign contract is still committing the offence of bribery
even if that company obtained the contract because they presented the best proposal rather
than because of the bribe. In addition, Article 1 requires State Parties to ensure that
"[a]ttempt and conspiracy to bribe a foreign public official shall be criminal offences to the
same extent as attempt and conspiracy to bribe a public official." Inchoate offences and party
liability are further explored in Chapter 3, Sections 3 and 4.

(iii) Definitions of Foreign Public Official and Official Duties

Article 1 also sets out the following definitions (paragraph 4):

           a) "foreign public official" means any person holding a legislative,
                administrative or judicial office of a foreign country, whether
                appointed or elected; any person exercising a public function for a
                foreign country, including for a public agency or public enterprise;
                and any official or agent of a public international organisation;

          b) "foreign country" includes all levels and subdivisions of government,
                from national to local;

          c) "act or refrain from acting in relation to the performance of official
                duties" includes any use of the public official's position, whether or
                not within the official's authorized competence.165

(iv) State Flexibility in Enacting OECD Convention Provisions

Pacini, Swingen and Rogers discuss the impact of the OECD Convention in their article "The
Role of the OECD and EU Conventions in Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials."166
They note that, unlike some earlier criminal law conventions, the OECD Convention is not
"self-executing." This means that the prohibitions contained within the provision are not
automatically part of domestic law. It is up to signatory nations to incorporate the elements
of the prohibition of the bribery of foreign public officials into domestic law--the goal is
"functional equivalency."167 In effect, Pacini et al. state that the Convention allows State
Parties "to pass legislation at different ends of a rather broad spectrum."168

      3.2.2 Defences

As already noted, Article 1 of the OECD Convention requires State Parties to the Convention
to make it "a criminal offence for any person intentionally to offer, promise or give an undue
pecuniary or other advantage ... to a foreign public official ... in order to obtain or retain ...
advantage in the conduct of international business." The Convention deals with "bribes"
and leaves punishment of the foreign public official who requests or receives a bribe to the
general corruption laws of the foreign state. Under Article 1, the briber must: (1) act
"intentionally" (2) the person being bribed must meet the broad definition under paragraph
4 of "foreign public official" (3) the "bribe" must constitute "an undue pecuniary or other
advantage" and (4) the advantage must be offered "in the conduct of international business."
Clearly, failure to prove any element of Article 1 constitutes a defence.

(i) Conduct of International Business

On its face, bribery by an NGO or a private company for charitable rather than business
purposes may not be covered by Article 1. However, a snapshot of 20 years of
implementation and enforcement of the OECD Convention by the Working Group on
Bribery, notes that "bribery committed through an intermediary, such as a subsidiary or

165 "Public function" and "public enterprise" are also defined terms. For brief commentary on these
definitions, see Robert W Tarun & Peter P Tomczak, The Foreign Corrupt Practices Handbook: A

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

other agent - and bribes for the benefit of family members, political parties or another third
party (e.g., a charity or company in which the official has an interest) - must also be made
illegal."169 Any uncertainty around the scope of Article 1 does not of course prevent
countries from prohibiting bribes to more effectively pursue charitable purposes. Several
countries, such as Canada, the US and the UK have done so in their domestic law. Canada
updated its CFPOA in 2013 to include the "charitable sector" (see Section 3.5.1). Previously,
the word "business" was limited by section 2 of the CFPOA to for-profit endeavours. The
post-2013 definition of "business" is not limited in this way and applies to bribery by NGOs
and other non-profit organizations.

In the US, the provisions of the FCPA are broader than those set out in Article 1 of the OECD
Convention. According to the FCPA guidance released by the US Department of Justice and
Securities Exchange Commission, "[i]n general, the FCPA prohibits offering to pay, paying,
promising to pay, or authorizing the payment of money or anything of value to a foreign
official in order to influence any act or decision of the foreign official in his or her official
capacity or to secure any other improper advantage in order to obtain or retain business."170
The Resource Guide goes on to note that "[t]he FCPA does not prohibit charitable
contributions or prevent corporations from acting as good corporate citizens. Companies,
however, cannot use the pretense of charitable contributions as a way to funnel bribes to
government officials."171

In the UK, the Bribery Act also provides a slightly more encompassing definition than that
provided in Article 1 of the OECD Convention. Section 6 of the Bribery Act deals with bribery
of foreign public officials. The person doing the bribing must intend to obtain or retain
"business" or "an advantage in the conduct of business." This is quite similar to the wording
used in Article 1 of the OECD Convention. However, under UK law the term "business"
includes "what is done in the course of a trade or profession."172 This broad definition of
business suggests that it may include the activities of a charitable organization or an NGO.

Further, in its Guidance document, the UK Ministry of Justice addresses the meaning of
"carrying on a business" (in the context of section 7, which deals with the failure of
commercial organizations to prevent bribery) as follows:

           As regards bodies incorporated, or partnerships formed, in the UK, despite
           the fact that there are many ways in which a body corporate or a partnership
           can pursue business objectives, the Government expects that whether such
           a body or partnership can be said to be carrying on a business will be

          answered by applying a common sense approach. So long as the
          organisation in question is incorporated (by whatever means), or is a
          partnership, it does not matter if it pursues primarily charitable or
          educational aims or purely public functions. It will be caught if it engages
          in commercial activities, irrespective of the purpose for which profits are
          made. 173

This excerpt suggests that charities and other NGO non-profit organizations are considered
to be engaging in "business." If a charity is considered a "business" for the purpose of section
7 of the Act, it follows that the charity's activities are considered to be "business" for the
purpose of section 6 of the Act, given the presumption of consistent usage of terms in
legislation.

(ii) Undue Advantage

Article 1 also refers to "undue ... advantage." Does the word "undue" permit facilitation
payments? Facilitation payments are relatively small bribes paid to induce a foreign official
to do something (such as issue a licence) that the official is already mandated to do. In order
for a payment to be properly classified as a facilitation payment, "[t]he condition must be
that these transfers really are of a minor nature not exceeding the social norm pertaining to them
in the society in question."174

The OECD Convention does not clearly permit or forbid facilitation payments, however
Commentary 9 provides the following:

          Small "facilitation" payments do not constitute payments made "to obtain
          or retain business or other improper advantage" within the meaning of
          paragraph 1 and accordingly, are also not an offence. Such payments,
          which, in some countries, are made to induce public officials to perform
          their functions, such as issuing licenses or permits, are generally illegal in
          the foreign country concerned. Other countries can and should address this
          corrosive phenomenon by such means as support for programmes of good
          governance. However, criminalisation by other countries does not seem a
          practical or effective complementary action.175

175 OECD Commentary, supra note 167 at para 9. Additionally, Tarun & Tomczak, supra note 165 at
68, state:

            As with the FCPA, small facilitation payments made with the intention of expediting or
            securing the performance of a routine governmental action are excluded from the definition
            of improper payments under the OECD Convention. By referring to "other improper
            advantage" the convention intends to address situations where a payment is made to obtain
            something to which the company is clearly not entitled (e.g. an operating permit for a
            factory that failed to meet local health and safety standards).

                                                                                                          191
GLOBAL CORRUPTION

The FCPA does not prohibit facilitation payments, but the UK Bribery Act does prohibit them.
The 2013 amendments of the Canadian CFPOA, proclaimed into force on October 31, 2017,
also prohibit facilitation payments. The issue of facilitation payments is more fully analyzed
in Section 4.

(iii) Specific Defences

There are no special or specific defences under the OECD Convention for bribery of foreign
public officials, but Commentary 7 and 8 provide:

          7. It is also an offence irrespective of, inter alia, the value of the advantage, its
          results, perceptions of local custom, the tolerance of such payments by local
          authorities, or the alleged necessity of the payment in order to obtain or retain
          business or other improper advantage.
          8. It is not an offence, however, if the advantage was permitted or required by the
          written law or regulation of the foreign public official's country, including case
          law. 176

Otherwise, the general assumption is that this offence will be subject to the same defences
that apply to other such crimes in the State Party's criminal law.

      3.2.3 Limitation Periods

Article 6 of the OECD Convention addresses statutes of limitations. It states:

          Any statute of limitations applicable to the offence of bribery of a foreign
          public official shall allow an adequate period of time for the investigation
          and prosecution of this offence.

The meaning of an "adequate" period of time is not clear. The OECD has not provided any
further guidance to signatories regarding Article 6 in the Convention itself or in the
Commentaries. There is some discussion of its meaning elsewhere.177

The UK and Canada have no statutory limitation periods for their bribery and corruption
offences. For a discussion of US statutory limitation periods, see Section 3.3.3.

      3.2.4 Sanctions

The OECD Convention has very few provisions on sentences and sanctions for corruption
of foreign public officials.178 Article 3 of the OECD Convention is entitled "Sanctions."
Paragraph 1 requires bribery of foreign officials to "be punishable by effective, proportionate
and dissuasive criminal penalties comparable to the penalties for corruption of domestic
officials."

Paragraph 2 requires State Parties which do not recognize "corporate criminal liability" to
ensure that legal persons are "subject to effective, proportionate and dissuasive non-criminal
sanctions, including monetary sanctions for bribery of foreign public officials."

Paragraph 3 and 4 of Article 3 also provide as follows:

           3. Each Party shall take such measures as may be necessary to provide
                that the bribe and the proceeds of the bribery of a foreign public
                official, or property the value of which corresponds to that of such
                proceeds, are subject to seizure and confiscation or that monetary
                sanctions of comparable effect are applicable.

           4. Each Party shall consider the imposition of additional civil or
                administrative sanctions upon a person subject to sanctions for the
                bribery of a foreign public official.

3.3 US

The United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) represents the first attempt by a state
to criminalize the bribery of foreign public officials. First enacted in 1977, it is significant in
scope and application and has led to numerous high profile prosecutions.179 The very broad
jurisdictional reach of the FCPA will be analyzed in Chapter 3, Section 1.7. For now, suffice
it to say, it applies not only to American citizens and corporations, but to all foreign
corporations doing business (widely defined) in the US or traded on a US stock exchange.180
The FCPA has often served as a model for other countries wishing to implement similar
legislation. It was amended in 1998 in order to conform to the requirements of the OECD
Convention.

For an in-depth guide to the FCPA, see Tarun & Tomczak, The Foreign Corrupt Practices
Handbook: A Practical Guide for Multinational General Counsel, Transactional Lawyers and White

sanctions by the OECD generally, and at 62-64 for guidance on sanctions for legal persons.

      3.3.1 Bribing a Foreign Official

The following brief comments on § 78dd-1 are based on Tarun and Tomczak's Handbook and
the Resource Guide (cited at 165 and 170).

(i) Provision

Section 78dd-1 of the FCPA prohibits the bribing of foreign officials or political parties. As
highlighted in Tarun & Tomzcak's Handbook, the FCPA's bribery offense contains five
elements:

          1. A payment, offer, authorization, or promise to pay money or anything
                of value, directly or through a third party;

          2. To (a) any foreign official, (b) any foreign political party or party
                official, (c) any candidate for foreign political office, (d) any official of
                a public international organization, or (e) any other person while
                "knowing" that the payment or promise to pay will be passed on to
                one of the above;

          3. Using an instrumentality of interstate commerce (such as telephone,
                telex, email, or the mail) by any person (whether US or foreign) or an
                act outside the United States by a domestic concern or US person, or
                an act in the United States by a foreign person in furtherance of the
                offer, payment, or promise to pay;

          4. For the corrupt purpose of (a) influencing an official act or decision of
                that person, (b) inducing that person to do or omit doing any act in
                violation of his or her lawful duty, (c) securing an improper
                advantage, or (d) inducing that person to use his influence with a
                foreign government to affect or influence any government act or
                decision; and

          5. In order to assist the company in obtaining or retaining business for or
                with any person or directing business to any person.183

It is important to note that the FCPA criminalizes active bribery (the person offering the
bribe), but does not address passive bribery (the person receiving the bribe), and the scope
of the offense is restricted to bribes made for the purpose of "obtaining or retaining
business," which parallels the provisions of UNCAC and the OECD Convention. The FCPA
also does not criminalize commercial bribery, although accounting offenses may catch

commercial bribery. Deferred prosecution agreements also might require companies to
refrain from commercial bribery.184

(ii) Authorization

Authorization can be explicit or implicit.185 In some circumstances, acquiescence might be
sufficient to indicate authorization.186

(iii) Anything of Value

The phrase "anything of value" is not defined in the FCPA. However, it has been interpreted
broadly by the SEC and DOJ, and includes both tangible and intangible benefits.187 The thing
of value will often be less direct than cash. There is no minimum threshold amount, but
"DOJ's and SEC's anti- bribery enforcement actions have focused on small payments and
gifts only when they comprise part of a systemic or long-standing course of conduct that
evidences a scheme to corruptly pay foreign officials to obtain or retain business."188 Wei
Zhang notes that the phrase "anything of value" has been interpreted expansively and is in
"accordance with the definition of bribery contained in the domestic anti-bribery statute."189

(iv) Foreign Official

Under the FCPA, "foreign official" is defined as an officer or employee of "a foreign
government or any department, agency or instrumentality thereof, or of a public
international organization," or any person working for or on behalf of any of those entities.
Foreign governments are not included in the provisions. As a result, when the Iraqi
government received kickbacks during the UN Oil-for-Food program, the DOJ was obliged
to turn to the accounting offenses to charge the companies involved.190

According to Koehler in his book, The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in a New Era, the definition
of "foreign official" is in dispute, but enforcement agencies tend to interpret the phrase
broadly.191 This means that "FCPA scrutiny can arise from business interactions with a

Press, 2014) at 201.
187 Tarun & Tomczak note that, while no FCPA decisions had addressed "anything of value" at the
time, federal courts that addressed similar domestic bribery legislation had interpreted the term
broadly to include such intangible property including "information," witness testimony, and
promises of future employment: supra note 165 at 6.

where the bribe receiver is not a public official. The Act prohibits travel in interstate or international
commerce that carries out unlawful activity, which includes activity in violation of state commercial
bribery laws. See Tim Martin, International Bribery Law and Compliance Standards, (Independent

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

variety of individuals, not just bona fide foreign government officials."192 According to
Deming, "[a] critical factor in determining whether someone is a foreign public official is
whether the individual occupies a position of public trust with official responsibilities."193

Whether a state-owned enterprise is an "instrumentality" is particularly open to dispute.194
According to the Resource Guide, to determine whether an entity is an "instrumentality," an
entity's ownership, control, status and function should be considered.195 Generally, an entity
will not be included in the definition of "instrumentality" if foreign government ownership
is less than 50%, unless the government has special shareholder status.196

In United States v Esquenazi,197 the Eleventh Circuit concluded that the definition of
"instrumentality," under the FCPA, was "an entity controlled by the government of a foreign
country that performs a function the controlling government treats as its own."198 The
Eleventh Circuit determined "that this test is a fact-bound inquiry" and provided a non-
exhaustive list of factors to determine whether the government "controls" an entity:

      the foreign government's formal designation of that entity;
      whether the government has a majority interest in the entity;
      the government's ability to hire and fire the entity's principals;
      the extent to which the entity's profits, if any, go directly into the governmental

          fiscal accounts, and, by the same token, the extent to which the government funds
          the entity if it fails to break even; and
      the length of time these indicia have existed.199

Furthermore, "to determine whether the entity performs a function that the government
treats as its own," the Eleventh Circuit listed the following non-exhaustive factors:

      whether the public and the government of that foreign country generally perceive
          the entity to be performing a governmental function.200

Additionally, it should be noted that "a number of courts in other circuits have approved
final jury instructions providing a similar non-exclusive list of factors to be considered."201

Public international organizations include the World Bank, International Monetary Fund,
World Trade Organization, OECD, Red Cross and African Union.202

(v) Knowledge

Payments or offers cannot be made through third parties if the defendant knows the
payment or offer will be passed on as a bribe. Actual knowledge is not required. Although
carelessness or foolishness is not sufficient, knowledge includes wilful blindness towards or
awareness of a high probability that the payment will be used to bribe a foreign official.203
This means companies must be alert to "red flags," such as close relations between a third
party and a foreign public official or a request by the third party to make payments to
offshore bank accounts.204

(vi) Application

The anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA apply to three categories of legal entities and all
officers, directors, employees, agents and shareholders thereof:

     1) "issuers": any company listed on a US stock exchange
     2) "domestic concerns": any citizen, national, or resident of the US or any company

          that is organized under the laws of the US
     3) "persons or entities acting within the territory of the US": any foreign national or

          non-issuer who engages in any act in furtherance of corruption while in the
          territory of the US.

As already noted, the jurisdictional reach of the FCPA will be dealt with in greater depth in
Chapter 3, Section 1.7.

(vii) Business Purpose Test

For a bribe to constitute an offence under the FCPA, the prosecution must show that the
defendant bribed a foreign official intending the official to act in a manner which would
assist the defendant in "obtaining or retaining business." Though this wording appears
restrictive on its face, US courts have given a broad interpretation to "obtaining and
retaining." For example, in US v Kay (2004), the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals held that
bribes paid to obtain favorable tax treatment--which reduced a company's customs duties

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

and sales taxes on imports--could (but do not necessarily) constitute "obtaining and
retaining business" within the meaning of the FCPA.205 The court ruled that avoidance of
taxes can provide a company with an improper advantage over its competitors, which
necessarily allows the company a greater probability of obtaining and retaining business.

Bribes in the conduct of business or to gain a business advantage also satisfy the business
purpose test. Other examples of prohibited actions include bribe payments to reduce or
eliminate customs duties, to obtain government action to prevent competitors from entering
a market, to influence the adjudication of lawsuits or enforcement actions, or to circumvent
a licensing or permit requirement. As the Resource Guide puts it:

          In short, although the FCPA does not cover every type of bribe paid around
          the world for every purpose, it does apply broadly to bribes paid to help
          obtain or retain business, which can include payments made to secure a
          wide variety of unfair business advantages.206

It should also be noted that UNCAC has expanded the definition of "international business"
to include the provision of international aid. This means that nonprofit organizations
"should be presumed to be fully subject to the anti-bribery provisions."207

(viii) Corrupt and Willful Intent

To violate the FCPA, a bribe must be made "corruptly," which focuses on the intention of
the defendant; there must be an "evil motive" or intent to wrongfully influence the
recipient.208 Under the FCPA, it is not necessary that a bribe succeed in its purpose (i.e.,
actually influence a foreign official to act corruptly). If the prosecution can prove that the
defendant intended to induce the foreign official to misuse their position of power, then the
burden of proof is met, regardless of the foreign official's actual conduct or the effect on the
defendant's business. For example, in United States v Joo Hyun Bahn, et al.,209 a New York
commercial real estate broker paid a "middleman" to a government official at the sovereign
wealth fund of a Middle Eastern country, a $500,000 payment, with the promise of a $2.5
million dollar bribe, to "induce the sovereign wealth fund to buy an $800 million dollar office
building complex owned by the broker's client."210 In reality the "middleman" did not have
any relationship with the government foreign official, however, "[e]ven though there was

206 DJSEC Resource Guide (2020), supra note 170 at 13. Note also that where prior the DJSEC guidance

no foreign official actually receiving the bribe, the defendant was convicted of violating the
FCPA.211 Practically speaking, even though there is no legal requirement that the defendant
benefit from the corrupt bribe, the DOJ is still less likely to take enforcement action where
the defendant has not personally benefitted.

The prosecution must also prove that the defendant acted "willfully." This is generally
construed by courts to mean an act committed "deliberately and with the intent to do
something that the law forbids, that is, with a bad purpose to disobey or disregard the
law."212 It is not necessary that the defendant knew the specific law that he or she was
breaking (i.e., that their conduct violated the FCPA), but merely that the defendant knew
that his or her actions were unlawful.213 It should be noted, however, that proof of
willfulness is not required to establish corporate or civil liability.214

Intent is often a difficult element for the prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt in
relation to bribery offences. Tarun and Tomczak point out that the search for intent:

          [W]ill frequently turn on the transparency of a payment or relationship,
          direct or indirect, with a foreign official. While some transactions or
          relationships will be fully concealed and thus likely corroborative of a
          corrupt plan or scheme, others will reveal a confounding mixture of
          visibility and secrecy that can defeat a conclusion of evil motive beyond a
          reasonable doubt.215

Tarun also notes that related accounting offenses are often "telltale" indications of corrupt
intent. 216

(ix) Gifts, Entertainment and Charitable Contributions

Gifts are often used to foster cordial business relationships and promote products,217
especially in countries where gift-giving is culturally mandated, such as China. If a gift is
given with no corrupt intent, the FCPA will not apply. However, gifts and charitable
donations often disguise bribes and the line between proper and improper gifts is fuzzy,
creating a compliance minefield for companies. Further, there is no de minimis exemption in
the FCPA (meaning that when "read literally, the FCPA prohibits in theory almost any kind
of gift or form of entertainment, even nominal ones, assuming that all other elements are
met"218). The Resource Guide states that larger, more extravagant gifts are more likely to

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

indicate corrupt motives, although small gifts might be part of a larger pattern of bribery.219
For example, in SEC v Veraz Networks, Inc (2010), the SEC settled with Veraz for violations
relating to improper gifts. According to Tarun, "[t]he Veraz gift allegations - down to the
detail of giving flowers for an executive's wife - represent an extreme SEC charging example
and would not by themselves have likely resulted in an enforcement action. Still, the case
demonstrates that the SEC will charge even minor gift abuses if they are part of a scheme."220
More recently, in United States v SBM Offshore,221 "a publicly traded energy company in the
Netherlands resolved with DOJ over bribes it paid that included extravagant gifts such as
paying for foreign officials to travel to sporting events and providing them with `spending
money,' paying for school tuition for the children of foreign officials, and shipping luxury
vehicles to foreign officials."222

Not everyone agrees with the SEC and DOJ's line-drawing; for example, the decision to fine
BHP Billiton $25 million for hosting foreign officials at the 2008 Olympics, despite the
absence of evidence of any specific quid pro quo, has been criticized for going too far.223 The
Resource Guide notes that "DOJ and SEC enforcement cases thus have involved single
instances of large, extravagant gift-giving (such as sports cars, fur coats, and other luxury
items) as well as widespread gifts of smaller items as part of a pattern of bribes."224

According to the Resource Guide, the "hallmarks of appropriate gift-giving" are transparency,
proper recording in the giver's books and records, a purpose of showing esteem or gratitude
and permissibility under local law.225 The DOJ has approved charitable donations, but will
consider whether companies carry out proper due diligence and implement control
measures to ensure that donations are unrelated to business purposes and used properly.226

      3.3.2 Defenses

In 1988, Congress added two affirmative defenses to the FCPA. In order to defend against a
charge of foreign bribery, the defendant must prove either that:

     (a) the payment was lawful under the written laws of the foreign country, or
     (b) the payment was a reasonable and bona fide expenditure, such as travel and

          lodging expenses, incurred by a foreign official and was directly related either to
          (i) the promotion, demonstration or explanation of products or services, or (ii) the
          execution or performance of a contract (for example, this could include travel and

          expenses incurred for training or meetings, or to visit company facilities or
          operations).227

The fact that an act would not be prosecuted in a foreign country is not enough to invoke
the local law defense. The payment itself must be lawful under foreign law.228 Because no
foreign countries permit bribery in their written laws, the local law defense is "largely
meaningless,"229 according to Koehler. However, Tarun points out that the defense could be
useful in the context of political campaign contributions.230

The reasonable and bona fide expenditure defense can absolve a company of liability for
providing gifts, travel, hospitality and entertainment for foreign officials. However, if
carried too far, these expenditures can become improper and lead to FCPA scrutiny. For
example, the defense will not cover side trips to tourist destinations with the sole purpose
of personal entertainment.231 The Resource Guide provides some guidance as to what
constitutes appropriate expenses.232

In addition, situations of extortion or duress afford a defense by negating "corrupt intent."
That being said, "economic coercion" does not amount to extortion.233 In other words, the
argument that the bribe was required in order to gain entry into the market or to obtain a
contract will fail--see United States v Kozeny.234 In addition, if extortion payments are not
recorded properly, the SEC may pursue accounting offenses.235 See Tarun and Tomczak for
a list of potential defenses to bribery and accounting offenses under the FCPA.236 See also
the discussion of other criminal law defenses in Section 2.3.2.

The case of James Giffen provides an example of a unique defense, nick-named the "spy
defense." Giffen was charged with violating the FCPA after he allegedly used $84 million
from US oil companies to bribe Kazakhstan's president and various officials. However, the
prosecution failed. Giffen claimed he was an informant for the CIA and argued that the US
government was supporting his actions all along. The court agreed, and New York judge
William Pauley called Giffen a "hero" for advancing US strategic interests in Central Asia.237

      3.3.3 Limitation Periods for Bribery of a Foreign Official

According to the Resource Guide, the FCPA does not specify a statute of limitations and
accordingly the general statute of limitation periods apply:

          [f]or substantive violations of the FCPA anti-bribery provisions, the five-
          year limitations period set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3282 applies.... For violations
          of the FCPA accounting provisions, which are defined as "securities fraud
          offense[s]" under 18 U.S.C. § 3301, there is a limitations period of six
          years. 238

However, as the Resource Guide points out, there are several ways to extend the limitation
period. For example, if the case is one of conspiracy, the prosecution need only prove that
one act in furtherance of the conspiracy occurred during the limitations period. Thus, the
prosecution may be able to "reach" bribery or accounting offenses occurring prior to the five
year limitation if the offenses contributed to the conspiracy.239

The limitation period can also be extended if the company or individual is cooperative and
enters into a tolling agreement that voluntarily extends the limitation (i.e., waives the right
to claim the litigation should be dismissed due to expiration of the limitation period).
Koehler points out that, in practice, enforcement actions against corporations usually
involve conduct outside the scope of the limitations period, since corporations are given the
choice of extending the limitation or being charged by the DOJ. Koehler criticizes this tactic,
pointing out that enforcement agencies face no time pressure, which means "the gray cloud
of FCPA scrutiny often hangs over a company far too long."240

Finally, if the government is seeking evidence from foreign countries, the prosecutor may
apply for a court order suspending the statute of limitations for up to three years.

      3.3.4 Sanctions

For violation of the anti-bribery provisions, corporations and other business entities are
liable to a fine of up to $2 million, while individuals (including officers, directors,
stockholders and agents of companies) are subject to a fine of up to $250,000 and
imprisonment for a maximum of 5 years. Fines imposed on individuals may not be paid by
their principal or employer.241

However, the Alternative Fines Act 18 USC § 3571(d) provides for the imposition of higher
fines at the court's discretion. The increased fine can be up to twice the benefit that the
defendant obtained in making the bribe, "as long as the facts supporting the increased fines
are included in the indictment and either proved to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt or

admitted in a guilty plea proceeding."242 The same Act specifies that the maximum fine for
an individual charged under the FCPA is $250,000 (see § 3571(e)). Actual penalties are
determined by reference to the US Sentencing Guidelines.243 Chapter 7, Section 4 contains a
detailed discussion of US sentencing practices.

      3.3.5 Facilitation Payments

The FCPA contains a narrow exemption in § 78dd-1(b) for "facilitating or expediting
payment[s] ... made in furtherance of a `routine governmental action' that involves non-
discretionary acts." According to the Resource Guide, such governmental actions could
include processing visas, providing police protection and mail service and the supply of
utilities.244 It would not include such actions as the decision to award or continue business
with a party, or any act within the official's discretion that would constitute the misuse of
the official's office. The general focus is on the purpose of the payment rather than its
value.245 The Resource Guide notes the OECD's Working Group on Bribery recommends "that
all countries encourage companies to prohibit or discourage facilitating payments."246 The
Resource Guide recommends companies discourage facilitating payments despite their
legality under the FCPA, since they may still violate local laws in the country where the
company is operating, and other countries' foreign bribery laws may not contain a similar
exception (such as the UK).247 As a result, American individuals and companies may find
they still face sanctions in other countries despite the FCPA's facilitation payment exception.

Finally, facilitation payments must be properly recorded in the issuer's books and records.248
A discussion of the FCPA's facilitation payments exemption and its pros and cons is
provided in Section 4.

      3.4.1 Offences

As noted in Section 2.4.2, the UK Bribery Act addresses both foreign and domestic bribery
and applies to individuals and other legal entities. In addition to its general anti-bribery
prohibitions, the Bribery Act also contains a discrete offence in section 6 that applies to

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

bribery of foreign public officials. The reach of sections 1, 2 and 7 is very broad, subject only
to jurisdictional constraints. As a result, it is difficult to envisage conduct falling within the
foreign bribery offence that would not already be covered by the other offences. Sullivan
posits that the primary role for the offence of bribing foreign public officials is to "flag clearly
that the United Kingdom is compliant with its treaty obligations to combat the bribery of
public officials."250

Section 6 criminalizes the giving or promising of an advantage to a foreign public official in
order to gain or retain business or a business advantage. Importantly, the offence only covers
"active bribery" and not the acceptance of bribes. The briber must know the receiver is a
public official and must intend to influence the official in the performance of his or her
functions as a public official. Unlike section 1, the briber need not intend to influence the
recipient to act improperly.251 This is very different from the FCPA, which requires corrupt
intent. Under section 6, the intention to influence the foreign official in and of itself makes
out the offence, regardless of whether the briber knows their conduct is improper or
unlawful. This means that a reasonable belief in a legal obligation to confer an advantage
does not provide a defence.252 Cropp criticizes this minimal mens rea requirement and
illustrates its absurdity by describing trivial, de minimis, scenarios that meet all the
requirements of a section 6 offence.253 Although the Director of Public Prosecutions and the
SFO are unlikely to allow prosecution of such de minimis allegations, Cropp argues that
prosecutorial discretion should not be the only check on "overbreadth of application."254
According to Cropp, businesses should not have to depend on the whims of the prosecutor
to avoid liability, but rather should be able to determine what conduct will result in
prosecution from the Bribery Act itself. He further notes that this "unusual reliance on official
discretion ... raises serious concerns about the extent to which the Act will be applied
consistently and transparently."255

A bribe can be made directly or through a third party, and can be received by the foreign
public official or by another person at the official's request or with their assent. Because the
official must have assented or acquiesced to the bribe, section 6 captures less peripheral and
preliminary conduct than the FCPA.256 Instead, the UK regime relies on inchoate offences to
capture such conduct.

"Foreign public officials" are defined in subsection (5) as individuals who hold legislative,
administrative, or judicial positions, as well as individuals who are not part of government,
but still exercise a public function on behalf of a country, public enterprise or international
organization. The definition does not include political parties or political candidates.

Corporate hospitality presents a challenge for companies trying to comply with the foreign
bribery provisions, especially in light of the absence of a corrupt intent requirement in
section 6.257 Corporate hospitality is a legitimate part of doing business, but can easily cross
the line to bribery. The Ministry of Justice Guidance states that the Bribery Act does not intend
to criminalize "[b]ona fide hospitality and promotional, or other business expenditure which
seeks to improve the image of a commercial organization, better to present products and
services or to establish cordial relations."258 The Guidance also states that "some reasonable
hospitality for the individual and his or her partner, such as fine dining and attendance at a
baseball match"259 are unlikely to trigger section 6. According to the Guidance, the more
lavish the expenditure, the stronger the inference that the expenditure is intended to
influence the official.

      3.4.2 Defences

If the foreign public official is permitted or required by the written law applicable to that
official to be influenced by an offer, promise, or gift, then the offence is not made out (see
section 6(3)(b)). The official must be specifically entitled to accept the payment or offer; the
silence of local law on the matter is not sufficient to ground the defence. Section 6(7)
addresses this defence in more detail. It clarifies that where the public official's relevant
function would be subject to the law of the UK, the law of the UK is applicable. If the
performance of the official's actions would not be subjected to UK law, the written law is
either the rules of the organization or the law of the country or territory for which the foreign
public official is acting (including constitutional or legislative laws as well as published
judicial decisions).

The UK Bribery Act 2010 contains no other specific defences to section 6. For a discussion of
general criminal law defences, see Section 2.4.3.

      3.4.3 Limitation Periods

As described in Section 2.4.4, the UK Bribery Act is not subject to any limitation periods.

      3.4.4 Sanctions

The applicable penalties have already been discussed at Section 2.4.5 under domestic
bribery.

      3.4.5 Facilitation Payments

The UK Bribery Act, unlike the American FCPA, does not provide an exemption for
facilitation payments. However the Joint Prosecution Guidance of the Director of the Serious
Fraud Office and the Director of Public Prosecutions state that whether it is in the public interest
to prosecute for bribery in the case of facilitation payments will depend on a number of

3.5 Canada

      3.5.1 Offences

The Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act (CFPOA) came into force in 1999 in order to meet
Canada's obligations under the OECD Convention. Section 3(1) of the CFPOA states:

          Every person commits an offence who, in order to obtain or retain an
          advantage in the course of business, directly or through a third party gives,
          offers or agrees to give or offer a loan, reward, advantage or benefit of any
          kind to a foreign public official or to any person for the benefit of a foreign
          public official

                (a) as consideration for an act or omission by the official in connection
                     with the performance of the official's duties or functions; or

                (b) to induce the official to use his or her position to influence any acts
                     or decisions of the foreign state or public international
                     organization for which the official performs duties or functions.

As pointed out by Deming, the inclusion of the words "in order to obtain or retain an
advantage" indicates a quid pro quo element.263 Since no particular mens rea is specified for
this crime, Canadian law presumes that the necessary mental element is subjective. There is
nothing in the context of this offence to displace that presumption. Proof of negligence will
not be enough; to be held liable the accused person must have committed the offence with
the intention of doing so or with recklessness or willful blindness to the facts. The definition
of "person" in the Criminal Code also applies to the bribery offences in section 3 of the
CFPOA, by reason of section 34(2) of the Interpretation Act.264 The definition of "person" in
section 2 of the Criminal Code includes both individuals and other organizations, including
corporations.

In R v Niko Resources Ltd (2011), the court demonstrated that gifts of significant value are
liable to be considered a "reward, advantage or benefit"265 under the CFPOA. Niko, an oil
and gas company, gave the Bangladeshi Minister for Energy and Mineral Resources an
expensive SUV and a trip to Calgary and New York in order to influence ongoing business

York was purely to visit family. These benefits were provided after an explosion at one of
Niko's gas wells in Bangladesh, which had caused bad press and legal problems for Niko.
The court imposed a fine of almost $9.5 million, in spite of the relatively small value of the
gifts in comparison to the size of the fine and Niko's cooperation during the investigation.266

In R v Karigar (2017), the court clarified the proper interpretation of "agrees" within section
3(1) of the CFPOA.267 Acting as an employee of Cryptometrics Canada, Karigar agreed with
other employees of the company to bribe Indian officials in order to secure a multi-million
dollar contract with Air India. Karigar was convicted of agreeing to offer a bribe to a foreign
public official, contrary to section 3(1)(b) of the CFPOA. On appeal, Karigar challenged the
meaning of the word "agree" within section 3 of the CFPOA, submitting that "the Crown
must prove an agreement between the accused and the foreign public official and that it is
not sufficient to prove a conspiracy to offer a bribe to a foreign public official."268 Upholding
the trial judge's interpretation, the ONCA held that "agrees" within section 3(1) of the
CFPOA is interpreted to include "both a direct and an indirect agreement to give or to offer
an advantage."269 Furthermore, the court held that "the offence of `agreeing' to give or offer
a benefit to a foreign public official in section 3 of the Act includes an agreement among two
or more people to offer a bribe to a foreign public official, and does not require the Crown
to prove an agreement with or payment to a particular foreign official. To do so would make
the legislation difficult or impossible to enforce, possibly undermining international comity
obligations."270 The court dismissed the appeal, agreeing with the trial judge that "to read in
such a limitation would constrain the ability of the Crown to enforce the policy of the Act in
accordance with Canada's obligations under the [OECD Convention]."271

"Foreign public official" is defined in section 2 of the CFPOA as follows:

                (a) a person who holds a legislative, administrative or judicial
                     position of a foreign state;

                (b) a person who performs public duties or functions for a foreign
                     state, including a person employed by a board, commission,
                     corporation or other body or authority that is established to
                     perform a duty or function on behalf of the foreign state, or is
                     performing such a duty or function; and

                (c) an official or agent of a public international organization that is
                     formed by two or more states or governments, or by two or more
                     such public international organizations.

This definition does not include political party officials or political candidates.

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

In response to criticism from a number of commentators as well as the OECD Working
Group, Canada amended the CFPOA. Bill S-14, An Act to Amend the Corruption of Foreign
Public Officials Act received royal assent and subsequently came into force in June, 2013.
Previously, the word "business" was limited by section 2 of the CFPOA to for-profit
endeavours. This has since been replaced by a definition of "business" that is not limited in
this way. Thus it also applies to bribery by NGOs and other non-profit organizations,
although according to Norm Keith, RCMP investigations remain focused on for-profit
businesses.272 In addition, the jurisdictional provisions under the former CFPOA were
amended in 2013 and the CFPOA now applies to the acts of Canadian citizens, permanent
residents and Canadian corporations while they are outside of Canadian territory.
Previously, Canada's ability to prosecute those engaged in bribery of foreign officials was
limited by the concept of "territoriality": in order for a person to be held liable under the
CFPOA there had to be a real and substantial link between the acts which constituted the
offence and Canada (discussed in detail in Chapter 3, Section 1.9). The 2013 amendments
also establish accounting offences, which make it a crime to falsify accounting records for
the purpose of facilitating or concealing the bribery of a foreign public official.

As noted by Deming, the secret commissions offence under section 426 of the Criminal Code
may be used to supplement the CFPOA if Canada has territorial jurisdiction over the conduct
at issue. The secret commissions offence covers any situation involving an agency
relationship and is not limited to situations in which the recipient of a bribe is a public
official. Section 426 could therefore be useful when dealing with recipients who do not meet
the definition of a foreign public official or when commercial bribery is at issue.273

      3.5.2 Defences

An accused charged with an offence under the CFPOA is entitled to the same general
defences as persons charged with other offences. These include mistake of fact, incapacity
due to mental disorder, duress, necessity, entrapment, diplomatic immunity and res judicata.

In addition, section 3(3) states that no person is guilty of an offence under section 3(1) where
the loan, reward, advantage or benefit is "permitted or required under the laws of the
foreign state or public international organization for which the foreign public official
performs duties or functions." Further, no person will be guilty where the benefit was "made
to pay the reasonable expenses incurred in good faith by or on behalf of the foreign public
official" where those expenses "are directly related to the promotion, demonstration, or
explanation of the person's products and services" or to "the execution or performance of a
contract between the person and the foreign state for which the official performs duties or
functions." According to Canada's 2013 Written Follow-Up to the OECD Phase 3 Report, the
defence of "reasonable expenses incurred in good faith"274 has not yet been considered by
any Canadian courts.

Keith pointed out the peculiarity of the wording of the defences in section 3(3). Both defences
use the words "loan, reward, advantage or benefit," but Keith argues these words "tend to
imply a potential questionable or even inappropriate payment to a foreign public official."275
Keith points out that providing "a loan to a foreign public official, with whom a Canadian
business must work" will rarely appear "ethical, lawful or permitted by the laws of a foreign
government,"276 and will rarely be appropriate as reimbursement for expenses incurred by
the official. As a result, Keith argues that the wording of section 3(3) is difficult for businesses
to interpret.

      3.5.3 Limitation Periods

Because the offences in the CFPOA are punishable by indictment, there are no limitation
periods in respect to laying a charge after an offence is alleged to have occurred. However,
since there was no offence in Canada of bribing a foreign public official prior to the
enactment of the CFPOA, there can be no prosecution of such conduct which occurred prior
to 1999.

      3.5.4 Sanctions

Bribing a foreign public official under section 3(1) is an indictable offence which was
punishable by a maximum of 5 years imprisonment until amendments were enacted in 2013
raising the maximum penalty to 14 years imprisonment. The accounting offences under
section 4 are also indictable and punishable by imprisonment for a maximum of 14 years.

Pursuant to Criminal Code amendments to section 742.1, the addition of subsection (c),
conditional sentences served in the community are no longer available sentencing options
for any indictable offence with a 14-year maximum penalty. Accused persons may also face
forfeiture of the proceeds of CFPOA offences, and Public Works and Government Services
Canada may not contract with businesses convicted under the CFPOA.277 These and other
consequences of a CFPOA conviction are dealt with in Chapter 7, Sections 7 to 10.

      3.5.5 Facilitation Payments

As part of the 2013 amendments discussed, facilitation payments, meaning those payments
made to either ensure or expedite routine acts that form part of a foreign public
official's official duties or functions, will no longer be exempt from liability under the
CFPOA. This provision was proclaimed in force as of October 31, 2017. The pros and cons
of facilitation payments are discussed in greater detail in Section 4.

4. FACILITATION PAYMENTS AND THE OFFENCE OF BRIBERY

Facilitation or "grease" payments are relatively small bribes paid to induce a foreign public
official to do something (such as issue a licence) that the official is already mandated to do.278
As Nicholls et al. point out, "those facing demands for such [payments] often feel there is no
practical alternative to acceding to them."279 In almost every case the payment will be illegal
in the public official's home state. Yet such payments are a routine way of life in most of the
countries listed in the bottom half or quarter of the TI Corruption Perception Index. Some of
the most developed nations do not prohibit their own nationals from making these
payments to public officials elsewhere. Other nations prohibit facilitation payments, but
make no effort to enforce that prohibition.280 UNCAC and the OECD Convention do not
expressly accept or reject exempting facilitation payments from the definition of offences of
bribery.

4.1 Facilitation Payments, Culture, and Economic Utility

While the debate surrounding the exemption of facilitation payments is beginning to abate
(that is, the prevailing international view is that facilitation payments constitute foreign
bribery281), it is nevertheless important to recognize two of the most circulated arguments
for not criminalizing facilitation payments: (1) that it is wrong for multinational corporations
and foreign states to impose western-centric views on corruption and facilitation payments
on countries where these payments are embedded within local customs (the culture
argument)282 and (2) that facilitation payments are economically efficient and allow firms to

278 Ingeborg Zerbes notes that in order for a payment to be properly classified as a facilitation
payment, "[t]he condition must be that these transfers really are of a minor nature not exceeding the
social norm pertaining to them in the society in question.": Zerbes, supra note 174. However, some
jurisdictions, like the US, may focus on the purpose of the payment rather than its value. Further, the
payment must not be in exchange for a breach of duty or involve a discretionary decision; its
purpose may only be for the inducement of a lawful act or decision on the part of the foreign public
official that does not involve an exercise of discretion.
279 Nicholls et al, supra note 45 at para 3.120.
280 As pointed out by Tim Martin, in practice, facilitation payments are not necessarily treated
differently in jurisdictions with prohibitions on facilitation payments as opposed to those without.
For example, in the US, the exception for facilitation payments has been substantially narrowed,
while in the UK, where facilitation payments are banned, prosecutorial policies make charges for
small facilitation payments less likely. See Martin, supra note 190.
281 For further commentary on the shift in attitude towards facilitation payments in the international
community over time, see Tyler Girard, "When Bribery is Considered an Economic Necessity:
Facilitation Payments, Norm Translation, and the Role of Cognitive Beliefs" (2021) 22:1 Intl Studies

navigate more quickly through the unnecessary and time-consuming red tape that exists in
certain highly bureaucratic states (the economic efficiency argument).283

4.2 US

As noted, the FCPA does not prohibit firms operating under its jurisdiction from making
facilitation payments to foreign public officials. The prosecution has the burden of negating
this exception. However, companies may still be liable under the FCPA's accounting
provisions if they make facilitation payments but fail to properly record the payments as
such. Firms are often unwilling to properly record facilitation payments as they are generally
prohibited under the domestic legislation of the foreign public official's home state.284 The
FCPA provides a more detailed description of what qualifies as a facilitation payment than
the OECD Convention; however, interestingly, the FCPA does not specifically require that
the payment be "small."285 Rather, the facilitation payments exception only applies to
payments which are "made to further `routine governmental action' that involves non-
discretionary acts."286

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

The facilitation payment exception under the FCPA has been called "illusory" by the SEC's
former Assistant Director of Enforcement due to enforcement patterns:

          [T]he fact that the FCPA's twin enforcement agencies have treated certain
          payments as prohibited despite their possible categorization as facilitating
          payments does not mean federal courts would agree. But because the vast
          majority of enforcement actions are resolved through DPAs [deferred
          prosecution agreements] and NPAs [non-prosecution agreements], and
          other settlement devices, these cases never make it to trial. As a result, the
          DOJ and the SEC's narrow interpretation of the facilitating payments
          exception is making that exception ever more illusory, regardless of
          whether the federal courts - or Congress - would agree.287

As other states intensify enforcement of domestic anti-bribery laws, it is becoming
increasingly likely that American corporations will face criminal charges in foreign countries
for offering or making facilitation payments. Some commentators find merit in the argument
that, as the chief enforcer of anti-bribery laws, the US must maintain the facilitation payment
exemption to "bridge the gap between the aspirational norm of total intolerance for bribery,
and the operational code in the field that actually determines how business gets done."288
Further, because the US is the predominant enforcer of anti-bribery legislation, perhaps "it
is even more important that its laws actually align with the aspiration norm it wishes to
achieve, or the gap between norm and practice will not narrow."289 Despite such arguments,
it does not appear that the US intends to change its stance on facilitation payments anytime
soon.

4.3 UK

As already noted, the UK Bribery Act does not contain an exception for facilitation payments.
Recognizing the practical difficulties potentially faced by UK businesses operating abroad,
the Government reiterated the basic principles of UK prosecution policy, including the
concept of proportionality (for example, it may not be in the public interest to prosecute

where the payments made were very small) and stated that the outcome in any particular
case will depend on the full circumstances of that case.290

The Joint Prosecution Guidance from the SFO and Ministry of Justice also notes that
"[f]acilitation payments that are planned for or accepted as part of a standard way of
conducting business may indicate the offence was premeditated,"291 which favours
prosecution. On the other hand, if the payer was in a "vulnerable position arising from the
circumstances in which the payment was demanded,"292 this militates against prosecution.
Additionally, the common law defence of duress may apply where individuals are faced
with no alternative but to make a payment to protect against loss of life, limb, or liberty.293
However, the defence has not been adapted or expanded to include non-physical
pressure.294 On the other hand, the less well recognized defence of necessity in England has
no similar restriction and might therefore be a viable defence.

4.4 Canada

                (5) Section 3(2) of Bill S-14 (2013), which came into force as of October
                     31, 2017, eliminates the exception for facilitation payments that
                     previously existed in the CFPOA in sections 3(4) and 3(5).

Section 4 of the CFPOA also criminalizes the actions of anyone who, "for the purpose of
bribing a foreign public official in order to obtain or retain an advantage in the course of
business or for the purpose of hiding that bribery," misrepresents bribe payments in books
and records or takes other steps to misrepresent or hide illicit bribery payments. Note that
this is in contrast to the accounting provisions in the USA under their FCPA, which require
accurate records be kept by issuers irrespective of what the payments are actually for.

5. ACCOUNTING (BOOKS AND RECORDS) OFFENCES

5.1 UNCAC

Creating criminal offences to punish false, deceptive or incomplete accounting of the
payment or receipt and use of money or other assets is seen as an essential and necessary
tool in fighting the hiding of corruption payments. Article 12 of UNCAC provides:

          1. Each State Party shall take measures, in accordance with the
                fundamental principles of its domestic law, to prevent corruption
                involving the private sector, enhance accounting and auditing
                standards in the private sector and, where appropriate, provide

                effective, proportionate and dissuasive civil, administrative or
                criminal penalties for failure to comply with such measures.

          2. Measures to achieve these ends may include, inter alia:

                (a) Promoting cooperation between law enforcement agencies and
                     relevant private entities;

                (b) Promoting the development of standards and procedures
                     designed to safeguard the integrity of relevant private entities,
                     including codes of conduct for the correct, honourable and proper
                     performance of the activities of business and all relevant
                     professions and the prevention of conflicts of interest, and for the
                     promotion of the use of good commercial practices among
                     businesses and in the contractual relations of businesses with the
                     State;

                (c) Promoting transparency among private entities, including, where
                     appropriate, measures regarding the identity of legal and natural
                     persons involved in the establishment and management of
                     corporate entities;

                (d) Preventing the misuse of procedures regulating private entities,
                     including procedures regarding subsidies and licences granted by
                     public authorities for commercial activities;

                (e) Preventing conflicts of interest by imposing restrictions, as
                     appropriate and for a reasonable period of time, on the
                     professional activities of former public officials or on the
                     employment of public officials by the private sector after their
                     resignation or retirement, where such activities or employment
                     relate directly to the functions held or supervised by those public
                     officials during their tenure;

                (f) Ensuring that private enterprises, taking into account their
                     structure and size, have sufficient internal auditing controls to
                     assist in preventing and detecting acts of corruption and that the
                     accounts and required financial statements of such private
                     enterprises are subject to appropriate auditing and certification
                     procedures.

          3. In order to prevent corruption, each State Party shall take such
                measures as may be necessary, in accordance with its domestic laws
                and regulations regarding the maintenance of books and records,
                financial statement disclosures and accounting and auditing
                standards, to prohibit the following acts carried out for the purpose of
                committing any of the offences established in accordance with this
                Convention:

                (a) The establishment of off-the-books accounts;
                (b) The making of off-the-books or inadequately identified

                     transactions;

                (c) The recording of non-existent expenditure;
                (d) The entry of liabilities with incorrect identification of their objects;
                (e) The use of false documents; and
                (f) The intentional destruction of bookkeeping documents earlier

                     than foreseen by the law.

          4. Each State Party shall disallow the tax deductibility of expenses that
                constitute bribes, the latter being one of the constituent elements of the
                offences established in accordance with articles 15 and 16 of this
                Convention and, where appropriate, other expenses incurred in
                furtherance of corrupt conduct.

The UNCAC Legislative Guide highlights the following features of Article 12:

          (1) Paragraph 1 of article 12 requires that States parties take three types of
                measures in accordance with the fundamental principles of their law.
                The first is a general commitment to take measures aimed at
                preventing corruption involving the private sector. The second type of
                measure mandated by paragraph 1 aims at the enhancement of
                accounting and auditing standards. Such standards provide
                transparency, clarify the operations of private entities, support
                confidence in the annual and other statements of private entities, and
                help prevent as well as detect malpractices. The third type of measure
                States must take relates to the provision, where appropriate, of
                effective, proportionate and dissuasive civil, administrative or
                criminal penalties for failure to comply with the accounting and
                auditing standards mandated above.295

          (2) Article 12, paragraph 2, outlines in its subparagraphs a number of
                good practices, which have been shown to be effective in the
                prevention of corruption in the private sector and in the enhancement
                of transparency and accountability.296

          (3) Risks of corruption and vulnerability relative to many kinds of illicit
                abuses are higher when transactions and the organizational structure
                of private entities are not transparent. Where appropriate, it is
                important to enhance transparency with respect to the identities of
                persons who play important roles in the creation and management or
                operations of corporate entities.297

The UN Working Group on the Prevention of Corruption has divided state implementation
of the provisions of Article 12 into three thematic categories: "([1] prevention and monitoring
through accounting and auditing standards--paragraphs 1 and 2(f); [2] sanctions for non-

5.2 OECD Convention

Article 8 of the OECD Convention stipulates that:

          1. In order to combat bribery of foreign public officials effectively, each
                Party shall take such measures as may be necessary, within the
                framework of its laws and regulations regarding the maintenance of
                books and records, financial statement disclosures, and accounting
                and auditing standards, to prohibit the establishment of off-the-books
                accounts, the making of off-the-books or inadequately identified
                transactions, the recording of non-existent expenditures, the entry of
                liabilities with incorrect identification of their object, as well as the use
                of false documents, by companies subject to those laws and
                regulations, for the purpose of bribing foreign public officials or of
                hiding such bribery.

          2. Each Party shall provide effective, proportionate and dissuasive civil,
                administrative or criminal penalties for such omissions and
                falsifications in respect of the books, records, accounts and financial
                statements of such companies.

The OECD Convention's implementation has immediate consequences. Commentary 29
states that "one immediate consequence of the implementation of this Convention by the
Parties will be that companies which are required to issue financial statements disclosing
their material contingent liabilities will need to take into account the full potential liabilities
under this Convention, in particular Articles 3 and 8, as well as other losses which might
flow from conviction of the company or its agents for bribery."299

Pacini, Swingen and Rogers discuss the impact of the OECD Convention in their article "The
Role of the OECD and EU Conventions in Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials."300
In addition to commenting on the contents of Commentary 29, they note that Article 8 has
implications for auditors, who "may be liable if they have not detected bribery of a foreign
public official by properly examining a company's books and records."301

Commentary 29 also points out that "the accounting offences referred to in Article 8 will
generally occur in the company's home country, when the bribery offence itself may have

301 Ibid. Nicholls et al, supra note 45 at para 17.93 also note the "key role played by auditors and
accountants in identifying foreign bribery in international business operations," which is evidenced
in the 2014 OECD Foreign Bribery Report, and underscores the importance of Article 8.

216                                                                                                   2022

been committed in another country, and this can fill gaps in the effective reach of the
Convention."

Unlike UNCAC, the OECD does not require State Parties to prohibit tax deductibility of
bribe expenses.302 However, the 2009 Recommendation of the Council for Further Combating
Bribery of Foreign Public Officials does urge State Parties to disallow deducting bribes from
taxes. 303

5.3 US

      5.3.1 Accounting Provisions

Accounting provisions in the FCPA are designed to prohibit off-the-books accounting.
Traditionally, enforcement of the provisions has been via civil actions filed by the Securities
Exchange Commission.304 The standard for imposing criminal liability is set out in §
78m(b)(5), which states that no person shall "knowingly" circumvent or fail to implement a
system of controls or "knowingly" falsify their records. This full mens rea of "knowingly"
removes liability for inadvertent errors, while willful blindness would still satisfy the
requisite intent.305 When prosecuted as a crime by the DOJ, the burden of proof is on the
prosecutor beyond a reasonable doubt. When dealt with as a civil offense by the SEC, the
burden of proof is the lower standard of balance of probabilities.306 In practice, most of the
books and records violations are dealt with as civil offenses by the SEC.307

FCPA provisions operate independently of the bribery provisions, and also amend the
Securities Exchange Act, meaning the accounting provisions apply to far more situations than
bribery, including accounting fraud and issuer disclosure cases. Furthermore, companies
engaged in bribery may also be violating the anti-fraud and reporting provisions found in
the Securities Exchange Act. The DOJ and SEC also may turn to accounting offenses when the
elements of a bribery offense cannot be made out.308

While judicial decisions on the accounting provisions are rare, the provisions are common
in enforcement actions that never make it to trial.309 As pointed out by Koehler, "the

305 Ibid at 832.
306 Tarun & Tomczak, supra note 165 at 25 state: "in the civil context, the accounting provisions
impose essentially strict liability on issuers, and do not require the showing of knowledge by an
issuer to sustain a civil violation of the FCPA's accounting provisions. Persons who are not issuers
must have `knowingly' circumvented or failed to implement a system of accounting controls in order
to violate the FCPA's accounting provisions."
307 Ibid at 25.
308 Ibid at 25.

current executive offers in federal court, see Mike Koehler, "SEC Charges Live Ventures and its
Current CEO and CFO with, Among Other Things, FCPA Books and Records and Internal Control
Violations" (11 August 2021), online (blog): FCPA Professor <https://fcpaprofessor.com/sec-charges-

[accounting] provisions, as currently enforced by enforcement agencies, are potent
supplements to FCPA's more glamorous anti-bribery provisions."310 The enthusiastic use of
accounting offenses in SEC settlements creates compliance challenges for companies.311

There are two general accounting provisions in the FCPA: the books and records provision
and the internal controls provision. Unlike the FCPA's anti-bribery provisions, the
accounting provisions do not apply to private companies. Instead, they apply to publicly

also Mike Koehler, "A Further Reminder that the FCPA has Always Been a Law Much Broader than
its Name Suggests" (26 February 2021), online (blog): FCPA Professor
<https://fcpaprofessor.com/reminder-fcpa-always-law-much-broader-name-suggests/>, which
comments:

     [T]he fact remains that most FCPA enforcement actions (that is enforcement actions that
     charge or find violations of the FCPA's books and records and internal controls provisions)
     have nothing to do with foreign bribery and these provisions are among the most generic
     legal provisions one can possibly find.

     ...

     Based on the above, the SEC found that Gulfport, among other things, violated the books
     and records provisions "by failing to record the true nature of the expenses as personal
     benefits and perquisites paid to Moore in the company's books, records, and accounts." In
     addition, the SEC found that Gulfport violated the internal controls provisions "by failing to
     implement sufficient internal accounting controls concerning perquisites and related person
     transactions."

     The Gulfport enforcement action is not only a reminder that the FCPA has always been a
     law much broader than its name suggests, but also a reminder just how inconsistent the
     SEC's approach is to enforcing the books and records and internal controls provisions.

     For instance, even though the Gulfport matter involved CEO conduct and resulted in
     material misstatements in its annual reports and definitive proxy statements, the
     enforcement action did not involve any monetary settlement amount.
     Compare this to the BHP Billiton enforcement action ... in which the SEC assessed a $25
     million civil penalty for - better sit down for this one - the company's "failure to devise and
     maintain sufficient internal controls over a global hospitality program that the company
     hosted in connection with its sponsorship of the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympic Games." Or
     the SEC's enforcement action against Telefonica Brasil ... in which the SEC assessed a $4.1
     million civil penalty for - are you still sitting down - "a hospitality program that the
     company hosted in connection with the 2014 World Cup and 2013 Confederations Cup.

held companies that are "issuers" under the Securities Exchange Act. An issuer is a company
that has a class of securities registered pursuant to § 12 of the Securities Exchange Act or that
is required to file annual or other periodic reports pursuant to § 15(d) of the Securities
Exchange Act (244), regardless of whether the company has foreign operations.

The reach of the accounting provisions is quite broad. As the Resource Guide emphasizes:

          Although the FCPA's accounting requirements are directed at "issuers," an
          issuer's books and records include those of its consolidated subsidiaries and
          affiliates. An issuer's responsibility thus extends to ensuring that
          subsidiaries or affiliates under its control, including foreign subsidiaries
          and joint ventures, comply with the accounting provisions.312

To be strictly responsible for a subsidiary for the purposes of the accounting provisions, the
issuer must own more than 50% of the subsidiary stock. Where the issuer owns 50% or less
of the subsidiary, they must only use "good faith efforts" to cause the subsidiary to meet the
obligations under the FCPA (§ 78m(b)(6)).313

For a detailed discussion of the nature, reach and implications of the accounting provisions,
see: Stuart H. Deming, "The Potent and Broad-Ranging Implications of the Accounting and
Record-Keeping Provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act."314

(i) Books and Records

The books and records provision (§ 78m(b)(2)(A)) states that every issuer shall "make and
keep books, records, and accounts, which, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect
the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the issuer." Section 78m(b)(6) defines
"reasonable detail" as a "level of detail and degree of assurance that would satisfy prudent
officials in the conduct of their own affairs." The SEC Chairman's 1981 advice provided that
a company should not be "enjoined for falsification of which its management, broadly
defined, was not aware and reasonably should not have known."315

The Resource Guide notes that "bribes are often concealed under the guise of legitimate
payments."316 According to a Senate Report, "corporate bribery has been concealed by the
falsification of corporate books and records," and the accounting provisions are designed to
"remove this avenue of coverup."317 The books and records provision can provide an avenue

for prosecution where improper payments are inaccurately recorded, even if an element of
the related anti-bribery provision was not met.

(ii) Internal Controls

The "internal controls" provisions "codify existing auditing standards."318 § 78m(b)(2)(B)
states that every issuer (as above) shall:

          Devise and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to
          provide reasonable assurances that--
          (i) transactions are executed in accordance with management's general

                 or specific authorization;
          (ii) transactions are recorded as necessary (I) to permit preparation of

                 financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
                 accounting principles or any other criteria applicable to such
                 statements, and (II) to maintain accountability for assets
          (iii) access to assets is permitted only in accordance with management's
                 general or specific authorization; and
          (iv) the recorded accountability for assets is compared with the existing
                 assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with
                 respect to any differences.

Again, "reasonable assurances" is defined in § 78m(b)(7) as a "level of detail and degree of
assurance that would satisfy prudent officials in the conduct of their own affairs." The
provision allows companies the flexibility to implement a system of controls that suits their
particular needs and circumstances. Reflective of the Guidance published pursuant to section
9 of the UK Bribery Act, the Resource Guide points out that "good internal accounting controls
can prevent not only FCPA violations, but also other illegal or unethical conduct by the
company, its subsidiaries, and its employees."319 Compliance with the provision will
therefore depend on the overall reasonableness of the internal controls in the circumstances
of the company, including the risks of corruption in the country and sector of operation.320
In SEC v World-Wide Coin,321 the court indicated that the costs of devising a system of internal
controls should not exceed the expected benefits. The court further noted that the occurrence
of improper conduct does not necessarily mean internal controls were unsatisfactory.322

Koehler argues that enforcement patterns potentially conflict with the reasonableness
qualifications built into the books and records and internal control provisions and promoted
in the Guidance and in SEC v World-Wide Coin.323 For example, in a 2012 SEC enforcement
action, Oracle Corporation was held liable for failing to conduct audits of its subsidiary in

India, even though such audits would not have been "practical or cost-effective absent red
flags suggesting improper conduct. The SEC did not allege any such red flag issues. In fact,
the SEC alleged that Oracle's Indian subsidiary `concealed' ... the conduct from Oracle."324
Koehler argues that such enforcement actions are edging towards strict liability, in spite of
the inclusion of "reasonable detail" and "reasonable assurances" in the accounting
provisions. Koehler goes on to state:

          Based on the enforcement theories, it would seem that nearly all issuers
          doing business in the global marketplace could, upon a thorough
          investigation of their entire business operations, discover conduct
          implicating the books and records and internal controls provisions. For
          instance, the SEC alleged in an FCPA enforcement action against
          pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly that the company violated the books and
          records and internal controls provisions because sales representatives at the
          company's China subsidiary submitted false expense reports for items such
          as wine, specialty foods, a jade bracelet, visits to bath houses, card games,
          karaoke bars, door prizes, spa treatments and cigarettes. If the SEC's
          position is that an issuer violates the FCPA's books and records and internal
          controls provisions because some employees, anywhere within its world-
          wide organization, submit false expense reports for such nominal and
          inconsequential items, then every issuer has violated and will continue to
          violate the FCPA. [footnotes omitted]325

      5.3.2 Defenses/Exceptions

There are two exceptions to criminal liability under the accounting provisions. The first (§
78m(b)(4)) states that criminal liability will not be imposed where the accounting error is
merely technical or insignificant. The second (§ 78m(b)(6)) discharges an issuer of their
responsibility for a subsidiary's accounting violations when the issuer owns 50% or less of
the subsidiary and the issuer "demonstrates good faith efforts" to encourage the subsidiary
to comply with the FCPA. However, in practice, Koehler points out that enforcement
agencies have eroded this good faith defense for parent companies and essentially created
strict (no fault) liability.326 For example, the SEC charged Dow Chemical with accounting
offenses committed by its fifth-tier subsidiary, even though Dow had no knowledge of the
improper conduct, and even though the SEC did not allege a lack of good faith on Dow's
part. 327

      5.3.3 Limitation Periods for Books and Record Offenses

The limitation periods for FCPA books and records offenses are the same as for the offense
of bribery, discussed at Section 3.3.3.

      5.3.4 Sanctions for Books and Records Offenses

§ 78ff(a) of the FCPA mandates that for violation of the accounting provisions, corporations
and other business entities are liable for a fine of up to $25 million while individuals
(including officers, directors, stockholders and agents of companies) are subject to a fine of
up to $5 million and imprisonment for a maximum of 20 years. However, the Alternative
Fines Act 18 USC. Section 3571(d) provides for the imposition of higher fines at the court's
discretion. The increased fine can be up to twice the benefit obtained by the defendant in
making the bribe.

Actual penalties are determined by reference to the US Sentencing Commission, Guidelines
Manual, § 3E1.1 (Nov 2018).328

5.4 UK

There are no accounting offences in the UK Bribery Act. However, as pointed out by Martin,
a compilation of existing UK corporate laws coupled with section 7 of the Bribery Act leads
to similar requirements as those in FCPA.329 Firstly, the Companies Act 2006 requires every
company in the UK to keep records that can show and explain their transactions, to
accurately disclose their financial positions and to implement adequate internal controls.
Secondly, the defence to section 7 requires companies have "adequate procedures" in place,
which means in part that the companies will need to keep proper records and implement
adequate internal controls.330 Finally, accounting offences facilitating corruption or the
hiding of the proceeds of corruption are covered in sections 17-20 of the Theft Act, 1968.331

Section 17 of the Theft Act creates the offence of false accounting. Section 17(1)(a) criminalizes
the conduct of a person who intentionally and dishonestly destroys, defaces, conceals or
falsifies any account, record or document made or required for any accounting purpose. The
falsification, etc., must be done with a view to gain or cause loss to another, but need not
actually cause loss or gain. Authorities are inconsistent regarding the meaning of
"accounting purpose," but a set of financial accounts is prima facie made for an accounting
purpose. The defendant is not required to know that the documents are for an accounting
purpose, creating an element of strict liability. Section 17(1)(b) also criminalizes the
dishonest use of false or deceptive documents with a view to gain or cause loss.332

Section 17 overlaps with both forgery and fraud offences. The fraud offence is broader than
section 17, since it is not restricted to documents made for accounting purposes, and also
has a higher maximum sentence. As a result, the Fraud Act is sometimes used instead of the
false accounting provisions.

Section 18 imposes liability on directors, managers, secretaries or other similar officers of a
body corporate for an offence committed by the body corporate with their consent or
connivance. The purpose of this section is to impose a positive obligation on people in
management positions to prevent irregularities, if aware of them. Section 19 is intended to
protect investors by making it an offence for directors to publish false prospectuses to
members. Section 20 makes it an offence to dishonestly destroy, deface or conceal any
valuable security, any will or other testamentary document, or any original document that
is belonging to, filed in or deposited in any court of justice or government department.

5.5 Canada

Before 2013, CFPOA had no accounting offences. False accounting allegations were dealt
with under domestic criminal law or income tax laws in circumstances where Canada had
jurisdiction over the commission of those offences.

Amendments to CFPOA in 2013 created new accounting offences. The accounting provisions
must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt (unlike the similar provisions in the FCPA,
which need only be proven on a balance of probabilities when used by the SEC). Section 4
of the CFPOA provides:

          1) Every person commits an offence who, for the purpose of bribing a
                foreign public official in order to obtain or retain an advantage in the
                course of business or for the purpose of hiding that bribery,

                (a) establishes or maintains accounts which do not appear in any
                     of the books and records that they are required to keep in
                     accordance with applicable accounting and auditing
                     standards;

                (b) makes transactions that are not recorded in those books and
                     records or that are inadequately identified in them;

                (c) records non-existent expenditures in those books and records;

                (d) enters liabilities with incorrect identification of their object in
                     those books and records;

                (e) knowingly uses false documents; or

                (f) intentionally destroys accounting books and records earlier
                     than permitted by law.

          (2) Every person who contravenes subsection (1) is guilty of an indictable
                offence and liable to imprisonment for a term of not more than 14
                years.

Section 4 was brought into force on June 19, 2013, and as far as I can tell (as of 2021), there
have been no prosecutions. This section was added to the CFPOA to bring the Act into line
with article 8 of the OECD Convention. Other existing Criminal Code offences support
Canada's implementation of Article 8 of the OECD Convention. These include the offences
of making a false pretence or statement (ss. 361 and 362), forgery and the use or possession

                                                                                                          223

of forged documents (ss. 366 and 368), fraud affecting public markets (s. 380(2)), falsification
of books and documents (s. 397) and issuing a false prospectus (s. 400). Section 155 of the
Canada Business Corporations Act, which addresses financial disclosure, may also be relevant
in cases involving false accounting.

1. JURISDICTION: STATE PROSECUTION OF BRIBERY OFFENCES

        Overview

In today's globalized world, bribery and other forms of corruption are often transnational.
Instances of bribery may involve a number of individuals or legal entities and encompass
actions in multiple states. Large corporations are often multi-national, and carrying on
business in numerous states. Acts of bribery by one corporation may disadvantage other
foreign firms who lose business as a result. Since anti-corruption laws and their enforcement
are not consistent across states, the way in which states determine jurisdiction--to whom
their anti-corruption laws apply and who can be prosecuted by their courts or tribunals--
has important implications for determining how effective anti-corruption laws will be in
detecting, investigating, prosecuting, and punishing corruption.

There are three general forms of jurisdiction: prescriptive, enforcement, and adjudicative.
These were briefly described by the Supreme Court of Canada in R v Hape:

          Prescriptive jurisdiction (also called legislative or substantive jurisdiction)
          is the power to make rules, issue commands or grant authorizations that are
          binding upon persons and entities. The legislature exercises prescriptive
          jurisdiction in enacting legislation. Enforcement jurisdiction is the power
          to use coercive means to ensure that rules are followed, commands are
          executed or entitlements are upheld.... Adjudicative jurisdiction is the
          power of a state's courts to resolve disputes or interpret the law through
          decisions that carry binding force. [footnotes omitted]1

1 R v Hape, [2007] 2 SCR 292 at para 58. The International Bar Association Task Force on Territorial
Jurisdiction's Report of the Task Force on Extraterritorial Jurisdiction, (International Bar Association
2009), however, notes that most jurisdictions outside of the United States simply differentiate
between prescriptive and enforcement jurisdiction. See 7-8 online: IBA
<https://www.ibanet.org/resources>. For further description of prescriptive and enforcement
jurisdiction, see Robert Currie, International and Transnational Criminal Law, 3rd ed (Toronto: Irwin
Law, 2020) at 56-105.

Danielle Ireland Piper provides a strong example which illustrates the gravity afforded to
enforcement jurisdiction:

            [W]hen Adolf Eichmann was kidnapped in 1960 in Argentina and taken to Israel for trial, it
            was not the prescription or adjudication of the offences for which he was charged that
            troubled the international community. Rather, it was the method of enforcement that
            caused the United Nations Security Council to declare that Israel had violated Argentinean
            sovereignty. [footnotes omitted]

See Danielle Ireland-Piper, "Extraterritorial Criminal Jurisdiction: Does the Long Arm of the Law
Undermine the Rule of Law" (2012) 13:1 Melb J Intl L 122 at 125. In the article, Ireland-Piper proceeds
by discussing assertions of jurisdiction through categories descriptive of their circumstance or motive
(i.e., treaty-based assertions, politically motivated prosecutions, reactive assertions) instead of
through these traditional three categories (see 126 onwards).

                                                                                                          233
GLOBAL CORRUPTION

As the Supreme Court noted, these forms of jurisdiction overlap in certain cases. Even if
there is prescriptive jurisdiction, there may be no enforcement jurisdiction (i.e., there may
not exist the power to compel extradition by reason of an extradition treaty or agreement, or
the power to conduct an investigation through mutual agreement of the relevant states).
Additionally, attitudes towards prescriptive jurisdiction tend to be permissive, while they
are considered restrictive for enforcement jurisdiction.2 The "permissive" nature of
prescriptive jurisdiction (that is, that a state may assert jurisdiction over a particular crime,
but they are not required to do so unless the crime has obtained jus cogens status) is "subject
only to the exceptional situations where a treaty-based obligation to pursue particular
offenders has crystallised into a customary law principle"3 (i.e. those who commit grave
breaches of the Geneva Convention), or where suppression treaties have been executed to fill
the many gaps left by permissive prescriptive jurisdiction. Some of these treaties target
organized crime and narcotics trafficking.4

The rules governing extra-territorial jurisdiction must be balanced with the concept of state
sovereignty. The principles of state sovereignty, including equality, territorial integrity, and
non-intervention are reaffirmed in Article 4 of UNCAC. A state is under an international
obligation to not enforce its legislative powers within the territorial limits of another state
without that state's consent, reflecting the general consensus on the ambit of enforcement
jurisdiction. However, under international law, the limits of a state's prescriptive or
legislative jurisdiction (in other words the limits of how a state may determine to whom its
laws apply) are less clear. See the International Bar Association's Report of the Task Force on
Extraterritorial Jurisdiction.5

When engaged in international business transactions, it is essential for the company and its
legal advisors to be aware which country's laws apply to its activities; that is, jurisdiction is
the most important issue in international business transactions. H. Lowell Brown describes

2 See Currie, supra note 1 at 97. At 101, Currie notes the gravity of respecting enforcement jurisdiction
in combatting transnational crime:

     It is important not to understate the dangers presented by conflicts over enforcement
     jurisdiction, since, as [Chris D Ram] noted, "[s]tates and intergovernmental organizations
     act with caution, deliberation and consensus because the consequences of precipitous
     unilateral actions can be dire. The First World War started, in part, because one State
     insisted on the right to conduct a criminal investigation into the murder of one of its
     officials on the sovereign territory of another." Less calamitously, breaches of the rule
     against extraterritorial enforcement jurisdiction can create legal and diplomatic
     complications between states; create havens for criminals in situations where jurisdiction
     is interfered with; and, perhaps most seriously, compromise the level of trust that is
     required for states to cooperate in the suppression of transnational crime. In the Canadian
     experience, such breaches have led to both extradition and mutual legal assistance requests
     being denied by courts, as well as to the corrosion of relationships between Canadian and
     US police forces. [emphasis added] [footnotes omitted]

           CHAPTER 3 JURISDICTION, LIABILITY, ACCOMPLICES, & INCHOATE OFFENCES

six theories that states may rely upon to assert prescriptive jurisdiction (i.e., to determine to
whom their law applies).6 The two most accepted of these are territoriality, whereby
jurisdiction is determined on the basis of where the criminal acts occurred, and nationality
(sometimes termed the "active personality principle"), whereby a state's jurisdiction extends
to the actions of its nationals no matter where the acts constituting the offence occur.
Historically, common law countries have been much more reluctant to assert jurisdiction
based on nationality, while civil law and socialist law countries were more likely to have
embraced this theory.7 Nationality also may be "extended" from citizens to those with
"nationality-type links to the state,"8 such as permanent residents, resident aliens,
corporations, or foreign citizens employed by the government or armed forces.9 This kind
of jurisdiction is called "extended nationality." The third theory is universality, where a state
may charge any person present in its territory under its own domestic laws no matter where
the acts constituting the offence occurred. While this principle was traditionally reserved for
piracy, it has been extended more recently to crimes universally regarded as heinous, such
as war crimes. The fourth theory--the protective principle--determines jurisdiction based
on harm caused by the offending act to the state's national interests, while the fifth theory's
passive personality principle determines jurisdiction based on the nationality of the crime's
victim or victims. Finally, there is the "flag" principle, which is sometimes classified under
the principle of territoriality and extends a state's domestic laws to acts occurring at sea on
a ship flying that state's flag.

By its nature, foreign corruption involves actions commenced and completed across
sovereign boundaries. As such, the theory which underpins the assertion of prescriptive
jurisdiction over the criminal act has significant implications for effecting criminal liability.
For example, bribery of a foreign public official, commonly involves the actual act of bribery
taking place within the official's home country while some preparation, or perhaps the
authorization to offer a bribe, takes place in the briber's home state. Therefore, in respect to
statutes that operate based on the territoriality principle alone, a home state's jurisdiction
over a briber will depend on the connection required by the home state's law between the
briber's conduct and the home state. A law that requires the whole or majority of the act of
bribery take place within the home state will have significantly less jurisdictional reach than
a law like the US FCPA, which applies (among other ways) when any or virtually any act or
communication in furtherance of a corrupt payment occurs within the US.

International Bribery" (1998-1999) 22 Hastings Intl & Comp L Rev 407 at 419, first identified in
"Harvard Research in International Law, Jurisdiction with Respect to Crime" (1935) 29 Am J Intl L
435.
7 Currie states that civil law countries likely favoured the nationality principle due to a "(typically
constitutional) inability to extradite their nationals to face criminal processes in foreign countries."
Without the nationality principle, these nationals would not face criminal liability for crimes
committed abroad. Common law countries were reluctant to assert jurisdiction based on nationality
due to England's historical "strict adherence to the territoriality principle," but more flexibility was
required by these countries over time to close the gaps that of jurisdictions which facilitated criminal
activity. See Currie, supra note 1 at 69-70.

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

Territoriality may be asserted under the principles of either subjective territoriality or
objective territoriality. Jennifer Zerk reviews the different ways in which states may assert
jurisdiction based on territoriality:

          The principle of subjective territoriality gives State X the right to take
          jurisdiction over a course of conduct that commenced in State X and was
          completed in another state. A terrorist plot that was hatched in State X and
          executed in State Y could fall into this category. The principle of objective
          territoriality gives State X the right to take jurisdiction over a course of
          conduct that began in another state and [was] completed in State X. A
          conspiracy in State Y to defraud investors in State X could give rise to
          jurisdiction based on this principle. A further refinement of the principle of
          objective territoriality appears to be gaining acceptance, in the antitrust field
          at least. This doctrine, known as the effects doctrine, argues that states have
          jurisdiction over foreign actors and conduct on the basis of "effects"
          (usually economic effects) produced within their own territorial
          boundaries, provided those effects are substantial, and a direct result of that
          foreign conduct. Jurisdiction taken on the basis of the effects doctrine is
          often classed as "extraterritorial jurisdiction" on the grounds that
          jurisdiction is asserted over foreign conduct. It is important, though, not to
          lose sight of the territorial connections that do exist (i.e. in terms of "effects")
          over which the regulating state arguably does have territorial jurisdiction.
          Nevertheless, while this doctrine has become increasingly accepted in
          principle as more states adopt it, its scope remains controversial, especially
          in relation to purely economic (as opposed to physical) effects.10

     UNCAC

Article 42(1) of the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC) requires State
Parties to assert jurisdiction when an offence is committed within their territory or on board
a vessel flying their flag. In addition, Article 42(3) requires State Parties to exercise
jurisdiction when the offender is present in their territory and extradition is refused on the
basis that the offender is a national, and Article 42(4) includes an extradite or prosecute
obligation. Unlike the OECD Convention, UNCAC does not appear to mandate that a state
assert jurisdiction in instances where the act occurred only partially within its territory. It is
also notable that UNCAC regulates the demand side of bribery, whereas the OECD
Convention only addresses supply-side bribery.11 The inclusion of demand side significantly

Article 42(2) permits states to establish jurisdiction in the following circumstances:

          2. Subject to Article 4 of this Convention [State Sovereignty], a State
                Party may also establish its jurisdiction over any such offence when:

                (a) The offence is committed against a national of that State Party; or
                (b) The offence is committed by a national of that State Party or a

                     stateless person who has his or her habitual residence in its
                     territory; or
                (c) The offence is one of those established in accordance with article
                     23, paragraph 1(b) (ii) [conspiracy or other forms of participation
                     in a plan to commit money laundering offences], of this
                     Convention and is committed outside its territory with a view to
                     the commission of an offence established in accordance with
                     article 23, paragraph 1 (a) (i) or (ii) or (b) (i) [money laundering
                     offences], of this Convention within its territory; or
                (d) The offence is committed against the State Party.12

Article 42(2) is limited by Article 4 and meant to protect state sovereignty by discouraging
the exercise of extraterritorial jurisdiction within the territory of another state if the laws of
that state mandate exclusive territorial jurisdiction. Some commentators, such as Evan
Lestelle, have questioned whether UNCAC permits jurisdiction to be established on the
basis of other theories of jurisdiction, such as the protective principle, which is notably
absent from Article 42(2).13 Lestelle states:

          Despite the extensive list of extraterritorial circumstances contemplated by
          article 42, the limitation in article 4 denudes much of the potency from the
          grant. Furthermore, a final theory of extraterritorial jurisdiction, the
          "protective" principle, is notably absent from the list in article 42. The
          "protective" principle provides jurisdiction if the effect or possible effect of
          the offense is to occur in the forum state and for offenses that threaten the
          "specific national interests" of the forum state. As discussed in Part I, global
          efforts at combating foreign public bribery would be aided by an
          amendment to the UNCAC that removes the limitations of article 4 and

          adds the "protective" principle as a basis for jurisdiction. [footnotes
          omitted]14

It could be argued, however, that the list of permitted bases of jurisdiction provided in
Article 42(2) is non-exhaustive. Article 42(6) provides that:

          Without prejudice to norms of general international law, this Convention
          shall not exclude the exercise of any criminal jurisdiction established by a
          State Party in accordance with its domestic law.

In addition, the Legislative Guide for UNCAC, produced by UNODC, states that UNCAC
does not aim to alter general international rules regarding jurisdiction, and that the list of
jurisdictional bases in 42(2) is not meant to be exhaustive. Rather, the purpose of Article 42
is to permit the exercise of jurisdiction in such a way that ensures that corruption offences
do not go unpunished because of jurisdictional gaps.15 As noted, there are differing views
concerning the degree of latitude afforded to states under international law when
determining the basis of criminal jurisdiction.

      1.2.1 Extraterritoriality

Lestelle argues that UNCAC should be amended to expressly allow for further
extraterritorial application of domestic laws, potentially based on the protective or passive
personality principles. In Lestelle's view, corruption is a humanitarian concern of sufficient
gravity to merit the application of laws with significant extraterritorial jurisdiction. Lestelle
compares corruption to piracy, the earliest crime for which states commonly asserted
jurisdiction based on the universality principle. According to Lestelle, both are "crimes
against the global market," and therefore far-reaching state-level laws are necessary in order
to avoid the possibility that perpetrators will be able to evade prosecution; otherwise,
Lestelle warns that some states motivated by self-interest will refrain from taking legal
action against perpetrators, thus creating a "safe harbour" refuge where those engaged in
bribery or corruption will not be prosecuted.16

However, other scholars argue that "even if extraterritoriality limits bribery in developing
countries, it might dictate to these countries [moral] values they do not share,"17 providing
some doubt on the utility or prudence of sweeping extraterritorial approaches. These
conversations are becoming more salient in the post-colonial or "anti-imperialist" era:
extraterritorial application of laws also necessitate the application of certain norms,
conceptions of the rule of law and legitimacy, and may "stigmatise some economic policies

principle (supra note 1 at 404).

and legal regimes ... without analysing their distributional or social consequences in any
specific detail."18 Alina Veneziano argues that "the morality concerns are easy, as
extraterritoriality involves the regulation of other states' nationals by a government who is
not accountable to these people; it is plainly an unfair process."19 Veneziano summarizes the
downsides of extraterritorial application as follows:

          (1) it is an unconsented form of global regulation and infringes state
          sovereignty; (2) it makes people uncomfortable with its legitimacy because
          it is coercive and diverts attention away from its victims; (3) it is a process
          by which the United States is not accountable to those that are affected by
          its regulatory reach; and (4) it undermines the self-determination of states
          as well as the democracy of the United States, such as the separation of
          powers.20

Veneziano offers an alternative or complement to territorial sovereignty that may help form
a basis for jurisdiction that is more reflective of the modern impact of extraterritorial
approaches:

          [B]ecause it is usually a foreign national - not the foreign state itself - that is
          aggrieved in [transnational activities], the state's rights under international
          law are not infringed. Instead, the resentment by the affected state against
          the dominant state exerting extraterritorial application "represents more a
          desire to prevent economic harm to its nationals or corporations than an
          assertion of the rights of the state." For this reason, and because the
          traditional understanding of sovereignty has been rendered slightly
          outdated, a more appropriate notion to sovereignty may include the
          recognition of economic sovereignty, as opposed to the traditional territorial
          sovereignty. Alan Simon advanced this theory to "acknowledge the
          increased significance of economic forces," "facilitate necessary economic
          transactions between and among states," and "preserve economic activities
          closely linked to the existence of the state." [emphasis in original] [footnotes

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

1.3 OECD Convention

Article 4 of the Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International
Business Transactions (OECD Convention) addresses jurisdiction. It requires that each State
Party take steps to ensure it has jurisdiction over bribery offences that occur wholly or
partially within its territory. This is a narrow conception of extra-territorial jurisdiction.22
The word "partial" is not defined. The Commentary accompanying the Convention text
states that this provision should be interpreted broadly in a way that does not require
"extensive physical connection to the bribery act." In addition, a State Party with "jurisdiction
to prosecute its nationals for offences committed abroad shall take such measures as may be
necessary to establish its jurisdiction to do so in respect of the bribery of a foreign public
official, according to the same principles" (Article 4(2)). Article 4(4) also requires states to
review whether their basis for jurisdiction is sufficient to effectively fight against the bribery
of foreign public officials. The OECD Convention does not have an extradite or prosecute
provision for enforcement jurisdiction.23

Currie elaborates on the meaning of "jurisdiction" in the OECD Convention:

          The Commentary to the OECD Convention ... makes clear that `jurisdiction'
          (as well as a reference in the article to domestic `principles') refers to the
          usual decision-making process of states regarding the bases on which they
          choose to exercise jurisdiction. Thus, a state such as Canada, which does not
          ordinarily exercise nationality jurisdiction, will still be in compliance with
          this article if it uses only territoriality; this is, indeed, what Canada did for
          the first decade or more after it signed the Convention, though it has now
          put nationality jurisdiction in place. [footnotes omitted]24

At the time the OECD Convention was negotiated (during the 1990s), many common law
countries were opposed to including a requirement that signatory states assert jurisdiction
based on nationality. Article 4(4) therefore represented a compromise.25 However, since that
time most of the common law OECD states have incorporated the principle of jurisdiction
based on nationality into their domestic anti-bribery legislation.

1.4 Other International Instruments

In addition to mandating that states assert jurisdiction based on the territorial principle, The
Council of Europe Criminal Law Convention, the European Union Convention on the Fight
against Corruption Involving Officials of the European Communities or Officials of Member

22 However, some argue that "committed" in Article 4(1) may be interpreted to include both
subjective territoriality and objective territoriality, meaning the effects of the act are included as a
basis for asserting jurisdiction. See Hock, supra note 17 at 319-321.
23 Currie, supra note 1 at 403.
24 Ibid. Canada incorporated the nationality principle in 2013.

240  2022
           CHAPTER 3 JURISDICTION, LIABILITY, ACCOMPLICES, & INCHOATE OFFENCES

States, and the African Union Convention on Preventing and Combating Corruption all
require State Parties to exercise jurisdiction on the basis of nationality. Interestingly, the
African Union Convention is the only multilateral anti-corruption convention to expressly
provide for jurisdiction based on the protective principle (see Article 13(1)(d)).

1.5 Corporate Entities

A corporation or other collective legal entity can be subject to a state's corruption laws (1)
based on territorial jurisdiction if the company commits the offence (in whole or in part) in
that state or (2) based on nationality jurisdiction if the company is incorporated or otherwise
legally created or registered in that state.26 A company from one state can commit an offence
in a foreign state either as the primary offender or as a secondary party offender (i.e., aid,
abet or counsel another person to commit the offence).

In countries that base corporate criminal liability on the identification (i.e., "directing
minds") theory, the actions and state of mind of certain employees and officers becomes in
law "the actions and state of mind" of the corporation. In those instances, the corporation is
the principal offender. Alternatively, a company can be liable for a corruption offence
committed in a foreign state by means of secondary party liability. If the parent company
aids, abets or counsels a subsidiary company or a third-party agent to commit a corruption
offence, the parent company is guilty of that offence as a secondary party to that offence. For
example, if SNC-Lavalin Group, the Canadian parent company, had been prosecuted for
corruption in the Padma Bridge case, its criminal liability would have been based on the
claim that it aided, abetted or encouraged its subsidiary company and its third-party agent
(not an employee of SNC-Lavalin) to commit the offence as principal offenders.

The requisite mental element for the parent company as an aider, abettor or counsellor can
vary depending on the particular offence and the state's laws for establishing corporate
criminal liability. Generally speaking, the parent company's required level of fault will be
(1) subjective fault (intentionally aided), (2) strict liability (aided by failing to take reasonable
steps to prevent the offence), or (3) absolute liability (no mental fault element to aid, abet or
counsel the offence is required).

The ability of state parties to exercise jurisdiction over foreign corporate entities, as
addressed in the UNCAC and the OECD Convention, is summarized by Zerk as follows:

          While all of the treaties either authorise or require the use of nationality
          jurisdiction in relation to the extraterritorial activities of their corporate
          nationals, they do not impose specific requirements vis-à-vis the regulation
          of the foreign activities of foreign companies and no treaties require the
          regulation of such activities directly. This will be because of the

26 There is no single test for establishing the nationality of a company: see Hock, supra note 17 at 321.
The emphasis on domestic law in this part is partly due to the fact that "all international instruments
in international criminal law and transnational criminal law so far only apply to natural persons,
although there are some modest inroads being made to also extend liability to corporate entities":
Currie supra note 1 at 705.

                                                                                                          241
GLOBAL CORRUPTION

          acknowledged legal limitations in relation to the regulation of foreign
          nationals in foreign territory. However, a number of treaty provisions are
          potentially relevant to the situation where a foreign subsidiary or agent is
          primarily responsible for a bribe. For instance, the UN Convention contains
          provisions relating to "accessory" or "secondary liability", under which a
          parent company could be held responsible for a foreign bribe on the basis
          that it was the "instigator" of that bribe. The OECD Convention mandates
          liability for complicity in the bribery of a foreign public official, including
          "incitement, aiding and abetting, or authorization" of such an act. The
          "Good Practice Guideline" annexed to a recent OECD Recommendation on
          implementation of the OECD Convention asks state parties to ensure that
          "a legal person cannot avoid responsibility by using intermediaries,
          including related legal persons, to offer, promise or give a bribe to a foreign
          public official on its behalf."

          There is little guidance in the treaty provisions themselves as to the extent
          to which accounting controls must cover the transactions of foreign
          subsidiaries. However, to the extent that the treaty covers foreign bribery,
          it would appear to be the intention that consolidated reporting (covering
          the transactions of foreign subsidiaries as well as the parent company) is
          indeed required. [footnotes omitted]27

1.6 Jurisdictional Liability of Legal Persons for Foreign Bribery

The 2016 OECD Liability of Legal Persons for Foreign Bribery: A Stocktaking Report provides a
summary of the types of jurisdiction for each OECD country. A few of the more interesting
highlights are:28

                                                            BEGINNING OF EXCERPT

 Some of the key findings in relation to jurisdiction are:

       · All the Parties to the Convention (except Argentina) establish some form of
            territorial jurisdiction over legal persons for the offence of foreign bribery. In
            some Parties, this jurisdiction is a collateral effect of having jurisdiction over the
            acts of a natural person who commits foreign bribery in its territory.

       · At least 23 Parties (56%) are able, in at least some circumstances, to assert
            jurisdiction over foreign companies that commit foreign bribery in their
            territory.

           CHAPTER 3 JURISDICTION, LIABILITY, ACCOMPLICES, & INCHOATE OFFENCES

 Finally, although the Convention does not create obligations for Parties to assert
 jurisdiction over acts of foreign legal persons for offences that take place entirely outside
 its territory, the WGB has identified some interesting arrangements among the Parties for
 asserting such jurisdiction. These include:

       · Universal jurisdiction [e.g. Iceland and Norway].

       · Foreign legal person conducts business in, or owns property, in the territory
            [e.g. Czech Republic].

       · Foreign legal person committed offence for the benefit of a domestic legal
            person [e.g. Czech Republic].

       · Foreign legal person is closely connected to a domestic legal person or natural
            person [e.g. Greece and Israel].

                                                                 END OF EXCERPT

In regard to the nationality requirements for legal persons, the 2016 report states the
following:

          Of the 41 Convention Parties, at least 16 countries (39%) will consider any
          legal person incorporated or formed in accordance with their laws to have
          their nationality. At least eight countries (20%) will look to the legal person's
          headquarters or seat of operations to determine its nationality, and at least
          another three countries (7%) will look at either the place of incorporation or
          the seat. Only 1 country, Brazil, restricts the application of its nationality
          jurisdiction to legal persons that are both incorporated in and
          headquartered in the country's territory.

          Finally, at least 11 countries (27%) will assert nationality jurisdiction over
          legal entities based on "other" factors, primarily whether the company is
          "registered" under the country's laws or has a "registered office" on its
          territory. Depending on the country, these other factors may be exclusive or
          operate alongside the place of incorporation or the seat of the company.

 Who is Covered by the Anti-Bribery Provisions?

 The FCPA's anti-bribery provisions apply broadly to three categories of persons and
 entities: (1) "issuers" and their officers, directors, employees, agents, and stockholders

 employees, agents, and stockholders acting on behalf of a domestic concern; and (3)
 certain persons and entities, other than issuers and domestic concerns, acting while in the
 territory of the United States.

 Issuers--15 U.S.C. § 78dd-1

 In practice, this means that any company with a class of securities listed on a national
 securities exchange in the United States, or any company with a class of securities quoted
 in the over-the-counter market in the United States and required to file periodic reports
 with SEC, is an issuer

 ...

 Domestic Concerns--15 U.S.C. § 78dd-2

 A domestic concern is any individual who is a citizen, national, or resident of the United
 States, or any corporation, partnership, association, jointstock company, business trust,
 unincorporated organization, or sole proprietorship, other than an issuer, that is
 organized under the laws of the United States or its states, territories, possessions, or
 commonwealths or that has its principal place of business in the United States. Officers,
 directors, employees, agents, or stockholders acting on behalf of a domestic concern,
 including foreign nationals or companies, are also covered.

 Territorial Jurisdiction--15 U.S.C. § 78dd-3

  The FCPA also applies to certain foreign nationals or entities that are not issuers or
 domestic "trade, commerce, transportation, or communication among the several States,

 or between any foreign country and any State or between any State and any place or ship
 outside thereof...." The term also includes the intrastate use of any interstate means of
 communication, or any other interstate instrumentality. Thus, placing a telephone call or
 sending an e-mail, text message, or fax from, to, or through the United States involves
 interstate commerce--as does sending a wire transfer from or to a U.S. bank or otherwise
 using the U.S. banking system, or traveling across state borders or internationally to or
 from the United States. [footnotes omitted]

Jurisdiction of US courts under the FCPA can be limited by due process requirements. In
civil cases, the defendant must have "minimum contacts" with the court's jurisdiction, and
the exercise of jurisdiction must be reasonable. If a defendant's actions have no effect in the
US and the defendant has negligible contact with the US, these requirements might not be
met. For example, in SEC v Steffen,32 the defendant's role in falsified records was too
"tangential," and the defendant had no geographic ties to the US. The US forum had little
continuing interest in pursuing the particular defendant, who also spoke little English. As a
result, the court found that exercising jurisdiction over the defendant would exceed the
limits of due process.33

In criminal cases, personal jurisdiction arises from a defendant's arrest in the US, voluntary
appearance in court or lawful extradition to the US.34

Foreign individuals or legal entities that would otherwise be outside the jurisdictional reach
of the FCPA may be held criminally liable pursuant to the FCPA if they aided, abetted,
counselled or induced another person or entity to commit a FCPA offense or if they
conspired to violate the FCPA. The Resource Guide explains the SEC's and DOJ's
interpretation of the scope of secondary liability provisions of the FCPA.35

Notwithstanding the DOJ's and SEC's wide claims of jurisdiction over the offence, they may
have difficulty prosecuting some foreign persons or entities if they have no extradition treaty
with the foreign state or if the foreign state rejects the US claim of jurisdiction and the legal
person no longer does business in the US and has no assets in the US to seize or forfeit.

      1.7.2 DOJ and SEC's Broad View of Territorial Jurisdiction

As noted, the DOJ and the SEC take a very broad view of the territorial jurisdiction of the
FCPA. Some commentators refer to US jurisdiction over bribery as "potentially quasi-
universal."36 It is also possible to understand the FCPA's jurisdiction over issuers as one

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

based on the effects doctrine of territoriality, as the corrupt acts made on behalf of foreign
corporations listed on the US markets have the potential to negatively affect the American
competitors of the offending corporations. As most cases are settled with the SEC rather than
proceeding to court, the interpretation and application of the statute has been largely driven
by the SEC and DOJ.37 Some commentators have critiqued the 2012 version of the Resource
Guide published by the SEC and DOJ as an "advocacy piece ... filled with selective
information, half-truths, and information that was demonstratively false."38

Indeed, in 2007, Judge Scheindlin, arguably the most remarkable jurist on FCPA cases stated,
"there are surprisingly few [judicial] decisions throughout the country on the FCPA"39 thirty
years after the FCPA was enacted. The lack of case law is particularly problematic because
the FCPA is ambiguous even to the court, making its application and interpretation almost
exclusively by administrative bodies more troublesome.40 This leaves the interpretation to
"prosecutorial common law."41

However, in 2018 the Second Circuit in Hoskins42 "dealt a blow to the US Department of
Justice's ... ongoing efforts to expand the extraterritorial reach of the [FCPA],"43 making the
future of territorial jurisdiction under the FCPA unsettled and less clear. Hoskins appears to
reign in the ability to use inchoate offences to broaden the effect of the act beyond the parties
specifically mentioned in the FCPA that may draw criminal liability. In 2018, Jeffrey
Lehtman and Margot Laporte posited that Hoskins may suggest that some of the DOJ's
"expansive jurisdictional theories are not grounded in law,"44 and noted that the SEC and
DOJ may assess their guidance in response to this judgement. That said, the excerpt from
the recently updated Resource Guide does little to address the implications of Hoskins, which
suggests that the case may not have significant impact on the DOJ and SEC's interpretation
of territorial jurisdiction that many observers had anticipated. See also discussion on this
point by Gibson Dunn & Crutcher LLP.45 The Hoskins case, and the resulting division in the
courts, is discussed further in Sections 3 and 4.

           CHAPTER 3 JURISDICTION, LIABILITY, ACCOMPLICES, & INCHOATE OFFENCES

With the limited recognition of Hoskins in the Resource Guide, it is likely that the
implications of the DOJ and SEC's broad interpretation of territorial jurisdiction recognized
by Sean Hecker and Margot Laporte will continue to be salient.46

The DOJ and SEC's expansive interpretation of territorial jurisdiction in corruption cases is
reflected by the assertion of US jurisdiction over FIFA officials. However, the FCPA was not
used. Since the FCPA only covers bribes to government officials, the DOJ used non-bribery
charges under The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) and the Travel
Act, which prohibit the use of interstate travel and commerce to further an illegal activity.
This assertion of jurisdiction has been criticized in relation to the officials who barely have
tangential connections to the US. The DOJ claims jurisdiction because several of the FIFA
officials and marketing executives were allegedly involved in palm-greasing-related
activities on American soil and some of the involved marketing companies and associations
have offices in the US.47

Prior to Hoskins, Hecker and Laporte noted that there is case law to suggest that the FCPA's
territorial jurisdiction is not inexhaustible. Mike Koehler also made this observation and
criticized the previous DOJ guidance for basing its advice on settled enforcement actions
lacking in judicial scrutiny rather than case law.48 Hecker and LaPorte cited a district court
decision, US v Patel,49 in which the Court rejected the DOJ's argument that the act of mailing
a corrupt purchase agreement from the UK to the US was sufficient to establish a territorial
nexus with the US. The Court held that, in order for the FCPA to apply to foreign entities
that are not considered "issuers," the act in furtherance of a corrupt payment must have
taken place within US territory.

Annalisa Leibold criticizes the broad extraterritorial application of the FCPA and argues that
the extension of FCPA jurisdiction to foreign non-issuers may be contrary to principles of
customary international law.50 Leibold considered the discrepancy in the amount of fines
paid by foreign businesses versus domestic businesses and suggests that these statistics may
be explained either by the fact that foreign corporations are more corrupt than the US firms,
foreign corporations do not cooperate with the US law enforcement authorities, or the SEC

and DOJ are unfairly targeting foreign businesses with higher penalties for FCPA
violations.51 Finally, given the ease with which the DOJ and the SEC can bring charges
against a foreign company, and the fact that most foreign corruption charges are settled
rather than litigated, the FCPA may be closer to an international anti-corruption business tax
than to a domestic criminal law with limited extraterritorial application.52 Leibold suggests
that, to minimize potential foreign policy concerns and violations of international law, the
SEC and DOJ should focus the enforcement of the FCPA on cases of bribery that have a close
connection or substantial effect on the United States.53 Michael Diamant et al. illustrate a gap
in domestic and foreign corporations as follows:

          The FCPA has been enforced against U.S. companies more frequently, but
          there is no question that foreign corporations have disproportionately borne
          the lion's share of FCPA fines and penalties. Foreign companies are 35% of
          all FCPA corporate resolutions but account for more than 69% ($7.8 billion)
          of all FCPA monetary settlement amounts since that statute was enacted.
          Foreign companies' average monetary settlement amounts have exceeded
          those of domestic corporations by $54,699,843, or 312%. From 1978 through
          2018, the average FCPA monetary resolution in an action against a domestic
          corporation was $17,559,982, compared with $72,259,825 for foreign
          corporations. And while FCPA enforcement actions against foreign
          corporations were uncommon until approximately 2004, the same trend
          holds true when focusing only on 2004 through 2018. During those years,
          the average FCPA monetary resolution against U.S. companies was
          $21,182,931, compared with $75,016,934 for non U.S. companies. In other
          words, in FCPA enforcement actions from 2004 through 2018, non-U.S.
          companies have been subject to monetary penalties that on average are
          nearly four times greater than those imposed on U.S. companies. In absolute
          terms, monetary resolutions from 2004 through 2018 against foreign
          companies have [totalled] $7.8 billion compared with $3.4 billion against
          domestic corporations.54

only one American company (Goldman Sachs) on the list.55

           CHAPTER 3 JURISDICTION, LIABILITY, ACCOMPLICES, & INCHOATE OFFENCES

1.8 UK

For offences under sections 1, 2, and 6 (active and passive bribery and bribing a foreign
public official), the Bribery Act asserts jurisdiction based on both the territoriality principle
and the nationality principle:

          12. Offences under this Act: territorial application

                (1) An offence is committed under section 1, 2 or 6 in England and
                     Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland if any act or omission which
                     forms part of the offence takes place in that part of the United
                     Kingdom.

                (2) Subsection (3) applies if--
                           (a) no act or omission which forms part of an offence under
                                section 1, 2 or 6 takes place in the United Kingdom,
                           (b) a person's acts or omissions done or made outside the
                                United Kingdom would form part of such an offence if
                                done or made in the United Kingdom, and
                           (c) that person has a close connection with the United
                                Kingdom.

                (3) In such a case--
                           (a) the acts or omissions form part of the offence referred to
                                in subsection (2)(a), and
                           (b) proceedings for the offence may be taken at any place in
                                the United Kingdom.

                (4) For the purposes of subsection (2)(c) a person has a close
                     connection with the United Kingdom if, and only if, the person
                     was one of the following at the time the acts or omissions
                     concerned were done or made--
                           (a) a British citizen,
                           (b) a British overseas territories citizen,
                           (c) a British National (Overseas),
                           (d) a British Overseas citizen,
                           (e) a person who under the British Nationality Act 1981 was a
                                British subject,
                           (f) a British protected person within the meaning of that Act,
                           (g) an individual ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom,
                           (h) a body incorporated under the law of any part of the
                                United Kingdom,
                           (i) a Scottish partnership.

                (5) An offence is committed under section 7 irrespective of whether
                     the acts or omissions which form part of the offence take place in
                     the United Kingdom or elsewhere.

                                                                                                          249
GLOBAL CORRUPTION

                (6) Where no act or omission which forms part of an offence under
                     section 7 takes place in the United Kingdom, proceedings for the
                     offence may be taken at any place in the United Kingdom.

                (7) Subsection (8) applies if, by virtue of this section, proceedings for
                     an offence are to be taken in Scotland against a person.

                (8) Such proceedings may be taken--
                           (a) in any sheriff court district in which the person is
                                apprehended or in custody, or
                           (b) in such sheriff court district as the Lord Advocate may
                                determine.

                (9) In subsection (8) "sheriff court district" is to be read in accordance
                     with section 307(1) of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995.

In summary, the Bribery Act applies if "any act or omission which forms part of the offence"
occurs within the UK (section 12(1)). In addition, the Bribery Act applies to conduct occurring
wholly outside the UK by persons with a "close connection" to the UK. Section 12(4) lists
those considered to have a close connection to the UK, including British citizens, British
nationals living overseas and all individuals ordinarily resident in the UK. Companies
incorporated under UK law are also deemed to have a close connection with the UK. Foreign
subsidiaries of UK parent companies are not subject to UK jurisdiction, even if wholly
owned by UK parent companies. But, if a foreign subsidiary acts as an agent for a UK
company, the agent's conduct can be attributed to the parent company. Pursuant to section
14, senior officers or directors of a UK corporation who are convicted of a section 1, 2 or 6
offence are also guilty of the offence if they consented or connived in the commission of the
offence.

The offence of commercial organizations failing to prevent bribery under section 7 of the
Bribery Act has much broader extraterritorial application. Section 7 reads (in part):

          7 Failure of commercial organisations to prevent bribery

                     (1) A relevant commercial organisation ("C") is guilty of an offence
                     under this section if a person ("A") associated with C bribes
                     another person intending--

                                (a) to obtain or retain business for C, or

                                (b) to obtain or retain an advantage in the conduct of
                                business for C.

                                ...

                     (3) For the purposes of this section, A bribes another person if, and
                     only if, A--

                                (a) is, or would be, guilty of an offence under section 1 or 6
                                (whether or not A has been prosecuted for such an offence),

                                (b) would be guilty of such an offence if section 12(2)(c) and
                                (4) were omitted.

                     (4) See section 8 for the meaning of a person associated with C and
                     see section 9 for a duty on the Secretary of State to publish guidance.

                                "relevant commercial organisation" means--

                                of the United Kingdom and which carries on a business
                                (whether there or elsewhere),

                                part of the United Kingdom and which carries on a

                                (d) any other partnership (wherever formed) which carries
                                on a business, or part of a business, in any part of the
                                United Kingdom, and, for the purposes of this section, a
                                trade or profession is a business.

As James Painter explains:

          Section 7 stands in stark contrast to the much narrower jurisdictional
          provisions of Sections 1, 2, and 6 of the Bribery Act, and it is this provision
          that is so striking in its extraterritoriality and scope of potential criminal
          liability. Three separate provisions embedded within Section 7 lead to this
          expansive jurisdictional reach and scope. First, the Section applies to
          "relevant commercial organizations". This term is defined in Section 7(5) of
          the Bribery Act to include both entities organized under UK law as well as
          entities organized under the laws of any other jurisdiction if the entity
          "carries on a business, or part of a business, in any part of the United
          Kingdom". Second, unlike the Section 1, 2, and 6 offenses that require either
          an act or omission in the UK or at least a "close connection", a relevant
          commercial organization can be exposed under Section 7 of the Act for
          failing to prevent bribery "irrespective of whether the acts or omissions
          which form part of the offence take place in the United Kingdom or
          elsewhere." Third, the predicate offenses for an organization to be
          criminally liable under Section 7 are triggered by the acts or omissions of a
          person "associated with" the relevant commercial organization. Under
          Section 8 of the Act, an "associated person" is a person who performs
          services for or on behalf of the organization. The term includes employees,
          agents and subsidiaries, and the capacity in which the associated person

                                                                                                         251
GLOBAL CORRUPTION

          performs services does not matter. These three concepts work to create an
          extraordinarily broad statute.56

As Jessica Lordi notes, it is likely that the words "carry on a business" are intended to
capture all commercial organizations doing business in the UK, not just those with a physical
office in the UK.57 In effect, section 7 appears to extend its reach to "virtually all major
multinational corporations,"58 with some commentators describing it as "the most
outrageously overreaching aspect of the Act."59 This approach, drawing criticism partly due
to the UK's former adherence to strict territoriality, "shows that legal attitudes to criminal
jurisdiction are changing in the light of transnational crime and its effects across
jurisdictions."60 Described as an "FCPA on steroids,"61 the Bribery Act reflects the prevailing
trend toward more FCPA-like corruption enforcement.62

The Guidance document to the UK Bribery Act, produced by the Ministry of Justice, attempts
to assuage concerns about the extraterritorial scope of section 7 by anticipating that a
"common sense approach" will be employed when determining whether an organization
carries on a business in the UK.63 According to the Guidance, the mere fact that a company is
listed for trading on the London Stock Exchange would not be sufficient to bring it under
the jurisdiction of section 7 of the Bribery Act without further evidence of a "demonstrable
business presence" in the UK. The Guidance also states that "having a UK subsidiary will
not, in itself, mean that a parent company is carrying on a business in the UK, since a
subsidiary may act independently of its parent or other group companies."64

           CHAPTER 3 JURISDICTION, LIABILITY, ACCOMPLICES, & INCHOATE OFFENCES

Commentators question whether the Guidance document has capitulated to business
interests that objected to the reach of the Bribery Act. According to Jaqueline Bonneau, the
Ministry of Justice's Guidance "has created loopholes that simply do not exist on the face of
the Bribery Act text, risking the resurrection of some of the most infamous problems of the
old common law bribery regime."65

Further, given the infrequency of Bribery Act cases taken to court (five between the Act's
introduction and March 2020),66 there is little opportunity for the court to influence the
interpretation of the "common sense approach" and how jurisdiction ought to be
determined. As of March 2020, only one conviction had been entered under section 7(1).67
At least five deferred prosecution agreements under section 7 have been entered, but the
details of these agreements are limited, and only one of included circumstances where the
entirety of the bribery occurred outside of the UK. The latter case, SFO v Airbus SE,68 hints
at the extensive breadth which may be ascribed to section 7, even where the connection to
the UK is nearly limited to the presence of a subsidiary unconnected to the bribery.69

In June 2021, Anneka Randhawa and Mhairi Fraser confirmed the ongoing lack of clarity:

          [T]he jurisdictional application of the section 7 offence, which applies to a
          corporate which "carries on a business or part of a business" in the UK, has
          so far evaded substantive clarification. The recent DPA entered into by
          Dutch-domiciled Airbus SE may provide some indication of approach. The
          court approving the DPA accepted that the jurisdictional test was satisfied
          on the basis that part of Airbus' business was carried out in the UK through
          two of its subsidiaries. This was despite the fact that Airbus' operational
          headquarters were in France and the conduct to which it admitted
          took place outside of the UK. However, the fact that Airbus did not contest

          jurisdiction means the law on this point still remains fundamentally
          untested.70

1.9 Canada

Until 2013, the Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act (CFPOA), which implements the
OECD Convention,71 determined jurisdiction based exclusively on the principle of
territoriality. Territoriality is the jurisdictional principle which governs most criminal
offences under Canadian law (Criminal Code, section 6),72 including the secret commissions
offence in section 426. However, Canada has asserted jurisdiction based on nationality for a
few crimes, such as offences under the CFPOA (since 2013), offences involving child sex
tourism and certain terrorism offences committed outside of Canada. See Criminal Code,
sections 7 (3.73) (3.74) (3.75) (4.1), and (4.11).73 Canada also extends jurisdiction through the
universality principle, such as through Crimes Against Humanity and War Crimes Act.74

Since the Criminal Code does not define "territorial jurisdiction," its meaning has been
determined by case law. The leading case was decided 30 years ago by the Supreme Court
of Canada (SCC), but its definition is now outdated in the context of bribery and other
transnational offences. In Libman v The Queen (1985), the SCC held that in order for a
Canadian criminal statute to apply, "a significant portion of the activities constituting that
offence" must take place in Canada.75 If a significant portion of the criminal conduct occurs
in Canada and other parts occur in a foreign state, then Canada and that foreign state have
concurrent jurisdiction (or qualified territorial jurisdiction). In Libman, the Court went on to
state that there must be a "real and substantial link"76 between the offence and Canada. In
addition, the court must be satisfied that prosecution does not offend the principle of
international comity. The term "comity" refers to the principle of legal reciprocity and
consideration for the interests of other states. Under this principle, a state displays civility
towards other nations by respecting the validity of their laws and other executive or judicial
actions.77 Penney, Rondinelli, and Stribolpolous note that the provisions which "define the

72 Specifically, section 6(2) reads, "Subject to this Act or any other Act of Parliament, no person shall
be convicted or discharged under section 730 of an offence committed outside Canada."

reach of Canada's criminal laws beyond its borders ... do not operate to the exclusion of the
real and substantial connection test from Libman.... Rather, they supply a further and
alternative basis for Canadian courts to assume jurisdiction."78

Libman sets a fairly high test for territorial jurisdiction. While Canada requires "significant
portions" of the offence to occur within Canada, the US and UK assert territorial jurisdiction
as "any act or omission," which constitutes an element of the offence occurs within their
borders. It appears that prior to the 2013 amendments adding nationality jurisdiction to
CFPOA, the Libman test would have excluded Canadian prosecution of bribery by Canadian
individuals or companies engaged in foreign bribery, if the conduct constituting bribery
occurred largely in other countries without any significant conduct in or substantial link to
Canada. As noted, such a demanding test for territorial jurisdiction is not well suited to the
modern realities of global business, in which the transfer of information, contracts, and
money between countries can occur instantaneously.

The OECD Working Group expressed concerns that Canada's standard of a "real and
substantial link" failed to comply with the OECD Convention, which mandates that even a
minor territorial link should be sufficient. However, the Libman standard has been relaxed
somewhat in practice. For example, in R v Karigar, the first conviction of an individual under
CFPOA, the accused was a Canadian acting on behalf of a Canadian company while in
India.79 Even though the actual financial element of the offence (i.e., approval or funding of
the bribe) did not occur in Canada, the court found there was still a real and substantial
connection because the accused was acting on behalf of a Canadian company and the unfair
advantage would have flowed to that Canadian company. The substantial link seems to be
that the accused was a Canadian citizen working for a Canadian company (compare with
Chowdhury noted below).

Canada's failure to expressly assert jurisdiction based on nationality was repeatedly
criticized by commentators prior to the 2013 amendments. In the 2011 Phase 3 Report, the
OECD Working Group called CFPOA's lack of extraterritorial jurisdiction based on
nationality "a serious obstacle to enforcement," and urged Canada to rectify this as a "matter
of urgency."80 Prior to the 2013 amendments, Canada responded to such criticisms by
arguing that the establishment of nationality jurisdiction was not explicitly mandated under
its treaty obligations.

In June 2013, the CFPOA was amended by Bill S-14 to extend the Act's prescriptive
jurisdiction to Canadian citizens, permanent residents, and any public body or entity formed
under Canadian law (called an "extended nationality basis"81). These individuals or legal
persons are subject to Canadian criminal liability with respect to acts of bribing a foreign

public official, irrespective of whether any part of the act constituting the offence takes place
in Canada. With these amendments, a Canadian accused (such as Mr. Karigar) would clearly
fall within Canada's jurisdiction.

However, the CFPOA's reach is not without limits. In Chowdhury v HMQ, the accused was a
citizen and resident of Bangladesh acting as an agent for a Canadian corporation, SNC-
Lavalin.82 The accused had never been to Canada. In his capacity as agent for SNC-Lavalin,
he allegedly facilitated the offer of bribes to foreign officials in Bangladesh in an attempt to
secure for SNC-Lavalin an engineering contract for the Padma Bridge proposal.

Chowdhury launched an application claiming Canada had no jurisdiction to prosecute him
for an offence of bribery under section 3(1)(b) of the CFPOA. The application was successful,
and the bribery charge against Chowdhury was stayed. The Court gave a very helpful
analysis of the complexity of the various concepts of jurisdiction.83 As the Court noted:

          [21] The decision in Hape dealt with the issue of the "extraterritorial
          application" of Canadian law. It noted the general prohibition in s. 6(2) of
          the Criminal Code that I have set out above. The court went on to find that
          Parliament has "clear constitutional authority" to pass legislation governing
          conduct by non-Canadians outside of Canada. However, in exercising that
          authority, the court noted certain parameters that will generally apply.
          LeBel J. said, at para. 68:

                     [Parliament's] ability to pass extraterritorial legislation is
                     informed by the binding customary principles of territorial
                     sovereign equality and non-intervention, by the comity of
                     nations, and by the limits of international law to the extent
                     that they are not incompatible with domestic law.

          [22] A basic part of international law is the principle of sovereign equality.
          Countries generally respect each other's borders ...

          [23] Nevertheless, there are situations where a country will reach beyond its
          borders to prosecute individuals who commit an offence in another country.
          This normally only occurs where the offence committed in the other country
          is committed by the first country's own nationals or where the harm arising
          from the criminal acts in the other country is visited upon the citizens of the
          first country. In the former case, the basis for jurisdiction is nationality. At
          common law, we recognize that Canada may have a legitimate interest in
          prosecuting an offence involving the actions of Canadians outside of our
          borders. In the latter case, the basis for jurisdiction is qualified territoriality,
          which extends the notion of territorial jurisdiction beyond our strict
          borders. Under the "objective territorial principle", Canada will have a
          legitimate interest in prosecuting non-Canadians for criminal actions that

cause harm in Canada provided a real and substantial link between the
offence and Canada is established and international comity is not offended.:
Libman; Hape at para. 59; Robert J. Currie, International & Transnational
Criminal Law (Toronto: Irwin Law, 2010) at pp. 63-65.

...

[35] There is a last point to be taken from Hape and that is with respect to
the issue that arises here, namely, the assumption of jurisdiction over
foreign nationals. The court in Hape held that it was open to Parliament to
pass legislation that sought to govern conduct by non-Canadians outside of
Canada. The court pointed out, however, that if Parliament chose to do so,
Parliament would likely be violating international law and would also
likely offend the comity of nations. Again, LeBel J. said, at para. 68:

          Parliament has clear constitutional authority to pass
          legislation governing conduct by non-Canadians outside
          Canada. Its ability to pass extraterritorial legislation is
          informed by the binding customary principles of territorial
          sovereign equality and non-intervention, by the comity of
          nations, and by the limits of international law to the extent
          that they are not incompatible with domestic law. By virtue
          of parliamentary sovereignty, it is open to Parliament to
          enact legislation that is inconsistent with those principles,
          but in so doing it would violate international law and
          offend the comity of nations.

[36] As a consequence of that reality, courts will approach the interpretation
of any legislation with the presumption that Parliament did not intend to
violate international law and offend the comity of nations. Thus, absent
clear language compelling such an interpretation, courts will adopt an
interpretation that leads to the opposite outcome.

The Court also emphasized the importance of the distinction between
jurisdiction over the offence and jurisdiction over the person:

[37] At the risk of being repetitive, but so that it is clear, there is a distinction
between Canada extending its jurisdiction over the offence, because the
offence has some extraterritorial aspects, and Canada extending its
jurisdiction over a person who is outside of Canada's territorial jurisdiction.
Jurisdiction over the former is governed by the "real and substantial link"
test set out in Libman. The latter is governed by the legislative language used
in the offence creating statute. This point is made by Robert J. Currie in
International & Transnational Criminal Law where the author observes, at p.
421:

          When Parliament wishes the courts to take extraterritorial
          jurisdiction over persons or conduct completely outside

                                                                                                257
GLOBAL CORRUPTION

                     Canadian borders, it must instruct the courts to this effect
                     by making it explicit or necessarily implied in the
                     legislation. Otherwise, territorial jurisdiction -- as
                     expanded by the Libman criteria -- is the default.

The Court held that neither section 3(1)(b) nor other provisions of CFPOA contained such
clear language, rejecting the position that jurisdiction over the offence establishes
jurisdiction over all parties to the offence and noting that jurisdiction over Chowdhury
would depend on his physical presence in Canada.84

Since Canada has no extradition treaty with Bangladesh, Canada cannot "lay hands" on
Chowdhury. The Court also rejected the Crown's argument that Chowdhury would get
away with impunity unless Canada claimed jurisdiction over him.85 The 2013 amendments
to CFPOA (adding nationality jurisdiction) would not give Canada jurisdiction over a person
like Chowdhury.

Despite the addition of nationality to jurisdiction, however, Canada still faces OECD
scrutiny for the scope of jurisdiction expressed in the CFPOA. While Canada has
"maintained that its approach to qualified territoriality under Libman provides a sufficiently
broad approach,"86 OECD reviewers find that the "substantial links" requirement makes
Canada's approach more restrictive than most other parties to the Convention.

On June 4, 2014, the RCMP charged US nationals Robert Barra and Dario Berini (former
CEOs of Cryptometrics), and UK national Shailesh Govindia (an agent for Cryptometrics)
with an offence under section 3 of CFPOA. Canada-wide warrants were issued for all three
(extradition proceedings in US and UK are an option). Based on Chowdhury, Ferguson
predicted, in the previous edition of this book, that prosecutors would no doubt argue that
Canada has a legitimate interest in prosecuting these foreign nationals in Canada because
the bribery scheme had its genesis in Canada and Cryptometrics is a Canadian company.
However, in finding that Canada had territorial jurisdiction, the case focused on the "fruits
of the transaction" being connected to Canada, and surprisingly did not cite Chowdhury at
all:

          [27] At pp. 212-13 of Libman, the Supreme Court stated that a significant
          portion of the activities constituting that offence must have taken place in
          Canada. Barra and Govindia argue that if they made an agreement with
          Berini to bribe Air India and Indian public officials, it occurred at the
          meeting between Berini, Barra and Govindia in New York City on
          November 2, 2007 or shortly thereafter, all of which occurred outside of
          Canada. This conspiracy would have been completed when they reached
          an agreement to pay $500,000 to bribe the Indian Minister of Civil Aviation

(Praful Patel) to approve the contract between Air India and Cryptometrics
Canada, which was separate from any previous agreement with Karigar.

[28] At p. 211 of the Libman decision, the Supreme Court also stated as
follows:

          It also ignores the fact that the fruits of the transaction
          were obtained in Canada as contemplated by the scheme.
          Their delivery here was not accidental or irrelevant. It was
          an integral part of the scheme. While it may not in strictness
          constitute part of the offence, it is, I think, relevant in
          considering whether a transaction falls outside Canadian
          territory. For in considering that question we must, in my
          view, take into account all relevant facts that take place in
          Canada that may legitimately give this country an interest
          in prosecuting the offence. One must then consider
          whether there is anything in those facts that offends
          international comity. If I may borrow the expression of
          Meredith J.A., in Bachrack, supra, the law would be lame
          indeed if its strictures could be avoided by the simple
          artifice of going outside the country to obtain the fruits of a
          scheme that was hatched in and largely put into effect in
          Canada. In this case, the whole operation of obtaining the
          proceeds of the fraud outside the country was a mere sham
          and should be treated as such. [emphasis added]

[29] In this case, the fruits of the transaction were intended to be obtained
in Canada, namely by obtaining a profitable contract for Cryptometrics
Canada. The court must take into account all relevant facts that took place
in Canada that may legitimately give this country an interest in prosecuting
this offence.

[30] At p. 211 of Libman, Laforest J. went on to state that "the law would be
lame indeed if its strictures could be avoided by the simple artifice of going
outside the country to obtain the fruits of a scheme that was hatched and
largely put into effect in Canada." In this case, the Canadian Corruption of
Foreign Public Officials Act would be lame if it did not apply to a situation
where members of senior management of a Canadian company could with
impunity arrange to meet with others outside of Canada and agree to pay
bribes to foreign officials to obtain a contract for the Canadian company.

[31] In the case of R. v. Karigar, 2017 ONCA 576 at para. 26, the Court of
Appeal quoted Libman, where La Forest J. stated that rather than confining
the analysis to only acts that were strictly part of the offence, the court must
take into account all relevant facts that take place in Canada that may
legitimately give this country an interest in prosecuting this offence. The
Ontario Court of Appeal upheld Hackland J.'s decision (2013 ONSC 5199)
and rejected the appellant's position that Canada did not have the requisite
territorial connection to the offence involving Karigar.

                                                                                                259
GLOBAL CORRUPTION

          ...

          [33] The main difference between the Karigar case and the case before me
          was that Karigar was a Canadian citizen who lived in Toronto, while
          Govindia was never a citizen or resident of Canada, but this was found by
          the Court of Appeal to be only one of the factors linking the offence to
          Canada (para. 31).

          [34] There is evidence that Govindia agreed to act as the second agent,
          replacing Karigar. There is evidence that on November 2, 2007 or shortly
          thereafter, he agreed with Berini and Barra to pay the sum of $500,000 to the
          Indian Minister of Civil Aviation to obtain the Air India contract for
          Cryptometrics Canada.

          [35] The presence of Berini at the meeting with Govindia and Barra in New
          York City provides a direct connection to Canada, because Berini was the
          Chief Operating Officer and the Manager of Cryptometrics Canada when
          he met with them and allegedly agreed to pay a bribe of $500,000 to the
          Indian Civil Aviation Minister to obtain the contract. In addition to the other
          factors identified in the Karigar decision, the active participation of the
          Chief Operating Officer and Manager of the Canadian company at a
          meeting outside of Canada, where there is evidence that he agreed with
          Barra and Govindia to pay a bribe of $500,000 to the Indian Minister to
          obtain a contract for the Canadian company that he managed, constitutes a
          "real and substantial link" between the offence and Canada. [emphasis
          added]87

This judgment's emphasis on the fruits of the transaction, and its choice to highlight that
other factors besides citizenship connected Karigar to Canada in the Karigar judgment may
foreshadow an increasingly flexible approach to the "significant links" that may connect an
offence to Canada for the purposes of the CFPOA.88

1.10 Concurrent Jurisdiction and Parallel Proceedings: A Cause for

         Caution

Skinnider, in Corruption in Canada: Reviewing Practices from Abroad to Improve Our Response
[written in 2012, before Canada extended jurisdiction to include nationality], reviews some
of the major arguments for and against expanding jurisdiction beyond territoriality:89

                                                            BEGINNING OF EXCERPT

The broadening of jurisdiction beyond the principle of [strict] territoriality will likely result
in higher incidences of concurrent jurisdiction. This could give rise to conflicting assertions
of civil or criminal jurisdiction, conflicts of laws and concerns of dual criminality and double
jeopardy. Companies have raised concerns as to how they are to do business and respond
to investigations and prosecutions in multiple jurisdictions that have different substantive
laws, enforcement procedures, penalties and available resources. Companies have also
expressed concern regarding the "legalization of compliance codes" and the multiplicity of
possible compliance codes found in different States.

Some commentators counter these concerns by pointing out that the reality is there is an
appalling lack of enforcement, and not to waste time worrying about multiple jurisdictional
issues. However, the IBA Legal Practice Division Task Force on Extraterritorial Jurisdiction
has studied this issue and calls for harmonizing guidelines to alleviate this potential
challenge. The Task Force also calls for States to consider adopting a "soft" form of double
jeopardy or ne bis in idem that takes into account not just criminal liability, but "functional
equivalent" civil liability for corporations and individuals. The lack of harmonization of
corruption statutes in terms of corporate and individual liability, penalties, major elements
of offences and defences, needs to be considered in devising any double jeopardy rule.

Whether a corporation may be regarded as national differs amongst States. Some States
regard a corporation as national if it has been founded according to the national law or if
the corporation resides in the territory. Other States relate the question of jurisdiction to the
nationality of the acting natural person, not to the nationality of the legal person. Thus,
States would require that the person who has acted corruptly within the structure or in
favor of the legal person is one of its citizens. However, this may cause "serious legal
loopholes since in the crucial cases of corporate liability
investigative agencies may not be able to identify the individual instigator or perpetrator."

Moreover States "may consider that the principle of liability of legal persons links legal
consequences to the legal entity itself, hence abstracting from individual persons and their
nationality". The application of nationality jurisdiction to legal persons remains untested.

2. CORPORATE CRIMINAL LIABILITY AND OTHER COLLECTIVE
      ENTITIES

It is well recognized among commentators that in order to effectively combat transnational
corruption, mechanisms must be in place to hold corporations and other collective entities
liable when they engage in bribery. For convenience, we will generally use the expression
"corporate liability," but when doing so I intend to include other legally recognized
collective entities. In many cases, particularly when dealing with large, decentralized
multinational corporations, it may be impossible for an enforcement agency to determine
who within the huge organization actually made the decision to offer a bribe.90 Often the
decision to offer a bribe by a frontline employee is either supported or tolerated by the upper
echelons of management.91 In such a case, punishing only the frontline employee would not
sufficiently punish the corporate culture that facilitated the wrongdoing, nor would it
effectively deter other corporations from allowing this culture to persist. There is therefore
a need to hold corporations liable in these instances.

For many years, both common law and civil law jurisdictions resisted the idea that a
corporation could be found guilty of a "crime."92 This reluctance was based on the
traditional notion that "crimes" required proof of "personal mental fault" (also referred to
as subjective fault), which usually took the form of acting intentionally or recklessly (i.e., the
accused foresees that his/her conduct may cause a criminal harm, but engages in that conduct,
thereby knowingly taking the risk that the criminal harm may occur). It was thought that

90 In a 2007 study of international business organizations, almost 70,000 multinational parent
companies operated through nearly 700,000 foreign affiliates and the largest 100 companies had an
average of 187 subsidiaries per group: PI Blumberg et al, The Law of Corporate Groups: Jurisdiction,
Practice and Procedure (Aspen Publishers Online, 2007), cited in OECD Stocktaking (2016), supra note
28 at 11, n 4. Also see the updated version of this text, PI Blumberg et al, Blumberg on Corporate
Groups, 2nd ed (New York: Wolters Kluwer, 2021). This latter text at 1-3 of the 2009 Supplement also
reminds us that, despite having some statistics for subsidiaries and affiliates of large corporations,
the landscape of multinational corporations (and their control or accountability over corporate
actions) is increased significantly by "franchisees, licensees, dealers and contractors for which
statistics are unavailable."

           CHAPTER 3 JURISDICTION, LIABILITY, ACCOMPLICES, & INCHOATE OFFENCES

corporations, as non-human legal fictions, could not form personal states of mind such as
intention or subjective recklessness. In other words, "a corporation was an incorporeal entity
that lacked the necessary degree of fault or blameworthiness that is a necessary condition
for the imposition of criminal liability."93 As industrialization spread in the 18th and 19th
centuries and "corporations acquired a greater social presence as the scope and impact of
their activities expanded dramatically,"94 many new offences were created to prevent or
regulate industrial activities and industrialization's harmful ancillary effects.95 These
offences were generally considered to be regulatory or administrative offences, as opposed
to criminal offences. Since they were not crimes, they did not require proof of "personal
fault." They were strict or absolute liability and, therefore, corporations could be and were
convicted of these types of offences.

The pressure to also hold corporations liable for criminal offences began to build in the early
20th century. Common law countries slowly adopted corporate criminal liability in the first
half of the 20th century. However, even in its increasing acceptance, Mark Fenwick states
that:

          [F]or much of its history, corporate criminal law was marginalized from the
          mainstream of criminal justice, even in those jurisdictions that embraced the
          doctrine. In practice, criminal prosecution of corporate suspects remained
          something of an exception, perhaps reflecting both the power of large
          corporations and a recognition on the part of the state that prosecuting such
          cases was always going to be difficult and that - even in the best case - a
          conviction might result in socially undesirable collateral damage to
          innocent third parties.96

The reluctance to charge corporations with criminal offences in a sanctions-based or punitive
model, still finds support among some of today's academics.97 Generally speaking, in order
to find corporate criminal liability, courts in common law countries began to hold that the
"personal fault" of the "directing minds" of a corporation was deemed to also be the
corporation's personal fault. The critical question then became: which officers of a
corporation are that corporation's `directing minds'?

Civil law countries were less willing to accept the fiction that a corporation can have a guilty
intent or mind, and instead focused on managerial personal liability.98 However, since the

93 Ibid.
94 Ibid.
95 English law expanded criminal liability to municipalities first, and followed with corporations. The
trend began first through "judicial rather than legislative action, and involved cases of criminal
omission resulting in public nuisance. The scope of this new form of criminal liability gradually
expanded, however, to include acts as well as omission and finally crimes requiring intent and not
just absolute liability offences": ibid. Criminal liability in the US developed in a similar manner: ibid.

Deterrence of Corporate Crime" in Jennifer Arlen ed, Research Handbook on Corporate Crime and

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

mid-20th century, many, but not all civil law countries began to recognize corporate criminal
liability (an issue further discussed in Section 2.4).99

There are currently three main legal mechanisms for imputing criminal liability to
corporations. The differences between these mechanisms are significant. In addition, within
each mechanism there can be variations in terms of broad or narrow attribution of criminal
liability to corporations. The three mechanisms are:

           1. strict vicarious liability (used in general for US federal laws);
           2. directing mind or identification doctrine (used by countries such as

                 England and Canada and by many states in the US and Australia); and
           3. corporate culture (used in Australian federal laws).100

Mark Pieth and Radha Ivory briefly summarize these three mechanisms:

       by imputing to the corporation offences committed by any corporate agent
           or employee - no matter what steps others in the corporation had taken to
           prevent and respond to the misconduct (strict vicarious liability), or if

99 This evolution has occurred in part due to the OECD and UNCAC, but also due to the 2nd EU
Protocol for European civil law countries:

     In the technical sense, however, the 2nd EU Protocol required only a (neutral) "sanctioning"
     of the legal person for a limited number of criminal acts under certain (limited) conditions,
     but did not, despite some (erroneous) claims in that direction, oblige member states to
     introduce corporate criminal responsibility in the strict sense. Still, the 2nd EU Protocol
     outlines basic elements of corporate legal (penal) responsibility, among those most notably
     the "attribution model" (namely the concept of deriving corporate crime from the criminal
     acts of certain natural persons, whose behaviour is deemed attributable to the legal person),
     the distinction between an "inner" and an "outer" circle of individuals acting on behalf of
     the legal person (the behaviour by the "inner circle" being attributable as such as the legal
     person's alter ego, while the more remote "outer circle" requires an additional surveillance
     or organisational mistake on the management level)

     ...

     The idea of "corporate crime" has since the 2nd EU Protocol grown in EU law. Many EU
     legal acts (directives) use nowadays the language of a "standard clause" that requires penal
     sanctions against legal persons for deeds both by members of the inner and outer circle.
     Such "standard clauses" can, for example, be found in Directive (EU) 2017/1371 of 5 July
     2017 on the fight against fraud to the Union's financial interests. [footnotes omitted]

          others had not done enough to prevent the wrongdoing (qualified
          vicarious liability);

      by identifying the corporation with its executive bodies and managers and
          holding the corporation liable for their acts, omissions, and states of mind
          of those executives (identification); and

      by treating the collective entity as capable of offending in its own right,
          either through the aggregated thoughts and deeds of its senior
          stakeholders (aggregation) or through inadequate organizational systems
          and cultures (corporate culture, corporate (dis)organization).101

Countries such as France, Austria, Italy, and Switzerland have all enacted statutes that
impose corporate criminal liability. Some jurisdictions, such as Germany, do not recognize
corporate criminal liability, but instead impose quasi-criminal regulatory sanctions (or
"administrative" regulation)102 on collective entities:

          This approach reflected the view that the liability of legal persons is
          properly dealt with as part of public administrative law rather than the
          criminal law. Many countries in Europe... began to confront the growing
          power of business enterprises by introducing systems of administrative
          regulation, similar to "public welfare" offences in the United States or
          regulatory offences in the UK. These infractions are enforced by
          administrative agencies and have neither the status of criminal sanction and
          are thought to be morally neutral and lacking the element of condemnation
          and moral fault associated with criminal liability.103

Outside of Europe, countries such as Korea, Japan and China recognize at least some form
of corporate criminal liability. There remain, however, some countries, such as Uruguay that
do not recognize criminal or quasi-criminal sanctions for companies.104 In these countries, it
is only possible to convict the employees, agents or executives of a company, but not the
company itself. For a recent overview of corporate liability in Europe see: Clifford Chance's,

of corporate liability of the 41 countries that are parties to the OECD Convention is discussed
in Section 2.2.2.106

Among countries that recognize corporate criminal liability, there are significant variations
regarding the offences for which criminal liability may be imposed and the way in which
that liability is triggered. Most common law jurisdictions now accept that a corporation may
be found to have mens rea through its human actors. Some civil law countries accept this
proposition and impose corporate criminal liability for all crimes. Other civil law countries
only accept this proposition for certain listed offences. Countries that employ a "list-based"
approach generally restrict corporate criminal liability to economic and other types of
offences associated with corporations, as well as offences established pursuant to
international and regional conventions. A more detailed review of the ways in which various
common law and civil law countries address corporate criminal liability can be found in
Pieth and Ivory's chapter "Emergence and Convergence: Corporate Criminal Liability
Principles in Overview"107 and in the 2016 OECD report Liability of Legal Persons for Foreign
Bribery: A Stocktaking Report.108

The attribution of criminal intent or fault to corporations also raises the possibility of a due
diligence or compliance defence. The possible existence of that defence in the context of
bribery and anti-corruption offences in the US, UK and Canada will be discussed in further
detail.

2.1 UNCAC

UNCAC does not mandate that State Parties establish criminal sanctions for corporations
involved in corruption offences. However, Article 26 requires State Parties to ensure that
legal entities are liable (criminally or otherwise) for their participation in offences established
under UNCAC. Fritz Heimann writes that, "[t]his is an important step because it should
accelerate the abandonment of the antiquated concept that only individuals and not
corporations shall be criminally liable for the offenses."109 Article 26 states:

          Article 26. Liability of legal persons

          1. Each State Party shall adopt such measures as may be necessary,
                consistent with its legal principles, to establish the liability of legal
                persons for participation in the offences established in accordance
                with this Convention.

          2. Subject to the legal principles of the State Party, the liability of legal
                persons may be criminal, civil or administrative.

          4. Each State Party shall, in particular, ensure that legal persons held

                proportionate and dissuasive criminal or non-criminal sanctions,
                including monetary sanctions.

The Legislative Guide to UNCAC addresses corporate liability as follows:

          [Article 26] complements the more general requirement of article 30,
          paragraph 1, that sanctions must take into account the gravity of the offence.

          quite lengthy, States with a legal system providing for statutes of limitation
          must ensure that the limitation periods for the offences covered by the
          Convention are comparatively long (see also art. 29).

          The most frequently used sanction is a fine, which is sometimes
          characterized as criminal, sometimes as non-criminal and sometimes as a
          hybrid. Other sanctions include exclusion from contracting with the
          Government (for example public procurement, aid procurement and export
          credit financing), forfeiture, confiscation, restitution, debarment or closing
          down of legal entities. In addition, States may wish to consider non-
          monetary sanctions available in some jurisdictions, such as withdrawal of
          certain advantages, suspension of certain rights, prohibition of certain
          activities, publication of the judgment, the appointment of a trustee, the
          requirement to establish an effective internal compliance programme and
          the direct regulation of corporate structures.

          The obligation to ensure that legal persons are subject to appropriate
          sanctions requires that these be provided for by legislation and should not
          limit or infringe on existing judicial independence or discretion with respect
          to sentencing. [footnotes omitted]110

2.2 OECD Convention

Corporate liability under the OECD Convention is similar to UNCAC.111 Article 2 of the
OECD Convention states:

          Each Party shall take such measures as may be necessary, in accordance
          with its legal principles, to establish the liability of legal persons for the
          bribery of a foreign public official.

The clause "in accordance with its legal principles" reflects the Convention's goal of
functional equivalency, meaning that State Parties are required to sanction the bribery of

foreign public officials in the same manner that they would sanction other offences
committed by corporations, without mandating changes in the fundamental principles of
their respective legal systems.112 In this regard, the Commentaries on the Convention state that
if the concept of criminal responsibility of legal persons is not recognized in a nation's legal
system, that nation is not required to establish it.113 Furthermore, Article 3(2) requires that if
criminal liability for legal persons is not available, State Parties "shall ensure" that legal
persons are subject to "effective, proportionate and dissuasive non-criminal sanctions,
including monetary sanctions, for bribery of foreign public officials." This wording is very
similar to the requirements regarding the sanctioning of legal persons later adopted by
UNCAC. Pursuant to Article 3(4), State Parties shall also consider the imposition of
additional civil or administrative sanctions, such as exclusion from participation in public
procurement processes, exclusion from entitlement to certain benefits or a judicial winding-
up order. These and other civil remedies are discussed in Chapter 7, Sections 7 to 10.

In 2009, the OECD Council adopted the 2009 Recommendation for Further Combatting Bribery
and Annex I, which stated that member parties to the convention should not treat
prosecution of natural persons as a prerequisite to also prosecuting the corporation, and
secondly it provided guidance on different methods for attributing liability to the company
based on the actions or inactions of natural persons associated with the company.114

Pieth notes that the OECD WGB has been reluctant to give directives on which sanctions it
feels meet the standard of "effective, proportionate and dissuasive."115 Upon reviewing the
WGB's Phase One evaluation of Japan (where it considered the sanctions available in Japan
to be insufficient), Pieth argues that two principles are discernible:

           [F]irst, that sanctions against corporations must be sufficiently `tough' to
           have an impact on large multinational corporations, second, that according
           to the concept of functional equivalence a trade-off is possible between two
           theoretically quite different instruments, i.e. the corporate fine and the
           forfeiture/confiscation of illicit profits (Article 3(3) of the Convention).116

Pieth goes on to address how the different concepts of corporate criminal liability compare
to the standard of effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions:

           With respect to those countries which have implemented corporate criminal
           liability, the application of a mere identification model, imputing only
           offences of the most senior management to corporations and also frequently

           CHAPTER 3 JURISDICTION, LIABILITY, ACCOMPLICES, & INCHOATE OFFENCES

          refusing a concept of `aggregate knowledge', would in our view fail to meet
          the requirements of `effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions.'117

The comments above are relevant to the UK. They were also applicable to Canada before the
2004 legislative changes which provided a broader definition of corporate liability. Pieth
then adds:

          On the other hand, the terms of Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention would
          be met by countries whose liability concept includes lack of due diligence
          by senior management, allowing junior agents to engage in bribery.118

According to this view, the many State Parties that rely on the identification theory to trigger
liability of corporate entities are failing to meet their full OECD Convention obligations.

      2.2.1 Approaches to Corporate Criminal Liability

As demonstrated, the OECD and UNCAC provide for some flexibility in domestic
approaches to corporate criminal liability. However, Elizabeth Acorn suggests that the
frequency with which states enforce anti-bribery legislation is tied to the available methods
of enforcement. For example, she writes:

          [W]hile Canadian authorities exclusively respond to allegations of foreign
          bribery with the traditional criminal-law methods of lengthy trials and
          guilty pleas, prosecutors in other states, like the US and Germany, deploy a
          variety of tools to enforce their foreign-bribery prohibitions, including
          diversionary resolution mechanisms that do not require a determination of
          criminal guilt.119

Some commentators believe these other mechanisms may be more effective, and the
addition of "criminal" punishment per se is not necessarily the most appropriate doctrinal
or practical solution to curbing international corruption. When writing of Austria's
reluctance to impose, or rather "late start" in imposing, corporate criminal liability, Peter
Lewisch writes:

          On the one hand, Austria had an elaborate, differentiated legal system that
          made it possible for new legal phenomena/challenges to be dealt with in a
          well-balanced way by "turning all available screws" in all legal fields
          concerned to accomplish an overall satisfactory outcome. Reliance on
          changes in all relevant pertinent fields (tort law, administrative law,
          administrative penal law, traditional criminal law) makes it possible to
          avoid overburdening one single legal field (say, criminal law) with tasks for
          which another field is better suited. In the case of "corporate crime",
          vicarious tort liability could go hand in hand with administrative penal

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

          sanctions and individual criminal punishment, thus accomplishing all
          relevant policy goals without "deforming" fundamental concepts of
          criminal law. There was hence no need to introduce corporate criminal
          responsibility: If it ain't broken, don't fix it. On the other hand, there were
          (and still are) substantial reservations both from the doctrinal self-
          understanding of criminal law and from constitutional law regarding the
          introduction of a new criminal sanction that would, while in substance
          equivalent to traditional criminal punishment, abandon the guilt
          requirement.120

Acorn looks "to national policies to combat corporate and economic crime more generally
and trace how they interact with the shared obligation to criminalize foreign bribery."121 A
divergence in policy between states can have significant impacts:

          For instance, in the 20 years since the Convention's signing, the UK has
          experimented with several different approaches to anti-foreign-bribery
          enforcement, including a new offence that punishes corporations for the
          failure to prevent bribery. Much of this experimentation can be traced back
          to the challenging anti-foreign-bribery enforcement environment in the UK
          created by its high standard for corporate criminal liability. In contrast, in
          the US, the relatively low bar for corporate criminal liability and the pivot
          by federal prosecutors in the mid-2000s to the use of diversionary settlement
          procedures for corporate wrongdoing at large has enabled prolific anti-
          foreign-bribery enforcement.122

Acorn identifies a spectrum of approaches to corporate anti-bribery enforcement, noting that
there is a "traditional criminal-law approach on one end and a more flexible and regulatory
approach on the other," and that "[w]here a state falls on this continuum can influence the
frequency, duration, and outcome of foreign-bribery prosecutions."123 Criminal trials are
slower enforcement processes and take significant resources, while "negotiated resolutions
... can be much quicker and less resource intensive."124 Some commentators also question
the effectiveness of heavy sanctions that have been increasingly levied in the recent past.125

           CHAPTER 3 JURISDICTION, LIABILITY, ACCOMPLICES, & INCHOATE OFFENCES

      2.2.2 Corporate Liability in the 41 State Parties

The OECD's WGB conducted a comparative study on the liability of legal persons in the 41
Parties to the OECD Convention. In December 2016, the WGB released its final stocktaking
report.126

The report notes the vast global expansion of liability for "legal persons" that has taken place
since the Convention's adoption in 1997, through creating legal person liability frameworks
for foreign bribery in absence of prior traditions, adapting pre-existing frameworks for legal
person liability to cover foreign bribery, or a multi-stage process of continued refinement for
a corporate liability. The latter form is indicated by "multiple entries [which] suggest that
the creation of an LP liability regime may be, for many countries, an ongoing search for an
appropriate fit with the local legal system through experimentation and adaptation as they
apply their laws."127

The 2019 OECD report, Strengthening Trust in Business, reported the following:

          The creation and refinement of corporate liability systems are key elements
          of this progress. At the time the Anti-Bribery Convention entered into force,
          a third of the Parties had no legal framework for corporate liability and
          many of the others had only very sketchy systems that did not reflect the
          complexities of business management. Now, all Parties to the Anti-Bribery
          Convention can hold business organisations liable for crime in some
          form or other. In most cases, corporate liability systems make companies
          accountable for foreign bribery and for a wide variety of other unlawful
          acts. This, along with the adoption of increasingly dissuasive sanctions for
          foreign bribery, strengthens incentives for companies to adopt management
          systems designed both to prevent corporate crime and to encourage them
          to cooperate with law enforcement. [emphasis added]128

Regarding the "sketchy systems" just mentioned, the report states, "[f]or example, many of
the common law members of the [WGB] had a `directing mind' approach to the standard of
corporate liability, meaning that involvement by the top decision-making echelons of the
company must be proved, if liability is to be established."129 The progress towards less
"sketchy" (but nevertheless of great variation) corporate liability demonstrates an

overwhelming success in the persuasive nature of the OECD and indicates a shift in the
prevailing attitudes towards corporate criminal liability.130

In regard to each OECD country, the 2016 report also examines nine distinct aspects of the
legal test or standard for liability of legal persons as well as three aspects of sanctions for
legal persons found liable. As might be expected, there is significant variance in these
features of legal person liability. These sections of the 2016 report make for very interesting
reading for those who are interested in the nature and scope of corporate criminal liability
amongst the 41 countries that are parties to the OECD Convention. Two of the most
interesting aspects that are reviewed are:

     (1) Liability of Legal Persons for Acts of Intermediaries: The complexity of the global
          marketplace, and the variety of licit financial vehicles create significant obstacles
          for attribution of liability, and consequently, enforcement. Nicholas Lord et al.
          illustrate a "simple" scheme through which international corporate crime may
          be conducted:

                     Professional intermediaries are central to how corporate vehicles
                     are misappropriated by those with illicit finances. To give a
                     hypothetical example of how this functions, an intermediary such
                     as a [Trust and Company Service Provider] or [Company
                     Formation Agent], in country A, would be contacted by a
                     representative, such as a lawyer, of the end client in country B and
                     be hired to set up a corporate vehicle. The TCSP/CFA would then
                     contact one of their agents in a jurisdiction known for its protection
                     or obscuring of beneficial owners, country C. The agent in country
                     C would then contact a local lawyer or professional who would
                     incorporate or set up a corporate vehicle, such as a trust or limited
                     company. The particulars of the corporate vehicle would then be
                     sent back through the chain from the lawyer in country C to the
                     agent in country C and back to the TCSP/CFA in country A and
                     then back to the representative in country B. In these cases, the
                     actual client in country B would never have contact with the
                     TCSP/CFA or any other actor along the network but would pay all
                     the associated fees and thus have the product, that is, the company
                     or trust. Funds could then be remitted to a corresponding bank, as
                     directed by the TCSP/CFA. This is a relatively simple scheme, but
                     in practice, such arrangements can be layered, and in some cases,
                     circular ownership structures will be created to obscure the

corporate liability laws in compliance with commitments made under the Anti-Bribery Convention":

                     beneficial owners. Contrived ownership networks create major
                     obstacles to enforcement.131

     Interactions between legal and natural persons, and legal and other legal persons,
     give rise to significant questions about the extent to which the criminal actions of
     one may be attributed to another.

     Intermediaries can be "related" (i.e., subsidiaries or individual entities within a
     corporate group) or unrelated (i.e., third-party agents, consultants or contractors).
     The law on liability of legal persons for acts of intermediaries varies significantly.
     The 2016 report studies each country on the basis of various circumstances. In
     respect to related intermediaries, some of the more noteworthy models of liability
     recognized in the report are:

                 In the spirit of the organisation [e.g., the Netherlands].
                 "On behalf of". In some countries, a parent company can be liable

                     for the acts of its subsidiary, if the subsidiary is an "agent" or
                     otherwise acting on its behalf. According to Norwegian officials
                     and other panellists at the WGB's on-site visit, Norway can hold
                     the parent liable whenever the subsidiary acts "on behalf of" the
                     parent. In the United States, "a parent may be liable for its
                     subsidiary's conduct under traditional agency principles",
                     whenever it has sufficient "control", whether formally or in fact,
                     over the subsidiary's operations or conduct. Whenever such an
                     "agency relationship" arises, the "subsidiary's actions and
                     knowledge" can trigger criminal or other liability for the parent
                     company.

                 "For the benefit of" [e.g., Slovenia].

                 Corporate Groups [e.g., Brazil]. [footnotes omitted]

     (2) Successor Liability: The 2016 report explains the importance of robust successor
          liability principles to the effective enforcement and sanctioning of corruption
          offences.132 Neither the OECD Convention, nor the 2009 Recommendation,
          specifically refer to successor liability.

Organized Crimes" (2019) 59:5 British J Crim 1217 at 1224.

liability, see Mihailis E Diamantis, "Successor Identity" (2019) 36:1 Yale J on Reg 1. At 4-5, Mihailis
states:

            The current state of successor liability should worry everyone from law and economics
            scholars to justice theorists. In a world where the annual social costs of white-collar crime
            often exceed half a trillion dollars and prosecutors regularly resolve corporate
            investigations for penalties exceeding one hundred million dollars, the stakes of getting
            corporate liability right are high. By automatically transmitting any criminal liability from
            predecessors to successors, current doctrine fails to distinguish between ways corporations
            can reorganize.

                                                                                                          273
GLOBAL CORRUPTION

2.3 US

Under the US common law doctrine of respondeat superior, a corporation will be vicariously
liable for acts of its employees that violate the FCPA if the employee was acting within the
scope of his or her authority, and the employee acted, at least in part, for the benefit of the
company.133 Under this principle, even low-level employees acting in contravention of an
express direction not to bribe a foreign official may still trigger liability for the corporation
under federal law.134 The term "scope of authority" means within the course of the
employee's ordinary duties. Robert Tarun and Peter Tomczak explain:

          For example, an international salesman agreeing to bribe a foreign official
          in order to obtain or retain business will be deemed to be acting within the
          scope of his authority. The focus is on the function delegated to the agent or
          employee and whether the conduct falls within that general function. So
          long as the agent or employee's acts are consistent with his general
          employment function, his employer may be held liable for those acts, even
          if they were contrary to express corporate policy. [footnotes omitted]135

In addition, "the benefit of the corporation" need not be the sole motivating factor behind
the employee's decision to offer a bribe: "So long as the motive includes a direct or ancillary
benefit to the corporation--either realized or unrealized--a corporation will be accountable

     Reorganizations can differ widely. Corporations know this. It is no secret that they try to
     use their fluid form and the potentialities of reorganization to manage their liabilities, both
     criminal and civil. Law influences the choices corporations make during reorganization, and
     these choices can have important implications for criminal justice policy. One crucial lever
     of influence is how reorganization impacts corporate criminal liability. That lever is
     currently stuck in "transmit."

     Some reorganizations are socially preferable, and the law should incentivize them. More
     specifically, current law fails to recognize that corporate reorganizations are pivotal
     moments when corporations could be encouraged to make significant improvements to
     compliance. By ignoring the details of each reorganization, current doctrine also cannot
     distinguish between cases when punishing successor corporations would advance social
     goals, and when not. Though corporations may be fictional people, they are composed of
     largely innocent real people-shareholders, employees, etc. who bear the burdens of
     corporate sanctions: "When the corporation catches a cold, someone else sneezes." The
     criminal law must balance considerations of social policy and justice where corporations are
     concerned because punishing them effectively sanctions their constituents. [footnotes

for the agent or employee's acts."136 However, where an employee's actions are a breach of
their fiduciary duty to a corporation (that is, acting contrary to a corporation's best interests),
their actions will not be imputed to the corporation.137

Corporate criminal liability through respondeat superior has been the subject of significant
critique, and these critics have espoused some standards and guidelines used by the DOJ
and Sentencing Commission to respond to the ambit of respondeat superior in federal
prosecutions.138 For example, the Principles of Federal Prosecution of Business Organizations
(Principles of Prosecution) "makes it clear that federal prosecutors should not bring criminal
charges merely because a case can be made on the basis of respondeat superior. Rather,
prosecutors must consider a variety of factors that identify corporate blameworthiness and
assess the adequacy of alternatives to federal prosecution, including those deemed most
important by the critics of respondeat superior."139 Among these factors are the nature of the
offence, risk to the public, pervasiveness and history of wrongdoing in the corporation, and
the corporation's willingness to co-operate.140 Sara Sun Beale observes that, "the
discretionary approach under the Principles of Prosecution has substantially narrowed the
effective reach of corporate liability."141

Despite some of the "cooling" of corporate criminal prosecutions in response to the Principles
of Prosecution, some critics (including Senator Elizabeth Warren and prominent scholar
Brandon Garrett) have also maintained that, "the Government too seldom employs the fruits
of corporate cooperation to bring individual prosecutions, even when a corporation's own
admissions have made it clear that there were culpable individuals."142 The DOJ faced
significant criticism for the lacunae of prosecutions against individuals in the wake of the
2008 financial crisis.143 This criticism resulted in the Yates Memo, which "restates the DOJ's
view of criminal law and prosecutorial discretion as utilitarian tools that should be used
pragmatically to protect the public, but it also emphasizes a new element: the public demand
for individual accountability."144 The Yates Memo provides "procedural adjustments [which
are intended to implement the policy decision to `strengthen [the] pursuit of individual
corporate wrongdoing'" [footnote omitted]145 and to ultimately provide deterrence and
encourage changing corporate culture.146 To put a finer point on the reception of the Yates
Memo, Norton Rose Fulbright stated:

          The extent to which these items represent policy changes, rather than mere
          clarifications of existing policy, is the subject of some debate. But whatever
          else might be said about the Yates Memo, the Memo's aggressive language
          and ambitious rhetoric combine to send a clear signal: individuals are in the
          crosshairs.147

While the Yates Memo may signal a greater attention to individual over corporate criminal
liability, Beale notes a significant and ongoing issue: bringing successful prosecutions
against individuals in the corporate setting is notoriously difficult. Shifting away from
corporate criminal liability (particularly to appease public opinion, which Beale opines was
a significant motivation behind the shift in policy reflected in the Yates Memo) may not be
an advisable way forward.148 However, it may be the case that the Yates Memo has little
actual influence on prosecutorial attitudes towards corporate criminal prosecutions.
Koehler, for example, stated in 2015:

          While many will likely view the Yates Memo as articulating new DOJ policy
          it really does not ... [T]he reality is that few DOJ corporate enforcement
          actions result in any related charges against company employees. In the
          FCPA context ... between 2008-2014, 75% of DOJ corporate enforcement
          actions have not (at least yet) resulted in any DOJ charges against company
          employees.149

In 2018, during the Trump Administration, individual prosecutions post-Yates Memo
remained high. However, a "more institution-friendly approach" was adopted. Among
other measures, the Yates Memo was revised to limit the information corporations needed

148 The impact of the Yates Memo and shift to individual accountability is reflected in the self-

program and cooperation requirements [which have been maintained since] are intended to
supplement the existing sentencing guidelines for corporations and the so-called 'Yates Memo' that
addresses individual responsibility - corporations will be required to provide information related to
senior executives, officers, and employees' criminal misconduct to be considered for cooperation

to provide about individuals while still receiving cooperation credit.150 It is predicted that
the Biden Administration may roll back some of these adjustments:

          While the [2018] revisions to its policies leave the DOJ with substantial
          flexibility to grant or decline cooperation credit, require a monitor and
          define its role, and impose appropriate penalties in multiagency
          investigations, financial institutions and other companies should expect the
          new department leadership under Attorney General nominee Merrick
          Garland to closely review these policies and potentially revise them. In light
          of the new administration's anticipated approach to corporate enforcement,
          the DOJ may choose to increase the demands on cooperating institutions
          in providing information about potentially culpable individuals and with
          regard to requiring monitors with a broad mandate and greater frequency.
          [emphasis added]151

Regardless, the landscape for corporate criminal liability in the United States appears to be
in a continued state of oscillation, shifting in emphasis in response to public opinion, the
practical realities of individual prosecutions, scholarly debate, and the point of view of the
political party in power.

      2.3.1 Corporate Criminal Liability: Foreign Subsidiaries

According to Tarun and Tomczak, whether US corporations are directly liable for the acts of
their foreign subsidiaries is somewhat uncertain. They state:152

          While the legislative history and one case indicate that foreign subsidiaries
          of US companies acting on their own and not as agents of a US parent are
          not subject to the anti-bribery provisions ... the Resource Guide to the US
          FCPA states that there are two ways in which a parent company can be liable
          for bribes paid by a subsidiary:

                     First, a parent may have participated sufficiently in the
                     activity to be directly liable for the conduct - as, for
                     example when it directed its subsidiary's misconduct or
                     otherwise directly participated in the bribe scheme.
                     Second, a parent may be held liable for its subsidiary's
                     conduct under traditional agency principles.

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

According to the Resource Guide, control over the subsidiary, both general and in terms of
the specific transaction, is the key factor in determining whether an agency relationship
exists. If the relationship exists, the subsidiary's actions and knowledge are imputed to the
parent.

Tarun and Tomczak state that although the FCPA does not specifically address liability
arising from the behaviour of foreign subsidiaries, there are "at least five" bases in American
law under which a parent corporation could be liable for acts of bribery undertaken by its
foreign subsidiaries:

          First, a US company may be liable for bribery under agency principles if it
          had knowledge of or was willfully blind to the misconduct of its subsidiary.
          Second, a US parent corporation that authorizes, directs, or controls the
          wayward acts of a foreign subsidiary may be liable. Third, a US company
          may be held liable under principles of respondeat superior where its corporate
          veil can be pierced. Fourth, a US Company that takes actions abroad in
          furtherance of a bribery scheme may be found liable under the Act's 1998
          alternative theory of nationality jurisdiction. Fifth, foreign subsidiaries may
          be liable if any act in furtherance of an illegal bribe took place in the United
          States territory.153

In addition, under the accounting provisions of the FCPA, if the records of the parent and
the subsidiary are consolidated for the purposes of filing documents pursuant to the SEC's
mandatory reporting requirements, a parent company may be liable for the accounting
violations of a foreign subsidiary.154

Despite the Resource Guide, the SEC appears to be taking an increasingly liberal view of the
ambit of parent-subsidiary liability. Koehler writes:

          It is relatively common for the SEC to advance a strict liability theory of
          enforcement under the FCPA's books and records and internal controls
          provisions against issuers for subsidiary actions.

          However, in the WAC enforcement action the SEC took it a step further and
          held WAC strictly liable for FCPA anti-bribery violations by WAC de
          Mexico (a former wholly-owned subsidiary).

          Under the heading "The Bribery Scheme," the SEC order contains five
          paragraphs of findings but there is not one finding as to WAC itself.

          It is black-letter law that the legal liability of each distinct corporate entity
          is to be contained within that entity absent a finding of abuse of corporate
          form such as insufficient capitalization, failure to hold annual meetings or
          the like. In short, legal liability does not ordinary hop, skip and jump
          around a multinational company. However, in the WAC enforcement
          action (like certain others in the modern era of FCPA enforcement), the SEC

          advanced the theory that a parent corporation is legally responsible for the
          acts of subsidiary employees absent any allegation or suggestion that the
          parent company was aware of, or participated in, the alleged improper
          conduct. [emphasis added]155

      2.3.2 Successor Liability

After a merger or acquisition, the successor company assumes the predecessor company's
liabilities, including those arising under the FCPA. No liability will be created where there
was none before, however; for example, if the predecessor was outside FCPA jurisdiction, it
will not be retroactively subject to the FCPA after acquisition. Generally, the DOJ will only
pursue FCPA actions against successor companies in extreme, egregious scenarios, such as
the continuation of violations by the successor company.156 This approach balances the
"potential benefits of corporate mergers and acquisitions, particularly when the acquiring
entity has a robust compliance program in place and implements that program as quickly as

155 "Issues To Consider From The World Acceptance Corp. Enforcement Action" (10 August 2020),
online (blog): FCPA Professor <https://fcpaprofessor.com/issues-consider-world-acceptance-corp-
enforcement-action/>. Another example is referenced in Shearman & Sterling's "FCPA Digest", supra
note 150 at 21, which states:

            The SEC's habit of charging parent issuers with violations of the anti-bribery provisions of
            the FCPA for the acts of a subsidiary without establishing that the parent authorized,
            directed, or controlled the subsidiary's corrupt conduct continues to be a problem. Instead
            of applying traditional concepts of corporate liability, the SEC often applies a theory of strict
            liability, taking the position that a subsidiary was ipso facto an agent of its parent.
            Therefore, applying the test for liability applicable to an employee's or agent's actions, any
            illegal act committed within the scope of the employee's or agent's duties, and at least in
            part for the benefit of the corporation results in corporate criminal liability. The latest
            example of this practice seems to be the UTC [United Technologies Corporation]
            enforcement action.

            UTC involved allegations of corrupt payments in a number of countries--Azerbaijan,
            China, Kuwait, South Korea, Pakistan, Thailand, and Indonesia. The SEC's order was clear,
            however, that only the alleged payment of bribes to government officials in Azerbaijan by
            UTC subsidiary Otis Russia violated the antibribery provisions of the FCPA. According to
            the SEC, the remainder of the conduct alleged in the SEC's order violated only the internal
            controls and books-and-records provisions of the FCPA.

            Notably absent from the allegations contained in the SEC's order, however, is any
            indication that United Technologies authorized, directed, or controlled the conduct at Otis
            Russia. Instead, it seems that the best link the SEC could draw between UTC and Otis
            Russia was that "UTC failed to detect the conduct and first learned of it in April 2017"--
            nearly five years after the alleged conduct had commenced. If this is truly the only basis for
            holding UTC liable for the conduct at Otis Russia, then it is the latest example of disregard
            for established limits on corporate criminal liability.

practicable at the merged or acquired entity,"157 with successor liability's aptitude for
addressing attempts to avoid criminal liability through corporate reorganization.158

A 2018 example of successor liability under the FCPA is commented on by Shearman:

          Kinross Gold provides another warning of the risks of successor liability in
          M&A transactions. In this case, Kinross was allegedly aware of inadequate
          internal controls at its two newly acquired subsidiaries even before it closed
          the acquisition and was on warning through internal audits that these issues
          continued post-closing. During this time, the subsidiaries continued to
          make improper payments to local vendors without confirming that the
          vendors provided the services, including after Kinross finally attempted to
          implement policies and adequate procedures at these companies. Kinross
          purportedly knew that the companies it had acquired "lacked an anti-
          corruption compliance program and associated internal accounting
          controls" and required "extensive remediation" but it failed to make the
          necessary remediation and the improper behavior continued and Kinross
          was held responsible.

          Kinross serves as a cautionary tale for acquiring companies, but realistically
          it's a pretty clear case. Based on the SEC's order, the compliance risks
          appear to have been clearly known by Kinross, but the company did
          virtually nothing for at least three or four years after the acquisition to
          address the problems. We should let that serve as a fairly obvious lesson--
          if there are known risks in an acquisition, waiting four years to address
          them is far too long.159

The bottom line, stated by Richard L. Cassin in his blog post referencing the risks of
successor liability (particularly in the post COVID-19 landscape, where "two very different
groups of companies will emerge from the lockdown: thousands with liquidity problems
and uncertain futures, and hundreds with piles of cash and an appetite for growth") is:

          What's most important to know about successor liability is this: No
          compliance program on earth can guarantee that an acquiring company won't be
          prosecuted for the acquired company's prior FCPA violations. [emphasis in

           CHAPTER 3 JURISDICTION, LIABILITY, ACCOMPLICES, & INCHOATE OFFENCES

2.4 UK

According to the traditional principles of corporate criminal liability in the UK, corporations,
partnerships, and unincorporated bodies may be held criminally liable for offences under
section 1, 2, and 6 of the Bribery Act.161 Under UK law, a corporation is its own legal entity
with its own legal personality. This means that the corporation, separately from the natural
persons who perform the activities of the corporation, can be involved in a corrupt
transaction. The corporation may be involved in corrupt transactions either as an offender
or as a victim. A corporation can be convicted of common law and statutory offences,
including offences which require mens rea.162

There are a few ways in which a corporation may be held criminally liable in the UK. If the
offence is strict liability and requires no mens rea, there is no problem attributing liability to
a corporation. A corporation can also be held vicariously liable for the acts of its employees
or agents in situations where a natural person would also be vicariously liable, for example,
where a statute imposes vicarious liability. This means that the acts and state of mind of
employees or agents are attributed to the corporate body.163

For offences that require mens rea and do not allow vicarious liability, corporate liability
depends on the identification principle. If the offence is committed by an officer who is
senior enough to be part of the directing mind and will of the company, and if the offence
was committed within the scope of the offender's authority as a corporate officer, the
offender's acts and state of mind will be deemed those of the company itself. The act does
not need to benefit or intend to benefit the legal person.164 The corporation can be convicted
of an offence without a natural person being prosecuted for that offence. The identification
principle is used to determine corporate liability for offences under sections 1, 2, and 6 of the
Bribery Act, as well as the false accounting offences under the Theft Act.

Because of the need to find subjective fault (mens rea) in one of the company's directing
minds, the identification doctrine is often ineffective in establishing corporate liability.
Firstly, identifying the directing minds of a large multinational corporation can be a
challenge, due to the `diffusion of managerial power,' meaning "a company's layers of
management and decision makers [which] insulate the directing mind and will from any
attribution of intent. These days, the board of a company will not be involved in the day-to-
day decision making."165 Even when the directing minds can be identified, attributing fault
to senior officers presents difficulties. Andrew Ashworth explains that the doctrine "allows
large companies to disassociate themselves from the conduct of their local managers, and

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

thus to avoid criminal liability. Moreover, where a large national or multi-national company
is prosecuted, the identification principle requires the prosecution to establish that one of
the directors or top managers had the required knowledge or culpability. Managers at such
a high level tend to focus on broader policy issues, not working practices."166 As a result, in
cases of bribery committed by a foreign agent in a foreign country to secure business for a
company, it can be very difficult to prove that a senior officer of that company was the
directing mind behind the bribery offence. The identification doctrine also fails to establish
liability for corporate culture, which can develop independently from senior officers at the
highest levels. Further, English law does not allow aggregation of the states of mind of more
than one person in the corporation in order to satisfy mens rea requirements, and in modern
corporations, decision-making is more often generated through overarching procedures and
policies more-so than the choices of particular individuals.167 Thus, historically it was very
difficult for corporations to be convicted of bribery. Indeed, at the inception of the UK Bribery
Act, James Maton said, "there has never been a successful prosecution in England of a
company for bribery."168 Additionally, Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner LLP observe:

Anneka Randhawa recently noted that "[p]rior to 2010, UK bribery laws were considered
inadequate.... This was evidenced in the UK's failure to prosecute a single case of bribery against a
company," suggesting that the simplification of corporate criminal liability in section 7 is one of the
Act's key achievements: Anneka Randhawa & Lucy Rogers, "Reflections on the UK Bribery Act (Part
I): The Act's Key Achievements" (14 June 2021), online: White & Case LLP

English case law has generally defined "directing mind" quite narrowly: See Tesco Supermarkets Ltd v
Nattras, [1972] AC 153 (HL); Director General of Fair Trading v Pioneer Concrete (UK) Ltd, [1995] 1 AC

Jefferson, "Corporate Criminal Liability in the 1990s" (2000) 64 J Crim L 106 argues that there has
been some expansion of the directing mind test, E Ferran, "Corporate Attribution and the Directing

            clear from the decisions in Pioneer Concrete and in Meridian that the courts now have the
            latitude to interpret statutes imposing corporate criminal liability as imposing it on different
            bases, depending on what will best fulfil the statutory purpose in question" ["the special
            rule"]. Consequently we concluded,

                        There is no pressing need for statutory reform or replacement of the identification
                        doctrine. That doctrine should only be applied as the basis for judging corporate
                        conduct in the criminal law if the aims of the statute in question will be best
                        fulfilled by applying it... We encourage the courts not to presume that the
                        identification doctrine applies when interpreting the scope of statutory criminal
                        offences applicable to companies.

           CHAPTER 3 JURISDICTION, LIABILITY, ACCOMPLICES, & INCHOATE OFFENCES

          [t]he [identification] principle has the perverse effect of making it easier to
          prosecute smaller companies. It will always be easier to link the intent of a
          smaller company's directing mind and will with the criminal act. This
          creates an unbalanced corporate criminal landscape that favours larger
          entities. As a matter of legal principle this is an unfortunate outcome.169

This ramification of the identification principle is hardly compatible with the goal of
addressing global corruption. That is, a doctrine that provides for the ease of prosecuting
small companies does little to further the more important objective of prosecuting massive
corruption by multinational and powerful entities.

The difficulty of attributing liability to corporations, especially large multinational
corporations, prompted criticism in Phase 1 and Phase 2 Evaluations of the UK by the OECD
WGB. The UK has addressed the difficulties of the identification doctrine by creating
offences that impose a duty on companies, for example, in the Corporate Manslaughter and
Corporate Homicide Act of 2007170 and Criminal Finances Act 2017 (the latter albeit in a limited
manner).171 The imposition of a corporate duty bypasses the difficulty of establishing
culpability on the part of a controlling mind in the company. Section 7 of the Bribery Act is

            However, that ambition has not been realised. In fact, the courts have strongly reaffirmed
            the identification doctrine as the primary rule of attribution. In Serious Fraud Office v
            Barclays, Lord Justice Davis ... held that the "special rule" of attribution only comes into
            play when insistence on the primary rule would defeat Parliament's intention ...

            That is to say, rather than "not presuming" that the identification principles applies (as we
            had proposed), and only applying it if this would best fulfil the aims of the statute, Barclays
            holds that it is presumed that the identification doctrine does apply, and can only be
            displaced if applying it would defeat the aims of the statute.

            ...

            Barclays makes the law more restrictive than under Tesco v Nattrass. The judges in Tesco
            appeared to accept that a Managing Director was likely to constitute a DMW as the
            company's ego without needing to look whether the extent of delegation made them its
            alter ego. Barclays suggests that it is not enough to identify one or more directors with the
            requisite intent. Rather, it is also necessary to show that the board collectively possessed the
            necessary mens rea or that those identified directors had sufficient de jure authority to
            engage in the conduct on the behalf of the board of directors.

            SFO v Barclays therefore can be seen as signalling the reversal of a period in which the
            courts had adopted a much more flexible approach to attribution of criminal liability [and]
            arguably makes the law harder to apply to a large corporation than Tesco envisaged.... Our
            conclusion in 2010 that there was no pressing need for reform of the identification doctrine
            was based on the trajectory of legal development.... In the light of Barclays, the assumptions
            on which that conclusion was based no longer hold true.

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

another example of this form of corporate liability, sometimes referred to as "failure
to prevent" or "FTP" offences, further discussed in Section 2.4.1.

Since the adoption of the FTP offence in section 7, there has been a "growing appetite" for
broader implementation of this kind of offence in other areas of economic crime, such as
money laundering.172 This may indicate a broader shift that may be anticipated in UK
corporate criminal law.173

Some commentators argue that FTP offences, however, should not overtake prosecution of
substantive offences. The Law Commission recognized this critique:

          [A] criticism of "failure to prevent" offences as an alternative to prosecuting
          the substantive offence is that these offences do not carry the same
          culpability (although the company might in appropriate cases be convicted
          of the substantive offence). As Dsouza puts it,

                     Bespoke corporate offences that are used to sidestep questions of
                     attribution also carry bespoke labels.... At least part of why we
                     want to hold corporations criminally responsible relates to a
                     conviction's morally loaded content.... Shifting the locus of
                     culpability away from the objectionable conduct weakens the basis
                     for the public and morally loaded condemnation that is the
                     currency of a conviction.174

The Commission further noted that, if FTP offences are to be implemented more broadly,
they would need to consider the scope of offences, whether the offence is to be limited to
associated persons or may be extended to the use of third-party platforms or financial
services, and what defences ought to be available.175 Alternatively, the Law Commission also
stated that the SFO has proposed that FTPs could overtake the identification principle all
together:

          Under this model, where a substantive offence was committed by an
          associated person, to obtain or retain business or a business advantage for
          a company or otherwise to benefit the company financially, the conduct
          would be attributed to the company and the company would be guilty of
          the substantive offence.176

           CHAPTER 3 JURISDICTION, LIABILITY, ACCOMPLICES, & INCHOATE OFFENCES

      2.4.1 Bribery Act Section 7

Section 7 creates a new strict liability offence of failure of a commercial organization to
prevent bribery. It is triggered when a person associated with a "relevant commercial
organization" (bodies corporate or partnerships) bribes another person for the benefit of the
commercial organization. A conviction under section 7 does not require a conviction for a
section 1, 2 or 6 offence, but there must be sufficient evidence that the act of bribery did
occur.

A codified defence to the charge exists. The organization is exonerated if it can prove, on a
balance of probabilities, that notwithstanding the actions of the associated person, it had
adequate procedures in place to prevent such persons from engaging in bribery.

Section 7 defines the scope of this new offence in the following words:

          (1) A relevant commercial organisation ("C") is guilty of an offence under
                this section if a person ("A") associated with C bribes another person
                intending--

                (a) to obtain or retain business for C, or
                (b) to obtain or retain an advantage in the conduct of business for

                     C.177

Under section 7, a commercial organization may be found guilty of an offence if anyone
associated with the company's business participates in bribery, unless the organization has
adequate procedures in place to prevent the bribery. The offence can be made out even if the
controlling minds of the organization were completely unaware of the bribery. To be
"associated" with the organization, person A must be a "person who performs services for
or on behalf of"178 the organization. The capacity in which he or she performs these services
does not matter; for example, person A may be an employee, agent or subsidiary, and there
need not be a formal contract or in fact any degree of control.179 Person A does not need to
have a close connection with the UK and may be an individual, a body corporate or a
partnership. If person A is a subsidiary, the parent company will only be liable if the
subsidiary acts in the parent's interest, or phrased differently, they must be performing
services on behalf of the parent, not simply on their own account (as the "offence has been
specifically designed to prevent parent companies from avoiding liability under the cover
of separate subsidiary companies"180). If the subsidiary bribes in its own interests, the parent
will not be liable, even if the subsidiary is wholly owned by that parent.181

The phrase "bribes another person" means that to be convicted under section 7, person A is
or would be guilty of an offence under sections 1 or 6 (whether prosecuted or not), or would
be guilty of such an offence if section 12(2)(c) and (4) dealing with jurisdiction to prosecute

177 Interestingly, there is no corresponding offence of failure to prevent the taking of a bribe.

were omitted.182 Furthermore, the person will be deemed to have committed the offence if
their conduct amounted to aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring the offence.183

Section 7 applies to "relevant commercial organisations," that is, companies incorporated in
the UK or partnerships formed in the UK, as well as to bodies corporate and partnerships
incorporated or formed anywhere and carrying on a business or part of a business in the
UK. As Stephen Gentle notes, the careful drafting of "carries on a business," rather than
simply "carries on business," is reflective of the wide jurisdiction of the offence.184 The mere
business presence of an overseas entity in the UK, irrespective of whether business is
actually carried out in the UK, is enough to fulfill the jurisdictional requirements of the
offence.185 That being said, the Government intends a "common sense approach" and has
suggested that organizations without a "demonstrable business presence in the United
Kingdom"186 will not be caught by this section.

It should be noted that the Bribery Act contains no provision specifically insulating person A
from secondary liability in respect to the offence under section 7 (in contrast to, for example,
the offence in the UK of corporate manslaughter).187 However, person A is already guilty of
the intentional offence of bribery under sections 1 or 6, so it would be somewhat pointless
to also charge or convict person A of the strict liability offence under section 7, where person
A's conduct of aiding and abetting the section 7 offence is exactly the same conduct that
constitutes the section 1 or section 6 offence.

Section 7(2) states that a full defence to the charge is available if the company can prove on
a balance of probabilities that it had adequate procedures in place and followed those
procedures at the time the bribery occurred in order to prevent associated persons from
engaging in bribery. For more information on the adequate procedures defence, refer to
Chapter 2, Section 2.4.3(i).

According to Celia Wells, the significance of this relatively new offence to UK law "cannot
be over emphasized,"188 and as shown, its presence is already foreshadowing significant
potential changes to corporate criminal liability in the UK more generally (or at the very

182 Section 12 deals with the territorial application of the Bribery Act. If the offence takes place outside
the UK but would constitute an offence if committed within the UK, and the individual in question
has a close connection with the UK, the person may still be charged under sections 1, 2, and 6.
Sections 12(2)(c) and 12(4) deal with the "close connection to the UK"; therefore persons associated
with commercial organisations can be found to be "bribing another person" for the purposes of the
organisation failing to prevent bribery, even if the activity took place outside of the UK and the
individual had no close connection with the UK, so long as the organisation fell within the definition
of a commercial organization.

least, for economic crime). The provision places important obligations on companies to
proactively prevent corruption within their organization. Wells views the provision as key
to ensuring corporate accountability for bribery. However, the OECD WGB's Phase 3 Report
(March 2012) notes that the section 7 offence does not completely eliminate the limitations
of the UK's narrow identification doctrine.189 If the "associated person" is a subsidiary or
another company, the identification doctrine is still necessary to determine whether the
associated person committed bribery. That said, this issue was not raised again in the Phase
4 Report, where the OECD provides the following commentary on the identification doctrine
(and UK's corporate criminal liability in the Bribery Act):

          Since Phase 3, while criminal liability for foreign bribery has been imposed
          on six companies ... the various concepts of corporate liability for foreign
          bribery have not been interpreted by the courts. Section 7 of the Bribery Act
          was the basis for criminal liability in four cases - Rolls Royce, Sweett Group,
          Standard Bank and XYZ Limited. Sweett Group pleaded guilty. Rolls Royce,
          Standard Bank and XYZ entered into DPAs. Accordingly, the defence of
          adequate procedures has not been tested in the courts. The identification
          theory was the basis for criminal liability in Rolls Royce (some of the
          offending occurred prior to the Bribery Act) and in XYZ Limited (the
          offending in that case occurred from 2004-2012, spanning both the old and
          the new UK foreign bribery regimes) and Smith & Ouzman. These cases were
          resolved through DPAs and, for Smith & Ouzman by a finding of guilt by
          the court. Although the Smith & Ouzman case involved a contested trial in
          which the legal person and natural persons accused pleaded not guilty, the
          case does not advance the identification theory of corporate liability because
          the company directors themselves committed the bribery. Consequently,
          there have been no relevant developments with regard to the identification
          theory in foreign bribery.190

Additionally, the OECD did note the possible disproportionate effects of the identification
theory on small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs), but these seem to be addressed
through prosecutorial discretion:

          SMEs may face other challenges that are not as apparent for large
          multinational corporations. While these challenges are a horizontal issue
          across many WGB members, they are perhaps particularly acute in the UK
          context because of the specificities of the systems of corporate liability.
          These challenges include limited ability to find resources to defend foreign
          bribery charges. Furthermore, SMEs are arguably exposed to greater risk of
          law enforcement, since it is easier to establish the corporate liability of an
          SME under the identification doctrine because the "directing mind of the
          entity" would usually be much easier to establish than in a vast, complex

          corporate structure.... Civil society and lawyers at the on-site visit also
          urged law enforcement to resist any temptation to only pursue these easier
          targets and to be careful to also pursue major corporates and their senior
          officials. The sanctions imposed on Rolls-Royce since the on-site visit and
          the fact that the SFO is looking into allegations of foreign bribery involving
          other major household brand companies, including Airbus and
          GlaxoSmithKline, suggest the SFO is serious about pursuing major
          corporates and is not targeting only SMEs. Nevertheless, support from the
          UK Government to SMEs to better understand and develop adequate anti-
          corruption compliance is crucial.191

Section 7 has received criticism for being overly broad. Jon Jordan, Senior Investigations
Counsel with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Unit of the US SEC, believes the "provision is
both revolutionary and dangerous."192 That said, as the Bribery Act reaches its 10th birthday,
commentators have noted that the provision has "had a significant impact on corporate
culture in the UK"193 through its rejection of the identification principle, reversal of the
burden proof, and capacity to lower the evidential bar for prosecution:

          This fundamental change prompted many organisations to completely
          overhaul their compliance programmes, with a view to preventing bribery
          by associated persons, and therefore being able to rely on the adequate
          procedures defence provided by the Act should they fail to do so. As the
          OECD noted, the Bribery Act has "prompted substantial progress" in the
          adoption of anti-corruption measures, which are "well advanced" in UK
          companies. On that measure, before assessing prosecutions and convictions
          under the Act, it may be judged a success. [footnotes omitted]194

Alison Lepeuple et al. go on to note that if the success of section 7 were to be measured by
the number of prosecutions, then there is much less to celebrate. Only two companies were
convicted of section 7 offences as of their May 2021 blog post, and this lack of enforcement
may prompt corporations to "cut corners":

          In light of these figures, companies that spent significant sums adopting
          stronger anti-bribery programmes ten years ago might reconsider whether
          the cost of maintaining or improving these programmes is proportionate to
          the risk of prosecution.

          In an OECD study on the drivers of anti-corruption compliance
          internationally, over 80% of respondents stated that avoiding prosecution

          or protecting their company's reputation was a "significant" or "very
          significant" factor in their decision to adopt an anti-bribery programme. If
          prosecution does not appear to be a realistic prospect, motivation to
          maintain high standards in such programmes may start to wane,
          particularly among smaller organisations.

          A March 2012 survey by FTI Consulting found that 29% of respondents
          were "risk takers" who were prepared to contravene the Act to win new
          business, while 20% of respondents were "confident" that they could do so
          "without getting caught." These more cavalier companies and individuals
          are unlikely to have been cowed into compliance by prosecution figures to
          date. [footnotes omitted]195

On the other hand, there has been more enforcement through DPAs, particularly in cases
that are significant in scale.196

Additionally, the lack of case law, definitions in the Act or Government guidance on
"adequate procedures" makes it difficult for even motivated corporations to comply with
the Act. The 2012 Guidance is too "high-level" and at times, confusing.197 Notably, the US also
considered codifying this type of compliance defence, but ultimately rejected this approach.
Instead, the US FCPA places positive obligations on companies to make and keep accurate

195 Ibid.
196 For example, Lepeuple et al, ibid, state:

            The six section 7 DPAs have resulted in financial sanctions totalling over a billion pounds.
            In contrast, one of the two section 7 convictions resulted in a financial penalty of £2.25
            million following a guilty plea and the other, prosecuted by the CPS, resulted in an absolute
            discharge--the only outcome possible against a dormant company. The authorities appear
            content to reserve their prosecutorial teeth for the lowest-hanging fruit.

            It would be surprising to see the SFO deviate from this pattern. Against the vulnerable, it
            can afford to expend the energy required for the hunt, confident of the kill or of finding its
            prey dead on arrival. Against more robust targets, a more circumspect approach is required.
            Through the DPA process, the SFO can hedge against the risk that a lengthy and expensive
            investigation will fail to yield results by passing the investigative burden to the company
            and, on current form, securing lucrative financial penalties, never mind the lack of
            convictions.

197 Lepeuple et al, ibid, write:

            One confusing example from the guidance is the suggestion that "flights and
            accommodation to allow foreign public officials to meet with senior executives of a UK
            commercial organisation in New York ... and some reasonable hospitality ... such as fine
            dining and attendance at a baseball match" are unlikely to fall within the scope of the
            Act. The OECD noted that this was "this is a high-risk activity under almost all
            circumstances." In other words, the guidance is not only vague but also potentially
            unreliable. Commercial organisations seeking to comply with the Act are left unable to
            ascertain whether their existing or proposed compliance programmes meet the required
            standard.

                                                                                                          289

paper, "Corruption in Canada: Reviewing Practices from Abroad to Improve Our
Response," the compliance defence is described as follows:

          The Affirmative Compliance Defences

          The compliance defence provides that corporations will not be held
          vicariously liable for a violation of the foreign corruption act by its
          employees or agents if the company established procedures reasonably
          designed to prevent and detect such violations by employees and agents.
          Generally this refers to employees and not officers or directors. Such a
          defence is an affirmative defence for corporations faced with possible
          criminal charges if the corporation can present "good faith efforts" to
          achieve compliance with the laws, usually demonstrated by corporate
          compliance programmes. This defence recognises that despite best efforts
          and with the utmost diligence, corporations can still find themselves the
          subject of criminal prosecutions. [footnotes omitted]198

Another development in the UK to note is the lack of enforcement against individuals in the
UK through the Bribery Act, suggesting a significant emphasis on corporate liability for
bribery. While the United States has repeatedly stated their focus on individual
accountability (as evidenced in the Yates Memo), and in 2018, more explicitly created a more
institution-friendly environment, there is a striking disconnect "between corporate
resolutions under the [UK Bribery] Act and the subsequent prosecution of individuals
connected to corporate misconduct."199

2.5 Canada

Pursuant to section 2 of CFPOA, the offence provisions apply to "persons," as defined in
section 2 of the Criminal Code. Section 2 of the Criminal Code states that "person" includes an
organization, which is defined as:

          (a) a public body, body corporate, society, company, firm, partnership,
                trade union or municipality, or

          (b) an association of persons that

            The SFO prosecuted three individuals connected to the misconduct described in each of the
            Güralp Systems Ltd and Sarclad Ltd DPAs. All were acquitted. The DPAs with Airline
            Services, Rolls-Royce and Standard Bank did not lead to the prosecution of any individuals.
            To date, no individuals have been successfully prosecuted under the Bribery Act for
            conduct linked to a DPA. Given that the underlying premise of the DPAs is that offences
            have been committed under sections 1 or 6, this lack of convictions is noteworthy. [footnotes

                (i) is created for a common purpose,

                (ii) has an operational structure, and

                (iii) holds itself out to the public as an association of persons.

Therefore, companies and other organizations are considered "persons" under CFPOA and
the Criminal Code and may be prosecuted for CFPOA and Criminal Code offences. It should
also be noted that by knowingly engaging in corruption offences on three or more occasions,
companies meet the definition of "criminal organization" under section 467.1, and can
therefore be prosecuted for the additional criminal organization offences in the Criminal
Code. Notably, the broad definition of "organization" extends liability to types of
organizations that do not have the status of legal persons in the same way that corporations
do. It is also notable that the CFPOA, unlike the FCPA, does not have a civil component--it
solely addresses criminal conduct.200

Prior to 2004, corporate criminal liability was based on the common law principle of the
directing mind (also known as the "identification doctrine"). In 2003, the Canadian
Government amended the Criminal Code and replaced the common law "directing minds"
doctrine with a statutory scheme for corporate criminal liability. This new statutory scheme
uses a much broader and more flexible definition of which officials in a corporation are to
be "identified" as the corporation in respect to their acts, omissions and states of mind. Via
section 34(2) of the federal Interpretation Act, the new Criminal Code corporate liability scheme
also applies to CFPOA offences. Section 22.1 of the Criminal Code widens the scope of
corporate criminal liability in the context of criminal and penal negligence offences, and
section 22.2 provides the test for other mens rea-based offences. Section 22.2 is the relevant
section of the Criminal Code for determining corporate liability under the CFPOA since those
offences require the prosecutor to prove subjective fault. It reads as follows:

          22.2 In respect of an offence that requires the prosecution to prove fault--
          other than negligence--an organization is a party to the offence if, with the
          intent at least in part to benefit the organization, one of its senior officers

                (a) acting within the scope of their authority, is a party to the offence;
                (b) having the mental state required to be a party to the offence and

                     acting within the scope of their authority, directs the work of other
                     representatives of the organization so that they do the act or make
                     the omission specified in the offence; or
                (c) knowing that a representative of the organization is or is about to
                     be a party to the offence, does not take all reasonable measures to
                     stop them from being a party to the offence.

This statutory scheme for corporate liability for crimes which require subjective fault still
relies on the identification theory. However, the common law concept of "directing minds"

has been replaced with the broader concept of "senior officers." A "senior officer" is defined
in the Criminal Code as follows:

          a representative who plays an important role in the establishment of an
          organization's policies or is responsible for managing an important aspect
          of the organization's activities and, in the case of a body corporate, includes
          a director, its chief executive officer and its chief financial officer.

"Representative" is defined to mean "a director, partner, employee, member, agent or
contractor of the organization."

The term "senior officer" is broader than the common law directing minds concept as it
includes persons who are responsible for managing an important aspect of the company's
activities. Under the old test, in order for a person to be considered a directing mind, they
had to be more than a manager of an important aspect of the company's activities; they also
had to have the authority to design or implement corporate policy.201 In practice, this made
establishing corporate criminal liability very difficult.202

Despite these adjustments to the directing minds doctrine and thus, corporate criminal
liability, there has been little enforcement against corporations. Ultimately, "the
amendments have not been very successful, and corporate crime continues to primarily be
an issue at the locus of the accused individual."203 Further, Lincoln Caylor and Nathan
Shaheen observe:

          Canadian law enforcement has also focused primarily on individual
          prosecution. As such, the American approach wherein corporations have an
          incentive to conduct internal investigations and aid law enforcement in
          uncovering corporate crime does not necessarily apply to the `background'
          structure of corporate criminal law in Canada.204

Nevertheless, the new definition of "senior officer," the terms "managing" and "an
important aspect of the organization's activities" require further examination. So far, there
have been very few cases that have interpreted these key parts of the definition of "senior

officer."205 In R v Metron Construction Corporation, the Ontario Court of Appeal imposed a
fine of CDN$750,000 on the accused corporation for criminal negligence causing death
contrary to section 221 of the Criminal Code.206 The negligence charge arose out of a
workplace accident caused primarily by serious negligence on the part of the site supervisor
and the foreman. The foreman died in the accident along with three other workers. Metron
Construction plead guilty to one count of criminal negligence causing death under section
221 of the Criminal Code. No doubt the guilty plea was premised on the conclusion that if
they disputed criminal liability at trial, they would be convicted on the basis of the new test
for criminal liability under section 22.1 and the new duty in section 217.1 of the Criminal
Code, which requires persons who have the authority to direct the work of others "to take all
reasonable steps to prevent bodily harm" to those persons. In a subsequent trial, the site
supervisor was found guilty of four counts of criminal negligence causing death.207 As noted,
had Metron plead not guilty, undoubtedly the court would have held that the site supervisor
was a "senior officer" and therefore the senior officer's criminal negligence was also
Metron's criminal negligence. Under the narrower "directing minds" test applied in Canada
before the 2004 amendments, it is highly unlikely that the site supervisor would have been
held to be a directing mind of Metron since he had not been delegated "governing executive
authority" over a part of the company business.208 As Jeremy Warning, Cheryl Edwards, and
Shane Todd note, the case demonstrates how sections 22.1 and 22.2 of the Criminal Code
expand the criminal liability of corporations in Canada to include criminal conduct by
employees who are not in an executive management position, but nevertheless hold a
significant amount of "localized responsibility" within the corporation.209 As a result, if a
company delegates responsibility to a foreign agent to engage in an important aspect of the
company's business, the agent is likely to be deemed a senior officer and his or her bribery
could be imputed to the company, even if no one else in the company knew the foreign agent
was bribing officials.210

NJ No 230 (NL Prov Ct), and R v ACS Public Sector Solutions Inc, [2007] AJ No 1310 (Alta Prov Ct), the
courts did not apply sections 22.1 or 22.2 since the alleged offences occurred before Bill C-45 came
into force on April 1, 2004. In R v Watts and Hydro Kleen Services, [2005] AJ No 568, R v Niko Resources
Ltd, 2011 CarswellAlta 2521 (Alta QB), and R v Griffiths Energy International, 2013 AJ No 412 (QB), all
three companies plead guilty. The acts of bribery in those three cases all came from the very top
officers of the companies, and therefore the companies would have been convicted on the basis of
section 22.1 of the Criminal Code had the companies not plead guilty.

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

In R c Pétroles Global Inc,211 the accused company was convicted of price-fixing under the
federal Competition Act.212 The company operated 317 gas stations in Ontario, Quebec and
New Brunswick. A regional manager (Payette) managed over 200 gas stations in Quebec
and New Brunswick and six subordinate territory managers who were responsible for their
portion of those 200 stations. The regional manager and two of the territorial managers were
involved in the price fixing. At the preliminary inquiry, the judge held that all three were
"senior officers" on the ground that each of them managed an "important aspect of the
company's activities."213 At trial, Justice Toth found that the regional manager was definitely
a senior officer and therefore his actions and state of mind were the actions and state of mind
of the company. Justice Toth held that it was therefore unnecessary to decide whether the
two territorial managers were also "senior officers" and he expressly declined to rule on that
issue. Justice Toth did note that the definition of senior officer involves a functional analysis
that goes beyond the mere title "manager." The management under consideration must
involve an important aspect of the company's activities. Since that case, commentators seem
to accept that mid-level employees who have significant managerial responsibility may be
considered "senior officers."214

Under section 22.2(a), quoted above, a corporation may be criminally liable if a senior officer
acting within the scope of their authority is a party to a CFPOA offence (this would include
situations where the senior officer is a party to an offence by virtue of aiding or abetting
another in the commission of an offence). In addition, the acts of the senior officer must have
been done with the intention, at least in part, of benefiting the corporation. Section 22.2(b),
quoted above, does not appear to expand the liability of corporations beyond the combined
effect of section 22.2(a) and the common law doctrine of innocent agents.215

215 This same point is made in Darcy Macpherson, "Extending Corporate Criminal Liability: Some
Thoughts on Bill C-45" (2004) 30 Man LJ 253 at 262. He explains the redundant nature of section
22.2(b) as follows:

     In the end, I believe that paragraph 22.2(b) is redundant. If the senior officer
     directs another representative to commit the actus reus, and the other
     representative does so with the requisite fault element, then the other
     representative commits the offence and the senior officer abets the other
     representative. Both are parties to the offence and are thus liable. As long as the
     senior officer acts within the scope of his or her authority, paragraph 22.2(a) is

294                                                                                                          2022
           CHAPTER 3 JURISDICTION, LIABILITY, ACCOMPLICES, & INCHOATE OFFENCES

Section 22.2(c), however, does significantly expand the law. Under the common law
directing minds doctrine, it was not clear to what extent, if any, a company could be held
liable for its omission to take action to prevent bribery. However, this is no longer the case
under section 22.2(c). A senior officer's failure to take reasonable steps to stop an employee's
offence can now attach liability to the corporation for that offence. Under the Canadian
criminal law, citizens are not guilty of an offence for failing to try to stop it or failing to report
it, unless the law places a specific duty on specific people in specific circumstances to take
reasonable steps to stop the commission of the crime. Section 22.2(c) places obligations on
company managers and other senior officers to take all reasonable measures to stop others
connected with the organization from being parties to an offence when they are aware that
an offence is occurring or is about to occur. This requires a significant level of cooperation
among senior officers and encourages timely reporting of any violations. As Darcy
Macpherson notes, if a senior officer of one department became aware that a representative
reporting to another department intended to offer a bribe to a foreign public official, the fact
that the senior officer might have no managerial powers within that department is
irrelevant; the corporation will be criminally liable unless the senior officer takes all
reasonable measures to stop the bribery.216 Macpherson suggests that reporting up the chain
of command, rather than requiring outside reporting to police, should satisfy the "all
reasonable measures" requirement; otherwise some senior officers may be placed in conflicts
of interest. However, whether the law requires external reporting is not clear.217 When
determining whether a senior officer took all reasonable measures, courts will also likely
consider factors relevant to the due diligence defence, such as industry standards and risk
management techniques.218

Unlike section 7 of the UK Bribery Act, section 22.2(c) stops short of prescribing positive
obligations to prevent wrongdoing on behalf of company representatives. Section 22.2(c) is
only implicated when a senior officer "knows" the representative is or is about to become a
party to an offence or when the senior officer is willfully blind to this. It does not include
instances when a senior officer is recklessly or negligently unaware that bribery or false
accounting is taking place within the corporation.

Additionally, it is likely that a parent company will be liable for its subsidiary's involvement
in bribery:

              satisfied and there is no need to resort to paragraph 22.2(b). If, on the other
              hand, the senior officer directs another representative to commit the actus reus
              and the other representative does so without the requisite fault element, then
              the other representative is an "innocent agent". The innocent agent is ignored
              for the purposes of the actus reus, and the senior officer would commit the
              offence. In either case, subsection 21(1) of the Code would make the senior
              officer a party to the offence (by virtue of paragraph 21(1)(c) in the former case,
              or by virtue of paragraph 21(1)(a) in the latter). In my view, paragraph 22.2(b)
              does not expand the conditions for corporate criminal liability.

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

          [T]he relevant provisions of the Criminal Code and the CFPOA impute
          liability in most instances upon anyone who "directly or indirectly"
          commits an offence contrary to the Act. The court may find that a parent
          company has indirectly committed an offence if its subsidiary is involved
          in bribery. This will be decided on a case-by-case basis. A parent company
          could also be found liable for aiding and abetting or counseling an offence
          committed by a subsidiary under the Criminal Code.219

Insofar as successor liability is concerned, McMillan LLP states the following:

          Whether the acquirer of a business can be held liable for pre-acquisition
          conduct of a corporation depends upon the manner in which the transaction
          is effected. In share acquisitions and amalgamations, the potential liabilities
          of the acquired corporation continue to exist. However, in an asset
          acquisition, it will be necessary to assess the contract between the parties to
          determine whether such potential liabilities were assumed by the purchaser
          or retained by the vendor.220

3. PARTY OR ACCOMPLICE LIABILITY

In most legal systems, the person who gives a bribe and the person who receives a bribe are
referred to as the principal offenders. But most legal systems also criminalize the conduct of
persons who aid (assist), abet (encourage) or counsel (solicit, incite or procure) the principal
offender in the commission of the offence. These persons are referred to as parties,
accomplices or secondary parties to an offence. In the US, the UK, and Canada, these
secondary parties are deemed guilty of the same offence as the principal offender. They are
also liable for the same punishments as the principal offender. The actual sentence imposed
will depend on the degree of involvement and the degree of responsibility of each offender.
Some civil law countries treat secondary parties differently. German law, for instance,
punishes a person who incites an offence (a solicitor) in the same way as it punishes a
perpetrator of the offence if he or she intentionally induces the perpetrator to commit the
offence. A person who intentionally assists the principal (a facilitator) in the commission of
the offence is criminally liable, but his or her sentence will be less severe than that of a

     Canadian courts recognize the "corporate veil" but may pierce the corporate veil,
     exposing the parent corporation to criminal liability for the acts of its subsidiary, where
     it is established that: (i) the subsidiary corporation is merely the alter ego of the parent
     corporation, and (ii) the corporation was created for, or is being used for, a fraudulent or
     improper purpose.

principal.221 While virtually all countries criminalize some form of accomplice liability, there
are both significant and subtle differences between legal systems with respect to accomplice
liability.

3.1 UNCAC

UNCAC requires State Parties to criminalize acts of secondary participation in the offences
set out in UNCAC in accordance with the State Party's domestic criminal law. Party liability
is addressed in Article 27(1), which states:

          Each State Party shall adopt such legislative and other measures as may be
          necessary to establish as a criminal offence, in accordance with its domestic
          law, participation in any capacity such as an accomplice, assistant or
          instigator in an offence established in accordance with this Convention.

Note that Article 27(1) is a mandatory requirement for State Parties and that it requires
criminalization of "participation in any capacity." For more on UNCAC's treatment of party
liability, see Cecily Rose, Michael Kubiciel and Oliver Landwehr's United Nations Convention
Against Corruption: A Commentary (Oxford University Press, 2019) at 287-291.

3.2 OECD Convention

Similarly, the OECD Convention mandates that those who are complicit in the act of bribing
a foreign public official must be held liable. Article 1(2) requires that each State Party "shall
take any measures necessary to establish that complicity in, including incitement, aiding and
abetting, or authorization of an act of bribery of a foreign public official shall be a criminal
offence."

3.3 US

Under section 2 of US Federal Criminal Law (18 USC § 2), an individual, corporation or other
legal entity who "aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces or procures" the commission of
an offense or "willfully causes an act to be done which if directly performed by him or
another would be an offense" is guilty of that offence and "is punishable as a principal." In
this sense, the liability of the aider, abettor, etc., is derivative--it is based on the offense
committed by the principal offender. The aider, abettor, etc., is sometimes referred to as a
secondary party to distinguish him or her from the principal offender; but, in law the
principal offender and the secondary offender are guilty of the same offence. Section 2 of the
US Code applies to all federal offenses including the bribery offences in the FCPA. For
further discussion of corporations as principal offender or aider, abettor or counsellor,
see Section 2.3.

systems, see Markus Dubber, Criminalizing Complicity: a Comparative Analysis (2007) 5 J Intl Crim Just

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

There is a limit, however, on the reach of accomplice liability. This is called the "Gebardi
principle."222 Arising from Gebardi v United States,223 accomplice liability is limited where
Congress demonstrates an affirmative intent to shield accomplices from criminal liability.224
Some suggest that the "traditional bases for secondary liability" are being used by the DOJ
to "stretch the [FCPA]'s extraterritorial application even further" in recent cases.225 The
subject of the charge may not have ever set foot in the United States nor have they taken
action in the United States, but instead have acted as an accomplice to another person subject
to liability under the FCPA.

The DOJ has taken the position that common law allows secondary liability when the statute
is silent.226 In Hoskins, the Second Circuit did not accept this argument, finding that imposing
liability on the subject of the charge was against the principle of extraterritoriality, and that
accomplice liability could not be used to extend the FCPA's extraterritorial reach. According
to Stephanie Teplin and Harry Sandick, amongst other points, the Second Circuit in Hoskins
held:

          Independent of the legislative history, the presumption against
          extraterritoriality would be enough to support the court's finding. Because
          some provisions of the FCPA expressly have extraterritorial application, the
          presumption works to "limit those provisions to their terms." (Quoting RJR
          Nabisco, Inc. v. European Cmty., 136 S. Ct. 2090, 2102 (2016) (alterations
          omitted).) Because the FCPA only imposes liability on non-agent foreign
          nationals if they are physically present in the United States, the conspiracy
          and complicity statutes cannot be used to expand the law's extraterritorial
          reach. 227

In US v Firtash,228 however, the DOJ was successful in arguing that Seventh Circuit precedent
was inconsistent with Hoskins. In the issue of the failure to state an offence regarding both
the conspiracy and aiding and abetting charges, the Seventh Circuit did not follow Hoskins:

          [A]lthough the Seventh Circuit has not yet ruled on this precise question,
          its disagreement with the Second Circuit's approach in Hoskins is evident
          from a pair of existing cases discussing exceptions to secondary liability:

3.4 UK

Section 8 of the Accessories and Abettors Act 1861, as amended by the Criminal Law Act 1977,
provides that anyone "who aids, abets, counsels or procures" the commission of any
indictable UK offence is liable and punishable for that offence as a principal offender.231
Therefore, anyone who, by an act or omission of a legal duty, assists or encourages the
commission of an offence under the Bribery Act will be punished in the same way as the
principal offender. The accessory must intend to assist the principal offender and must have
knowledge of the essential elements of the principal offender's offence.232 Voluntary
attendance at the scene of the crime and a failure to stop the crime are not necessarily
sufficient to constitute an act of assistance.233 The actual breadth of aiding and abetting,
insofar as causation is concerned, is unclear.234

A recent development in English criminal law is the abolition of parasitic accessory liability
through R v Jogee; Ruddock v The Queen [2016] UKSC 8.235 Previously, liability was extended
to all persons who belonged to a common unlawful purpose (sometimes called a joint
venture) for further offences that are committed by one member of that group in carrying
out the common unlawful purpose, provided these further offences were a reasonably
foreseeable consequence of carrying out the unlawful purpose. In particular:

          The Court in R v Jogee held that Chan Wing-Siu [[1985] AC 168] took a wrong
          turn and was in error, as it equated foresight that D1 might commit crime B

231 In modern case law, however, the distinction between these terms appears to be abating, and it is
more common to use "encourage" in lieu of "counsel," and "assist" in lieu of "aid" and "abet."
Ashworth notes, however, that maintaining a distinction between terms is important because
"encouraging" for example, is a narrower term than "counselling": Ashworth, supra note 166 at 458-

          with intent to assist D1's commission of crime B. The correct approach is to
          treat such foresight as evidence of intent to assist D1 in crime B. Although
          foresight may sometimes be powerful evidence of intent, it is not conclusive
          of it.236

Pursuant to section 14, the Bribery Act establishes liability for senior company officers, such
as directors, managers, company secretaries or those purporting to act in such a capacity,
who "consent or connive" in the commission of a Bribery Act offence under sections 1, 2 or 6
by a legal entity (see Chapter 2, Section 2.4.2(iv)). It has been suggested that the concept of
"consent and connivance" is wider and more flexible than accomplice liability.237 The
concept does not necessarily require that aid be given intentionally; it could also criminalize
reckless behaviour. It likely also captures instances where a senior officer knows the bribery
offence is occurring, but does nothing to stop it even if the senior officer did not actually aid
or encourage the offence's commission. The explanatory notes write that the section does
not create a separate offence of "consent or connivance," but rather that the body corporate
and the senior manager will be guilty of the main bribery offence.238 Senior officers can also
face party liability if they consent or connive in the commission of false accounting
provisions under the Theft Act. The practical utility of this provision is questionable,
however, given that sections 1, 2, and 6 would still rely on the identification doctrine in order
to find the body corporate liable for the main bribery offence and the first step for section 14
is "to ascertain that the body corporate or Scottish partnership has indeed been guilty of an
offence under section 1, 2 or 6."239

3.5 Canada

The CFPOA does not explicitly mention secondary parties to the indictable offence of bribery
of foreign public officials. However, via section 34(2) of the federal Interpretation Act,240 all
the provisions of the Criminal Code that relate to indictable offences also apply to bribery of
foreign public officials.241 Sections 21 and 22 of the Criminal Code address secondary party
liability. Section 21(1) of the Criminal Code criminalizes the actions (or omissions of legal
duties) of anyone who aids in the commission of an offence or abets any person in
committing an offence. Pursuant to section 21(1), aiders, abettors and principal offenders
who actually commit the offence are all guilty of the same offence and subject to the same

241 Despite some contrary views, this includes the Criminal Code provisions that criminalize
complicity in the committal of an indictable offence. In Naglingam v Canada (Minister of Citizenship &
Immigration), 2008 FCA 153, the Court reasoned that pursuant to section 34(2) of the federal
Interpretation Act, a refugee can be removed from Canada if he or she was a secondary party to one of
the serious offences set out in the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (see Fanny Lafontaine,
"Parties to Offences under the Canadian Crimes against Humanity and War Crimes Act: An Analysis of
Principal Liability and Complicity" (2009) C de D 967 at 982).

penalties set out for that offence. As well, pursuant to section 21(2), when two or more people
form a common unlawful purpose to commit an offence and during the course of that
unlawful purpose one of them commits an ancillary offence, they are all parties to that
offence if they knew or ought to have known that the commission of the ancillary offence
was a probable consequence of carrying out the common unlawful purpose. A corporation
or other organization can also be a member of a conspiracy if the requirements of sections
22.1 or 22.2 of the Criminal Code are met (further discussed in Section 2.5).

Additionally, section 5 of the CFPOA states the following:

           5 (1) Every person who commits an act or omission outside Canada that, if
           committed in Canada, would constitute an offence under section 3 or 4 -- or a
           conspiracy to commit, an attempt to commit, being an accessory after the fact in
           relation to, or any counselling in relation to, an offence under that section -- is
           deemed to have committed that act or omission in Canada if the person is

                      (a) a Canadian citizen;

                      (b) a permanent resident as defined in subsection 2(1) of the Immigration
                      and Refugee Protection Act who, after the commission of the act or
                      omission, is present in Canada; or

                      (c) a public body, corporation, society, company, firm or partnership that is
                      incorporated, formed or otherwise organized under the laws of Canada or
                      a province. [emphasis added]242

Section 22(1) of the Criminal Code makes those who counsel an offence liable for that offence
if that offence is committed. If the offence is counselled but not committed, the counsellor is
liable for a separate inchoate offence of incitement under section 464 of the Criminal Code;
that offence is subject to the same punishment as an attempt to commit the offence that was
counselled. Section 22(2) creates party liability for the counsellor for all reasonably
foreseeable ancillary offences committed by the person counselled. For a more detailed
analysis of party liability, see a standard Canadian criminal law textbook.243

4. INCHOATE OFFENCES

Certain offences are described as inchoate (or uncompleted) crimes, as opposed to "full or
complete crimes."244 The major inchoate crimes are attempt and conspiracy. Many common

244 While introducing inchoate crimes, Ormerod, supra note 163 at 410-11, writes:

            Criminalizing inchoate offences raises particular difficulties because the conduct involved
            will often be far removed from the type of harm that would be needed to give rise to a charge
            under the relevant substantive offence ...

                                                                                                          301
GLOBAL CORRUPTION

law legal systems (including the UK and Canada) also criminalize the inchoate offence of
counselling an offence which is not committed (sometimes termed incitement). Although
referred to as inchoate or incomplete, these offences are nonetheless distinct crimes on their
own. Generally, common law states are more willing to punish inchoate crimes than civil
law countries. Sweden, for example, only punishes attempts for certain crimes, attempted
bribery not being one of them.245 In this section, the UNCAC and OECD provisions on each
of these three forms of inchoate offences will be examined, followed by a description of how
the law in the US, UK and Canada deals with each offence.

4.1 Attempts

Countries around the world treat attempts to commit an offence in different ways. Some
countries do not criminalize attempts at all. In countries that do punish attempts, there is
general agreement that the criminal law should not punish criminal thoughts alone;
attempts are not committed until the offender engages in some acts for the purpose of
committing the crime. But do all acts engaged in for the purpose of committing the offence
in question constitute the offence of an attempt? Put another way, "how much [evidence of]
illegality has to be present in order for something to be qualified as an attempt."246 In some
countries, certain preliminary acts are classified as mere acts of preparation rather than an
attempt, but at a certain point, acts will cross the line from preparation to attempt. Most
common and civil law countries do not punish preparatory acts until they have reached the
threshold of an "attempt." However, there are some European states that do consider
preparatory acts in respect to at least some criminal offences to be a crime. These countries
include Poland (Article 16 of the Criminal Code)247 and Russia (section 66 of the Criminal
Code). 248

In practice, the distinction between mere preparatory acts and actual attempts is often
difficult to draw, and the line between them is unclear in many states. Gideon Yaffe writes

     The actus reus of inchoate offences can extend to cover a wide range of behaviour, sometimes
     seemingly innocuous as, for example, with `an agreement' in conspiracy, or mere words of
     encouragement in assisting and encouraging. However, there are sound reasons in policy and
     principle for punishing these types of wrongdoing, a central one being that the defendant has
     demonstrated by his actions his willingness that a substantive offence be committed.

     There is nevertheless a clear risk of over-criminalisation. Since the actus reus is so broad, it is
     important that inchoate are kept within reasonable limits by requiring substantial mens rea
     elements. In inchoate crimes it is not uncommon to find requirements of intention or
     knowledge that the substantive offence will be committed. But this emphasis on mens rea does
     not mean that inchoate can be regarded as thought-crimes; there remains a requirement that
     the defendant's blameworthy state of mind manifests itself by some words or other conduct

           CHAPTER 3 JURISDICTION, LIABILITY, ACCOMPLICES, & INCHOATE OFFENCES

that there is a general lack of clarity on "what, exactly, we have criminalized in criminalizing
attempt."249 He comments that, "[t]his confusion manifests itself, for instance, in the many
and various descriptions of the conditions that must be met in order for the defendant's
conduct to constitute more than `mere preparation,' several of which are metaphorical
(`direct movement towards' completion, for instance)."250

Germany, France, and a number of other European countries consider the point at which
preparation becomes an attempt to be "with the act which immediately precedes the
execution of the full offence."251 In other words, attempted offences are not committed until
the offender is very close to executing or completing the full offence. On the other hand, in
many common law countries, including the UK, US, and Canada, the threshold of an attempt
is reached earlier, before the perpetrator has reached the "last act" stage. Stephen Matis
characterizes the English criminal law approach as a "midway course" between the point of
mere preparation and the last act stage.252 In the US, the Model Penal Code suggests that an
attempt begins when the offender has taken "a substantial step" towards the commission of
the substantive offence. The point at which countries draw the line between an act of
preparation and an attempt is often influenced by the rationale which that country relies
upon in criminalizing an attempt. There are three possible rationales:

          a) Prevention;
          b) Moral fault; and
          c) Deterrence.

The law of attempts also raises the issue of whether voluntary withdrawal from an attempt
forms a defence. Withdrawal, or voluntary desistance, refers to instances where the
perpetrator has reached the stage of attempt, but has a change of heart before the full offence
is completed. France, Germany and Norway accept a defence of voluntary withdrawal,
while other countries like Australia have rejected this notion.253 Some argue that voluntary
withdrawal ought to serve as a mitigating factor for sentencing rather than an affirmative
defence.254

      4.1.1 UNCAC

In consideration of the different approaches to the criminalization of attempts among the
international community, UNCAC does not impose mandatory obligations on states to
criminalize attempts or other types of preparatory actions in regard to most corruption-
related offences. Article 27(2) provides a State Party "may" create an offence of attempted

bribery. Article 27(3) provides that a State Party "may" create an offence for engaging in
preparatory acts to commit bribery. Articles 27(2) and (3) state:

          2. Each State Party may adopt such legislative and other measures as
                may be necessary to establish as a criminal offence, in accordance with
                its domestic law, any attempt to commit an offence established in
                accordance with this Convention.

          3. Each State Party may adopt such legislative and other measures as
                may be necessary to establish as a criminal offence, in accordance with
                its domestic law, the preparation for an offence established in
                accordance with this Convention.

It is interesting to note that UNCAC is more prescriptive with regard to money laundering.
Article 23(1) provides that State Parties "shall, subject to the basic concepts of its legal system
... establish criminal offences" in respect to "attempts to commit" any of the money
laundering offences listed in Article 23. For more information, see Rose et al., United Nations
Convention Against Corruption: A Commentary (Oxford University Press, 2019) at 289-291.

      4.1.2 OECD Convention

The OECD Convention also respects the fact that countries take different approaches to the
criminalization of inchoate offences. Article 1(2) states that an "[a]ttempt ... to bribe a foreign
public official shall be a criminal offence to the same extent as an attempt ... to bribe a public
official is an offence" in one's own country. The Commentaries on the OECD Convention
accompanying the Convention clarify that:

          The offences set out in paragraph 2 are understood in terms of their normal
          content in national legal systems. Accordingly, if authorisation, incitement,
          or one of the other listed acts, which does not lead to further action, is not
          itself punishable under a Party's legal system, then the Party would not be
          required to make it punishable with respect to bribery of a foreign public
          official.255

      4.1.3 US

Most state penal codes and the US Model Penal Code have a provision in their general part
which makes it an offense to attempt any offense (but "it is common for [specific sections
criminalizing attempts] to say no more than that it is a crime to attempt a crime - without
specifying what conditions need to be met for a person's behaviour to constitute an
attempt"256). Some state penal codes and the US Code only penalize attempts within the
context of specific offences.257 In US law, a key point is whether the conduct of the accused
has gone beyond mere acts of preparation and entered the realm of attempts. The details of

           CHAPTER 3 JURISDICTION, LIABILITY, ACCOMPLICES, & INCHOATE OFFENCES

the US law of attempts can be found in any standard American textbook of criminal law.258
Voluntary abandonment of an attempt (i.e., the plan to commit an offense) is recognized as
a defense under the Model Penal Code and under many state penal codes.259

Since the offense of bribery is broadly stated in section 78dd-1, it is not generally necessary
to resort to attempted bribery. In section 78dd-1, bribery includes not only the completed
offense "of paying the bribe and receiving the benefit," but also the "uncompleted" offenses
of "offering, authorizing or promising" to pay a bribe, even if nothing further happens in
regard to the actual payment of the bribe. Thus, attempts to bribe a foreign official will be
caught in the full offense of bribery as defined in section 78dd-1.

      4.1.4 UK

Under section 1 of the Criminal Attempts Act 1981, it is an offence to attempt to commit any
offences that are indictable in England and Wales.260 This act repealed the common law of
attempt.261 Section 1(4) stipulates that it is not an offence to attempt to commit conspiracy or
to attempt to aid, abet or counsel a substantive offence. Under section 1(1), a person is guilty
of attempting to commit an offence if, with the intention of committing an applicable offence,
"a person does an act which is more than merely preparatory to the commission of the
offence." Once a person's actions have reached the stage of attempting an offence, the
attempt is complete. It is not a defence if the perpetrator voluntarily withdraws from the
attempt, although voluntary desistance may be evidence that the accused never really had
the requisite intent to commit the substantive offence to begin with.262 Historically, UK
courts applied the "last step" test, especially for property crimes (i.e., to be classified as an
attempt the accused's conduct must have reached the last step before completion of the full
offence). More recent case law suggests that the offender does not need to have commenced
the last act before the completion of the substantive offence, but the precise line between
merely preparatory acts and actual attempts is still unclear. As with US law, the law of
attempts is not frequently resorted to for Bribery Act offences since the offences of bribery in
that Act involve not only giving or receiving a bribe, but also offering to give or promising
to give, or requesting or agreeing to receive, a bribe.

In DPP v Stonehouse,263 the House of Lords found that if an act is performed abroad with the
intent that it will cause the commission of an offence in England, and it had an effect on
England, it is possible to prosecute that attempt in England.264 Additionally, the Privy

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

Council in Somchai Liangsiriprasert v United States Government265 stated in obiter that the
finding that a conspiracy abroad to commit an offence in England may be prosecuted in
England even when no overt act has been done in that jurisdiction also applies equally to
attempt.266 It is also likely that, where England has jurisdiction over an offence committed
abroad (for example, those committed by a British citizen), an attempt to commit such an
offence will also be prosecutable in England.267

      4.1.5 Canada

Section 34(2) of the federal Interpretation Act states that all the provisions of the Criminal Code
that relate to indictable offences also apply to the offence provisions of other federal
statutes.268 Therefore, although not explicitly noted in CFPOA, the three major inchoate
offences in Canada (counselling a crime not committed, attempt and conspiracy) apply to
CFPOA offences of bribing a foreign public official and falsifying books and records.

Pursuant to section 24(1) of the Canadian Criminal Code, anyone who, with the intention to
commit an offence, "does or omits to do anything for the purpose of carrying out his
intention is guilty of an attempt to commit the offence whether or not it was possible under
the circumstances to commit the offence." However, section 24(2) clarifies that mere
preparation to commit an offence is not considered an attempt, and states that whether
something is "mere preparation" is considered a question of law.

Like other legal systems, Canadian courts have struggled with the distinction between
preparatory acts and attempts. In the 1986 Supreme Court of Canada decision in R v Deutsch,
the Court held that there is no general rule for distinguishing between preparation and an
attempt and that the distinction should be left to the common sense of the trial judge.269
Writing for the majority, Justice Le Dain went on to state:

          In my opinion the distinction between preparation and attempt is
          essentially a qualitative one, involving the relationship between the nature
          and quality of the act in question and the nature of the complete offence,
          although consideration must necessarily be given, in making that
          qualitative distinction, to the relative proximity of the act in question to
          what would have been the completed offence, in terms of time, location and
          acts under the control of the accused remaining to be accomplished.270

           CHAPTER 3 JURISDICTION, LIABILITY, ACCOMPLICES, & INCHOATE OFFENCES

The Court's failure to express a clear test to determine whether particular acts fulfill the actus
reus requirement of an attempt offence remains troubling to some commentators, who argue
that criminal law principles demand that a clearer formulation of the actus reus of attempt
offences be available to the public.271 The issue of whether voluntary withdrawal is a defence
to an attempt charge has not been fully considered in Canada.272

4.2 Conspiracy

The offence of conspiracy involves at its core an agreement between two or more persons to
commit an offence. Many civil law countries only criminalize conspiracy to commit a limited
number of very serious crimes, which generally do not include bribery. Most common law
countries criminalize conspiracy to commit a broader range of offences, including the
offence of bribery.273 Unlike the law of attempts, conspirators may be convicted when no
concrete steps to carry out the agreement beyond reaching the agreement have been taken.
The criminalization of conspiracy is more controversial than the criminalization of attempts.
Conspiracy occurs well before an attempt to commit an offence, and its criminalization can
lead to a form of collective guilt that may unfairly punish individuals for the wrongdoing of
others. Some argue that conspiracy is an offence in itself because "it often poses a greater
danger to society than a substantive offence committed by a single individual."274 To this
end, the US Supreme Court has commented:

          For two or more to ... combine together to commit ... a breach of the criminal
          laws is an offense of the gravest character, sometimes quite outweighing, in
          injury to the public, the mere commission of the contemplated crime. It
          involves deliberate plotting to subvert the laws, educating and preparing
          the conspirators for further and habitual criminal practices. And it is
          characterized by secrecy, rendering it difficult of detection, requiring more
          time for its discovery, and adding to the importance of punishing it when
          discovered.275

In the past, the criminalization of conspiracy has also been used to suppress political dissent.
However, the availability of an offence of conspiracy to commit corruption offences allows
enforcement agencies to arrest perpetrators before harm has occurred and can be an effective
weapon against organized crime.276

      4.2.1 UNCAC

While Article 27 of UNCAC specifically references the adoption of provisions criminalizing
parties to bribery and attempts to commit bribery, UNCAC is silent on conspiracy to commit
bribery. However, Article 23 states that "subject to the basic concepts of its legal system,
State Parties shall establish a criminal offence for conspiracy to commit" any of the money
laundering offences in Article 23.

      4.2.2 OECD Convention

As with attempts, rather than mandating a globally consistent approach, Article 1(2) focuses
on consistency within the domestic context when dealing with criminalization of conspiracy.
A conspiracy or an attempt to bribe a foreign official must be penalized in the same way (if
any) as conspiracies or attempts to bribe domestic public officials.

      4.2.3 US

The US criminalizes conspiracies to bribe foreign public officials. Charges under the FCPA
will often be accompanied by a charge under the federal general conspiracy statute (18 USC
§ 371), which makes it a crime to conspire to commit an offense against the US or to conspire
to defraud the US. The applicable punishment is either a fine or a prison term of up to five
years (unless the object of the conspiracy is a misdemeanor offense, in which case the
punishment shall not exceed the maximum punishment for that offense). The elements of
the offense of conspiracy to commit bribery can be found in Tarun and Tomczak's book The
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Handbook.277 They list the four elements of a federal conspiracy
as follows:

          a. An agreement by two or more persons,
          b. To commit the unlawful object of the conspiracy,
          c. With knowledge of the conspiracy and with actual participation in the

                conspiracy, and
          d. The commission of an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy by at least

                one co-conspirator.278

It is important to note that the conspiracy offense is not complete until one of the co-
conspirators commits an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy. This does not have to be
a criminal act in its own right,279 but can be a non-criminal preparatory act, such as opening
a bank account that is to be used as a part of the bribery scheme. By contrast, the offence of
conspiracy in the UK and Canada does not require any overt acts in furtherance of the
conspiracy. Mitchell McBride notes that the overt act requirement "demonstrates that the

277 Tarun & Tomczak, supra note 30 at 31-32.                                                       2022

conspiracy was operative, rather than a mere scheme in the minds of the actors."280 The law
of conspiracy in the US is set out in detail in LaFave's book Substantive Criminal Law.281

Tarun and Tomczak note that charging individuals or corporations with both a general
conspiracy offence and a substantive FCPA offence offers several advantages to the
prosecution. In this regard, they state:

          First, the ongoing nature of conspiracy lends itself to expansive drafting,
          particularly in temporal terms. Conspiracies frequently are alleged to have
          continued for years and occasionally decades. Second, the breadth and
          vagueness of a conspiracy count allow the admission of much proof that
          might otherwise be inadmissible. Third, a conspiracy count enables the
          government to broadly join persons and allegations. A conspiracy can allege
          an agreement to defraud multiple entities, individuals, and companies or
          both the government (e.g., the Securities and Exchange Commission) and
          private entities and individuals. Fourth evidentiary rules with respect to co-
          conspirator declarations enlarge the admissibility of often-damaging
          statements in conspiracy trials [Under the US Federal Rules of Evidence, out
          of court statements made by a co-conspirator in furtherance of the
          conspiracy may be admitted against the accused]. Fifth, because the
          conspiracy is a continuing crime, its five-year statute of limitations does not
          begin to run until either the conspiracy's objectives are met, the conspiracy
          is abandoned, its members affirmatively withdraw, or the last overt act
          committed in furtherance of the conspiracy occurs. [footnotes omitted]282

Additionally, it is as of yet unclear to what extent the general charge of conspiracy may be
used to expand jurisdiction (see the discussion of Hoskins and Firtash, relating to the potential
expansion of the general charge of accomplice liability in Section 3.3).

      4.2.4 UK

For the purposes of most corruption-related offences, the old common law offence of
conspiracy has been replaced with the Criminal Law Act 1977.283 Section 1(1) of the Act
provides that a person is liable for conspiring to commit an offence if that person agrees with

280 On this point, McBride, ibid, references Yates v United States, 354 US 298, 334 (1957), where the
Court stated, "[t]he function of the overt act in a conspiracy prosecution is ... to manifest `that the
conspiracy is at work.'"

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

at least one other person to pursue a course of conduct that, if carried out according to plan,
would necessarily involve the commission of any offence. The key element is the agreement.
Evidence of negotiations without proof of an agreement is insufficient.284 To be convicted,
the defendant must have intended to enter the agreement, intended that the purpose of the
agreement be carried out, and had knowledge of the relevant circumstances.285 Recklessness
rather than actual knowledge of these circumstances is insufficient.286 If a defendant
withdraws from a conspiracy immediately after entering the agreement, this does not
provide a defence, but may be used to mitigate the sentence.287 A company may be a party
to a conspiracy if an officer forming part of its directing mind enters the agreement on the
company's behalf.288

The courts discourage the charging of both conspiracy and the substantive crime that the
parties conspired to commit due to the length and complexity of resulting trials and the
unfairness of convicting accused persons for two separate crimes for what constitutes one
continuous transaction. However, charging both offences can provide the prosecution with
evidentiary advantages.289

English courts will have jurisdiction over a conspiracy offence if the agreement is made in
England or Wales to commit an offence abroad or if an agreement was made abroad to
commit an offence in England or Wales, regardless of an absence of acts done in furtherance
of the agreement in England or Wales.290

      4.2.5 Canada

In R v Karigar,291 the court noted that section 3 of the CFPOA incorporates the idea of
conspiracy. As stated by the court, "a conspiracy or agreement to bribe foreign public
officials is a violation of the Act ... the use of the term `agrees' imports the concept of
conspiracy."292 The court further elaborated that the agreement need not be between the
giver and receiver of the bribe. Even if the word "agrees" in section 3 of the CFPOA does not
import the concept of conspiracy, the Criminal Code provisions on conspiracy also apply to
the bribery offences in the CFPOA.293 Conspiracy to commit an indictable offence is set out
under section 465(1)(c) of the Criminal Code as follows:

          every one who conspires with any one to commit an indictable offence ... is
          guilty of an indictable offence and liable to the same punishment as that to

          which an accused who is guilty of that offence would, on conviction, be
          liable.

The essence of the offence consists of an agreement between two or more persons to commit
an indictable offence. There must be a common agreement between the parties to work
together to commit the offence(s). Unlike the US conspiracy offence, there is no requirement
that one of the co-conspirators take any action in furtherance of the conspiracy. The offence
is complete the moment the agreement is reached. Like in the US, hearsay evidence spoken
by a co-conspirator is admissible against the other conspirators, although there must be
independent evidence of a conspiracy before this information may be used in court. Because
of this permissive evidence rule, the conspiracy charge is sometimes referred to as "the
prosecutor's darling."294 The criminalization of conspiracy is generally justified by the
principle that two people with a plan to commit an offence are more dangerous than one
person plotting alone. This justification has been questioned, and numerous commentators
and organizations have called on the Canadian government to narrow the offence of
conspiracy.295

Canadian courts have territorial jurisdiction over defendants who conspire in Canada to
commit an act abroad that constitutes an offence both in Canada and the foreign country.
Further, Canada will have jurisdiction if the defendant conspires elsewhere to commit any
act in Canada that is an offence in Canada.296

A more recent case on conspiracy in the bribery context is R v Barra and Govindia.297 In that
case, the defendants argued that they were only part of "a third distinct agreement
or conspiracy to bribe the Indian Minister to obtain the contract for Cryptometrics Canada,
an alleged conspiracy that does not have a real and substantial connection to Canada,"298 as
opposed to part of a larger conspiracy. The Crown argued that there was one overarching
conspiracy, and that "the fact that Barra and Berini decided to change the agent they would
use to deliver the bribe did not constitute a new separate or conspiracy but was rather a
continuation of the same conspiracy."299 The Court concluded that there "was evidence
capable of supporting the inference that he was part of a single ongoing conspiracy."300

4.3 Incitement (or Solicitation)

Inciting or counselling an offence that is later committed by the person who was counselled
makes the incitor or counsellor a party to, and therefore guilty of, the offence committed.
But suppose a person incites or counsels another person to commit an offence, but that other
person does not commit it. The incitor or counsellor cannot be a party to the offence

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

counselled because that offence was never committed and their acts of counselling or
inciting are too preliminary to convict the person of an attempt to commit the offence. Some
countries have created a separate inchoate offence for counselling an offence that is not
committed, which is called incitement in the UK and Canada and solicitation in the US.

      4.3.1 UNCAC and OECD Convention

The inchoate offence of incitement is not specifically mentioned in either UNCAC or the
OECD Convention. There is no pressing need for this type of separate inchoate offence, since
the definition of bribery under both conventions includes conduct such as "requesting a
bribe," regardless of whether the bribe is paid, or "offering a bribe," regardless of whether
the bribe is accepted or not.

      4.3.2 US

The inchoate offence of incitement (which includes counselling, encouraging, instigating or
soliciting) is referred to as the offence of solicitation in the US. The elements of this inchoate
offence can be found in a standard American textbook on criminal law.301 However, because
of the expanded definition of the offense of bribery in section 78 dd-1, there is little or no
need to use the offence of solicitation in respect to bribery offenses.

      4.3.3 UK

In the UK, the common law offence of incitement was recognized by at least 1769.302 The
common law for all such offences committed after October 1, 2008 was abolished in section
59 of the Serious Crimes Act 2007303 and replaced by sections 44-46 of the same legislation
(which refer to "encouraging or assisting an offence"). Under section 44, those that
intentionally commit acts that are capable of encouraging or assisting in the commission of
an offence are themselves committing an offence, regardless of whether the substantive
offence is carried out and regardless of whether their acts actually encourage or assist the
principal offender. Section 45, "encouraging or assisting an offence believing it will be
committed," creates an offence where a person does an act capable of encouraging the
commission of an offence, believing that the offence will be committed and that their acts
encourage or assist such a commission.304 Section 46 applies to encouraging or assisting
offences with the belief that one or more offences will be committed. Section 65 clarifies that
threats or pressure may be considered encouragement, and that taking steps to reduce the

303 Serious Crime Act 2007, 2007 c 27.
304 The Crown Prosecution Service (supra note 283) writes:

     Belief is a state of mind which is more than suspicious, the word `belief' is a word of
     ordinary usage and does not require any elaboration: Treacy v DPP (1971) 55 Cr.App.R. 113.
     If elaboration is required, a direction approved in R v Moys (1984) 79 Cr.App.R.72 should be
     given, confirming that suspicion, in addition with the fact that the defendant shut his eyes
     to the circumstances, is not enough, although such matters were relevant to the jury's
     determination of the defendant's knowledge or belief.

312                                                                                                2022
           CHAPTER 3 JURISDICTION, LIABILITY, ACCOMPLICES, & INCHOATE OFFENCES

risk of criminal proceedings for the principal offender is considered to be doing an act
capable of assisting or encouraging the commission of an offence.305

English courts have jurisdiction under Section 52 if the defendant knew or believed that the
substantive offence would be committed in England or Wales, regardless of where the acts
of encouragement or assistance took place. English courts also have jurisdiction if the
encouragement or assistance took place in England or Wales, but the defendant knew or
believed the substantive offence would take place abroad so long as the defendant knew the
offence was illegal both in the UK and in the country of the substantive offence.306

      4.3.4 Canada

A person who counsels another person to commit an offence that is later committed is
considered a party to that offence (section 22 of the Criminal Code). However, a person who
counsels another to commit an offence that is not committed is guilty of a different offence
that is sometimes referred to as the offence of incitement. Section 464 of the Criminal Code
states:

          464. Except where otherwise expressly provided by law, the following
          provisions apply in respect of persons who counsel other persons to commit
          offences, namely,

                (a) every one who counsels another person to commit an indictable
                     offence is, if the offence is not committed, guilty of an indictable
                     offence and liable to the same punishment to which a person who
                     attempts to commit that offence is liable; and

                (b) every one who counsels another person to commit an offence
                     punishable on summary conviction is, if the offence is not
                     committed, guilty of an offence punishable on summary
                     conviction.

The term "counselling" is wide and, pursuant to section 22(3) of the Criminal Code, "includes
procuring, soliciting or inciting."307

The mens rea of the offence of incitement per section 464 requires an intention that the
counselled offence be committed or recklessness in the sense of a conscious disregard for a
substantial and unjustified risk that the offence counselled was likely to be committed.308
The offence of incitement under section 464 has not been used in Canada so far to prosecute
a person who counsels bribery that was not actually committed. It could have been used in
the prosecution of Wallace and three other Canadians in respect to the alleged bribe offer
in the Padma River Bridge project in Bangladesh (see Chapter 1, Section 1.2).

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

1. INTRODUCTION

The term "money laundering" describes a range of practices used to disguise the source of
proceeds of crime and integrate them into the legitimate economy. Simply put, money
laundering means `washing' dirty money so that it appears clean. Corrupt officials and other
criminals use money laundering techniques to hide the true sources of their income. This
allows them to avoid detection by law enforcement and to spend their profits freely. Money
laundering in some form is an essential part of most illicit enterprises, although methods
vary widely. Large drug-trafficking organizations and corrupt public officials use complex,
multi-jurisdictional layering schemes; small-time criminals use simpler strategies.

As Raymond Baker points out in a 2013 article, all the illicit funds in the global economy
flow through similar channels. Drug smugglers, tax evaders and corrupt officials use their
money for different ends and acquire it by different means. Nonetheless, Baker notes:

          All three forms of illicit money - corrupt, criminal, and commercial - use
          this structure, originally developed in the West originally for the purpose
          of moving flight capital and tax evading money across borders. In the 1960s
          and 1970s drug dealers stepped into these same channels to move their illicit
          money across borders. In the 1980s and 1990s, seeing how easy it was for
          the drug dealers to do it, other kinds of racketeers stepped into these same
          structures to move their illicit money across borders. In the 1990s and in the
          early years of this new century, again seeing how easy it was for drug
          dealers and racketeers, terrorist financiers also stepped into these same
          channels to move their illicit money across borders. Drug dealers, criminal
          syndicate heads, and terrorist masterminds have not invented any new
          ways of shifting illicit money across borders. They merely utilize the
          mechanisms we originally created to move corrupt and commercially tax
          evading money across borders.1

Therefore, suppressing money laundering through a variety of anti-money-laundering
(AML) schemes is essential to combatting terrorist financing, organized crime, and
corruption. What Baker calls the "global shadow financial system" is integral to a broad
range of corrupt and criminal activities worldwide.2 Indeed, as Margaret Beare notes, while
the 1931 arrest, conviction and downfall of Al Capone is often dismissed as being "merely
for tax evasion," his undoing was in fact due to a failure to launder illicit money adequately.3

Because the purpose of money laundering is to conceal the source of illicit funds, it is
inherently difficult to measure its global scope. In a recent article, Killian McCarthy
summarizes some of the more common estimates:

          The IMF and the World Bank, for example, have estimated that some 2-4
          per cent of the world's GDP stems from illicit sources. Agarwal and
          Agarwal (2004; 2006), using regression analysis and forecasts, suggest an
          even higher level of 5-6 per cent. At this rate somewhere between $2.0-2.5
          trillion should flow through the money laundering market on an annual
          basis. Walker (1999, 2004, 2007) however, claims that this is too low a figure
          and, using input-output and gravity models, proposes that the true amount
          is more like $3 trillion per annum. Each estimate is subject to some criticism
          (cf. Reuter 2007), and are variously said to be overblown - either by media
          hype, or measurement errors - by as much as +/- 20 per cent (Schneider,
          2008). Despite all this the consensus remains that the market for money
          laundering is a significant one. [footnotes omitted]4

Despite the wide range of estimates, there is a degree of consensus among researchers. No
one has an accurate estimate, but everyone agrees that a large amount of money is being
laundered every year.

2. ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS

There are many ways to launder money. Most scholars break money laundering schemes
into three stages to make it easier to compare, contrast, and analyze different methods. These
three stages are:

     1. Placement: illicit funds are used to make a purchase or deposit in the legitimate
          economy;

     2. Layering: through repeated transactions, the source of the funds is concealed; and
     3. Integration: the funds are fully and untraceably integrated into the legitimate

          economy.

The "layering" stage, in which the source of the funds is concealed, is where most of the
activity occurs in any given scheme.

A useful and easily readable description of the basic concepts of money laundering and its
prevention can be found in the Global Organization of Parliamentarians Against Corruption
(GOPAC)'s 2011 Anti-Money Laundering Action Guide for Parliamentarians.5 GOPAC is a non-

3. MOST COMMON METHODS

As noted, the term "money laundering" encompasses a wide variety of different schemes
used by everyone from small-time drug dealers to corrupt heads of state. As Beare stated,
"[i]t is impossible to identify all the laundering possibilities - from cults to marathons and
beyond,"6 noting in the 1990s the Solar Templar doomsday cult was accused of being a front
for laundering, and the Los Angeles Marathon Corporation was convicted of money
laundering. Methods of money laundering can be as simple as small businesses using illicit
cash to generate greater profits or as complex as international schemes using methods of
concealing funds including offshore laundering havens, shell companies and wire transfers.7
Beare identifies four typologies of money laundering schemes: 1) Simple-limited schemes that
launder relatively small volumes of illicit proceeds through small cash-based businesses
such as bars and vending machine companies; 2) Simple-unlimited schemes that launder large
amounts of money with few transactions utilizing big-budget companies with unclear
resources, materials and service costs; 3) Serial-domestic schemes that use numerous financial
transactions; moving funds through a network of transactions that involve multiple banks;
and 4) Serial-international schemes that use multiple transactions and international services,
often returning funds into big banks in North America and Europe. Both serial domestic and
serial-international schemes can use professionals such as lawyers and accountants.8 The
Liberty Reserve Global case demonstrates complex schemes used by money launderers.
Liberty Reserve offered a digital currency service based in Costa Rica. The Department of
Justice (DOJ) created a diagram of the complexity of the investigation, which involved 17
countries and 36 mutual legal assistance treaty (MLAT) requests in 15 countries for
execution of search warrants, wiretap authorizations, freezing or seizing assets, all of which
culminated in 5 arrests.9

This chapter focuses on money laundering in the context of corruption. While a great deal
of global AML efforts are directed towards controlling organized crime and preventing
terrorist financing, those topics are beyond the scope of this book. The following excerpt
from Laundering the Proceeds of Corruption, a report produced by the Financial Action Task
Force (FATF), describes the most common money-laundering methods used by corrupt
officials.10 The FATF is an inter-governmental policy group composed of 34 nations,
including the US, UK, and Canada, which sets standards in the form of the FATF 40

 An Analysis of the Most Common Methods Used to Launder the Proceeds of Grand
 Corruption

 40. Laundering of corruption proceeds can take a variety of forms, depending on the
 nature of the corrupt act. In the grand corruption context, the most prevalent forms of
 proceeds are those arising from 1) bribe-taking or kickbacks; 2) extortion; 3) self-dealing
 and conflict of interest; and 4) embezzlement from the country's treasury by a variety of
 fraudulent means. Understanding the typical methods by which PEPs ["politically
 exposed persons" - a technical term for public officials in the AML context] unlawfully
 obtain proceeds assists in understanding how those funds could be laundered.

 41. In bribery, money flows from a private entity, generally speaking, to a PEP or associate
 in exchange for the grant of some sort of government concession: a contract for goods or
 services, for example, or the right to extract resources from the state. The proceeds of the
 bribery flow from the bribe giver to the corrupt PEP or an associate, possibly through a
 shell company or trust in which the PEP is the beneficial owner; it may never touch the
 home country of the corrupt PEP. A good example of this is found in the Bangkok film
 festival case, in which two promoters were able to bribe certain Thai officials to obtain the
 rights to sponsor and manage a government-funded film festival in Thailand.11 The bribes
 were paid simply by means of the wire transfer of funds from US-based accounts, where
 the promoters were located, into offshore accounts in third countries maintained by
 family members of the PEP. The bribes never passed through Thailand, although that was
 the locus of the corrupt activity.

 42. However, as noted later in the section on the use of cash, sometimes funds are retained
 in the country where the corruption takes place. For example, Joseph Estrada, then the
 President of the Philippines, often received cash or check payments from gambling
 operators in exchange for their protection from arrest or law enforcement activities. This
 money was simply deposited into domestic accounts in the name of a fictional person or
 in corporate vehicles established by Estrada's attorney, and then used for a variety of
 expenses.12 Likewise, in the case of the bribery of US Congressman Randall Cunningham,
 who was a senior legislator with significant control over military expenditures, a military
 contractor bribed him both by checks to a corporation controlled by Cunningham, but
 also by agreeing to purchase real estate owned by Cunningham at a vastly inflated price.13

 43. Proceeds are also generated through extortion schemes. In such schemes, funds are
 passed from the victim to the PEP. This can be done within the country or elsewhere.

11 [39] United States v. Green, et al, (2010) court documents. Kickbacks and bribes generally have no
legal distinction. In ordinary parlance, a kickback typically refers to the payment of a percentage of a
specific contract, while bribery is simply the unrestricted payment of money.

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

 Pavel Lazarenko, former Prime Minister of Ukraine, regularly required entities that
 wished to do business in Ukraine to split equally the profits of the enterprise with him in
 exchange for his influence in making the business successful. These businesses would
 transfer a share of ownership to Lazarenko associates or family members, and money
 would be wired from the victim companies to offshore accounts controlled by
 Lazarenko.14

 44. Self-dealing occurs when a PEP has a financial interest in an entity which does business
 with the state. The PEP is able to use his official position to ensure that the state does
 business with the entity, thereby enriching the PEP. A US Senate report noted a situation
 in which one West African PEP was responsible for selling the right to harvest timber
 from public lands, while at the same time owning the same company that had been
 awarded those rights.15 In such situations, money would flow from the affected country's
 accounts or central bank to accounts owned by the corporation or entity owned or
 controlled by the PEP.

 45. Finally, embezzlement schemes are used in a number of corruption cases. Money flows
 can occur in a number of ways, using a variety of methods. In the case involving former
 governor of Plateau state in Nigeria, Joshua Dariye, for example, a grant for
 environmental contracts was made from the federal government to the State, and the
 money was deposited into a bank account established by the State. Dariye used his
 influence to cause the bank to issue a bank draft creditable to an account at a different
 Nigerian bank that Dariye had established under an alias about ten months previously.16
 In the case involving Sani Abacha, then the President of Nigeria, Abacha directed his
 national security advisor to create and present false funding requests, which Abacha
 authorised. Cash "in truckloads" was taken out of the central bank to settle some of these
 requests. The national security advisor then laundered the proceeds through domestic
 banks or Nigerian and foreign businessmen to offshore accounts held by family
 members.17

 46. Thus, it would appear that all stages of the money laundering process - placement,
 layering, and integration - are present in the laundering of proceeds regardless of the
 manner of corruption. The specific methods by which the funds are actually laundered
 are discussed below.

                                                                 END OF EXCERPT

3.1 Use of Corporate Vehicles and Trusts

                                                            BEGINNING OF EXCERPT

 47. The project team's review of the case studies showed that every examined case
 featured the use of corporate vehicles, trusts, or non-profit entities of some type. That this
 is the case should perhaps not be surprising; corporate vehicles and trusts have long been
 identified by FATF as posing a risk for money laundering generally, and are addressed in
 Recommendations 33 and 34.18 WGTYP [Working Group on Typologies] long ago noted
 in its 1996-1997 Report on Money Laundering Typologies of the common use of shell
 corporations, and the advantages they provide in concealing the identity of the beneficial
 owner and the difficulty for law enforcement to access records.

 48. WGTYP issued a report detailing the risks of misuse of corporate vehicles and trusts
 in October 2006.19 The intervening ten years changed little. As that report noted, "[o]f
 particular concern is the ease with which corporate vehicles can be created and dissolved
 in some jurisdictions, which allows these vehicles to be ... misused by those involved in
 financial crime to conceal the sources of funds and their ownership of the corporate
 vehicles." This point was again made more recently in FATF's 2010 typology, Money
 Laundering Using Trust and Company Service Providers.20

 49. These typologies, as well as other publically available information, set forth the money
 laundering risks that corporate vehicles and trusts present, regardless of the predicate
 crime. Features of corporate vehicles that enhance the risk of money laundering include:

       · the ease with which corporate vehicles can be created and dissolved in some
            jurisdictions;

       · that a vehicle can be created as part of a series of multi-jurisdictional structures,
            in which a corporation in one jurisdiction is owned by one or more other
            corporations or trusts in other jurisdictions;

       · the use of specialised intermediaries and professionals to conceal true
            ownership;

       · the ease in which nominees may be used to disguise ownership, and
            corporations;

       · and other vehicles whose only purpose is to disguise the beneficial owner of the
            underlying asset.21

18 [46] In preparation for the fourth round of mutual evaluations, the FATF has recently started a
review of some key components of the Recommendations, including transparency of legal persons
and arrangements. In February 2012, the FATF plenary will consider the WGEI [Working Group on
Evaluations and Implementation] recommendation on amending the standards related to the
transparency of legal persons and arrangements.

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

 50. Moreover, each jurisdiction has its own set of requirements regarding identification of
 the beneficial owner and the circumstances under which that information may be
 accessed. As discussions within the FATF regarding clarification of the standards related
 to beneficial ownership have demonstrated, few jurisdictions collect beneficial ownership
 information at the time of company formation, increasing the challenges of international
 cooperation. Each of these features has the effect of making it more difficult for financial
 institutions, regulators, and law enforcement to obtain information that would allow for
 an accurate understanding of the ownership and control of the assets involved and the
 purposes for which specific financial transactions are conducted. Some vehicles are even
 designed to protect against asset confiscation; certain trusts, for example, require the
 trustee to transfer assets upon receiving notice of a law enforcement or regulatory
 inquiry.22

 51. The ease by which an individual can obtain a corporate vehicle is highlighted by J.C.
 Sharman's recently-published foray into purchasing shell corporations. Sharman, a
 professor at Griffith University in Brisbane, Australia, noted that of 45 service providers
 he was able to contact, 17 of them were willing to form the company with only a credit
 card and mailing address (to receive the documents).23 Sharman acknowledged that the
 relatively small sample size of his study "necessitates a degree of modesty about the
 findings," and that obtaining a bank account for the corporations without divulging an
 identity would be more difficult. Nevertheless, as he notes, "If one law-abiding individual
 with a modest budget can establish anonymous companies and bank accounts via the
 Internet using relatively high-profile corporate service providers, how much simpler is it
 likely to be for criminals, who are not bound by any of these restrictions, to replicate this
 feat?"

 52. In the corruption context, it is easy to understand why a corrupt PEP may wish to use
 a corporate vehicle. In some jurisdictions, PEPs are subject to public asset disclosure
 requirements, rules regarding engaging in outside transactions to prevent self-dealing
 and conflicts of interest, and a host of other codes of conduct, and ethical prohibitions.24
 Specific investigative bodies and watchdog groups may exist to guard against corruption,
 and in many countries a robust media is able to publicise missteps by public officials.
 Some countries have effectively implemented FATF Recommendation 6 [now
 Recommendation 12], and require financial institutions to conduct enhanced due
 diligence for those customers who are foreign PEPs. PEPs have their career and reputation
 at stake if found to be in possession of unexplained wealth. In this environment, corrupt
 PEPs have a greater need than others to ensure that specific criminal assets cannot be
 identified with or traced back to them. Corporate vehicles thus provide one of the most

24 [52] Many of these are obligations of member states under the UNCAC. A good description of the
available legislative and regulatory schemes employed by some countries is described in the
UNODC`s UN Anti- corruption Toolkit (2004), found at [updated link:

 effective ways to separate the origin of the illegal funds from the fact that the PEP controls
 it.

 53. One example of this comes from the case of Augusto Pinochet, the former President of
 Chile. Pinochet was assisted by his US-based bank (and its U.K. branch) in setting up
 corporate vehicles in order to both hide his assets and shield them from the reach of asset
 freezing and confiscation or civil recovery orders. Specifically, Pinochet was able to set up
 offshore shell corporations and a trust in 1996 and 1998, even after a Spanish magistrate
 had filed a detailed indictment against Pinochet for crimes against humanity and issued
 world-wide freezing orders.25 These corporations, established in jurisdictions that at the
 time had weak AML controls, were listed as the nominal owners of the US bank accounts
 and other investment vehicles that benefited Pinochet and his family. The bank's KYC
 documentation listed only the corporations, not Pinochet, as the owners of the accounts,
 despite the fact that the bank knew that Pinochet was the beneficial owner (since the bank
 itself had set up the corporations). The bank has since been convicted of AML-related
 criminal charges.

 54. According to the case study of Vladimiro Montesinos, Peruvian President Fujimori's
 security advisor, he used shell corporations very effectively to disguise and move money
 illegally obtained through defence contracts with the Peruvian government.26 Such a
 scheme, involving several corporate vehicles in a number of jurisdictions with each
 vehicle holding bank accounts in yet other jurisdictions, is designed to frustrate any
 financial institution, regulator or government investigator attempting to unravel the
 scheme.

                                                                 END OF EXCERPT

 55. Gatekeepers were significantly represented in the cases within the project team
 inventory. "Gatekeepers are, essentially, individuals that `protect the gates to the financial
 system' through which potential users of the system, including launderers, must pass in
 order to be successful."27 The issue of gatekeepers has been addressed by FATF on several
 occasions, including WGTYP's 2003- 2004 Report, which concluded:

            Increasingly, money launderers seek out the advice or services of
            specialised professionals to help facilitate their financial operations. This
            trend toward the involvement of various legal and financial experts, or
            gatekeepers, in money laundering schemes has been documented
            previously by the FATF and appears to continue today. The work

            undertaken during this year's exercise confirmed and expanded the
            FATF's understanding of specific characteristics of this sector and what
            makes it vulnerable to money laundering. The most significant cases each
            involve schemes of notable sophistication, which were possible only as a
            result of the assistance of skilled professionals to set up corporate
            structures to disguise the source and ownership of the money.

 56. In 2010, FATF published its Global Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Threat
 Assessment, which described gatekeepers as a "common element" in complex money
 laundering schemes. The report noted that gatekeepers' skills are important in creating
 legal structures that could be used to launder money and for their ability to manage and
 perform transactions efficiently and to avoid detection. Recommendation 12 [now
 Recommendation 22] acknowledges the role that such gatekeepers can play by
 recommending that such individuals engage in due diligence and record keeping when
 engaged in certain activities.

 57. The review of the cases illustrates the variety of ways in which gatekeepers, in
 particular lawyers, are used to launder the proceeds of corruption. They have been used
 to create corporate vehicles, open bank accounts, transfer proceeds, purchase property,
 courier cash, and take other means to bypass AML controls. In addition, lawyers have
 subsequently used rules of attorney-client privilege to shield the identity of corrupt PEPs.

 58. West African PEPs: In four separate case studies of West African PEPs and their
 families, the US Senate discovered that lawyers were used to create corporate vehicles,
 open bank accounts and purchase property with the express purpose of bypassing AML
 controls set up to screen for PEPs.28 For example, the son of the President of one West
 African nation, who himself was a minister within the government, wished to purchase
 real estate and aircraft within the United States. To do so, a lawyer for the PEP opened
 bank accounts there. However, because of US banking rules requiring enhanced level of
 due diligence for funds moving through those accounts, several US banks closed the
 accounts on the belief that they were being used to conduct suspicious transactions. In
 response, the lawyers for the PEP would deposit incoming funds into attorney-client or
 law office accounts, and then transfer the money into newly-created accounts for the PEP.
 Due to the fact that the lawyer's accounts were not subject to the same enhanced due
 diligence as the PEP, the lawyer was able to circumvent the enhanced AML/CFT
 measures. Ultimately, at least two banks were able to identify the fact that the attorney's
 accounts were being utilised in this manner and closed the attorney accounts, but not
 before hundreds of thousands of dollars had passed through.

 59. Duvalier case: Haitian government assets diverted by Jean-Claude Duvalier were
 likewise disguised by the use of lawyers as intermediaries, who would hold accounts for
 the Duvalier family. This, according to the UK court that examined the matter, had the
 added advantage of the use of professional secrecy to avoid identifying the client.29 The

 both in the UK and in Jersey. The use of professional secrecy was used to attempt to
 prevent an inquiry into the nature of the funds.

 60. Chiluba case: Similarly, in a civil recovery suit instituted in the UK against the former
 President of Zambia, the court, in its factual findings, described in great detail the use of
 certain lawyers and law firms to distribute and disguise money embezzled from the
 coffers of the Zambian government.30 Special corporate vehicles had been set up,
 purportedly for use by the country's security services, and government funds were
 transferred to accounts held by those entities. Thereafter, millions of dollars were
 transferred to the client accounts of certain law firms, from which the lawyers would then
 make certain disbursals upon instructions from complicit PEPs. These disbursals were to
 other accounts located both in Zambia and in other countries, as well as payments for
 personal expenses and asset acquisitions for the government officials and their families.
 As the Court noted in its opinion, "There is no reason for his client account to be used for
 any genuine currency transactions. This is ... money which has been traced back to [the
 Zambian Ministry of Finance]. It is a classic example of washing money through [the
 attorney's] client account to hide its origins and to clothe it with an aura of respectability."

 61. The court also noted an instance in which the PEP's lawyer withdrew GBP 30 000 - an
 amount that vastly exceeded the President's annual salary - and delivered it personally
 to the President. Moving the money through the lawyer's accounts disguised the fact that
 the money originated from government accounts, and further hampered the ability to
 trace the proceeds. The court noted that the lawyers involved did not make any efforts to
 determine the source or the purpose of the money: "Yet [the lawyer] made no enquiry as
 to how the President could simply take such a large amount of money. An honest solicitor
 would not participate in such a transaction without a full understanding of its nature so
 that he could be satisfied it was lawful. [The lawyer] did not so satisfy himself because he
 was unwilling to ask the question because he was afraid of the answer." Additionally, the
 lawyers involved formed foreign shell corporations, which were then used to purchase
 properties with government money for the benefit of corrupt officials.

                                                                 END OF EXCERPT

3.3 Use of Domestic Financial Institutions

 62. Much of the focus on PEPs to date has been to ensure that foreign PEPs are subject to
 enhanced due diligence regarding the source of funds deposited into financial institutions
 - in other words, measures to prevent corrupt PEPs from laundering their proceeds in
 foreign bank accounts. For example, the Third EU Directive requires enhanced due
 diligence only for foreign PEPs. The UNCAC, however, does not distinguish between
 foreign PEPs and those prominent political figures within the institution's own country.

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

 The World Bank policy paper on PEPs notes that many financial institutions do not
 distinguish between foreign and domestic PEPs.31

 63. The Interpretive Note to Recommendation 6 encourages jurisdictions to extend its
 EDD requirements to domestic PEPs as well. Recently the FATF has discussed the degree
 to which domestic PEPs should be subject to enhanced due diligence, and in addressing
 the issue, has recommended that domestic PEPs continue to be considered on a risk-based
 approach, and that foreign PEPs continue to receive enhanced due diligence.32

 64. Some typology exercises the project team reviewed have concluded that domestic
 PEPs may present a significant risk for corruption-related money laundering. Professor
 Jason Sharman, in summarizing the ADB/OECD paper on PEPs, characterised the notion
 that domestic PEPs do not present a threat of money laundering as a "myth."33 The project
 team's analysis of the case study inventory found that PEPs are not only using foreign
 financial institutions to transfer and hide the proceeds of corruption. PEPs are also using
 domestic financial institutions to launder funds.

 65. Perhaps the most obvious example of this involves President Joseph Estrada of the
 Philippines, who was convicted in his country of the crime of plunder. The court's ruling
 in that case noted that a significant portion of the money that Estrada collected as a result
 of kickbacks from illegal gambling and tobacco excise taxes ultimately ended up at a bank
 account in the Philippines in the name of an alias, Jose Velarde. The court noted that
 Estrada used the account and would simply sign Velarde's name to deposit slips,
 oftentimes in the presence of bank personnel. Money that went through that account was
 used for various asset purchases, including real estate for the benefit of Estrada.34

 66. The US Senate, in its 2010 investigation of the use of US banks to launder corruption
 proceeds, described in two different reports the banking and asset purchase activities of
 the President of a West African oil producing country as well as that of his son, who was
 also a high-level government official. The son, for example, in purchasing in cash a house
 in the United States for USD 30 million, wire transferred money, in six different USD 6
 million tranches, from a personal bank account he held in his own country, through an
 account in France and then to the United States. The son had an official government
 monthly salary of approximately USD 6 000.

 67. The case involving assets stolen by Joshua Chibi Dariye also highlight the use of
 domestic accounts in at least the initial stages of a more complex scheme. Dariye, the
 Governor of Plateau State in the Federal Republic of Nigeria from May 1999 through May
 2007, embezzled money belonging to the state in several ways. Checks issued from the
 central bank of Nigeria to Plateau State for ecological works were received by Dariye and,
 rather than being deposited into a government account, were instead diverted to an
 account in Nigeria Dariye had established using an alias. The money was then transferred

 to accounts held in Dariye's own name in the UK. Likewise, Dariye purchased real estate
 by diverting money destined for a Plateau State account into an account in Nigeria in the
 name of a corporation he controlled. That corporation, in turn, transferred money to UK
 accounts in the corporation's name to effectuate the real estate purchase.35

 68. Raul Salinas, the brother of the President of Mexico, likewise was able to move money
 out of his home country by using the Mexican branch of a US-based international bank. A
 US-based bank official introduced Salinas' then-fiancée to a bank official at the Mexico
 City branch of the bank. The fiancée, using an alias, would deliver cashier's checks to the
 branch, where they were converted to dollars and wired to US accounts.36

 69. PEPs need accounts in their own country in which to fund their lifestyles, and there
 have been examples in which the PEP, after secreting money overseas, then moved the
 money back to his home country. The US Senate, in its 2004 investigation of corruption-
 related money laundering, provided one such example. Augusto Pinochet of Chile,
 notwithstanding a modest official government salary, was able to secret millions of
 dollars in UK and US accounts, often through the use of aliases and family members. In
 1998 a Spanish investigating magistrate instituted worldwide asset freeze orders as a
 result of an investigation into Pinochet's role in human rights abuses and other crimes
 and was subsequently facing charges in Spain and Chile. Pinochet was able however, to
 purchase USD 1.9 million in cashier`s checks (in USD 50 000 increments) from his account
 in the US, which he was thus able to cash using banks in Chile.37

 70. That corrupt PEPs would seek to move money outside of their home jurisdiction is at
 the root of Recommendation 6, requiring enhanced due diligence for foreign PEPs. An
 examination of the corruption case studies revealed that in nearly every case foreign bank
 accounts were being used in part of the scheme. Beginning with one of the earliest cases,
 Marcos of the Philippines, through the significant and egregious activity of Sani Abacha
 and a number of Nigerian governors, and most recently with the US Senate's study of
 three West African heads of state, corrupt PEPs nearly universally attempt to move their
 money outside of their home country. This money is typically moved from developing
 countries to financial institutions in developed countries or those with a stable climate for
 investment.

 71. Of course, corruption is not restricted to developing countries. The project team
 analyzed the Nino Rovelli judicial corruption matter, for example.38 There, approximately
 USD 575 million was paid out to individuals as a result of bribes paid to judicial officials
 in Italy. The money ultimately was moved and disguised in a series of financial
 transactions involving accounts and corporate vehicles in the United States, British Virgin
 Islands, Singapore, Cook Islands and Costa Rica. Likewise, the developing world's
 financial systems may well be used to hide money. In the Titan Corporation bribery case

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

 for example, bribes from a US corporation to the President of Benin, intended to secure
 government contracts in telecommunications, was moved, in cash, directly to Benin.39

 72. The reason for this preference is obvious. Foreign accounts hold the advantage of being
 harder to investigate for the victim country, are perceived of as more stable and safer, and
 are more easily accessed than accounts held in the PEPs home country. Moreover, a PEP
 can "stack" foreign jurisdictions: a bank account in one country could be owned by a
 corporation in another jurisdiction, which is in turn owned by a trust in a third
 jurisdiction. Each additional country multiplies the complexity of the investigation,
 reduces the chances of a successful result, and extends the time needed to complete the
 investigation.

                                                                 END OF EXCERPT

3.4 Use of Nominees

                                                            BEGINNING OF EXCERPT

 73. The use of associates or nominees - trusted associates or family members, but not
 necessarily the lawyers and accountants described in the gatekeepers section - to assist
 the PEP in disguising and moving the proceeds of corruption was common in the
 inventory of cases. FATF has documented the use of such nominees previously. The
 WGTYP annual report for 2003-2004 noted at paragraph 78:

            PEPs, given the often high visibility of their office both inside and outside
            their country, very frequently use middlemen or other intermediaries to
            conduct financial business on their behalf. It is not unusual therefore for
            close associates, friends and family of a PEP to conduct individual
            transactions or else hold or move assets in their own name on behalf the
            PEP. This use of middlemen is not necessarily an indicator by itself of
            illegal activity, as frequently such intermediaries are also used when the
            business or proceeds of the PEP are entirely legitimate. In any case,
            however, the use of middlemen to shelter or insulate the PEP from
            unwanted attention can also serve as an obstacle to customer due
            diligence that should be performed for every customer. A further obstacle
            may be involved when the person acting on behalf of the PEP or the PEP
            him or herself has some sort of special status such as, for example,
            diplomatic immunity.

 74. A typical use of nominees can be found in the case of Arnoldo Aleman. Aleman was
 able to siphon government funds through a non-profit institution known as the
 Nicaraguan Democratic Foundation (FDN), an entity incorporated by Aleman's wife in
 Panama. In addition, Aleman and his wife set up both front companies and non-profit
 organisations to funnel money through. Lastly, Aleman was able to defraud the

 government in the sale of telecommunications frequency to a private entity, using
 companies set up by advisors to Aleman. Aleman was also assisted in his efforts to steal
 and subsequently move money through the active participation of Byron Jerez, the
 country's tax commissioner at the time.40

 75. The scheme set up by a high level PEP in a Central American country likewise
 depended on the assistance of both family members as well as other associates to succeed.
 The PEP would divert money that was intended to be paid to the country's treasury
 through a series of financial transactions, which would then ultimately end up in foreign
 bank accounts in the name of the PEP's former wife and daughter.41

                                                                 END OF EXCERPT

3.5 Use of Cash

                                                            BEGINNING OF EXCERPT

 76. The use of cash, and its placement into the financial system, has long been identified
 as a method for the laundering of proceeds of crime. Indeed, when the FATF 40
 Recommendations were first issued in 1990, the focus of many of its preventative
 measures was on detecting money laundering at the cash proceeds stage. The anonymous
 nature of cash, with its lack of paper trail, is attractive and may outweigh other negatives.
 Some of the predicate crimes, such as drug trafficking, are historically cash businesses.
 Indeed, even for crimes that do not generate cash requiring placement into the financial
 system, WGTYP has noted (Report on Money Laundering Typologies, 2000-2001) some
 laundering schemes in which the proceeds are converted back to cash in order to break
 the paper trail.

 77. While smaller-scale, endemic corruption (in which money is provided to lower- or
 mid-level government officials in order to act or refrain from acting in their official
 capacity), would be expected to generate cash in need of placement, the grand corruption
 cases would not be expected to have significant amounts of cash. A cash payment to a
 PEP would break the chain of bank records, of course, but it would require the PEP to run
 the gauntlet of AML/CFT controls designed to combat placement of illegally-derived cash
 into the system. This would include the possibility that the PEP's transactions (as well as
 those for his family and close associates) are subject to enhanced due diligence in
 accordance with Recommendation 6. In each case in which the PEP receives the cash, he
 must engage in a calculus to determine whether the risks associated with placement -
 including the possibility of EDD as a result of his PEP status - outweigh the benefits of
 having broken the chain. It appears that in a significant number of cases, the corrupt PEP
 wants the cash and, moreover is able to place the cash without attracting undue attention.

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

 78. The US Senate's investigation of corruption-related money laundering identified the
 President of one oil rich West African country, for which a US bank accepted nearly USD
 13 million in cash deposits over a three-year period into accounts controlled by the
 President or his wife. The report noted that some of these deposits were for a million
 dollars at a time, and the currency was in shrink-wrap packaging. The report could
 identify no legitimate source for such currency. This same bank also provided USD 1.9
 million in cashier checks to a PEP from a South American country, using the maiden name
 of the wife of the PEP as the payee. These cashiers' checks were ultimately cashed in the
 PEP's home country. The bank involved was fined and criminally prosecuted for these
 violations and ultimately was closed as a result.42

 79. The Zambian asset recovery lawsuit, noted above, also highlights the use of cash. As
 part of the scheme, the president of Zambia directed his UK-based lawyer to withdraw
 GBP 30 000 in cash from accounts containing diverted government money and deliver it
 to him personally. There were also other significant cash payments, including a USD 250
 000 payment made from a diverted account to the Zambian Ambassador to the United
 States, which he then took in a suitcase to Switzerland and gave to the head of the
 Zambian security service, and hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash used to purchase
 property in the UK and elsewhere. The court found that there was no legitimate purpose
 for the large cash withdrawals.43

 80. Other case studies have shown the presence of significant amounts of unexplained
 cash. Diepreye Alamieyeseigha, for example, was found to have over GBP 1 000 000 in his
 apartment in the UK at the time of his arrest, notwithstanding the fact that as governor of
 Bayelsa State in Nigeria, his salary was a fraction of that. Another governor of a Nigerian
 state around that time, Joshua Chibi Dariye, previously discussed, was found to have
 deposited into his UK accounts in excess of GBP 480 000 during a four and a half year
 period. According to a US Senate report on the matter, immediately after Sani Abacha's
 death in 1998, his wife was stopped at a Lagos airport with 38 suitcases full of cash, and
 his son was found with USD 100 million in cash. According to the World Bank study he
 was able to place significant amounts of cash in the financial system by using associates.
 Lastly, Montesinos used cash couriers to transfer funds from Switzerland to Mexico and
 Bolivia.

 81. PEPs have an advantage not usually available to the general public: the use (and abuse)
 of the so-called "diplomatic pouch." Intended to protect free communication between
 diplomats and their foreign missions, a diplomatic bag is protected from search or seizure
 by the 1961 Convention on Diplomatic Relations.44 A diplomatic bag may only be used for
 official materials and, while the Convention protects it from search, it does not relieve the
 carrier of adherence to the laws of the host nation, including cross-border currency
 reporting requirements.

 82. Such was the situation that the US Senate uncovered in its report on the financial affairs
 of one West African PEP. His daughter, who was in graduate school in the United States,
 asked her US bank to count certain cash she had stored in her safe deposit box. The bank
 found USD 1 million in cash, in USD 100 bills, wrapped in plastic. When asked about the
 source of the money, the daughter replied that her father, the PEP, provided her the cash
 when he came into the United States, and that he often brought cash into the United States.
 The PEP had never declared his transport of the cash, as he was required to do by US
 law. 45

4. INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS FOR PREVENTION AND
      CRIMINALIZATION

4.1 UNCAC

As discussed in previous chapters, UNCAC is the most extensive and most widely ratified
international convention addressing corruption.46 In addition to prohibiting bribery and
other forms of corruption, the drafters of UNCAC recognized that effective anti-money
laundering strategies are an important factor in preventing and detecting large-scale
corruption. The transnational nature of money laundering necessitates international
cooperation and consistent standards in anti-money laundering efforts. UNCAC therefore
addresses money laundering in both Chapter II (Preventative Measures) and in Chapter III
(Criminalization and Law Enforcement). Article 14 sets out standards for State Parties to
follow in developing anti-money laundering measures, while Article 23 of UNCAC
criminalizes the laundering of the proceeds of corruption. A more comprehensive overview
of the anti-money laundering provisions of UNCAC can be found in Indira Carr and Miriam
Goldby's paper, "The UN Anti-Corruption Convention and Money Laundering."47

      4.1.1 Article 23--Criminalization

Article 23 is ambitious in scope. It criminalizes the actions of those involved in money
laundering in a number of different capacities. Unlike some of the other criminalization
provisions of UNCAC, the criminalization of money laundering under Article 23 is
mandatory, although the provision may be adapted if necessary to conform to the
"fundamental principles" of the State Party's domestic law. It provides:

     1. Each State Party shall adopt, in accordance with fundamental
          principles of its domestic law, such legislative and other measures
          as may be necessary to establish as criminal offences, when
          committed intentionally:

     (a) (i)       The conversion or transfer of property, knowing that
                   such property is the proceeds of crime, for the purpose
                   of concealing or disguising the illicit origin of the
                   property or of helping any person who is involved in
                   the commission of the predicate offence to evade the
                   legal consequences of his or her action;

     (ii) The concealment or disguise of the true nature, source,
             location, disposition, movement or ownership of or
             rights with respect to property, knowing that such
             property is the proceeds of crime;

     (b) Subject to the basic concepts of its legal system:

     (i) The acquisition, possession or use of property,
             knowing, at the time of receipt, that such property is the
             proceeds of crime;

     (ii) Participation in, association with or conspiracy to
             commit, attempts to commit and aiding, abetting,
             facilitating and counselling the commission of any of
             the offences established in accordance with this article.

The following excerpt from the Legislative Guide for the Implementation of the United Nations
Convention against Corruption provides guidance to legislators tasked with incorporating
Article 23 into a state's domestic legislation:

(e) Money-laundering

220. Article 23 requires the establishment of offences related to the laundering of proceeds
of crime, in accordance with fundamental principles of domestic law. The related
Convention articles addressing measures aimed at the prevention of money-laundering
were discussed in the previous chapter.

221. In the context of globalization, criminals take advantage of easier capital movement,
advances in technology and increases in the mobility of people and commodities, as well
as the significant diversity of legal provisions in various jurisdictions. As a result, assets
can be transferred instantly from place to place through both formal and informal
channels. Through exploitation of existing legal asymmetries, funds may appear finally
as legitimate assets available in any part of the world.

222. Confronting corruption effectively requires measures aimed at eliminating the
financial or other benefits that motivate public officials to act improperly. Beyond this,

332                                                                                             2022
                                                                CHAPTER 4 MONEY LAUNDERING

combating money-laundering also helps to preserve the integrity of financial institutions,
both formal and informal, and to protect the smooth operation of the international
financial system as a whole.

223. As noted in the previous chapter, this goal can only be achieved through international
and cooperative efforts. It is essential that States and regions try to make their approaches,
standards and legal systems related to this offence compatible, so that they can cooperate
with one another in controlling the international laundering of criminal proceeds.
Jurisdictions with weak or no control mechanisms render the work of money launderers
easier. Thus, the Convention against Corruption seeks to provide a minimum standard
for all States.

224. The Convention against Corruption specifically recognizes the link between corrupt
practices and money-laundering and builds on earlier and parallel national, regional and
international initiatives in that regard. Those initiatives addressed the issue through a
combination of repressive and preventive measures and the Convention follows the same
pattern (see also chap. II of the present guide).

225. One of the most important of the previous initiatives related to the Organized Crime
Convention, which mandated the establishment of the offence of money-laundering for
additional predicate offences, including corruption of public officials, and encouraged
States to widen the range of predicate offences beyond the minimum requirements.

226. "Predicate offence" is defined as "any offence as a result of which proceeds have been
generated that may become the subject of an offence as defined in article 23 of this
Convention" (art. 2, subpara. (h)).

227. As a result of all these initiatives, many States already have money laundering laws.
Nevertheless, such laws may be limited in scope and may not cover a wide range of
predicate offences. Article 23 requires that the list of predicate offences include the widest
possible range and at a minimum the offences established in accordance with the
Convention against Corruption.

228. The provisions of the Convention against Corruption addressing the seizure, freezing
and confiscation of proceeds (see art. 31) and the recovery of assets (see chap. V of the
Convention and, especially, art. 57) include important related measures. States should
review the provisions they already have in place to counter money-laundering in order to
ensure compliance with these articles and those dealing with international cooperation
(chap. IV). States undertaking such a review may wish to use the opportunity to
implement the obligations they assume under other regional or international instruments
and initiatives currently in place.

229. Article 23 requires that States parties establish the four offences related to money-
laundering described in the following paragraphs:

                                                                                                         333
GLOBAL CORRUPTION

 (f) Conversion or transfer of proceeds of crime

 230. The first offence is the conversion or transfer of property, knowing that such property
 is the proceeds of crime, for the purpose of concealing or disguising the illicit origin of the
 property or of helping any person who is involved in the commission of the predicate
 offence to evade the legal consequences of his or her action (art. 23, para. 1 (a) (i)).

 231. The term "conversion or transfer" includes instances in which financial assets are
 converted from one form or type to another, for example, by using illicitly generated cash
 to purchase precious metals or real estate or the sale of illicitly acquired real estate, as well
 as instances in which the same assets are moved from one place or jurisdiction to another
 or from one bank account to another.

 232. The term "proceeds of crime" means "any property derived from or obtained,
 directly or indirectly, through the commission of an offence" (art. 2, subpara. (e)).

 233. With respect to the mental or subjective elements required, the conversion or transfer
 must be intentional, the accused must have knowledge at the time of conversion or
 transfer that the assets are criminal proceeds and the act or acts must be done for the
 purpose of either concealing or disguising their criminal origin, for example by helping
 to prevent their discovery, or helping a person evade criminal liability for the crime that
 generated the proceeds.

 234. As noted in article 28 of the Convention against Corruption, knowledge, intent or
 purpose may be inferred from objective factual circumstances.

 (g) Concealment or disguise of proceeds of crime

 235. The second money-laundering offence is the concealment or disguise of the nature,
 source, location, disposition, movement or ownership of or rights with respect to
 property, knowing that such property is the proceeds of crime (art. 23, para. 1 (a) (ii)).

 236. The elements of this offence are quite broad, including the concealment or disguise
 of almost any aspect of or information about property.

 237. Here, with respect to the mental or subjective elements required, the concealment or
 disguise must be intentional and the accused must have knowledge that the property
 constitutes the proceeds of crime at the time of the act. This mental state is less stringent
 than for the offence set forth in article 23, subparagraph 1 (a) (i). Accordingly, drafters
 should not require proof that the purpose of the concealment or disguise is to frustrate
 the tracing of the asset or to conceal its true origin.

 238. The next two offences related to money-laundering are mandatory, subject to the
 basic concepts of the legal system of each State party.

 (h) Acquisition, possession or use of proceeds of crime

334                                                                                                 2022
                                                                CHAPTER 4 MONEY LAUNDERING

239. The third offence is the acquisition, possession or use of proceeds of crime knowing,
at the time of receipt, that such property is the proceeds of crime (art. 23, para. 1 (b) (i)).

240. This is the mirror image of the offences under article 23, paragraph 1 (a)(i) and (ii), in
that, while those provisions impose liability on the providers of illicit proceeds, this
paragraph imposes liability on recipients who acquire, possess or use the property.

241. The mental or subjective elements are the same as for the offence under article 23,
paragraph 1 (a) (ii): there must be intent to acquire, possess or use, and the accused must
have knowledge, at the time this occurred, that the property was the proceeds of crime.
No particular purpose for the acts is required.

(i) Participation in, association with or conspiracy to commit, attempts to commit and
aiding, abetting, facilitating and counselling the commission of any of the foregoing
offences

242. The fourth set of offences involves the participation in, association with or conspiracy
to commit, attempts to commit and aiding, abetting, facilitating and counselling the
commission of any of the offences mandated by the article (art. 23, para. 1 (b) (ii)).

243. These terms are not defined in the Convention against Corruption, allowing for
certain flexibility in domestic legislation. States parties should refer to the manner in
which such ancillary offences are otherwise structured in their domestic system and
ensure that they apply to the other offences established pursuant to article 23.

[Note - see Chapter 3, Sections 3 and 4, for a discussion on inchoate crimes and secondary
liability.]

244. The knowledge, intent or purpose, as required for these offences, may be inferred
from objective factual circumstances (art. 28). National drafters could see that their
evidentiary provisions enable such inference with respect to the mental state, rather than
requiring direct evidence, such as a confession, before the mental state is deemed proven.

245. Under article 23, States parties must apply these offences to proceeds generated by
"the widest range of predicate offences" (art. 23, para. 2 (a)).

246. At a minimum, these must include a "comprehensive range of criminal offences
established in accordance with this Convention" (art. 23, para. 2 (b)). For this purpose,
"predicate offences shall include offences committed both within and outside the
jurisdiction of the State party in question. However, offences committed outside the
jurisdiction of a State party shall constitute predicate offences only when the relevant
conduct is a criminal offence under the domestic law of the State where it is committed
and would be a criminal offence under the domestic law of the State party implementing
or applying this article had it been committed there" (art. 23, para. 2 (c)). So, dual
criminality is necessary for offences committed in a different national jurisdiction to be
considered as predicate offences.

                                                                                                         335
GLOBAL CORRUPTION

 247. Many States already have laws on money-laundering, but there are many variations
 in the definition of predicate offences. Some States limit the predicate offences to
 trafficking in drugs or to trafficking in drugs and a few other crimes. Other States have an
 exhaustive list of predicate offences set forth in their legislation. Still other States define
 predicate offences generically as including all crimes, or all serious crimes, or all crimes
 subject to a defined penalty threshold.

 248. An interpretative note for the Convention against Corruption states that "money-
 laundering offences established in accordance with this article are understood to be
 independent and autonomous offences and that a prior conviction for the predicate
 offence is not necessary to establish the illicit nature or origin of the assets laundered. The
 illicit nature or origin of the assets and, in accordance with article 28, any knowledge,
 intent or purpose may be established during the course of the money-laundering
 prosecution and may be inferred from objective factual circumstances" (A/58/422/Add.1,
 para. 32).

 249. The constitutions or fundamental legal principles of some States do not permit the
 prosecution and punishment of an offender for both the predicate offence and the
 laundering of proceeds from that offence. The Convention acknowledges this issue and,
 only in such cases, allows for the non-application of the money-laundering offences to
 those who committed the predicate offence (art. 23, para. 2 (e)).48

                                                                 END OF EXCERPT

      4.1.2 Article 14--Measures to Prevent Money-Laundering

As mentioned above, in addition to mandating the criminalization of money laundering,
UNCAC also requires State Parties to take measures to establish a regulatory regime
intended to prevent money laundering:

          Article 14. Measures to prevent money-laundering

          1. Each State Party shall:

                (a) Institute a comprehensive domestic regulatory and supervisory
                     regime for banks and non-bank financial institutions, including
                     natural or legal persons that provide formal or informal services
                     for the transmission of money or value and, where appropriate,
                     other bodies particularly susceptible to money-laundering, within
                     its competence, in order to deter and detect all forms of money-
                     laundering, which regime shall emphasize requirements for

                     customer and, where appropriate, beneficial owner identification,
                     record-keeping and the reporting of suspicious transactions;

                (b) Without prejudice to article 46 of this Convention, ensure that
                     administrative, regulatory, law enforcement and other authorities
                     dedicated to combating money-laundering (including, where
                     appropriate under domestic law, judicial authorities) have the
                     ability to cooperate and exchange information at the national and
                     international levels within the conditions prescribed by its
                     domestic law and, to that end, shall consider the establishment of
                     a financial intelligence unit to serve as a national centre for the
                     collection, analysis and dissemination of information regarding
                     potential money-laundering.

          2. States Parties shall consider implementing feasible measures to detect
                and monitor the movement of cash and appropriate negotiable
                instruments across their borders, subject to safeguards to ensure
                proper use of information and without impeding in any way the
                movement of legitimate capital. Such measures may include a
                requirement that individuals and businesses report the cross-border
                transfer of substantial quantities of cash and appropriate negotiable
                instruments.

          3. States Parties shall consider implementing appropriate and feasible
                measures to require financial institutions, including money remitters:

                (a) To include on forms for the electronic transfer of funds and related
                     messages accurate and meaningful information on the originator;

                (b) To maintain such information throughout the payment chain; and
                (c) To apply enhanced scrutiny to transfers of funds that do not

                     contain complete information on the originator.

          4. In establishing a domestic regulatory and supervisory regime under
                the terms of this article, and without prejudice to any other article of
                this Convention, States Parties are called upon to use as a guideline
                the relevant initiatives of regional, interregional and multilateral
                organizations against money-laundering.

          5. States Parties shall endeavour to develop and promote global,
                regional, subregional and bilateral cooperation among judicial, law
                enforcement and financial regulatory authorities in order to combat
                money-laundering.

Carr and Goldby note that Article 14(1) requires states to implement a regulatory and
supervisory regime that monitors both formal and informal methods of transferring money
in order to combat money laundering. 49 They state that "[t]he system known as Hawala (in
India) or Fie Ch'ieu (in China) is typically used by migrant workers to transfer small amounts
of money to relatives in villages lacking bank accounts or access to banks, but can also be

abused by criminals."50 Although Carr and Goldby welcome this inclusion of informal
networks of money transfer into supervisory regimes, they argue that "much research still
needs to be done in order to design an effective regime for the regulation and supervision of
such informal networks."51

Article 14 of UNCAC also requires states to develop comprehensive anti-money laundering
regimes. Although not expressly mandated, there is a strong suggestion by UNCAC that
states look to international standard setting bodies, such as the FATF, when designing anti-
money laundering frameworks. Therefore, although the FATF recommendations are not
themselves binding international law, in addition to their independent ability to set
standards through peer pressure, they are given some degree of legal recognition under
UNCAC.

The following excerpt from the UNCAC Legislative Guide summarizes and explains the
various mandated and recommended actions that, pursuant to Article 14, State Parties are
to follow:

                                                            BEGINNING OF EXCERPT

 Summary of Main Requirements

 138. Article 14 contains two mandatory requirements:

       (a) To establish a comprehensive domestic regulatory and supervisory regime to
            deter money-laundering (para. 1 (a));

       (b) To ensure that agencies involved in combating money-laundering have the
            ability to cooperate and exchange information at the national and international
            levels (para. 1 (b)).

 139. In addition, pursuant to article 14 States must consider:

       (a) Establishing an FIU (para. 1 (b));
       (b) Implementing measures to monitor cash movements across their borders (para.

            2);
       (c) Implementing measures to require financial institutions to collect information

            on originators of electronic fund transfers, maintain information on the entire
            payment chain and scrutinize fund transfers with incomplete information on the
            originator (para. 3);
       (d) Developing and promoting global, regional and bilateral cooperation among
            relevant agencies to combat money-laundering (para. 5).

140. Article 14, paragraph 1 (a), requires that States parties establish a regulatory and
supervisory regime within their competence in order to prevent and detect money-
laundering activities. This regime must be comprehensive, but the precise nature and
particular elements of the regime are left to States, provided that they require, at a
minimum, banks and non-bank financial institutions to ensure:

     (a) Effective customer identification;
     (b) Accurate record-keeping;
     (c) A mechanism for the reporting of suspicious transactions.

141. The requirements extend to banks, non-bank financial institutions (e.g. insurance
companies and securities firms) and, where appropriate, other bodies that are especially
susceptible to money-laundering (art. 14, para. 1 (a)). The interpretative notes add that
other bodies may be understood to include intermediaries, which in some jurisdictions
may include stockbrokering firms, other securities dealers, currency exchange bureaux or
currency brokers (A/58/422/Add.1, para. 18). An addition to the equivalent provisions in
the Organized Crime Convention is that financial institutions include "natural or legal
persons that provide formal or informal services for the transmission of money or value"
(art. 14, para. 1 (a)). This is a reference to concerns about both formal remitters and
informal value-transfer systems, such as the hawala networks that originated in South Asia
and have become global in recent decades. These channels offer valuable services to
expatriates and their families, but are also vulnerable to abuse by criminals, including
corrupt public officials.

142. Thus, this regime should apply not only to banking institutions, but also to areas of
commerce where high turnover and large volumes make money-laundering likely.
Previous experience shows that money-laundering activities have taken place in the real
estate sector and in the trade of commodities, such as gold, precious stones and tobacco.

143. In many forums, the list of institutions is being expanded beyond financial
institutions to include businesses and professions related to real estate and commodities.
For example, recommendation 12 of the FATF Forty Recommendations extends, when
certain conditions are met, the requirements of customer due diligence and record-
keeping to casinos, real estate agents, dealers in precious metals and stones, lawyers,
notaries, other independent legal professionals and accountants and trust and company
service providers. Similar requirements are set forth in article 1 of Directive 2005/60/EC
adopted by the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union on 26
October 2005.

144. More recently, increased attention has been focused on money service businesses and
informal value-transfer systems, such as hawala and hundi. In a growing number of
jurisdictions, these are also subject to a regulatory regime for the purposes of detecting
money-laundering, terrorist financing or other offences.

145. Customer identification entails requirements that holders of accounts in financial
institutions and all parties to financial transactions be identified and documented.
Records should contain sufficient information to identify all parties and the nature of the

                                                                                                         339
GLOBAL CORRUPTION

 transaction, identify specific assets and the amounts or values involved, and permit the
 tracing of the source and destination of all funds or other assets.

 146. The requirement for record-keeping means that client and transaction records should
 be kept for a specified minimum period of time. For example, under the FATF Forty
 Recommendations, at least five years is recommended, while for States parties to the
 International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism, retention of
 records for five years is mandatory.

 147. Suspicious transactions are to be notified to the FIU or other designated agency.
 Criteria for identifying suspicious transactions should be developed and periodically
 reviewed in consultation with experts knowledgeable about new methods or networks
 used by money launderers.

 148. The interpretative notes indicate that the words "suspicious transactions" may be
 understood to include unusual transactions that, by reason of their amount, characteristics
 and frequency, are inconsistent with the customer's business activity, exceed the normally
 accepted parameters of the market or have no clear legal basis and could constitute or be
 connected with unlawful activities in general (A/58/422/Add.1, para. 19). The
 International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism defines
 suspicious transactions as all complex, unusually large transactions and unusual patterns
 of transactions, which have no apparent economic or obviously lawful purpose (General
 Assembly resolution 54/109, annex, art. 18, para. 1 (b) (iii)).

 149. The powers to be granted to regulators and staff of the FIU to inspect records and to
 compel the assistance of record keepers in locating the records must also be defined. As
 some of these records may be covered by confidentiality requirements and banking
 secrecy laws that prohibit their disclosure, provisions freeing financial institutions from
 complying with such requirements and laws may be considered. Drafters should also
 ensure that the inspection and disclosure requirements are written in such a way as to
 protect financial institutions against civil and other claims for disclosing client records to
 regulators and FIUs.

 150. The implementation of such measures is likely to require legislation. In particular,
 the requirement that financial institutions must disclose suspicious transactions and the
 protection of those who make disclosures in good faith will require legislation to override
 banking secrecy laws (see also paras. 1-3 of art. 52, on the prevention and detection of
 transfers of proceeds of crime).

        (b) Domestic and international cooperation

 151. Coordination of efforts and international cooperation is as central to the problem of
 money-laundering as it is to the other offences covered by the Convention against
 Corruption. Beyond the general measures and processes such as extradition, mutual legal
 assistance, joint investigations and asset recovery (which are covered in detail in the

340                                                                                              2022
                                                                CHAPTER 4 MONEY LAUNDERING

sections on international cooperation in chapter IV and asset recovery in chapter V,
below), the Convention seeks to strengthen such coordination and cooperation.

152. Article 14, paragraph 1 (b), requires that administrative, regulatory, law enforcement
and other domestic authorities in charge of the efforts against money-laundering are able
to cooperate at both the national and international level. This includes the exchange of
information within the conditions prescribed by their domestic law. This must be done
without limiting or detracting from (or in the words of the Convention, "without
prejudice to") the requirements generated by article 46 (Mutual legal assistance).

153. In order for cooperation to be possible, domestic capabilities must be developed for
the identification, collection and interpretation of all relevant information. Essentially,
three types of entity may be part of a strategy to combat money-laundering and could,
thus, be considered by States:

     (a) Regulatory agencies responsible for the oversight of financial institutions, such
          as banks or insurance entities, with powers to inspect financial institutions and
          enforce regulatory requirements through the imposition of regulatory or
          administrative remedies or sanctions;

     (b) Law enforcement agencies responsible for conducting criminal investigations,
          with investigative powers and powers to arrest and detain suspected offenders
          and that are subject to judicial or other safeguards;

     (c) FIUs, which are not required under the Convention, whose powers are usually
          limited to receiving reports of suspicious transactions, analysing them and
          disseminating information to prosecution agencies, although some such units
          have wider powers (see more on FIUs in sect. V.E, below).

154. The authority of each entity to cooperate with national bodies and with other similar
agencies in other States is usually specified in the relevant legislation. If States do have
such entities, legislation may be needed to amend existing mandates and the division of
labour among these entities, in accordance with each State's constitutional or other
principles and the specificities of its financial services sector.

155. Some of these measures may constitute a strong challenge for countries in which the
financial sector is not heavily regulated and the necessary legislation and administrative
infrastructure may have to be created. It is essential to note, however, that the relevance
and utility of these arrangements are not limited to the control of money-laundering, but
also to corruption. They also strengthen confidence in the financial infrastructure, which
is instrumental to sustainable social and economic development.

156. The remaining provisions of this article are also closely connected to domestic and
international cooperation, and are examined below, as they are not mandatory under the
Convention.

Optional requirements: obligation to consider

                                                                                                         341
GLOBAL CORRUPTION

        (a) Financial intelligence units

 157. Article 14, paragraph 1 (b), requires States parties to consider the establishment of
 FIUs to serve as a national centre for the collection, analysis and dissemination of
 information regarding potential money-laundering. Since the 1990s, many States have
 established such units as part of their regulatory police or other authorities. There is a
 wide range of structure, responsibilities, functions and departmental affiliation or
 independence for such units. According to the interpretative notes, the call for the
 establishment of an FIU is intended for cases where such a mechanism does not yet exist
 (A/58/422/Add.1, para. 20).

 158. The Egmont Group (an informal association of FIUs) has defined such units as a
 central, national agency responsible for receiving (and, as permitted, requesting),
 analysing and disseminating to the competent authorities, disclosures of financial
 information (a) concerning suspected proceeds of crime; or (b) required by national
 legislation or regulation; in order to counter money laundering.52

 159. The Convention does not require that an FIU be established by law, but legislation
 may still be required to institute the obligation to report suspicious transactions to such a
 unit and to protect financial institutions that disclose such information in good faith (see
 also art. 58, on FIUs). In practice, the vast majority of FIUs are established by law. If it is
 decided to draft such legislation, States may wish to consider including the following
 elements:

       (a) Specification of the institutions that are subject to the obligation to report
            suspicious transactions and definition of the information to be reported to the
            unit;

       (b) Legislation defining the powers under which the unit can compel the assistance
            of reporting institutions to follow up on incomplete or inadequate reports;

       (c) Authorization for the unit to disseminate information to law enforcement
            agencies when it has evidence warranting prosecution and authority for the unit
            to communicate financial intelligence information to foreign agencies, under
            certain conditions;

       (d) Protection of the confidentiality of information received by the unit, establishing
            limits on the uses to which it may be put and shielding the unit from further

            seizure, disposal of proceeds, as well as provisions on asset recovery, as
            necessary.

 160. It is worth noting that actions taken to conform to article 14 may also bring States into
 conformity with other conventions and initiatives, such as Security Council resolution
 1373 (2001), the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of
 Terrorism, the Organized Crime Convention and the FATF Nine Special
 Recommendations on Terrorist Financing.

 161. Further information about various options that can be included in laws, regulations
 and procedures to combat money-laundering can be obtained from the Anti-Money-
 Laundering Unit of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.

        (b) Other measures

 162. As part of the effort to develop the capacity to provide effective international
 cooperation, States are required to consider the introduction of feasible measures aimed
 at monitoring the cross-border movement of cash and other monetary instruments (art.
 14, para. 2). The goal of such measures would be to allow States to detect and monitor the
 movement of cash and appropriate negotiable instruments across their borders, subject to
 safeguards to ensure proper use of information and without impeding in any way the
 movement of legitimate capital. Such measures may include a requirement that
 individuals and businesses report the cross-border transfer of substantial quantities of
 cash appropriate negotiable instruments. Generally, structures based on monitoring or
 surveillance will require legal powers giving inspectors or investigators access to
 information on cross-border transactions, in particular in cases where criminal behaviour
 is suspected.53

 163. Article 14, paragraph 3, contains provisions going beyond the Organized Crime
 Convention. It requires that States consider the implementation of measures obliging
 financial institutions, including money remitters:

       (a) To include on forms for the electronic transfer of funds and related messages
            accurate and meaningful information on the originator;

       (b) To maintain such information throughout the payment chain; and
       (c) To apply enhanced scrutiny to transfers of funds that do not contain complete

            information on the originator.

 164. The concern is essentially about the identification of remitters and beneficiaries on
 the one hand and the traceability of the transaction on the other. There are no exact
 estimates on the extent of funds transferred across national borders, especially with
 respect to informal remitters, who are popular in many countries. Given that they range
 in the tens of billions of United States dollars, however, it is an area of regulatory concern.

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

 165. As mentioned above, the Convention against Corruption builds on parallel
 international initiatives to combat money-laundering. In establishing a domestic
 regulatory and supervisory regime, States parties are called upon to use as a guideline the
 relevant initiatives of regional, interregional and multilateral organizations against
 money-laundering (art. 14, para. 4). An interpretative note states that during the
 negotiations, the words "relevant initiatives of regional, interregional and multilateral
 organizations" were understood to refer in particular to the Forty Recommendations and
 the Eight54 Special Recommendations of the FATF, as revised in 2003 and 2001,
 respectively, and, in addition, to other existing initiatives of regional, interregional and
 multilateral organizations against money-laundering, such as the Caribbean Financial
 Action Task Force, the Commonwealth, the Council of Europe, the Eastern and Southern
 African Anti-Money-Laundering Group, the European Union, the Financial Action Task
 Force of South America against Money Laundering and the Organization of American
 States" (A/58/422/Add.1, para. 21).

 166. Ultimately, States are free to determine the best way to implement article 14.
 However, the development of a relationship with one of the organizations working to
 combat money-laundering would be important for effective implementation.

 167. In implementing article 14, paragraph 4, States may wish to consider some specific
 elements relative to the measures that the comprehensive regulatory regime must include.
 The Forty Recommendations are useful in this regard, as are model regulations that have
 been prepared by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and the Organization of
 American States (see sect. II.G (Information resources) at the end of this chapter of the
 guide).

 168. Furthermore, paragraph 5 of article 14 requires that States endeavour to develop and
 promote global, regional, subregional and bilateral cooperation among judicial, law
 enforcement and financial regulatory authorities in order to combat money-laundering.55

                                                                 END OF EXCERPT

4.2 OECD Convention

The OECD Convention does not deal extensively with money laundering, but it does touch
on the issue in the two articles reproduced below:

          legislation shall do so on the same terms for the bribery of a foreign public
          official, without regard to the place where the bribery occurred.

          Article 8: Accounting

          In order to combat bribery of foreign public officials effectively, each Party
          shall take such measures as may be necessary, within the framework of its
          laws and regulations regarding the maintenance of books and records,
          financial statement disclosures, and accounting and auditing standards, to
          prohibit the establishment of off-the-books accounts, the making of off-
          the-books or inadequately identified transactions, the recording of non-
          existent expenditures, the entry of liabilities with incorrect identification of
          their object, as well as the use of false documents, by companies subject to
          those laws and regulations, for the purpose of bribing foreign public
          officials or of hiding such bribery.

          Each Party shall provide effective, proportionate and dissuasive civil,
          administrative or criminal penalties for such omissions and falsifications
          in respect of the books, records, accounts and financial statements of such
          companies.

The OECD acknowledges that the FATF is the international standard setter in the
development and promotion of policies to combat money laundering and terrorist financing,
and that the OECD's work on tax crime and money laundering is designed to complement
that of the FATF. The FATF recommendations covered in the following section, provide a
more comprehensive treatment of money laundering and the measures that states can take
to combat it.

4.3 FATF Recommendations

The latest version of the FATF Recommendations was released in 2012, and amended in
2021.56 There are 40 recommendations in this new version, which merged the original 40
recommendations (issued in 1996) with nine additional 2003 recommendations (on
countering terrorism financing).57 The Recommendations also include interpretive notes.
The following excerpt from Paul Allan Schott's Reference Guide to Anti-Money Laundering and
Combating the Financing of Terrorism,58 provides a general introduction to the FATF and the
Recommendations. The following excerpt is based on the 2003 version of the Forty
Recommendations, but it does not affect the validity of the general comments set out.

 [Chapter III: International Standard Setters, pp. III-7 to III-12]

 Formed in 1989 by the G-7 countries,59 the Financial Action Task Force on Money
 Laundering (FATF) is an intergovernmental body whose purpose is to develop and
 promote an international response to combat money laundering.60 In October of 2001,
 FATF expanded its mission to include combating the financing of terrorism.61

 FATF is a policy-making body, which brings together legal, financial and law enforcement
 experts to achieve national legislation and regulatory AML and CFT reforms. Currently,
 its membership consists of 31 [now 37] countries and territories and two regional
 organizations.62 In addition, FATF works in collaboration with a number of international
 bodies63 and organizations.64 These entities have observer status with FATF, which does
 not entitle them to vote, but otherwise permits full participation in plenary sessions and
 working groups.

 FATF's three primary functions with regard to money laundering are:

    1. monitoring members' progress in implementing anti-money laundering measures;

62 [33] The 31 member countries and territories are: Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil,
Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong-China, Iceland, Ireland, Italy,
Japan, Luxemburg, Mexico, Kingdom of the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Russia,
Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, United Kingdom, and United States.
The two regional organizations are the European Commission and the Gulf Co-operation Council.
63 [34] The international bodies are regional FATF-style regional bodies (FSRBs) that have similar
form and functions to those of FATF. Some FATF members also participate in the FSRBs. These
bodies are: Asia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering (APG), Caribbean Financial Action Task Force
(CFATF), Council of Europe MONEYVAL (previously PC-R-EV) Committee, Eastern and Southern
Africa Anti-Money Laundering Group (ESAAMLG) and Financial Action Task Force on Money
Laundering in South America (GAFISUD). For a discussion of these organizations, See Chapter IV,
Regional Bodies and Relevant Groups, FATF- Style Regional Bodies. FATF also works with the
Egmont Group.
64 [35] Each of the international organizations, which have, among other functions, a specific anti-
money laundering mission or function, are: African Development Bank, Asia Development Bank,
The Commonwealth Secretariat, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, European
Central Bank (ECB), Europol, Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), Intergovernmental Action
Group Against Money-Laundering in Africa (GIABA), International Association of Insurance

    2. reviewing and reporting on laundering trends, techniques and counter- measures;
          and

    3. promoting the adoption and implementation of FATF anti-money laundering
          standards globally.

 1. The Forty Recommendations

 FATF has adopted a set of 40 recommendations, The Forty Recommendations on Money
 Laundering (The Forty Recommendations), which constitute a comprehensive framework for
 AML and are designed for universal application by countries throughout the world.65 The
 Forty Recommendations set out principles for action; they permit a country flexibility in
 implementing the principles according to the country's own particular circumstances and
 constitutional requirements. Although not binding as law upon a country, The Forty
 Recommendations have been widely endorsed by the international community and relevant
 organizations as the international standard for AML.

 The Forty Recommendations are actually mandates for action by a country if that country
 wants to be viewed by the international community as meeting international standards.
 The individual recommendations are discussed in detail throughout this Reference Guide
 and, particularly in Chapters V, VI, VII, and VIII.

 The Forty Recommendations were initially issued in 1990 and have been revised in 1996 and
 2003 to take account of new developments in money laundering and to reflect developing
 best practices internationally. [The current version of the Forty Recommendations was
 revised in 2012.]

 2. Monitoring Members Progress

 Monitoring the progress of members to comply with the requirements of The Forty
 Recommendations is facilitated by a two-stage process: self assessments and mutual
 evaluations. In the self-assessment stage, each member responds to a standard
 questionnaire, on an annual basis, regarding its implementation of The Forty
 Recommendations. In the mutual evaluation stage, each member is examined and assessed
 by experts from other member countries.

 In the event that a country is unwilling to take appropriate steps to achieve compliance
 with The Forty Recommendations, FATF recommends that all financial institutions give
 special attention to business relations and transactions with persons, including companies
 and financial institutions, from such non-compliant countries and, where appropriate,
 report questionable transactions, i.e., those that have no apparent economic or visible
 lawful purpose, to competent authorities.66 Ultimately, if a member country does not take

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

 steps to achieve compliance, membership in the organization can be suspended. There is,
 however, the process of peer pressure before these sanctions are enforced.

 3. Reporting on Money Laundering Trends and Techniques

 One of FATF's functions is to review and report on money laundering trends, techniques
 and methods (also referred to as typologies). To accomplish this aspect of its mission,
 FATF issues annual reports on developments in money laundering through its Typologies
 Report.67 These reports are very useful for all countries, not just FATF members, to keep
 current with new techniques or trends to launder money and for other developments in
 this area.

 4. The NCCT List

 One of FATF's objectives is to promote the adoption of international AML/CFT standards
 for all countries. Thus, its mission extends beyond its own membership, although FATF
 can only sanction its member countries and territories. Thus, in order to encourage all
 countries to adopt measures to prevent, detect and prosecute money launderers, i.e., to
 implement The Forty Recommendations, FATF has adopted a process of identifying those
 jurisdictions that serve as obstacles to international cooperation in this area. The process
 uses 25 criteria, which are consistent with The Forty Recommendations, to identify such non-
 cooperative countries and territories (NCCT's) and place them on a publicly available
 list.68

 ...

 [In response to criticisms levied against the use of the NCCT list, the last country on the
 NCCT list was removed in 2006, and no new states have been reviewed by the FATF under
 the NCCT criteria since 2001. Many felt that the NCCT focused attention unfairly on
 smaller, less powerful nations while ignoring the failings of more powerful countries such
 as the United States. Since it is no longer relevant, the remainder of the section on the
 NCCT list has not been included in this excerpt. However, the FATF has continued to
 issue public statements on high-risk and non-compliant countries. This list presently
 includes Iran, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and Algeria. It is available at:
 http://www.fatf-gafi.org/topics/high-riskandnon-cooperativejurisdictions/]

 5. Terrorist Financing

 FATF also focuses its expertise on the world-wide effort to combat terrorist financing. To
 accomplish this expanded mission FATF has adopted nine Special Recommendations on

 Terrorist Financing (Special Recommendations).69 As part of this effort, FATF members use a
 self-assessment questionnaire of their country's actions to come into compliance with the
 Special Recommendations.70 FATF is continuing to develop guidance on techniques and
 mechanisms used in the financing of terrorism.

                                                                 END OF EXCERPT

The FATF prepares guidance and best practices documents to assist states in implementing
the Recommendations.71

4.4 European Union Money Laundering Directives

In addition to the supra-national AML requirements of the UN, the FATF, and the OECD,
which have evolved into international norms, there are also important regional AML
regimes. The most influential is that of the European Union, which began issuing AML
Directives to its member nations in 1990. As of January 10, 2020, each member state of the
EU is required to implement the provisions of the Fifth Money Laundering Directive.72 A
new, sixth directive is being drafted in 2021. Although only applicable within the EU, these
directives have considerable influence elsewhere, both for nations that trade with EU
countries and for their suasive impact.73

5. STATE-LEVEL AML REGIMES: US, UK, AND CANADA

5.1 Essential Elements of AML Regimes

While the FATF Recommendations provide a global standard for AML measures, these
recommendations must be put into place at the state level to be effective. The global
effectiveness of the AML regime depends on a degree of standardization, but each state must
also create a regime that fits within its domestic legal framework and policy goals. As a

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

result, despite many shared elements, there is significant variation between different state-
level AML regimes.

The overall goal of state-level AML regimes is to allow centralized monitoring of the
financial sector. The recommended set of laws and policies contained in the FATF
Recommendations is intended to enable a calibrated degree of state surveillance and
intelligence gathering across the financial sector. Data concerning suspicious transactions is
transmitted to a central organization for analysis and selected information is then passed to
law enforcement agencies for investigation. In general, the goal is to create a system in which
suspicious transactions or patterns of transactions are promptly detected and thoroughly
investigated, preventing the abuse of financial institutions by organized crime and corrupt
officials.

There are three principal elements in a state-level AML regime, each of which is dealt with
in a separate section below. The first element is a Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU). FIUs are
central, national-level organizations that collect and analyze information concerning
suspicious transactions reported by financial institutions. They pass selected information
along to the appropriate law enforcement agencies for investigation.

The second element of a state-level AML regime is regulation of the financial sector, which
requires financial institutions to report information to the FIU. There are three basic aspects
of this regulatory framework. The first is customer due diligence measures (CDD), which
require financial institutions to collect identifying information from each of their customers.
The second is record keeping requirements, which require financial institutions to retain all
information collected for at least five years. The final aspect is transaction reporting
requirements, which require financial institutions to report certain transactions to their
respective FIUs.

The third element of a state-level AML regime is the creation of tools that law enforcement
agencies and prosecution authorities can use to effectively investigate and prosecute money
launderers once their activities are detected. These include the creation of stand-alone
criminal offences for money laundering to enable the prosecution of launderers. In theory,
the three elements discussed should create a state-level regime in which money laundering
can be effectively combated through cooperation between the financial sector, the FIU, and
law enforcement agencies.

While the three elements described above are present in all state-level AML regimes that
conform to the FATF recommendations, how each is put into place varies considerably from
country to country. The following section surveys the state-level AML regimes in the US,
Canada, and the UK, comparing and contrasting the different approaches taken in each
jurisdiction. Each subsection begins by reproducing the appropriate FATF recommendation,
and then briefly discusses how the recommendation has been enacted by each of the three
governments.74

5.2 Financial Intelligence Units

      5.2.1 FATF Recommendations

Recommendation 29 of the FATF suggests that each member state create a financial
intelligence unit (FIU) as part of its AML regime. These FIUs cooperate internationally
through their membership in the Egmont Group, an informal network whose membership
currently exceeds 160 state-level FIUs. The Egmont Group's website75 provides a library of
research reports produced by the organization as well as sanitized cases from member FIUs.

The full text of Recommendation 29 is reproduced below:

          29. Financial intelligence units

          Countries should establish a financial intelligence unit (FIU) that serves as
          a national centre for the receipt and analysis of: (a) suspicious transaction
          reports; and (b) other information relevant to money laundering, associated
          predicate offences and terrorist financing, and for the dissemination of the
          results of that analysis. The FIU should be able to obtain additional
          information from reporting entities, and should have access on a timely
          basis to the financial, administrative and law enforcement information that
          it requires to undertake its functions properly.

There is considerable scope available to states in implementing Recommendation 29. It
simply recommends the creation of a central organization that collects and analyzes reports
of suspicious transactions and "other information." Some states have chosen to create FIUs
with a broad range of powers, while others have taken a minimalist approach. Furthermore,
there is nothing in the recommendation to indicate how the FIU should relate to other
government agencies, or who it should report to. States have made different choices in this
regard as well. The following section briefly discusses and compares the FIUs created by the
UK, the US, and Canada respectively.

The US FIU is known as the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN).76 Canada,
displaying US influence, chose the name Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre
of Canada (FINTRAC).77 The UK, taking a more prosaic approach, named its FIU the UK

of the Treasury79 and FINTRAC to the Minister of Finance.80 In contrast, UKFIU is situated
within the law enforcement apparatus of the UK (in an indication of this embedded role, the
organization does not have its own website). It forms part of the National Crime Agency
(NCA). The NCA website describes its function as follows:

          The NCA has a wide remit. We tackle serious and organised crime,
          strengthen our borders, fight fraud and cyber crime, and protect children
          and young people from sexual abuse and exploitation. We provide
          leadership in these areas through our organised crime, border policing,
          economic crime and CEOP commands, the National Cyber Crime Unit and
          specialist capability teams. The NCA works closely with partners to deliver
          operational results. We have an international role to cut serious and
          organised crime impacting on the UK through our network of international
          liaison officers.81

Had the US and Canada taken a similar approach, their FIUs would have been created as
specialist bodies within federal law enforcement. Instead, FINCEN and FINTRAC have
considerably more autonomy from law enforcement than UKFIU, as well as broader powers.

      5.2.2 US

Established under the Bank Secrecy Act, FINCEN performs a variety of functions, covering
data gathering, regulation, research, and analysis. Its website describes the organization's
powers as follows:

          Congress has given FinCEN certain duties and responsibilities for the
          central collection, analysis, and dissemination of data reported under
          FinCEN's regulations and other related data in support of government and
          financial industry partners at the Federal, State, local, and international
          levels. To fulfill its responsibilities toward the detection and deterrence of
          financial crime, FinCEN:

                 Issues and interprets regulations authorized by statute;

                 Supports and enforces compliance with those regulations;

                 Supports, coordinates, and analyzes data regarding compliance
                     examination functions delegated to other Federal regulators;

                 Manages the collection, processing, storage, dissemination, and
                     protection of data filed under FinCEN's reporting requirements;

                 Maintains a government-wide access service to FinCEN's data,
                     and networks users with overlapping interests;

                 Supports law enforcement investigations and prosecutions;

                 Synthesizes data to recommend internal and external allocation of
                     resources to areas of greatest financial crime risk;

                 Shares information and coordinates with foreign financial
                     intelligence unit (FIU) counterparts on AML/CFT efforts; and

                 Conducts analysis to support policymakers; law enforcement,
                     regulatory, and intelligence agencies; FIUs; and the financial
                     industry.82

Under the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), FinCEN can bring enforcement actions for BSA
violations.83 For example, in May 2015, a FinCEN enforcement action led to the imposition
of a $700,000 fine on a virtual currency exchange company that lacked an AML program.84
In June 2015, FinCEN fined a casino in the Northern Mariana Islands $75 million for its
failure to institute an AML program, hire compliance staff, and create procedures for
detecting suspicious transactions.85 In July 2015, FinCEN imposed "special measure five" on
Tanzania-based FBME Bank Ltd, meaning US financial institutions are barred from
"opening or maintaining correspondent accounts or payable through accounts for or on
behalf of FBME."86 FinCEN alleges that FBME is being used to facilitate money laundering
and that high-risk shell companies are among its customers.87 The bank expressed outrage
at the ban and claimed it did not receive adequate notice, although FinCEN issued a notice
in July 2014 warning that FBME was a primary money laundering concern and could be
subject to a final ban.88 See the FinCEN website for a full list of enforcement actions.89

      5.2.3 UK

The UK's FIU responsibilities were transferred from the Serious Organized Crime Agency
to the National Crime Agency (NCA) in 2013 with the passing of the Crime and Courts Act.
In contrast to FinCEN, the NCA website simply states: "The UK Financial Intelligence Unit

intelligence gathered from Suspicious Activity Reports."90 While FinCEN and FINTRAC
also handle suspicious activity (US) or suspicious transaction (Canada) reports, which will
be discussed in more detail in the following section, they also do a great deal more. UKFIU's
mandate is narrower, likely due to its integration within the state's law enforcement
apparatus. FinCEN and FINTRAC have broader mandates and greater organizational
independence.

      5.2.4 Canada

FINTRAC was created by the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act
(PCMLTFA) of 2000.91 This enabling legislation has been amended numerous times however
it has also spawned a number of regulations which provide greater detail of reporting
requirements and related matters.92 Important amendments were made to the regulations in
2019.93 In addition to the statute and regulations, FINTRAC issues numerous rules and
policy statements, which reporting entities must track to ensure continued compliance. A
good source of those changes is FINTRAC's own news releases.94

Similarly to its US counterpart, FINTRAC's description of its function is comprehensive,
covering data gathering, analysis, and research. The organization's website states:

          Our mandate is to facilitate the detection, prevention and deterrence of
          money laundering and the financing of terrorist activities, while ensuring
          the protection of personal information under our control. We fulfill our
          mandate through the following activities:

             Receiving financial transaction reports and voluntary information on
                 money laundering and terrorist financing in accordance with the
                 legislation and regulations and safeguarding personal information

FINTRAC is authorized by legislation to provide information to foreign FIUs, and also
receives information from FIUs and law enforcement agencies in other jurisdictions.96

FINTRAC has broad powers to search premises, other than a dwelling-house, without
warrant, investigate and report to police authorities.97 Terence D. Hall notes that "[t]here is
a tension between the values placed on privacy and the protection of personal information
and the public policy goals of deterring criminal activity and the financing of terrorism by
requiring the collection and disclosure of personal and proprietary information."98 During
its 2017 audit, Canada's Privacy Commissioner, reported that FINTRAC "continues to
receive and retain personal information outside of the legislated thresholds for reporting."99

5.3 Regulation of Financial Institutions and Professionals

      5.3.1 Customer Due Diligence

FATF Recommendation 10 deals with customer due diligence (CDD) measures. The essence
of CDD is requiring financial institutions to ascertain whom they are dealing with for each
major transaction. The full text of the recommendation is reproduced below:

                                                            BEGINNING OF EXCERPT

 Financial institutions should be prohibited from keeping anonymous accounts or
 accounts in obviously fictitious names.

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

 Financial institutions should be required to undertake customer due diligence (CDD)
 measures when:

       (i) establishing business relations;
       (ii) carrying out occasional transactions: (i) above the applicable designated

               threshold (USD/EUR 15,000); or (ii) that are wire transfers in the circumstances
               covered by the Interpretive Note to Recommendation 16;
       (iii) there is a suspicion of money laundering or terrorist financing; or
       (iv) the financial institution has doubts about the veracity or adequacy of
               previously obtained customer identification data.

 The principle that financial institutions should conduct CDD should be set out in law.
 Each country may determine how it imposes specific CDD obligations, either through law
 or enforceable means.

 The CDD measures to be taken are as follows:

       (a) Identifying the customer and verifying that customer's identity using reliable,
            independent source documents, data or information.

       (b) Identifying the beneficial owner, and taking reasonable measures to verify the
            identity of the beneficial owner, such that the financial institution is satisfied
            that it knows who the beneficial owner is. For legal persons and arrangements
            this should include financial institutions understanding the ownership and
            control structure of the customer.

       (c) Understanding and, as appropriate, obtaining information on the purpose and
            intended nature of the business relationship.

       (d) Conducting ongoing due diligence on the business relationship and scrutiny of
            transactions undertaken throughout the course of that relationship to ensure
            that the transactions being conducted are consistent with the institution's
            knowledge of the customer, their business and risk profile, including, where
            necessary, the source of funds.

 Financial institutions should be required to apply each of the CDD measures under (a) to
 (d) above, but should determine the extent of such measures using a risk-based approach
 (RBA) in accordance with the Interpretive Notes to this Recommendation and to
 Recommendation 1.

 Financial institutions should be required to verify the identity of the customer and
 beneficial owner before or during the course of establishing a business relationship or
 conducting transactions for occasional customers. Countries may permit financial
 institutions to complete the verification as soon as reasonably practicable following the
 establishment of the relationship, where the money laundering and terrorist financing
 risks are effectively managed and where this is essential not to interrupt the normal
 conduct of business.

356                                                                                              2022
                                                                  CHAPTER 4 MONEY LAUNDERING

 Where the financial institution is unable to comply with the applicable requirements
 under paragraphs (a) to (d) above (subject to appropriate modification of the extent of the
 measures on a risk-based approach), it should be required not to open the account,
 commence business relations or perform the transaction; or should be required to
 terminate the business relationship; and should consider making a suspicious transactions
 report in relation to the customer.

 These requirements should apply to all new customers, although financial institutions
 should also apply this Recommendation to existing customers on the basis of materiality
 and risk, and should conduct due diligence on such existing relationships at appropriate
 times.

                                                                 END OF EXCERPT

As discussed in the first section of this chapter, PEPs launder large amounts of
misappropriated government funds and bribes every year. Because of the particular risks
associated with PEPs, FATF Recommendation 12, set out below, requires enhanced due
diligence when dealing with them as customers:

                                                            BEGINNING OF EXCERPT

 12. Politically exposed persons

 Financial institutions should be required, in relation to foreign politically exposed persons
 (PEPs) (whether as customer or beneficial owner), in addition to performing normal
 customer due diligence measures, to:

       (a) have appropriate risk-management systems to determine whether the customer
            or the beneficial owner is a politically exposed person;

       (b) obtain senior management approval for establishing (or continuing, for existing
            customers) such business relationships;

       (c) take reasonable measures to establish the source of wealth and source of funds;
            and

       (d) conduct enhanced ongoing monitoring of the business relationship.

 Financial institutions should be required to take reasonable measures to determine
 whether a customer or beneficial owner is a domestic PEP or a person who is or has been
 entrusted with a prominent function by an international organisation. In cases of a higher
 risk business relationship with such persons, financial institutions should be required to
 apply the measures referred to in paragraphs (b), (c) and (d).

                                                                 END OF EXCERPT

                                                                                                          357
GLOBAL CORRUPTION

Both the UK and Canada have created comprehensive regulatory frameworks to implement
the above recommendations.100 They require financial institutions to collect and record
personal information about their customers. As suggested by the FATF, both also require
banks to conduct ongoing monitoring of the customer relationship and to take steps to
identify the beneficial owners of customers that are organizations. Finally, both Canada and
the UK require financial institutions to take steps to determine if their customers are PEPs
and require enhanced due diligence in such cases.101 The PEP concept has been criticized by
some for its vagueness. Different definitions are used internationally, and challenges arise
in determining who fits each definition. Financial institutions must choose where to draw
the line, which is often far from clear cut.102

US regulations require financial institutions to set up a Customer Identification Program
(CIP) to determine the identity of each customer.103 In 2016, FINCEN issued final rules under
the Bank Secrecy Act to clarify and strengthen CDD requirements. The rules, which came into
effect in 2018, included a new requirement to identify and verify the identity of beneficial
owners of legal entity customers, subject to certain exclusions and exemptions. Furthermore,
the US requires enhanced CDD in the case of correspondent accounts created by US banks
for non-US persons. These measures include a requirement to determine beneficial
ownership of any organizations involved and to determine whether the account holder is a
Senior Foreign Political Figure (the US statutory language, roughly equivalent to PEP).104

      5.3.2 Transaction Reporting

FATF Recommendation 20 expects states to create legal requirements for financial
institutions to report any suspicious transactions to their respective FIUs:

100 In the UK, see the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, c 22 [POCA], and the Money Laundering Regulations
2007, SI 2007/2157 [UK ML Regulations]. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is the authority
responsible for supervising compliance with the Money Laundering Regulations by most financial
firms and organisations. For more detail, see the resources available at the FCA website: "Financial
Conduct Authority" (last visited 8 August 2021), online: FCA <http://www.fca.org.uk/>. See also

          20. Reporting of suspicious transactions

          If a financial institution suspects or has reasonable grounds to suspect that
          funds are the proceeds of a criminal activity, or are related to terrorist
          financing, it should be required, by law, to report promptly its suspicions
          to the financial intelligence unit (FIU).

Following this recommendation, Canada, the US, and the UK require financial institutions
to report all suspicious transactions to their FIUs. However, there are some significant
variations between the different reporting regimes. The UK only requires that all suspicious
transactions be reported to UKFIU.105 The US and Canada have similar requirements,106 but
both countries also require that large transactions over $10,000 be reported to their
respective FIUs.107 All three countries have threshold-based reporting of cash or monetary
instruments crossing the border that exceeds 10,000 dollars (US, Canada) or pounds (UK).
Other than at the border, the UK has taken a strict risk-based approach to transaction
reporting, while Canada and the US have supplemented this with threshold-based reporting
requirements. However, this should not be taken to mean that the UK's regime is weaker.
Their reporting requirements are backed up with harsh sanctions for failure to report
suspicious transactions.108 Failure to disclose can result in up to five years imprisonment or
a fine, or both. While the UK has taken a slightly different approach, it is not a more lenient
one, and this "fear factor" has led to a dramatic increase in SAR submissions. However,
critics claim that the high cost of compliance with the UK's SAR regime is disproportionate
to its effectiveness.109

      5.3.3 Record-Keeping

The final piece of the regulatory regime proposed by the FATF Recommendations is the
requirement for financial institutions to retain transaction records and customer information
for at least five years. This requirement is set out in Recommendation 11:

          11. Record-keeping

          Financial institutions should be required to maintain, for at least five
          years, all necessary records on transactions, both domestic and
          international, to enable them to comply swiftly with information requests
          from the competent authorities. Such records must be sufficient to permit
          reconstruction of individual transactions (including the amounts and
          types of currency involved, if any) so as to provide, if necessary, evidence
          for prosecution of criminal activity.

          Financial institutions should be required to keep all records obtained

          results of any analysis undertaken (e.g. inquiries to establish the
          background and purpose of complex, unusual large transactions), for at
          least five years after the business relationship is ended, or after the date of
          the occasional transaction.

          Financial institutions should be required by law to maintain records on
          transactions and information obtained through the CDD measures.

          The CDD information and the transaction records should be available to
          domestic competent authorities upon appropriate authority.

The US, UK, and Canada all require financial institutions to store records for five years in
accordance with Recommendation 11.110 While the information stored in these records will
vary slightly based on differences in their respective CDD regimes, there are no significant
variations with regard to the record-keeping requirements themselves.

5.4 Offences

      5.4.1 FATF Recommendations and UNCAC

FATF Recommendation 3 expects states to create offences to directly criminalize money
laundering. The recommendation is reproduced below, along with an interpretive note.
FATF Recommendation 3 on money laundering was produced in the original 2003 FATF
Forty Recommendations. It was drafted on the basis of two existing UN Conventions: the
1998 Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Convention and the 2000 Transnational
Organized Crime Convention. The money laundering provisions in those two conventions
are now consolidated in the money laundering provisions in UNCAC. FATF
Recommendation 3 provides:

          3. Money laundering offence

          Countries should criminalise money laundering on the basis of the Vienna
          Convention and the Palermo Convention. Countries should apply the
          crime of money laundering to all serious offences, with a view to including
          the widest range of predicate offences.

          Interpretive Note to Recommendation 3 (Money Laundering Offence)

                1. Countries should criminalise money laundering on the basis of the
                     United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic
                     Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, 1988 (the Vienna Convention)
                     and the United Nations Convention against Transnational

                     accordance with Articles 14 and 23 of UNCAC (2005), which are
                     discussed in detail in Sections 4.1.1 and 4.1.2].

                2. Countries should apply the crime of money laundering to all
                     serious offences, with a view to including the widest range of
                     predicate offences. Predicate offences may be described by
                     reference to all offences; or to a threshold linked either to a
                     category of serious offences; or to the penalty of imprisonment
                     applicable to the predicate offence (threshold approach); or to a
                     list of predicate offences; or a combination of these approaches.

                     ...

                5. Predicate offences for money laundering should extend to conduct
                     that occurred in another country, which constitutes an offence in
                     that country, and which would have constituted a predicate
                     offence had it occurred domestically. Countries may provide that
                     the only prerequisite is that the conduct would have constituted a
                     predicate offence, had it occurred domestically.

                6. Countries may provide that the offence of money laundering does
                     not apply to persons who committed the predicate offence, where
                     this is required by fundamental principles of their domestic law.

The US, the UK, and Canada all have money laundering offences that generally comply with
FATF and UNCAC requirements. However, there are significant differences between the
three countries' provisions. Canada and the US define money laundering as the use of the
proceeds of a list of specified offences ("predicate offences"). The UK takes a more inclusive
approach. Under its regime, virtually all profit-driven crime can lead to money laundering
charges.

      5.4.2 US

In the United States, money laundering is an offence under both federal criminal law and in
the majority of state criminal codes. Where money laundering is criminalized at the state
level, federal and state authorities work closely together. Approximately 2,500 natural and
legal persons are charged with federal money laundering offences each year, resulting in
over 1,200 convictions. In 2014, a total of 3,369 money laundering charges were laid and
1,967 convictions registered (the greater number of charges accounted for by the fact that a
person may be charged with multiple counts of various money laundering offences).111

The two primary money laundering offences are 18 USC 1956: Money Laundering (proceeds
laundering) and 18 US 1957: Money Laundering (transactional). In 2014, charges for the first
offence were laid 1,895 times and 517 times for the second offence, together accounting for
72% of all money laundering charges in the United States. Other money laundering related

(a) (1)             Whoever, knowing that the property involved in a financial transaction
                    represents the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity, conducts or
                    attempts to conduct such a financial transaction which in fact
                    involves the proceeds of specified unlawful activity--

                    (A) (i)  with the intent to promote the carrying on of specified

                             unlawful activity; or

                              violation of section 7201 or 7206 of the Internal
                              Revenue Code of 1986; or

                    (B) knowing that the transaction is designed in whole or in part--

                    (i)      to conceal or disguise the nature, the location, the

                             source, the ownership, or the control of the proceeds of

                             specified unlawful activity; or

                    (ii) to avoid a transaction reporting requirement under
                              State or Federal law,

                    shall be sentenced to a fine of not more than $500,000 or twice the
                    value of the property involved in the transaction, whichever is
                    greater, or imprisonment for not more than twenty years, or both.
                    For purposes of this paragraph, a financial transaction shall be
                    considered to be one involving the proceeds of specified unlawful
                    activity if it is part of a set of parallel or dependent transactions,
                    any one of which involves the proceeds of specified unlawful
                    activity, and all of which are part of a single plan or arrangement.

          transmit, or transfer a monetary instrument or funds from a place in
          the United States to or through a place outside the United States or to a

          of specified unlawful activity; or

     (ii) to avoid a transaction reporting requirement under

shall be sentenced to a fine of not more than $500,000 or twice the
value of the monetary instrument or funds involved in the
transportation, transmission, or transfer, whichever is greater, or
imprisonment for not more than twenty years, or both. For the
purpose of the offense described in subparagraph (B), the
defendant's knowledge may be established by proof that a law
enforcement officer represented the matter specified in
subparagraph (B) as true, and the defendant's subsequent
statements or actions indicate that the defendant believed such
representations to be true.

(3) Whoever, with the intent--

(A) to promote the carrying on of specified unlawful activity;

(B) to conceal or disguise the nature, location, source, ownership, or
          control of property believed to be the proceeds of specified
          unlawful activity; or

(C) to avoid a transaction reporting requirement under State or
          Federal law,

conducts or attempts to conduct a financial transaction involving
property represented to be the proceeds of specified unlawful activity, or
property used to conduct or facilitate specified unlawful activity, shall
be fined under this title or imprisoned for not more than 20 years,
or both. For purposes of this paragraph and paragraph (2), the
term "represented" means any representation made by a law
enforcement officer or by another person at the direction of, or
with the approval of, a Federal official authorized to investigate or
prosecute violations of this section. [emphasis added]

                                ten years or both. If the offense involves a pre-retail
                                medical product (as defined in section 670) the
                                punishment for the offense shall be the same as the
                                punishment for an offense under section 670 unless the
                                punishment under this subsection is greater.

                                transaction.

           (c) In a prosecution for an offense under this section, the Government
                     is not required to prove the defendant knew that the offense from
                     which the criminally derived property was derived was specified
                     unlawful activity.

          (d) The circumstances referred to in subsection (a) are--

                     (1) that the offense under this section takes place in the
                                United States or in the special maritime and territorial
                                jurisdiction of the United States; or

                     (2) that the offense under this section takes place outside the
                                United States and such special jurisdiction, but the
                                defendant is a United States person (as defined in section
                                3077 of this title, but excluding the class described in
                                paragraph (2)(D) of such section).

(f)  As used in this section--

     (1) the term "monetary transaction" means the deposit,
               withdrawal, transfer, or exchange, in or affecting
               interstate or foreign commerce, of funds or a monetary
               instrument (as defined in section 1956 of this title) by,
               through, or to a financial institution (as defined in section
               1956 of this title), including any transaction that would be
               a financial transaction under section 1956 of this title, but
               such term does not include any transaction necessary to
               preserve a person's right to representation as guaranteed
               by the sixth amendment to the Constitution;

     (2) the term "criminally derived property" means any
               property constituting, or derived from, proceeds obtained
               from a criminal offense; and

     (3) the terms "specified unlawful activity" and "proceeds"
               shall have the meaning given those terms in section 1956
               of this title. [emphasis added]

While the US statutory provisions are longer and more complex than their Canadian
equivalents (discussed below), their overall effect is similar. Only the proceeds of certain
crimes ("specified unlawful activity") can give rise to a money laundering charge. The term
"specified unlawful activity" is defined in 18 USC 1956(c)(7), and provides a long list of
offenses that encompasses most serious crimes and includes violations of the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act. To be convicted, the accused must have known that the property in question
was derived from unlawful activity of some kind. The two US provisions excerpted above
include a variety of different uses that can give rise to a money laundering conviction,
including attempting to avoid transaction reporting requirements and promoting the
carrying on of a specified unlawful activity (i.e., funding further crimes). However, the
overall effect is that money laundering consists of using the proceeds of certain defined
crimes in certain defined ways.113

Sentences for money laundering offenses are often lengthy and can reach a life term. From
2010-2015, prison sentences greater than 61 months (5 years) were imposed in 40% of
convictions, while non-custodial sentences were used in only 15% of convictions. Table 4.1
outlines the sentences given in US federal money laundering cases from 2010-2014.

113 For lawyers prosecuting or defending money laundering charges, these provisions raise a host of
issues. For a detailed analysis of the US money laundering provisions, including elements of the
offences, possible defenses and sanctions, see Carolyn Hart, "Money Laundering" (2014) 51 Am Crim

      5.4.3 UK

In the UK, money laundering is criminalized by sections 327-329 of the Proceeds of Crime Act,
2002 (POCA). Those provisions provide as follows:

          327 Concealing etc

                1) A person commits an offence if he--
                     (a) conceals criminal property
                     (b) disguises criminal property;
                     (c) converts criminal property;
                     (d) transfers criminal property;
                     (e) removes criminal property from England and Wales or from
                           Scotland or from Northern Ireland.

                2) But a person does not commit such an offence if--
                     (a) he makes an authorised disclosure under section 338 and (if
                           the disclosure is made before he does the act mentioned in
                           subsection (1)) he has the appropriate consent;
                     (b) he intended to make such a disclosure but had a reasonable
                           excuse for not doing so;
                     (c) the act he does is done in carrying out a function he has
                           relating to the enforcement of any provision of this Act or of
                           any other enactment relating to criminal conduct or benefit
                           from criminal conduct.115

                3) Concealing or disguising criminal property includes concealing
                     or disguising its nature, source, location, disposition, movement

          [The meaning of "suspicion" in section 328 has been the subject of some
          debate due to its subjectivity. The case law has indicated a preference for
          the "more than fanciful possibility" test. It should also be noted that
          "arrangement" does not include legal proceedings.116]

                     (b) a person uses or has possession of property for inadequate

Section 340(3) of the POCA defines criminal property broadly. Property is criminal property
if:

          (a) it constitutes a person's benefit from criminal conduct or it represents
                such a benefit (in whole or part and whether directly or indirectly), and

          (b) the alleged offender knows or suspects that it constitutes or represents
                such a benefit.

The person benefitting from criminal conduct need not commit the criminal act. The
definition also includes property from anywhere in the world.

In the UK, unlike Canada and the US, there is no defined set of predicate offences for money
laundering. There is also no need, under some of the provisions above, for any intent to
conceal the source of the funds. The use or possession of the proceeds of any crime
whatsoever can be prosecuted as money laundering. Under this regime, stealing and selling
bicycles can give rise to money laundering charges. There is a requirement that the accused
know that the proceeds in question were derived from criminal activity and a statutory
defence if the accused reported the act as a suspicious transaction. Nonetheless, far more
criminal activity is captured by this regime than in either the US or Canada.

Section 333 of the POCA also creates an offence of "tipping off." The offence is committed
where a person in the regulated sector tells a customer or third person that a money
laundering investigation is underway or under consideration and where this disclosure is
likely to be prejudicial.118

      5.4.4 Canada

Money laundering laws in Canada were first enacted in 1989 and amended numerous times
120 The current money laundering offences are set out in sections 462.31(1) and 354(1) of the
Criminal Code, which state:

          Laundering proceeds of crime

          462.31 (1) Every one commits an offence who uses, transfers the possession of,
          sends or delivers to any person or place, transports, transmits, alters, disposes of
          or otherwise deals with, in any manner and by any means, any property or any
          proceeds of any property with intent to conceal or convert that property or
          those proceeds, knowing or believing that, or being reckless as to whether,
          all or a part of that property or of those proceeds was obtained or derived
          directly or indirectly as a result of

                (a) the commission in Canada of a designated offence; or
                (b) an act or omission anywhere that, if it had occurred in Canada,

                     would have constituted a designated offence.

          Possession of property obtained by crime

          354. (1) Every one commits an offence who has in his possession any
          property or thing or any proceeds of any property or thing knowing that all
          or part of the property or thing or of the proceeds was obtained by or
          derived directly or indirectly from

                (a) the commission in Canada of an offence punishable by indictment; or
                (b) an act or omission anywhere that, if it had occurred in Canada,

                     would have constituted an offence punishable by indictment.
                     [emphasis added]

There are three important aspects to section 462.31. First, it applies only to the proceeds of
"designated offences." The term "designated offence" is defined in section 462.3 of the
Criminal Code as an offence that may be prosecuted as an indictable offence under Canadian
legislation, unless it is expressly excluded by regulation. This means violations of the
Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act and bribery offences, as well as most other criminal
offences, are included as designated offences. Second, while the range of actions that can
constitute the actus reus of the offence is broad, there must be intent to conceal or convert on
the part of the accused. Finally, the accused must know or believe, or be reckless as to
whether the property or proceeds were derived from the commission of an indictable
offence. An offence under section 462.31 is punishable by up to ten years imprisonment.
Section 354(1) does not require any intent to conceal the source of the property or proceeds,
but it requires specific knowledge that the property was derived from a criminal offence.

120 For a history of the development of money laundering laws in Canada, see German, supra note
100, c 3.

                                                                                                          369
GLOBAL CORRUPTION

This knowledge requirement often leads to difficulty when attempting to draw a nexus
between a predicate offence and the property or proceeds.

Money laundering charges are typically laid along with a predicate offence such as bribery
or drug trafficking. From 2010 to 2014, 1,800 money laundering charges were laid in 1,027
cases involving one or more counts of money laundering along with other offences.
Prosecuting the money laundering is typically not prioritized in these circumstances. The
tables below, reproduced from FATF's 2016 mutual evaluation of Canada, show that while
the conviction rate for these cases was 59.6%, the money laundering charge led to a
conviction only 9.4% of the time.121 Conversely, the money laundering charge was stayed
14.6% of the time and withdrawn 72.7% of the time. In FATF's mutual evaluation of Canada,
discussed in greater detail in Section 6.2.3, it is explained that insufficient
evidence, avoidance of over-charging, plea bargaining, and length of proceedings
in money laundering cases were some of the reasons why this is done.122 Given the
principle of totality in sentencing, pursuing a money laundering charge when there is
already a conviction for the predicate offence may not greatly increase the sentence, and
therefore prosecutors may believe their resources are better directed at crafting a plea
bargain or focusing on the predicate offence.

Table 4.3 Results of Money Laundering-Charges124

Conviction rates for money laundering were higher in cases where that is the only charge
laid. In a limited sample size of 35 single-charge money laundering cases from 2010 to 2014,
12 resulted in convictions, a 34.3% rate. Stays were imposed 14.3% of the time; a comparable
proportion as when money laundering is charged with other offences, while withdrawals
were far less frequent, occurring 40% of the time, compared to 72.7% when money
laundering is charged alongside other offences.

Sentencing for money laundering ranges from non-custodial sentences to penitentiary
terms. FATF suggests sanctions imposed in Canada for money launderers are low and not
dissuasive enough. In 145 sentencing cases where money laundering was the most serious
offence, nearly half received no prison time, and only 11% received over two years'
incarceration.125

5.5 Role of Legal Professionals

      5.5.1 FATF Recommendations

FATF Recommendations 22 and 23 state that lawyers should be required to engage in CDD
measures when performing transactions for clients and to report suspicious transactions.
Many members of the legal profession and legal organizations such as the Canadian Bar
Association have strongly opposed the inclusion of lawyers in these reporting regulations.127
The interpretive note to Recommendation 23, reproduced below, modifies FATF's position
somewhat:

          Interpretive Note to Recommendation 23 (DNFBPS [designated non-
          financial businesses and professions] - Other Measures)

          1. Lawyers, notaries, other independent legal professionals, and
                accountants acting as independent legal professionals, are not
                required to report suspicious transactions if the relevant information
                was obtained in circumstances where they are subject to professional
                secrecy or legal professional privilege.

          2. It is for each country to determine the matters that would fall under
                legal professional privilege or professional secrecy. This would
                normally cover information lawyers, notaries or other independent
                legal professionals receive from or obtain through one of their clients:
                (a) in the course of ascertaining the legal position of their client, or (b)
                in performing their task of defending or representing that client in, or
                concerning judicial, administrative, arbitration or mediation
                proceedings.

          3. Countries may allow lawyers, notaries, other independent legal
                professionals and accountants to send their STR [suspicious
                transaction report] to their appropriate self-regulatory organisations,
                provided that there are appropriate forms of cooperation between
                these organisations and the FIU.

          4. Where lawyers, notaries, other independent legal professionals and
                accountants acting as independent legal professionals seek to dissuade
                a client from engaging in illegal activity, this does not amount to
                tipping-off.

In this interpretive note, the FATF clarifies that its recommendations are tempered by the
requirements of legal privilege and confidentiality, and leaves it in the hands of member
states to decide how to implement an AML regime that respects those duties. Lawyers in the
US, the UK and Canada are subject to different degrees of regulation. This variation is a
function of a number of factors, principally legislative policy, the power of the bar and the
constitutional structure of the country in question. For instance, after Canada's Parliament
included the legal profession among those entities required to report to its FIU, the
Federation of Law Societies successfully challenged these measures on constitutional
grounds (further discussed in Section 5.5.4). In the UK, on the other hand, lawyers have been
less successful in preventing mandatory reporting.

There are two principal ways that lawyers must deal with state-level AML regimes. The first
is regulation. Similarly to financial institutions, lawyers in some countries are subject to
reporting, record-keeping and CDD requirements. The second is direct criminal liability. In
some countries, AML laws are drafted in such a way that lawyers must be extremely careful
to avoid prosecution for careless handling of funds or lack of due diligence in the ordinary
course of their practice.

      5.5.2 US

To date, the US has not taken serious steps to regulate lawyers as part of their AML regime.
According to an article on the International Bar Association's Anti-Money-Laundering
Forum:

          [T]he American legal system regards legal professional privilege as
          fundamental to the lawyer­client relationship. Therefore, it is disinclined
          towards modifying its current anti­money laundering legislation to include
          professionals such as lawyers. Trust and confidence are considered as
          keystone principles to the legal professional relationship. They would be
          eroded indefinitely, if lawyers were required to reveal information relating
          to the client to third parties, based upon mere suspicions. A client must feel
          free to seek legal assistance and be able to communicate with his legal
          representative fully and frankly.128

US lawyers are not subject to any mandatory reporting requirements, with one exception.
They are required to report any cash transaction greater than $10,000 to the IRS.129 Other
than that, their work is outside the US AML regime.

US lawyers are also not likely to be caught by the country's anti-money laundering offenses
in the ordinary course of their work. As discussed in Section 5.4.2, US money-laundering
offenses require that the accused have actual knowledge that the funds in question were
derived from criminal activity. While some courts have held that willful blindness is

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

sufficient to make out this element of the offence, it is still unlikely that a lawyer who was
not knowingly complicit in a money laundering scheme could be successfully prosecuted.130

      5.5.3 UK

Lawyers in the UK are in an unenviable position relative to their North American colleagues.
They face significant potential criminal liability under section 328 of the POCA, even in the
ordinary course of their practice. Section 328 targets those who assist in the layering and
integration stages of the money laundering process. The Crown is required to establish that
the accused entered into or became concerned in an arrangement that they knew or
suspected "facilitates (by whatever means) the acquisition, retention, use or control of
criminal property by or on behalf of another person." This provision is intended to catch
financial advisors, accountants, lawyers and other professionals who assist in a money
laundering scheme.

Section 328 is broad enough that even careless lawyers can be prosecuted. For example, in R
v Duff, a solicitor was sentenced to six months imprisonment because he suspected that his
client's funds had been criminally derived, but did not report his suspicions.131 This came to
light some years later when his client was arrested for cocaine smuggling.132 There are
statutory defences to a section 328 charge, but they require the accused either to have
reported their suspicions or to have a reasonable excuse for their failure to do so. This regime
forces lawyers to report any suspicions or face criminal charges.

The UK courts have limited the scope of section 328 somewhat. In the 2005 Bowman v Fels
case, the English Court of Appeal held that section 328 does not apply to lawyers involved
in ordinary litigation or other dispute resolution processes who, as a result of the privileged
information they receive, come to suspect that the property at issue is criminal property.133
The case involved a family law dispute. The claimant, Ms. Bowman, sought recognition of a
proprietary interest in the defendant's home based on the doctrine of constructive trust. The
claimant and the defendant had previously lived in the house together in a common-law
relationship. During the course of preparing for litigation, the claimant's solicitors began to
suspect that the house may have been criminal property and became concerned that if they
did not disclose their suspicions to the authorities they would be held liable under section
328 for participating in an arrangement to aid their client in acquiring an interest in criminal
property. The Court in Bowman clarified that the solicitors were in no such danger. Section
328 does not override the concept of legal privilege and therefore would not have applied to
the acts of the solicitors of the claimant or the defendant.

However, the Court in Bowman did not address the position of lawyers who assist clients in
matters not involving litigation. Therefore, the potential liability of lawyers acting in a
transactional context remains uncertain.134

      5.5.4 Canada

The Canadian government has tried unsuccessfully to subject lawyers to reporting and CDD
requirements much like those imposed on financial institutions. When they were
promulgated, the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act
(PCMLTFA) and Regulations applied to lawyers. They imposed reporting and CDD
requirements and allowed searches of law offices and seizure of evidence. The application
of the PCMLTFA and Regulations to lawyers was challenged by the Federation of Law
Societies on constitutional grounds. In a 2015 ruling, the Supreme Court upheld the
Federation's position and read down the relevant provisions to effectively exclude lawyers
from the PCMLTFA and Regulations.135 The Federation has created model rules to deal with
money laundering, which have been adopted by the provincial law societies.136 The
Federation's model rule on cash transactions states that "[a] lawyer shall not receive or
accept from a person, cash in an aggregate amount of $7,500 or more Canadian dollars in

135 Canada (Attorney General) v Federation of Law Societies of Canada, 2015 SCC 7. The SCC articulated a
new principle of fundamental justice under section 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The SCC held that it is a principle of fundamental justice that the state cannot impose duties on
lawyers that undermine their duty of commitment to their clients' causes. The SCC stated that this
duty is a basic tenet of the Canadian legal system, a distinct element of a lawyer's broad common law
duty of loyalty and a fundamental part of the solicitor-client relationship. The Court noted that the
lawyer's duty of commitment to the client's cause is essential to maintain confidence in the integrity
of the administration of justice. Under the impugned regulations, lawyers must create and preserve
records not required for client representation and the solicitor-client confidences contained in these
records are not adequately protected against the sweeping warrantless searches authorized by
sections 62-64 of the PCMLTFA, supra note 91, which violate section 8 Charter rights against search
and seizure in law offices as set out in Lavallee, Rackel & Heintz v Canada (Attorney General), 2002 SCC
61.

"Federation Model Code of Professional Conduct" (last visited 8 August 2021), online: FLSC

lawyers from "knowingly assist[ing] in or encourage[ing] any dishonesty, fraud, crime or illegal
conduct, or instruct[ing] the client on how to violate the law and avoid punishment," including
money laundering. The same prohibition is also found in Rule 3.2-7 of the BC Law Society Code of

respect of any one client matter or transaction."137 The BC Law Society Rule 3-59 also adopts
the $7,500 cash rule.138 However, these rules are less comprehensive, contain exemptions,
and generally impose less stringent requirements than the government's Regulations. The
federal legislation and regulations require that financial institutions and other professionals,
such as accountants or investment brokers, report all transactions of $10,000 or more to
FINTRAC. On the other hand, lawyers need not report cash transactions to anyone. The law
societies take the position that when a cheque or electronic bank transfer of $10,000 or more
is received by a law firm, that money has already been subjected to the automatic FINTRAC
reporting requirement (for $10,000 or more) at the point of deposit of that money with a
financial institution. This fails, of course, to allow the lawyer to ascertain and account for the
source of funds or wealth, instead relying upon the financial institution.

As in the US, Canadian lawyers are unlikely to be prosecuted for money laundering offences
unless they deliberately facilitate a money laundering scheme. As discussed in Section 5.4.4,
the Canadian offences require that the accused have actual knowledge that the funds in
question were obtained through the commission of an indictable offence. Wilful blindness
and recklessness can, however, equate with actual knowledge.139 Section 462.31(1) of the
Criminal Code also requires intent to conceal or convert the property. Mere careless conduct
on the part of a lawyer is unlikely to make out the offence.140

of these evaluations. It then excerpts a critical evaluation from the Canadian Senate and
discusses some of the systemic barriers to creating effective state-level AML regimes.

6.1 Basel AML Index

Since 2012, the Basel Institute on Governance has produced an annual index on anti-money
laundering.141 The Basel AML Index (Index) provides a useful tool for assessing and
comparing the risk of money laundering in different countries worldwide and for observing
over time changes to that risk within a given country.

The Index is a composite weighting of the average of 16 indicators, relying on data provided
by groups such as FATF, Transparency International, the World Economic Forum, and the
World Bank.142 For the 2020 report, data was available for 141 countries who were given a
score from 0 (lowest risk) to 10 (highest risk).

Factors weighed in the total score are:

      Quality of AML/CFT Framework
      Bribery and Corruption
      Financial Transparency and Standards
      Public Transparency and Accountability
      Legal and Political Risks143

The highest (worst) score in the 2020 Basel Index was Afghanistan at 8.16. The lowest (best)
score was Estonia at 2.36. Canada placed 94th (4.68), the US placed 100th (4.57) and the UK
placed 116th (4.02).

It is important to note that the Index measures risk of money laundering and terrorist
financing. In practice, factors relating to a country's financial sector and economy are
important considerations for money launderers and can contribute significantly to the
volume of laundering in any given country. For example, the US ranks 97th of 149 countries,
meaning there are approximately 50 countries which have a lower risk for money
laundering. However, that US ranking does not mean that all the countries which were
ranked as lower money laundering risks are doing more, or are more effective, in trying to
control and prevent money laundering. In practice, the majority of international money
launderers choose not to operate in small, isolated economies. One study found that nearly

143 These factors are determined by a number of sub-factors.

half of the world's money laundering originates in the US, due in part to the dominance of
US dollars in global markets and transactions.144

6.2 FATF Mutual Evaluations

The FATF assesses compliance with its AML recommendations through a process of mutual

evaluation. For the first three rounds of evaluation, countries were assessed on their
technical compliance with the FATF recommendations. However, a new methodology was
developed in 2013 to evaluate the effectiveness of AML regimes. This methodology is used in
the ongoing fourth round of FATF evaluations, which began in mid-2014. Evaluations are
carried out by teams of experts, described by FATF as follows:

          An assessment team will usually consist of five to six expert assessors
          (comprising at least one legal, financial and law enforcement expert),
          principally drawn from FATF members, and will be supported by members
          of the FATF Secretariat. Depending on the country and the ML/TF risks,
          additional assessors or assessors with specific expertise may also be
          required.145

Prior to 2014, countries were assigned a rating for compliance with each FATF
recommendation. Possible ratings were C (compliant), LC (largely compliant), PC (partially
compliant) or NC (non-compliant). After an evaluation, a country may be required to report
back to the FATF at intervals to describe its progress in addressing any shortcomings
identified by the evaluation team.

Care must be exercised in using the FATF evaluations as a basis for comparing AML regimes
in the US, UK, Canada, and elsewhere. Also, the process for conducting mutual evaluations
and the FATF Recommendations themselves have changed significantly over time. The
mutual evaluations and follow-up reports on each member state were prepared at different
times, and may not be directly comparable. The mutual evaluations are intended as a tool to
assist countries to improve their AML regimes and to allow the FATF to exert peer pressure
on reluctant countries. The evaluations are not a global comparative survey for scholarly
analysis.

Nonetheless, the FATF mutual evaluation process provides the best primary data on global
AML efforts and is an important source for surveys by other organisations, including the
Basel Institute. The following sections summarize the most recent evaluations of the AML
regimes in the US, UK, and Canada, focusing on any key weaknesses identified.

      6.2.1 US
The United States had a FATF mutual evaluation in 2016, which like the previous evaluation
in 2006 was generally positive. The United States has significant exposure to potential
money laundering due to the global dominance of the US dollar. The US was one of the first
countries to place significant focus on money laundering and has a developed anti-money
laundering system.146
Of FATF's 40 recommendations, the US was found compliant with 11, largely compliant
with 20, partially compliant with 6 and non-compliant with 3. The non-compliances related
to the lack of transparency of beneficial ownership and the regulation of designated non-
financial businesses and professions including lawyers, accountants and real estate
agents. 147
Mutual legal assistance from the US was positive. From 2009 to 2014, the US received 1,541
requests from MLA relating to money laundering, terrorist financing or asset forfeiture and
recovery and granted the request in 1,062 of those cases.
Table 4.5 Response to Incoming MLA Requests148

In the same years, 21 requests to extradite a money laundering suspect were made, resulting
in ten extraditions. Contested extraditions took an average of one year to resolve.

Table 4.6 Response to Incoming Extradition Requests149

One beneficial aspect of the US system is the assigning of an attorney to US embassies in
specific countries to assist in mutual legal assistance and extradition requests.150

Recommendations made in the FATF mutual evaluation include ensuring the requirement
of beneficial ownership information at the federal level,151 as well as assessing and
addressing exposure to the risk of money laundering by non-financial businesses and
professions, such as lawyers, accountants and real estate agents.152

      6.2.2 UK

The last mutual evaluation of the UK was completed in 2018. The evaluation was very
positive, rating the UK as compliant or largely compliant with all but two FATF
Recommendations. The key findings were as follows:

          a) The UK has a robust understanding of its ML/TF risks which is reflected
          in its public national risk assessments (NRAs). National AML/CFT policies,
          strategies and activities seek to address the risks identified in the NRAs.
          National co-ordination and co-operation on AML/CFT issues at both the
          policy and operational levels has improved significantly since the last
          evaluation.

          b) The UK proactively investigates, prosecutes and convicts a range of TF
          activity, in line with its identified risks in this area. A particularly positive
          feature of the system is the strong public/private partnership on TF matters.
          This is facilitated by the Joint Money Laundering Intelligence Task Force
          (JMLIT) which facilitates public/private information sharing including on
          TF and ML investigations.

          c) The UK routinely and aggressively identifies, pursues and prioritises ML
          investigations and prosecutions. It achieves around 7,900 investigations,
          2,000 prosecutions and 1,400 convictions annually for standalone ML or
          where ML is the principal offence. The UK investigates and prosecutes a

wide range of ML activity. Investigations of high-end ML (a long-standing
risk area for the UK) have increased since being prioritised in 2014. These
cases generally take years to progress to prosecution and conviction and
limited statistics are available on high-end ML investigations, prosecutions,
and convictions prior to its prioritisation in 2014. As a result, it is not yet
clear whether the level of prosecutions and convictions of high-end ML is
fully consistent with the UK's threats, risk profile, and national AML/CFT
policies.

d) Another strong point of the system is that all entities within the FATF
definition of financial institutions and all DNFBPs are subject to
comprehensive AML/CFT requirements and subject to supervision.
Supervisors' outreach activities, and fitness and proprietary controls are
generally strong. Each supervisor takes a slightly different approach to risk-
based supervision. However, while positive steps have been taken, there are
weaknesses in the risk-based approach to supervision even among the
statutory supervisors.

e) The UK has been a leader in designating terrorists at the UN and EU level,
and takes a leading role promoting effective global implementation of
proliferation-related TFS. The UK has frozen assets and other funds
pursuant to its proliferation financing sanctions program and taken steps to
increase the overall effectiveness of its targeted financial sanctions (TFS)
regime, including through the creation of the Office of Financial Sanctions
Implementation and the strengthening of penalties for breaching TFS.
However, minor improvements are required in relation to applying
penalties for sanctions breaches, ensuring consistent application of TFS and
communicating designations immediately. The UK has a good
understanding of the TF risks associated with NPOs and has been effective
in taking action to protect the sector from abuse. The UK also has a robust
confiscation regime through which it can and does deprive terrorists of
assets.

f) Available financial intelligence and analysis is regularly used by a wide
range of competent authorities to support investigations of ML/TF and
related predicate offences, to trace assets, enforce confiscation orders, and
identify risks. However, the UK has made a deliberate policy decision to
limit the role of the UK Financial Intelligence Unit (UKFIU) in undertaking
operational and strategic analysis which calls into question whether
suspicious activity report (SAR) data is being fully exploited in a systematic
and holistic way and providing adequate support to investigators.
Additionally, while reports of a high quality are being received, the SAR
regime requires a significant overhaul to improve the quality of financial
intelligence available to the competent authorities.

g) The UK is a global leader in promoting corporate transparency and has a
good understanding of the ML/TF risks posed by legal persons and
arrangements. The UK has a comprehensive legal framework requiring all
financial institutions and all DNFBPs to conduct customer due diligence

                                                                                                381
GLOBAL CORRUPTION

          and obtain and maintain beneficial ownership information in a manner that
          is generally in line with the FATF requirements. Beneficial information on
          trusts is available to the competent authorities through a registry of trusts
          with tax consequences in the UK. The information in the trust register is
          verified for accuracy, but the register itself is not yet fully populated. For
          legal persons, basic and beneficial ownership information is freely and
          immediately available to the public and all competent authorities through
          a central public register. This information is not verified for accuracy which
          limits its reliability. Authorities confirmed that beneficial ownership
          information, where held in the UK, was obtainable for investigative
          purposes in a timely manner via available informal and formal investigative
          tools, including JMLIT and the NCA s.7 gateway.153

The report noted two key weaknesses in the UK regime, one being the ambit of its
correspondent back rules (Recommendation 13) and the other being its FIU, which includes
a lack of independence (Recommendation 29).

In 2016, the UK created a publicly accessible registry of the beneficial ownership of
companies. That law will greatly aid in the identification of money launderers.
Mandatory disclosure of beneficial ownership is discussed fully in Chapter 5, Section 6.1.2.

      6.2.3 Canada

Canada had a FATF mutual evaluation in 2016, and that evaluation noted significant
progress since the previous evaluation in 2007. The FATF report noted overall that "Canada
has a strong framework to fight ML and TF, which relies on a comprehensive set of laws and
regulations, as well as a range of competent authorities."154 Of the 40 FATF
recommendations, Canada was found compliant with 11, largely compliant with 18,
partially compliant with six and non-compliant with five.155 The non-compliant ratings
resulted from the anti-money laundering legal obligations being inoperative with respect
to lawyers, inadequate beneficial ownership laws (discussed in Chapter 5, Section 6.1.2),
and failing to meet the standards for foreign politically exposed persons.156 The latter
concern was addressed through amended regulations to the PCMLTFA in July 2016.

The evaluation states that most high-risk areas are governed by Canada's AML/CTF
framework, but finds that the exemption of legal counsel, law firms, and Quebec notaries is
a "significant loophole"157 in Canada's framework. This has a trickle-down effect throughout
the AML/CTF regime. As the evaluation notes, "[i]n light of these professionals' key
gatekeeper role, in particular in high-risk sectors and activities such as real-estate

transactions, and the formation of corporations and trusts, this constitutes a serious
impediment to Canada's efforts to fight ML."158

The evaluation suggests that law enforcement results are not commensurate with Canada's
money laundering risk and that asset recovery appears low. The report notes that some
provinces appear more effective in asset recovery, citing Quebec as an example.159 As
discussed in Chapter 6, Section 3.1.2, Quebec is the only province to have a dedicated, multi-
governmental anti-corruption agency.

As discussed in Section 5.4.4, the evaluation is also critical of the prosecution of money
laundering cases, finding that there is a high percentage of withdrawals and stays of
proceedings, and that sanctions in money laundering cases are not sufficiently dissuasive.160

The evaluation commended Canada's mutual legal assistance system. From 2008 to 2015,
Canada received 383 mutual legal assistance requests for money laundering offences.
Canada provided assistance in 253 of these requests, while 17 were withdrawn, 36
abandoned and 7 refused. Feedback from 46 counties found that assistance provided by
Canada is of good quality.161

Canada is also cooperative with extradition requests, although the process can be lengthy.
From 2008 to 2015, Canada received 92 requests for extradition in money laundering cases,
77 of which came from the US. These resulted in 48 persons being extradited and 13 subject
to other measures such as deportation or voluntary return.162 As noted in Section 6.2.1,
contested extradition from the US in money laundering cases is resolved within a year on
average. The extradition process from Canada is lengthier, with 53% of cases taking 18
months to five years to complete, 28% from three to five years and 4% over five years.163

Recommendations stemming from the mutual evaluation included mitigating the risks
posed by the exclusion of lawyers, law firms and Quebec notaries from the PCMLTFA,
engaging prosecutors at earlier stages in money laundering cases, and ensuring asset
recovery is pursued as a policy objective.164

6.3 Other Evaluations

As the previous two sections demonstrate, both the FATF and the Basel Institute are
relatively positive about the performance of the US, UK, and Canada. However, in the case
of the Basel Index this is a relative measure--it simply shows that many other countries in
the world are doing worse in reducing or controlling their risk of money laundering. In the
case of the FATF mutual evaluations, most of the focus is on implementation of the
Recommendations. However, in some cases, even complete compliance with the FATF

Recommendations may not produce an effective AML regime in practice. Some
commentators have produced more critical reviews of the AML regimes discussed above.165

The following excerpt is from a 2013 Canadian Senate report entitled Follow the Money: Is
Canada Making Progress in Combatting Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing? Not Really.166
This report was completed pursuant to section 72 of the PCMLTFA, which mandates that a
Parliamentary Committee review the act every five years. As the title of the report suggests,
the Senate committee found that there is little evidence that the PCMLTFA, FINTRAC, and
the rest of Canada's anti-money laundering regime is effective at reducing or prosecuting
money laundering. The report goes on to suggest eighteen recommendations for reform. The
following excerpt (pages 5-7) provides an overview of the Committee's findings and
recommendations:

                                                            BEGINNING OF EXCERPT

 B. The Impact

 Recognizing that Canada's anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing legislation
 has had incremental changes over the past 11 years, the Committee believes that it is
 appropriate to examine the extent to which Canada's Regime is effective in detecting and
 deterring the laundering of money and the financing of terrorist activities, and contributes
 to the successful investigation and prosecution of those who are involved in these criminal
 activities. The Committee is interested in the responses to several questions:

        Have the scope and magnitude of money laundering and terrorist financing in
            Canada diminished over time?

        Are the time, money and other resources dedicated to addressing these activities
            having sufficient "results?" and

        What changes are needed to bring about better "results?"

 Throughout the hearings, the Committee questioned witnesses about the scope and
 magnitude of money laundering and terrorist financing in Canada. While the Committee
 learned that FINTRAC has a solid reputation internationally, witnesses shared only
 limited and imprecise information about the extent to which the Regime meets its
 objective of detecting and deterring money laundering and terrorist financing. The
 Committee believes that there continues to be a clear need for legislation to combat money
 laundering and terrorist financing in Canada.

 The Committee feels that there is a lack of clear and compelling evidence that Canada's
 Regime is leading to the detection and deterrence of money laundering and terrorist
 financing, as well as contributing to law enforcement investigations and a significant rate

 of successful prosecutions. It is possible that some witnesses were unable to share
 confidential information in a public meeting. It is also possible that information about the
 success or failure of the Regime is not being collected. In any event, the Committee feels
 that the current Regime is not working as effectively as it should, given the time, money
 and other resources that are being committed by reporting entities, a variety of federal
 departments and agencies, other partners and taxpayers.

 Given that multinational financial institutions have recently been implicated in money
 laundering and terrorist financing, the Committee is concerned about non-compliance
 with the Act by reporting entities. While the majority of non-compliance charges laid in
 Canada are in relation to cross-border reporting offences, the Committee is aware of the
 July 2012 report by the United States (U.S.) Senate Permanent Subcommittee on
 Investigations of the U.S. Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental
 Affairs, entitled U.S. Vulnerabilities to Money Laundering, Drugs, and Terrorist
 Financing: HSBC Case History, in relation to HSBC and money laundering using
 international wire transfers. [In 2013, HSBC paid $1.9 billion to settle money laundering
 charges filed by the US Department of Justice.167] The U.S. Senate Committee made
 several recommendations designed to strengthen anti-money laundering and anti-
 terrorist financing controls, particularly in relation to large, multinational financial
 institutions with affiliates in jurisdictions that are considered to be at high risk of being
 targeted by money launderers and those who finance terrorism. As financial institutions
 play a critical role in preventing illicit money from entering the financial system, the
 Committee feels that FINTRAC must be vigilant in ensuring that Canada's reporting
 entities comply with their obligations under the Act.

 The Committee believes that an approach involving incremental legislative and
 regulatory changes must end. Consequently, ongoing efforts are needed to ensure that the
 resources committed to detecting, deterring, investigating and prosecuting money
 laundering and terrorist financing offences have the best "results" in the least costly,
 burdensome and intrusive manner. While it is virtually impossible to eliminate the illegal
 activities that lead to the need to launder money, a continuation of the current incremental
 approach - which appears to involve changes to fill gaps by adding reporting entities and
 to meet evolving FATF recommendations that may or may not have relevance for Canada
 - is not the solution that Canada needs at this time.

 Having conducted a comprehensive study, the Committee's view is that the Act should
 be amended to address three issues:

        the existence of a structure for Canada's Regime that leads to increased
            performance in relation to the detection, deterrence, investigation and
            prosecution of money laundering and terrorist financing;

        the existence of information-sharing arrangements that ensure that suitable
            information is being collected and shared with the right people at the
            appropriate time, bearing in mind the need to protect the personal information
            of Canadians; and

        the existence of a scope and focus for the Regime that is properly directed to
            ensuring that individuals and businesses report the required information to the
            appropriate entity in an expedient manner.

 The time for incremental change to the Regime has ended. The time for examination of
 fundamental issues has arrived.

                                                                 END OF EXCERPT

Some commentators criticize the high costs of AML measures for businesses and society and
question whether these costs are worth the arguable benefits of AML regimes.168

6.4 Barriers to Creating Effective AML Measures

There are a variety of reasons why it is difficult to create effective AML measures. First, there
are the difficulties posed by the lack of information available to legislators at the national
and international level. There is no accurate estimate of the global scope of money
laundering or its extent in any particular country. This makes it difficult to evaluate the
success of any particular AML measure, since we cannot accurately measure the impact of
any such measure. The secrecy surrounding government and FIU information also poses a
challenge to those researching the effectiveness of AML measures.169

Investigation of money laundering also presents many problems, such as the volume of data
and documents, and the length of time between a corrupt act and its discovery.170 A further
difficulty is that a successful AML regime relies heavily on the cooperation of the financial
sector, which may see little financial benefit in assisting the authorities. As Margeret Beare
and Stephen Schneider note in their 2007 book Money Laundering in Canada:

168 See, for example, Michael Levi & Peter Reuter, "Money Laundering" (2006) 32:1 Crime Justice
289. The UK has embarked on a review of the country's AML regime with the goal of making the
system more efficient and less costly for businesses. See: Department of Business, Innovation and
Skills, Press Release, "Financial Red Tape Targeted in New Review" (28 August 2015), online:

cost-benefit analysis of AML laws in a hypothetical EU country, see Joras Ferwerda, "Cost-benefit
analysis" in Brigitte Unger et al, eds, The Economic and Legal Effectiveness of the European Union's Anti-
Money Laundering Policy (Edward Elgar Publishing, 2014) 205. For a detailed analysis of money
laundering regulation in 80 countries with the aim of determining which regulations are most

           The rhetoric of financial institutions come across as if all of the objectives of
           the banks are equal: profit, risk management, customer satisfaction, and a
           sense of societal/corporate responsibility towards the reduction of money
           laundering. In reality, these goals are often seen to be contradictory and are
           not given equal attention. As we have noted, a focus on profitability runs
           throughout the banking sector. Picking up on the `what gets measured and
           gets rewarded, gets done' line of reasoning (Bogach and Gordon, 2000), it is
           important to consider the reward system within those institutions that have
           claimed to implement sound voluntary codes, especially where those codes
           might work against other rewarded objectives. During the US Senate's 1999
           review of the operations of private banking, one bank official stated that
           `no-one took the "know-your-customer" policies seriously until bonuses
           were threatened.' The internal study of bank defalcations [failure to repay
           loans] within Canadian financial institutions revealed a maze of individual,
           departmental, and branch incentives that were offered based on
           performance. These individual and group rewards were so coveted that
           they were seen to be partially responsible for overzealous banking decisions
           (e.g., unwise loans and credit lines). Peer pressure from group incentives
           was particularly powerful. Hence any policy that resulted in the loss of
           customers - especially customers with large amounts of money - operated
           against the current reward structure. Banks are organized around the
           concept of attracting funds, and few banks reward those who turn money
           away. 171

Richard Gordon further criticizes this reliance on the private sector to report transactions
and keep records. Gordon calls for a greater role for the public sector and FIUs in AML
efforts.172 The recent movement to require public disclosure of the beneficial owners of
shell companies and trusts is discussed in Chapter 5, Section 6.1.2.

Clare Fletcher and Daniela Hermann outline several other challenges for AML regimes.173
Legal or political immunity of high-level politicians may block prosecution of money
laundering offences. Corrupt officials may also use AML measures to freeze funds of their
opponents and can frustrate the efforts of law enforcement in other countries to gather
evidence against themselves or their government. Bank secrecy laws continue to pose a
challenge to AML efforts, although strict secrecy has been relaxed due to FATF blacklisting
and increased international pressure since September 11, 2001. Finally, Fletcher and
Hermann note that the creation of FIUs is expensive for developing countries, and the
effectiveness of FIUs has been questioned in less advanced, cash-oriented economies.

1. INTRODUCTION

The World Bank estimates that $20 to $40 billion (equivalent to 20-40% of official
development assistance) is stolen from developing countries and hidden overseas every year
through high-level corruption practices.1 The Stolen Asset Recovery Initiative (StAR)
estimates that over a 15-year period, only $5 billion was recovered (between 0.8% and 1.6%
of stolen assets).2 In 2011, StAR estimated that $1 to $1.6 trillion in global proceeds from
criminal activities, corruption, and tax evasion crosses borders every year.3

Asset recovery in corruption cases includes the uncovering of corruption and the tracing,
freezing, confiscating, and returning of funds obtained through corrupt activities. It is a
particularly vital tool for developing countries that see their national wealth corruptly
exported. There are several barriers to asset recovery. Once stolen assets are transferred
abroad, recovery is extremely difficult. In developing countries, this difficulty results from
limited legal, investigative and judicial capacity, as well as inadequate resources. Further,
the lack of resources affects the ability of a state to make requests to countries holding the
stolen assets. The problem is exacerbated in developed countries where assets are hidden or
where necessary laws may be lacking to respond to requests for legal assistance.4 Moreover,
the lack of non-conviction based (NCB) asset forfeiture laws in some countries makes
recovering assets difficult when the officials engaged in stealing assets have died, fled or
have immunity.

Confiscating assets is an important tool in the fight against corruption. It serves as both a
sanction for improper, dishonest and corrupt behaviours, and a deterrent as the incentive to
commit corruption is removed. Further, it incapacitates the offenders by depriving them of
their assets and instruments of misconduct. It also repairs the damage done to victim
populations when financial resources are confiscated from the offenders and are directed
toward economic development and growth in that country. Finally, asset recovery promotes
accountability and positively affects the rule of law. The asset recovery process involves four

government seems to rely on its secret agents to find fugitive suspects abroad and pressure them to
return home. In particular, Operation Fox Hunt, commenced by China in 2014, resulted in the
repatriation of some 700 suspected economic fugitives globally, and Operation Skynet saw the return
of another 857 persons in 2015: Affan Chowdhry, "China's Corruption Crackdown Ruffles

steps: (1) identification (2) investigation, tracing, freezing and seizing (3) confiscation or
forfeiture, and (4) return of the stolen assets to the owner. For these reasons, The United
Nations and other relevant organizations attach a high priority to the problem of cross-
border transfers of illicitly obtained funds and the return of such funds.

In this chapter we discuss the international and domestic obligations that facilitate the
recovery of stolen assets through the United Nations Convention Against Corruption
(UNCAC),5 the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials (OECD
Convention),6 and other multilateral agreements. Then the discussion covers StAR and the
role Financial Intelligence Units (FIUs) have in facilitating the recovery of stolen and corrupt
assets before moving on to the various legal approaches for freezing, confiscation, and the
ultimate return of assets obtained by corruption.

2. ASSET RECOVERY CONCEPTS AND TOOLS

The following sections summarize the asset recovery process, identify relevant enforcement,
policy development and investigatory agencies, and describe the legal tools used for asset
recovery. An important resource for these sections, and the chapter as a whole, is the 2011
StAR/World Bank publication Asset Recovery Handbook: A Guide for Practitioners.7 This guide
provides a detailed description of the entire asset recovery process. However, it is
worth noting at this stage, as discussed in Section 6.1, that some commentators are not
enamoured with the policies and practices of the World Bank and StAR.

2.1 Asset Recovery Steps

 Evidence is gathered and assets are traced by law enforcement officers under the
 supervision of or in close cooperation with prosecutors or investigating magistrates, or by

 private investigators or other interested parties in private civil actions. In addition to
 gathering publicly available information and intelligence from law enforcement or other
 government agency databases, law enforcement can employ special investigative
 techniques.... Private investigators do not have the powers granted to law enforcement;
 however; they will be able to use publicly available sources and apply to the court for
 some civil orders ...

 ...

 1.1.2 Securing the Assets

 During the investigation process, proceeds and instrumentalities subject to confiscation
 must be secured to avoid dissipation, movement, or destruction ...

 1.1.3 International Cooperation

 International cooperation is essential for the successful recovery of assets that have been
 transferred to or hidden in foreign jurisdictions. It will be required for the gathering of
 evidence, the implementation of provisional measures, and the eventual confiscation of
 the proceeds and instrumentalities of corruption. And when the assets are confiscated,
 cooperation is critical for their return. International cooperation includes "informal
 assistance," mutual legal assistance (MLA) requests, and extradition8 ...

 1.1.4 Court Proceedings

 Court proceedings may involve criminal or NCB [non-conviction based] confiscation or
 private civil actions (each described below and in subsequent chapters); and will achieve
 the recovery of assets through orders of confiscation, compensation, damages, or fines.
 Confiscation may be property based or value based [discussed later in this chapter] ...

 1.1.5 Enforcement of Orders

 When a court has ordered the restraint, seizure, or confiscation of assets, steps must be
 taken to enforce the order. If assets are located in a foreign jurisdiction, an MLA request
 must be submitted. The order may then be enforced by authorities in the foreign
 jurisdiction through either (1) directly registering and enforcing the order of the
 requesting jurisdiction in a domestic court (direct enforcement) or (2) obtaining a domestic

8 [13] For the purposes of this handbook, "informal assistance" is used to include any type of
assistance that does not require a formal MLA request. Legislation permitting this informal,
practitioner-to-practitioner assistance may be outlined in MLA legislation and may involve "formal"
authorities, agencies, or administrations. For a description of this type of assistance and comparison
with the MLA request process, see section 7.2 of chapter 7.

 order based on the facts (or order) provided by the requesting jurisdiction (indirect
 enforcement)9 ...

 1.1.6 Asset Return

 The enforcement of the confiscation order in the requested jurisdiction often results in the
 confiscated assets being transferred to the general treasury or confiscation fund of the
 requested jurisdiction (not directly returned to the requesting jurisdiction).10 As a result,
 another mechanism will be needed to arrange for the return of the assets [these
 mechanisms are discussed later in this chapter].

 ...

 A number of policy issues are likely to arise during any efforts to recover assets in
 corruption cases. Requested jurisdictions may be concerned that the funds will be
 siphoned off again through continued or renewed corruption in the requesting
 jurisdictions, especially if the corrupt official is still in power or holds significant influence.
 Moreover, requesting jurisdictions may object to a requested country's attempts to impose
 conditions and other views on how the confiscated assets should be used. In some cases,
 international organizations such as the World Bank and civil society organizations have
 been used to facilitate the return and monitoring of recovered funds.11 12

                                                                 END OF EXCERPT

Judges in the United States and the United Kingdom have, in a number of cases, made orders
directing corrupt public officials and money launderers, as well as corporations and their
agents involved in bribery of public officials, to pay compensation or damages to a state that
has been harmed by corruption offences.13 For instance, when the British construction and

to make restitution to the government of Trinidad and Tobago in the amounts of $4 million,
$2 million, and $100,000 respectively.15

      2.1.2 Management of Seized Assets

Below is an excerpt from the International Centre for Asset Recovery/Basel Institute on
Governance publication entitled, Development Assistance, Asset Recovery and Money
Laundering: Making the Connection.

                                                            BEGINNING OF EXCERPT

 Asset Recovery, Management of Seized Assets and the Monitoring the Use of Returned
 Assets

 Two additional elements should be considered in the asset recovery process: the
 management of assets that have been seized and that are pending confiscation, and the
 monitoring of assets that are repatriated by the recipient country to the victim country.16

 Both national and international authorities often overlook the management of seized
 assets that are pending a confiscation order. Some of the problems include the cost of
 maintenance of the property - whether the taxes that are due during the seizure or the
 cost of up-keeping it in storage - while the seizure is pending a confiscation order, and
 the depreciation that the asset may have during its storage. To overcome such a situation,
 it is useful to analyse how some jurisdictions deal with the challenges, varying from the
 anticipated sale of the seized assets, such as in the United States and several Eastern
 European countries, or the promise from the person that committed the corrupt or other
 criminal act before a court that he/she will not sell the asset and will maintain it in good
 condition, such as in the United Kingdom.

                                                             CHAPTER 5 ASSET RECOVERY & MLA

 Whatever the option chosen, if at all since many countries do not yet have regulations in
 place to adequately address the management of seized assets, countries must bear in mind
 the fact that the anticipated sale of assets must be properly introduced into a legal system,
 so as to avoid any conflicts with the right to property of persons who may have a
 legitimate claim to the assets. Furthermore, an adequate database of seized assets must
 be put in place so as to ensure transparency and security in the management of such
 assets.

 On the other hand, the monitoring of returned assets is a much debated topic in the asset
 recovery field. Some countries returning assets have in the past requested or conditioned
 the return of proceeds of corruption and other criminal acts to spending on specific
 projects or areas mutually determined by both countries. The argument used by returning
 countries is that this is an attempt to avoid the returned assets being recycled out of the
 country again through further corruption or other criminal acts. Many victim countries,
 in turn, argue that such imposition and conditioning of the returned assets is a violation
 of their sovereign right to decide how to spend or invest returned money.

 The monitoring of returned assets must be mutually decided upon [by] both the recipient
 and victim countries in a case-by-case scenario, ensuring transparency and dialogue in
 the process. In past cases, there have been examples [of] countries using independent
 third parties, such as civil-society organisations from both countries to monitor the
 process.17

                                                                 END OF EXCERPT

In regard to the somewhat controversial issue of monitoring returned assets, Article 57(5) of
UNCAC stipulates that State Parties may "give special consideration to concluding
agreements or mutually acceptable arrangements on a case-by-case basis, for the final
disposal of confiscated property." This vague provision attempts to ensure that the return
of property to fragile, corrupt recipient states can have anti-corruption safeguards attached
to the agreement to return. Aside from objections relating to the erosion of the recipient's
sovereignty, monitoring may pose its own challenges, such as expense and technical
difficulties.18

For example, in Kazakhstan, criminal proceedings in Switzerland led to the restitution of assets
derived from bribery. In a relatively successful monitoring arrangement, a non-profit, independent
foundation was set up in Kazakhstan to monitor the use of returned assets. The foundation is

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

While there are some examples of successful agreements to facilitate the return of assets,19
recovering the proceeds of corruption is often impossible. Civil society organizations and
transparency advocates argue that money from the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA)20
settlements should also be used to compensate victims, just as settlements in environmental
cases often go towards affected communities.21 StAR echoes this argument, encouraging
countries to consider legislation allowing third parties to be included in settlement
agreements for foreign bribery cases.22

2.2 International Asset Recovery Agencies

The World Bank in partnership with the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime
(UNODC) launched StAR in 2007 for the international support of asset recovery. The StAR
Initiative was designed to:

      (1) urge countries to ratify UNCAC and apply the framework;
      (2) lower the barriers to asset recovery;
      (3) build technical capacity to facilitate asset recovery;
      (4) help to deter such flows and eliminate safe havens for corruption;
      (5) generate and disseminate knowledge on asset recovery;
      (6) advocate for implementation of measures that reduce barriers to asset recovery;
      (7) support national efforts to build institutional capacity for asset recovery; and
      (8) monitor recovered funds if requested.

Each country maintains its own asset recovery system. In 2010, the UK created the National
Crime Agency (NCA)23 to fight serious and organized crime. Originally, this agency was
organized into a number of "command" groups, including the Economic Crime Command
(which dealt with economic crime) and the Organized Crime Command (which dealt with
serious and organized crime).24 In 2017, this organizational structure was revisited and new

the return of assets. For more information see, Aaron Bornstein, "The BOTA Foundation Explained

bodies, such as the National Economic Crime Centre (NECC),25 were established.26 The
Asset and Forfeiture and Money Laundering Section of the Department of Justice is the US
government body dealing with asset forfeiture and anti-money laundering (AML)
enforcement efforts.27 An international unit assists prosecutors in the restraint and forfeiture
of assets located abroad and assists foreign governments seeking restraint and forfeiture of
assets held in the United States. The Kleptocracy Team28 investigates and litigates to recover
proceeds of foreign official corruption. The US manages the Consolidated Assets Tracking
System29--a database for managing the approximately $2 billion in assets seized.

Many jurisdictions, such as Canada, Australia, Italy, the US, and South Africa maintain asset
forfeiture funds to ensure adequate funding for asset recovery. Confiscation laws may
require confiscated assets be liquidated and the proceeds paid into these accounts. Canada
identifies its fund as the Seized Property Proceeds Account,30 South Africa has the Criminal
Assets Recovery Account (CARA),31 while the US has the Assets Forfeiture Fund.32

2.3 State-Level Financial Intelligence Units

Financial Intelligence Units (FIUs) are responsible for collecting suspicious transaction
reports (STRs) from financial and some non-financial organizations in order to combat
money laundering. An FIU is defined as a national agency responsible for receiving (and, as
permitted, requesting), analyzing and disseminating disclosures of financial information
involving the proceeds of crime to the authorities as required by national legislation or
regulation. FIUs may conduct investigations based on the reports received and disseminate
results to local law enforcement.

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

FIUs are essential in the fight to prevent or reduce the laundering of proceeds of corruption
and other related crimes. AML legislation requires many financial and non-financial
organizations to file activity reports or STRs with FIUs. Some FIUs also collect currency
transaction reports (CTRs). Organizations include financial institutions, regulatory
authorities and professions such as lawyers, accountants, and trust company providers. The
local FIU may also give information to the Egmont Group, the informal association of FIUs,
which can then forward information to foreign FIUs.33

The US FIU is known as the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN),34 while the
UK created the UKFIU.35 FinCEN's approach to its reporting entities has evolved into a
model, which it states provides "clarity and transparency."36 Part of that transparency is to
clearly delineate potential enforcement actions. Canada created the Financial Transactions
and Reports Analysis Centre (FINTRAC)37 in 2000.

UNCAC does not require an FIU be established, but Article 58 requires that State Parties
cooperate to prevent the transfer of the proceeds of Convention offences and to promote
recovery of such proceeds. To that end, Article 58 requires State Parties to consider
establishing an FIU.38

33 The following description is taken from StAR Initiative, Towards a Global Architecture for Asset
Recovery, (Washington, DC: World Bank/UNODC, 2010) [Towards a Global Architecture for Asset
Recovery] at 38, online: <https://star.worldbank.org/resources/towards-global-architecture-asset-
recovery>:

     The Egmont Group is a network of 116 Financial Intelligence Units established to improve
     cooperation in the fight against money laundering and financing of terrorism and promote
     programs in this field at the national level. The Egmont Group manages a secure
     information network, which allows members to exchange information freely that would
     facilitate analysis or investigation of financial transactions. This information originates from
     suspicious activity reports or other disclosures from the financial sector, as well as
     government administrative data and public record information. Members agreed that
     information exchanged between FIUs be used only for the specific purpose for which the
     information was sought or provided. Rarely is information used as evidence and then only
     where authorized by the requested FIU. Nonetheless, the Egmont network serves as an
     important support to international asset recovery both in terms of detecting illicit flows,
     identifying possible leads, and facilitating tracing and the collection of evidence to support
     asset recovery cases.

2.4 Tools for Asset Recovery

The following sections briefly describe the statutory and private law remedies that can be
used for asset recovery, as well as the ways in which they interact and their limitations.

      2.4.1 Criminal Forfeiture

Confiscation (or forfeiture) provides a means of redress for authorities seeking to recover
stolen assets. Confiscation is an order by which a person is permanently deprived of assets
without compensation. As a result, title is acquired by the state. The rationale for
confiscating proceeds of corruption is both to compensate victims and to provide deterrence
by removing the enjoyment of illegal gains. Criminal confiscation takes place after a criminal
conviction (at trial or by a guilty plea). The forfeiture order follows as part of the sentencing
process. Guilt must be proven at trial "beyond a reasonable doubt" in common law regimes,
or the judge must be "intimately convinced" in civil law regimes. Once a conviction is
obtained, the court can order confiscation. In most jurisdictions, the standard of proof for
establishing that certain assets were derived from criminal activities is lowered to a "balance
of probabilities."

      2.4.2 Civil (Non-Criminal Based) Forfeiture

Civil or Non-Criminal Based (NCB) is another form of forfeiture. Criminal forfeiture and
NCB forfeiture share the same objective, but their procedures are different. For example,
criminal confiscation can only occur after a criminal conviction. NCB forfeiture, on the other
hand, can operate separately from the criminal justice system or alongside it, and it allows
for the restraint, seizure, and forfeiture of stolen assets without a finding of guilt in the
criminal context. NCB forfeiture only requires a finding that the property is tainted, either
as the proceeds of a crime or as an instrument of criminal activity.

NCB forfeiture is an action against the asset itself (e.g., money, property, etc.), not the person.
After an NCB forfeiture order, the defendant forfeits the thing itself subject to any innocent
owners. There are generally three ways NCB forfeiture is available. First, it can form part of
criminal proceedings without requiring a final conviction or finding of guilt. In this regard,
NCB confiscation tools are incorporated into criminal legislation. The second method is
through a separate proceeding, normally governed by the rules of civil procedure and can
occur independently or parallel to criminal proceedings. The final method is administrative
confiscation, which can occur in some jurisdictions and does not require a judicial
determination.

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

An acquittal from criminal charges does not bar NCB forfeiture proceedings.39 Article 54 of
UNCAC requires all State Parties to consider NCB forfeiture. It also obliges State Parties to
enable domestic authorities to recognize and act on an order of confiscation issued by a court
of another State Party, and to permit competent authorities to order the confiscation of
property of foreign origin acquired through Convention offences. These obligations are
broadly worded and could include NCB forfeiture orders. However, many jurisdictions
have yet to put in place procedures allowing NCB forfeiture.

NCB forfeiture is particularly important for asset recovery in circumstances when there is a
lack of evidence to support a criminal conviction (beyond a reasonable doubt), such as when
the offender is dead (bringing to an end criminal proceedings), has fled the jurisdiction, is
immune from prosecution, is unknown, or the property is held by a third party who is aware
(or wilfully blind) that the property is tainted. For these reasons, StAR views NCB forfeiture
as a "critical tool for recovering the proceeds and instrumentalities of corruption."40

Confiscation can be either property-based or value-based. In a property-based order, assets
linked to illicit activities are specifically targeted for confiscation. In a value-based order, a
monetary amount is calculated based on the value of the benefit, advantages, and profits a
person gained from illicit activities.

Criminal proceedings and NCB forfeiture operate together to achieve the best results. Both
procedures can occur without violating double jeopardy because NCB forfeiture is not
considered a punishment or a criminal proceeding.41 In both methods, it must be established
that the targeted assets were derived directly or indirectly from the commission of the crime.
Tracing assets can be extremely difficult as they can quickly change form, location and
ownership, and complicated legal vehicles are used to hide assets abroad. Fortunately,
"know-your-customer" policies and procedures imposed by international treaties can assist
in the asset tracing process. Further, FIUs can also provide helpful information in an asset
tracing investigation.

For both criminal and NCB forfeiture, confiscated proceeds go to the prosecuting state
treasury, unless compensation for victims is also ordered.42

Civil Forfeiture Act43 and Remedies for Organized Crime and Other Unlawful Activities Act, 2001.44

      2.4.3 Administrative Freezing and Confiscation Measures

Administrative orders to freeze or confiscate assets are issued by a government rather than
the judiciary and can bypass mutual legal assistance requests from foreign countries in cases
of urgency. For example, after the Arab Spring, administrative measures were implemented
to facilitate the rapid freezing of assets of corrupt former leaders in the Arab world. Canada,
the US, Switzerland, and the EU introduced legislation allowing their governments to order
financial institutions to freeze assets without a judicial order or mutual legal assistance
request from the corrupt officials' countries.45

      2.4.4 Fines Corresponding to the Value of the Benefit

Fines can also be imposed on individuals or corporations that are equal to or greater than
the value of benefits derived from the inappropriate conduct. The judgment may be
enforceable as a fine or a debt. Derived benefits include all assets and profits that can be
reasonably linked to the offences forming the offender's criminal conviction. This is referred
to as "value-based confiscation," as the person is ordered to pay an amount of money
equivalent to or greater than their criminal benefit. Fines are generally paid into the treasury
of the prosecuting jurisdiction.46

The OECD/World Bank publication entitled, Identification and Quantification of the Proceeds of
Bribery gives examples of how various countries use fines and value-based forfeiture orders
to remove any "criminal benefits."47

      2.4.5 Civil Actions and Remedies

Civil remedies provide another tool for recovering the proceeds of corruption and can
complement criminal proceedings. Civil actions are not limited to asset recovery purposes,
but also achieve anti-corruption goals more generally by sanctioning wrongdoing and
allowing injured parties to bring suits. These actions will be discussed in this section,
including those not specifically related to asset recovery.

Article 35 of UNCAC creates an international obligation to provide private actors with the
right to initiate civil proceedings:

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

          Each State Party shall take such measures as may be necessary, in
          accordance with principles of its domestic law, to ensure that entities or
          persons who have suffered damage as a result of an act of corruption have
          the right to initiate legal proceedings against those responsible for that
          damage in order to obtain compensation.

However, Article 35 does not provide special standing or a special right of action for private
litigants and is subject to sovereignty and domestic law. As pointed out by Abiola Makinwa
in Private Remedies for Corruption, this means that private rights of action "exist only to the
extent provided under domestic laws and processes."48 Makinwa also points out that Article
35 applies only where a causal link exists between the claimant and the wrongdoing.49 As a
result, Article 35 on its own "gives a very limited right of redress to only a very particular
group of people."50

A foreign court is competent to hear a civil suit if the defendant lives in or is incorporated in
the court's jurisdiction, or if assets are located in or have passed through the jurisdiction, or
if an act of corruption or money laundering was committed in the jurisdiction.51 In some
countries, civil and criminal proceedings can run simultaneously.52

State Parties, and local public entities like municipalities and state-owned companies, can
initiate civil proceedings in foreign or domestic courts in the same manner as private
citizens, although legal standing may be denied if the public entity has no direct and
personal interest in the case.53 Article 43 of UNCAC requires that all State Parties consider
assisting each other in investigations and proceedings in civil and administrative matters
relating to corruption. Article 53 requires that each State Party take necessary measures to:

          (i) ensure that other States may make civil claims in its courts to establish
                ownership of property acquired through a Convention offence;

          (ii) ensure that courts have the power to order the payment of damages to
                another State Party; and

          (iii) ensure that courts considering criminal confiscation also take into
                consideration the civil claims of other countries.

Domestic statutes, such as the US Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act
(RICO),54 sometimes recognize the right of foreign states to sue. Another option for victims

of corruption is to bring an action domestically and seek to enforce the judgment in the
foreign jurisdiction in which assets are located.55

In general, to be enforceable in Canada, a judgment "must have been rendered by a court of
competent jurisdiction and must be final, and it must be of a nature that the principle of
comity requires the domestic court to enforce."56 The defences to enforcement of a foreign
judgment include fraud, public policy, and lack of natural justice.57 Overall, Canadian courts
have adopted a "generous and liberal" approach to the enforcement of foreign judgments,
but a case involving Chevron demonstrates that enforcement of foreign judgments in
complex disputes involving years of litigation in multiple jurisdictions may be ultimately
unsuccessful.58 That saga is set out in the example below.

Example of a Complex Enforcement of a Foreign Judgement Case

In the Chevron case, in 2011, after a seven-year-long trial process, a provincial court in
Ecuador issued a judgment ordering the California-based oil company Chevron to pay $8.6
billion in environmental damages and $8.6 billion in punitive damages to the plaintiffs
representing around 30,000 Ecuadorian indigenous villagers. In November 2013, Ecuador's
Court of Cassation reduced the total amount to $9.5 billion. In May 2012, the plaintiffs sought
recognition and enforcement of the Ecuadorian judgment against Chevron and its Canadian
subsidiary in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice. The dispute ultimately reached the
Supreme Court of Canada, which held that the only prerequisite to recognize and enforce a
foreign judgment is that the foreign court had a real and substantial connection with the
litigants or with the subject matter of the dispute, or that the traditional bases of jurisdiction
(the defendant's presence in the jurisdiction or consent to submit to the court's jurisdiction)
were satisfied.59 There is no need to prove that a "real and substantial connection" exists
between the enforcing forum and the judgment debtor or the dispute, or that the foreign
debtor has assets in the enforcing forum.60 However, the fact that a court in Canada has
jurisdiction in an enforcement proceeding does not mean that the judgment will be enforced
because the debtor may still raise any of the available defences (i.e., fraud, denial of natural
justice or public policy).61 Here Chevron instituted legal proceedings in the United States
alleging that the plaintiffs' American lawyer Steven Donziger and his team corrupted the
Ecuadorian proceedings by offering a bribe of $500,000 to the trial judge and "ghost-writing"
the judgment. In 2011, Judge Kaplan of the US District Court for the Southern District of
New York granted Chevron a global anti-enforcement injunction with respect to the
Ecuadorian judgment.62 In 2014, Judge Kaplan held that the Ecuadorian judgment had been

plaintiffs, holding that Chevron Canada's shares and assets were not exigible and that there

Appeal dismissed the plaintiffs' appeal.65 In 2019, the Supreme Court of Canada dismissed
the plaintiffs' application for leave to appeal.66

Civil actions in corruption cases may benefit private interests or public interests. In this
respect, Makinwa divides claims for damage into two categories. The first involves claims
for damage to private interests. Claimants in this category are direct parties to a corruption-
tainted transaction, such as shareholders or losing competitors in a bidding process. States
or public entities can be included in this category if they are party to a tainted contract.
Remedies for damaged private interests are found in tort law, in the principles of fiduciary
duty, and in securities and antitrust litigation. The second category of claims is for damage
to public interests. Claimants in this category are indirect victims of corruption or states and
civil society groups claiming on behalf of indirect victims. Because obtaining legal standing
and establishing a cause of action is challenging for indirect victims, they "do not have as
clear a path to redress as compared with the methods available to direct victims such as
principals, shareholders, and third parties affected by noncompetitive behavior."67
Makinwa, however, lists some strategies used in past cases involving damage to the public
interest:

          [Examples include] a state government using private law processes to
          protect the interest of the state and people; a state company seeking redress for
          international corrupt activity affecting its officials; and a succeeding
          government using the processes of private law to seek remedies for corrupt
          actions. Other examples show attempts by NGOs and private citizens to
          seek redress on behalf of the general citizenry for damage caused by a
          corrupt activity.68

Recovery in civil proceedings can take the form of compensation for damages, return of
property acquired through corruption to the legitimate owner or restitution of the rewards
of unjust enrichment. As mentioned, civil remedies in corruption cases do not always further
the goals of asset recovery and instead might be related to sanctioning wrongdoing and
compensating individuals for harm arising from corrupt conduct. The following sections
will explore various claims and remedies related to anti-corruption and asset recovery goals.

          2.4.5.1 Personal Claims and Remedies

Victims of corruption can bring claims against other persons to seek redress for damage
caused by corruption. For example, a victim might bring an action in tort for monetary
damages to compensate for economic losses caused by corruption. Possible plaintiffs include
governments that pay excessive amounts for goods or services due to bribes paid to their
officials or harmed individuals like consumers and unsuccessful bidders.

a) Actions for compensation for damages in tort

In tort-based actions, the plaintiff is compensated for losses caused by a defendant's breach
of duty. In the case of bribery, the giver and the receiver of the bribe will likely be joint
tortfeasors, since both act wrongfully towards the plaintiff.69 Causes of action useful to asset
recovery and corruption include civil fraud, tortious interference, conspiracy and
misfeasance in public office.70 Tort claims are sometimes hindered by the need to establish
intent on the part of the defendant and causation between the corrupt act and the loss.

Tortious interference is relevant when the private interests of parties to a transaction are
damaged, such as when bribery taints a bidding process. The interfering conduct must be
unlawful, like bribery, in order to provide a foundation for the tort. In Korea Supply Co (KSC)
v Lockheed Martin Corp (2003),71 KSC succeeded in recovering damages based on the tort of
interference with prospective economic advantage. KSC stood to gain a hefty commission if
it secured a contract for another company. The defendant, another bidder, bribed a public
official and was awarded the contract instead.

The tort of misfeasance in public office holds potential to assist in asset recovery, as
demonstrated by the successful claim for compensation in Marin and Coye v Attorney General
of Belize.72 The state was allowed to bring an action for misfeasance against its own officials,
who sold state land to a company beneficially owned by themselves.73 However, Makinwa
warns that claims of misfeasance in public office are often not feasible due to the requirement
of establishing intent to cause loss.74

The case against SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. provides another example of a civil action for
damages in the context of corruption. SNC-Lavalin was charged with corruption and fraud
in relation to alleged bribery in Libya and subsequently sued two former executives for
financial losses and reputational damage. SNC-Lavalin claimed it was unaware that one of

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

the executives was allegedly the beneficial owner of a shell consultancy company, which
was used to divert funds.75

b) Actions for contractual invalidity, contractual damages, and contractual restitution

Makinwa outlines two different contracts involved in cases of bribery: the primary contract,
which consists of offer and acceptance of the bribe, and the secondary contract, which comes
into being because of the bribe.76 Makinwa notes that international consensus exists as to the
unenforceability of the primary contract, since it evidences criminally prohibited behaviour.
Therefore, a court will not interfere with disputes over the primary contract.

The secondary contract will generally be void or, particularly in common law jurisdictions,
voidable at the instance of the betrayed principal. This unenforceability is based on public
policy. These secondary contracts will therefore be subject to general contract law principles
applicable to voidable contracts (i.e., orders of restitution may apply to an invalid secondary
contract; damages are available for breaches of contract causing loss or a breach of duty of
loyalty or good faith; principals may rescind contracts in the absence of wrongdoing, etc.).

If the principal decides not to rescind, the court may award compensation for damages
resulting from entering a contract with unfavourable terms. For example, if a government
buys goods from a company that has bribed a public official, a court might find that the true
price of the goods has been inflated by the amount of the bribe. This allows the government
to recover the amount of the bribe as well as any other losses it can show.77

Further, while damages are usually calculated based on the plaintiff's loss, in some
jurisdictions the defendant in a suit for contractual breach might be obliged to disgorge the
profits of corruption instead of, or even in addition to, compensating the plaintiff for losses.

defence, SNC's former executive vice-president of construction Riadh Ben Aissa alleged that specific
SNC executives organized and approved purchases of a number of lavish gifts for Saadi Gaddafi,
including a $38 million yacht. He further claimed that "most of SNC's senior executives knew that
the so-called agency contracts were in reality bribes paid to Libyan foreign officials in exchange for
the award of the sole-source contract" (see Dave Seglins, "SNC-Lavalin Replaces CEO Amid More
Allegations", CBC News (14 September 2015), online: <http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/snc-lavalin-
card-bruce-1.3226097>). Also, in December 2014, SNC-Lavalin recovered $13 million from Ben
Aissa's frozen assets in Switzerland after Ben Aissa was found guilty for bribery in Swiss
proceedings. The recovered money was part of the $47 million surrendered by Aissa and was
awarded to SNC-Lavalin on the basis that the company was an "injured party." Recovery by
corporate "victims" in bribery cases is very rare and has only occurred in two cases. See Richard L

The rationale behind this alternative measure of damages is that bribery is not only a breach
of contract, but also a wrongful act.78

c) Unjust enrichment and disgorgement of profits

Unjust enrichment is available as a non-tortious, non-contractual cause of action. An action
for unjust enrichment generally requires that one party acquire and retain a benefit at the
expense of another. However, in the context of agents, such as public officials, who retain
secret profits through corruption, retention of the benefit need not be at the principal's
expense. The principal is not obliged to establish loss in order to seek restitution of secret
profits because harm is considered to flow from the breach of fiduciary duty alone.79

Disgorgement of profits is an equitable remedy in common law systems based on unjust
enrichment. In the enforcement of the US FCPA, the Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC) considers disgorgement to be an essential element of any SEC settlement for bribery
offenses. Foreign companies that trade on the US Stock Exchanges are subject to SEC
penalties and disgorgement actions.80

In the StAR/World Bank report entitled Asset Recovery Handbook: A Guide for Practitioners, the
authors state:

          In the United States, disgorgement of profits is frequently sought by the
          Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice in civil
          or criminal actions to enforce the FCPA. Settlements often include recovery
          of the benefits of wrongful acts or illicit enrichment. In cases where a
          government contract was awarded as a result of bribery, the illicit
          enrichment is normally calculated by deducting direct and legitimate
          expenses linked to the contract from the gross revenue. The amount of the
          bribe and the taxes are generally not considered deductible expenses. In
          other civil actions brought by parties as private plaintiffs, U.S. courts have
          ruled that an employer or buyer is entitled to recover the amount of the
          bribe received by an employee even if the goods or services were exactly
          what the employer was seeking and even if the price was reasonable (Sears,
          Roebuck & Co. v. American Plumbing & Supply Co., 19 F.R.D. 334, 339

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

          2.4.5.2 Proprietary Claims and Remedies

Proprietary claims are for specific assets, as opposed to personal claims against another
party for damages. In a property-based action, the state or another party claims to be the
rightful owner of assets, or the state claims on behalf of the rightful owners that assets have
been taken by theft, fraud, embezzlement or other wrongdoing. For example, in Federal
Republic of Nigeria v Santolina Investment Corp, the London High Court of Justice found
Nigeria to be the true owner of several bank accounts and properties in London, which were
the proceeds of bribery accepted by a corrupt Nigerian official.82 Over $17.7 million was
recovered and repatriated.

Article 53 of UNCAC requires states to permit the initiation of civil actions by other State
Parties to establish ownership of property acquired through corruption and to recognize
another state's claim as the true owner. Unlike personal claims in tort and contract, a
successful claimant in a property-based action will have priority over the defendant's other
creditors.83

In common law jurisdictions, claimants can use constructive trusts to recover assets acquired
through a breach of trust or of a fiduciary duty. When public funds or property are
embezzled or misappropriated, the state will be the beneficial owner of the stolen property,
any profits derived from it or any property into which the stolen property is converted. The
state's beneficial ownership will affix to the asset as it goes through successive transactions,
unless there is a bona fide purchaser for value without notice of the breach of trust. For
example, Saadi Gaddafi used funds belonging to the State of Libya to purchase a $10 million
house in London. Ownership of the house was easily traceable to Gaddafi, since it was
owned by a shell company of which he was the beneficial owner. The Court found that
Gaddafi held beneficial ownership of the house in constructive trust for Libya, allowing the
transfer of the house to the State of Libya.84

The same logic of constructive trust has been extended to situations where a state or other
principal claims a proprietary interest in a bribe accepted by an agent. A successful
proprietary claim allows the principal to recover the bribe and any increases in its value.85
As the Privy Council of the UK House of Lords stated in an earlier case:

          When a bribe is accepted by a fiduciary in breach of his duty then he holds
          that bribe in trust for the person to whom the duty was owed. If the property
          representing the bribe decreases in value the fiduciary must pay the
          difference between that value and the initial amount of the bribe because he
          should not have accepted the bribe or incurred the risk of loss. If the

85 See for example, Kartika Ratna Thahir v PT Pertambangan Minyak dan Gas Bumi Negara (Pertamina),
[1994] 3 SGCA 105 (Singapore), where a state-owned oil and gas company discovered that one of its
executives had accepted bribes from contractors seeking preferential treatment and, therefore,
breached his fiduciary duty, leading the Court to hold that the bribe was held in trust for Pertamina.

408                                                                                                        2022

          property increases in value, the fiduciary is not entitled to any surplus in
          excess of the initial value of the bribe because he is not allowed by any
          means to make a profit out of a breach of duty.86

However, the law is currently unclear as to whether principals can still claim a proprietary
interest in bribes accepted by their agents. While one line of authority supports the idea that
all traceable proceeds of a fiduciary's corruption belong to the victim in equity, the Court in
Sinclair Investments (UK) v Versailles Trade Finance Ltd87 held that claimants can only acquire
a proprietary interest in a fiduciary's wrongfully acquired property if the property belongs
or belonged to the claimant or if the fiduciary took advantage of a right belonging to the
claimant.88 This suggests that betrayed principals cannot claim a proprietary interest in a
bribe. 89

          2.4.5.3 Other Civil Claims, Remedies, and Tools

a) Actions based on FCPA violations

In the United States, FCPA violations can provide the basis for civil actions under other
statutes including securities laws, antitrust laws, or RICO.90 For instance, if a violation
adversely affects competition between companies, a civil action can be brought under state
or federal antitrust laws.91 Shareholders can also bring claims based on FCPA violations to
obtain compensation for damages. For example, shareholders might bring a class action for
damage caused by false and misleading information about a company's bribery activities
that led to a fall in share prices.92 Avon Products Inc. (Avon) was sued by a group of
shareholders in a derivative class action lawsuit alleging securities fraud. After conceding
that it had bribed Chinese government officials to boost sales revenues and paying $135
million in fines for SEC and FCPA offenses as part of a DPA, Avon settled the shareholder
class action with a $62 million settlement.93 Similar securities class actions were settled

against Petrobras94 and Wal-Mart.95 Corporations may face foreign corrupt practices-related
class actions in Canada as well. For example, SNC-Lavalin faced securities class proceedings
in Ontario and Quebec based on alleged material misrepresentations in its disclosure of
internal investigations of bribery in Bangladesh and elsewhere.96 In 2018, SNC-Lavalin
reached a CDN$110 million settlement.97

b) Social damages

The concept of social damage is an emerging tool in obtaining compensation for damages to
the public interest. Costa Rican law, for example, allows the Attorney General to bring a civil
action for compensation when conduct causes damage to society. Costa Rica successfully
used this tool to obtain compensation in a 2010 settlement after corruption was uncovered
in a bidding process for telephone service providers in Costa Rica. As explained by
Makinwa, "[t]he action filed by the government of Costa Rica under the Criminal Procedural
Rules in Costa Rica, to seek pecuniary compensation for damage suffered by the collective
interests of the state and peoples of Costa Rica, illustrates a resort to private law notions of

94 In February 2016, the US District Judge Jed Rakoff in the Southern District of New York certified a
class action brought against the Brazilian oil company Petrobras. The plaintiffs, who held Petrobras
securities from 2010 to 2015, sought to recover their losses following a bribery and political kickbacks
scandal involving dozens of public officials in Brazil. The scandal has contributed to a drop in
Petrobras' market value to below $20 billion from almost $300 billion less than eight years ago. See

c) Insolvency proceedings

Jean-Pierre Brun et al. note that insolvency and receivership proceedings provided another
tool in tracing and recovering assets. They summarized the advantages and disadvantages
of using insolvency proceedings in asset recovery:

          Insolvency or receivership may present opportunities because the receiver
          (or other insolvency office holder) enjoys increased powers over assets. In
          such proceedings, the state claimant may be able to recover property simply
          by showing that it owns it. It is also easier to reclaim assets that have been
          transferred away, for example, by fraud. The insolvency office holder has
          the power to access information and demand testimony and has proved
          powerful and pivotal in large asset recovery cases. Within an insolvency
          proceeding, an insolvency office holder can compel the testimony of
          witnesses, including the directors or managers who may have been culpable
          in hiding assets. Refusal to cooperate can lead to imprisonment, which may
          motivate testimony that helps the office holder to locate and subsequently
          recover substantial assets.

          Formal insolvency processes are complex to implement internationally.
          Generally, in pursuing assets across borders, a plaintiff or creditor will need
          to pursue the assets under the insolvency laws of that country. Moreover,
          insolvency judgements are not easily recognized in foreign courts, unless
          certain regulations, conventions, or model laws apply. Therefore, the
          insolvency laws of the country where the assets are located will influence
          the effectiveness of approaching asset recovery through insolvency.
          [footnotes omitted]99

Partie civile

Victims of corruption can participate in criminal proceedings for corruption-related offences
as a partie civile in civil law jurisdictions. The victim must establish that they suffered direct
and personal harm as a result of the criminal offence. This allows claims for damages to be
assessed within a criminal trial and awarded if there is a conviction. For example, in 2007,
Nigeria was awarded 150,000 for non-pecuniary damages after a French court convicted a
former Nigerian energy minister for money laundering.100 Disadvantages of the partie civile
approach include the victim state's lack of control over criminal proceedings and the fact
that prosecutors may engage in plea bargaining without consideration of the partie civile.101

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

      2.4.6 Limitations and Advantages of Criminal and Civil Proceedings

Both criminal and civil proceedings have their advantages and limitations. Civil actions are
limited in terms of access to information and investigative powers. Criminal proceedings
provide investigators with access to information at the national and international level and
allow them to overcome bank secrecy. Further, the assistance and cooperation between
states provided by mutual legal assistance (MLA) in criminal proceedings is not mandatory
in civil cases.102 For example, in Attorney General of Zambia v Meer, Care & Desai and Others,103
the Zambian government was obliged to hire a private firm specializing in the tracing of
assets due to the absence of any MLA in civil actions.104

Benefits of civil litigation, aside from the lower burden of proof, include the possibility of
action against third parties, such as facilitators (parties who knowingly facilitated the
transfer of proceeds or received illicit assets). For example, a whole range of defendants were
included in Attorney General of Zambia, including lawyers and other third parties.105
However, plaintiffs might be required to establish dishonesty on the part of third parties,
since incompetence is not always sufficient to ground liability.

Another advantage of civil actions is the possibility of the inclusion of moral and punitive
damages in compensation. Further, plaintiffs can choose the jurisdiction in which recovery
is pursued, and civil recovery can be pursued in several jurisdictions at once. Criminal
proceedings, on the other hand, are much more structured and provide limited
opportunities for intervention by an aggrieved party.

As pointed out by Makinwa, civil actions can be pursued independently of the state, which
is an advantage when states are unwilling to pursue criminal proceedings. Makinwa also
points out that private suits deter corrupt transactions through the introduction of "an
element of uncertainty in terms of the number, duration, and costs (both financial and
reputational) of potential private suits that may be filed by a variety of claimants. The
criminal process is much more predictable as fines and punishment are pre-determined and
can be more easily factored into the decision whether or not to give a bribe."106

                                                          BEGINNING OF EXCERPT

1. Interaction between confiscation, disgorgement, and fines

Disgorgement and confiscation serve similar purposes, as noted above. Both seek to
remove ill-gotten gains. However, disgorgement and confiscation can be computed based
on different factors depending on the specific facts and circumstances of the bribery
scheme and the relevant jurisdiction. Thus, it is possible to have both disgorgement and
confiscation used in the same case. In the United States, disgorgement and restitution are
quite similar and are unlikely to be used simultaneously. In the United States, if the SEC
has already sought civil disgorgement of profits, generally the DOJ would exercise its
discretion not to seek the same funds as a criminal restitution or forfeiture order. Unlike
confiscation and disgorgement, the purpose of fines is to punish the offender, and not to
remove the benefits of crime per se. In the U.S., the authorities frequently seek a criminal
fine and/or a civil penalty in addition to disgorgement and forfeiture. In the United
Kingdom, case law makes clear that a fine is to serve as a deterrent and that "offending
itself must be severely punished quite irrespective of whether it has produced a benefit."
If a defendant is in a position to pay both a fine and have the benefits confiscated, both
may be ordered. In other cases, if the defendant does not have sufficient resources to pay
both, confiscation will take primacy over a fine.

...

2. Interaction between confiscation and compensation for damages

Compensation is based on the existence of damages suffered by the victim and may be
awarded even in cases where bribery did not generate any profit or benefit for the briber.
However, bribes are generally intended to, and often do, ensure that the briber makes a
profit. In certain instances, the profit may be greater than the damage suffered by the
victim. There are various remedies that can be sought in this instance - the government
enforcing anti-bribery laws can seek confiscation and the victim of the bribery can seek
compensation for damages.

...

3. Interaction between confiscation and contractual restitutions

In some jurisdictions government agencies have the authority to declare void or
invalidate contracts awarded by or through bribed officials. In such instances, the
government harmed by the bribery may seek recovery of all the amounts expended and
the property transferred under the terms of the tainted contracts. In this situation,
contractual restitutions could be as high as the proceeds of crime confiscated by the
government enforcing the antibribery laws.

...

4. Interaction between remedies applied in foreign or multiple jurisdictions

                                                                                                        413
GLOBAL CORRUPTION

 Courts may take into account confiscation decisions or settlements with the same effect
 in foreign jurisdictions to avoid unfair duplication ...

 Similarly, in the resolution of the Johnson & Johnson (J&J)/DePuy case, the United States
 and the United Kingdom simultaneously resolved investigations into some of the same
 misconduct. In the U.S., J&J's criminal fine was reduced by 25%, in part in light of
 anticipated fines in the U.K. and Greece, noting in the deferred prosecution agreement,
 "J&J and the Department agree that this fine is appropriate given [...] penalties related to
 the same conduct in the United Kingdom and Greece [...]." J&J was also required to
 disgorge profits from the conduct in a settlement with the SEC. DePuy settled the U.K.
 charges by agreeing to financial penalties under a civil recovery order. In reaching the
 settlement, the U.K. Serious Fraud Office also took the multijurisdictional nature of the
 settlement into account, stating that it had "taken particular note of the fact of
 disgorgement and recovery in more than one jurisdiction for the same underlying
 unlawful conduct. [...] The Serious Fraud Office has considered the matter from a global
 perspective. It has worked to achieve a sanction in this jurisdiction which will form part
 of a global settlement that removes all of the traceable unlawful property and at the same
 time imposes a penalty."107

                                                                 END OF EXCERPT

3. INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION OBLIGATIONS

3.1 UNCAC

International cooperation is extremely important for successful foreign recovery of corrupt
assets. Most corruption cases require asset recovery efforts beyond domestic borders. For
instance, the assets may be held in one jurisdiction and then laundered to another
jurisdiction, with the offence committed in a third jurisdiction and the company responsible
for paying bribes headquartered in a fourth jurisdiction. Further, money can be moved very
quickly through computers, mobile devices, and wire transfers.

As corrupt activities often involve several countries, international cooperation is emphasised
in UNCAC. Chapter V provides a framework to facilitate the recovery of stolen assets. The
first provision, Article 51, declares that asset recovery is a "fundamental principle" of the
convention:108

107 Identification & Quantification, supra note 47 at 22-25. For a detailed discussion of civil actions and
remedies available in asset recovery proceedings in both common law and civil law jurisdictions, see
van der Does de Willebois & Brun, supra note 69. For a recent guide to navigating civil actions in
asset recovery, see the StAR publication: Brun et al, supra note 51.
108 UNCAC, supra note 5, art 51.

414                                                                                                          2022
                                                             CHAPTER 5 ASSET RECOVERY & MLA

          The return of assets pursuant to this chapter is a fundamental principle of
          this Convention, and States Parties shall afford one another the widest
          measure of cooperation and assistance in this regard.

Article 51 makes cooperation and assistance mandatory. Procedures and conditions for asset
recovery include facilitating civil and administrative actions (Article 53), recognizing and
taking action on the basis of foreign confiscation orders (Articles 54 and 55), returning
property to requesting states in cases of embezzled public funds or other corruption
offences, and returning property to its legitimate owners (Article 57). UNCAC provides a
direct method of recovery by requiring State Parties to permit civil suits by other State
Parties in their courts and requires that State Parties recognize the judgments of other State
Party courts.

Article 52 calls for "know your customer" policies in financial institutions. It requires that
each State Party take measures requiring financial institutions to verify the identity of
customers and beneficial owners of funds and conduct enhanced scrutiny of accounts sought
or maintained by or on behalf of individuals who are or have been entrusted with prominent
public functions, along with their family members and close associates. This applies to
public officials not just of the government of the jurisdiction where the surveillance takes
place but other countries. State Parties must require their financial institutions report
suspicious transactions, issue advisories, and maintain adequate records. State Parties must
also prevent the establishment of banks known as "shell banks," which have no physical
presence and are not affiliated with a regulated financial group.109

Article 53 requires each State Party to have a legal regime allowing another State Party to
initiate civil litigation for asset recovery in its jurisdiction or to intervene or appear in
proceedings to enforce their claim for compensation. State Parties are required to take
measures to (i) permit another State Party to initiate a civil action in its courts to establish
title to or ownership of property acquired through the commission of a Convention offence;
(ii) permit its courts to order those who have committed offences to pay compensation or
damages to another State Party that has been harmed; and (iii) allow its courts or authorities
to recognize another State Party's claims as legitimate owner of property acquired through
the commission of an offence.

UNCAC sets forth procedures for international cooperation in confiscation matters in
Articles 54 and 55. These Articles create a basic regime for domestic freezing, seizure and
confiscation. Article 54 provides that each State Party must take measures to "adopt laws
that facilitate cooperative asset restraint and confiscation,"110 including duties to enable

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

cooperative confiscation, the duty to give effect to foreign confiscation orders, duties to
enable cooperative freezing and seizure, and duties to act upon foreign orders or requests.

Article 55 implements mutual legal assistance between each State Party by providing a
mechanism for responding to orders and requests from State Parties. It requires each State
Party to:

          (i) submit the request for confiscation over corruption offences to its
                 authorities;

          (ii) submit the order of confiscation issued by a court of the requesting
                 State Party; and

          (iii) take measures to identify, trace and freeze or seize proceeds of crime,
                 property, etc., for confiscation by the requesting state or by
                 themselves.111

Article 55 also sets out the requirements for making a request for assistance.

The assistance sought by the requesting State Party may be refused if the requested State
Party did not receive sufficient and timely evidence or if the property was of de minimis
value.

The United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC)112 also
imposes international obligations on the signatories. Article 13(1) requires a state to act in
response to requests for confiscation from other states to the "greatest extent possible within
its domestic legal system." Note that the obligations under this convention apply only if the
criminal act is carried out by an organized criminal group within the definition under Article
2(1). Article 14(2) requires the return of assets in order to "give compensation to the victims
of crime or return such proceeds of crime to their legitimate owners."

Tim Daniel and James Maton pointed out that UNCAC's asset recovery provisions are based
on the assumption that victim states will attempt to recover assets, which they see as a
fundamental flaw.113 Fear, lack of political will, breakdown of political systems or the
corruption of current leaders in victim countries can easily frustrate UNCAC's asset
recovery goals by preventing requests from victim countries. For example, after the death of
Zaire's kleptocratic President, Mobutu Sese Seko, the Swiss authorities froze Mobutu's Swiss
bank accounts. However, Zaire, by now the Democratic Republic of Congo, failed to request
repatriation of the stolen funds, which allowed the money to be recovered by Mobutu's
family.114 Similarly, Haiti failed to claim funds from a member of Haiti's kleptocratic
Duvalier family during litigation in Switzerland. However, the day after a Swiss court ruled
that the money would be remitted to "Baby Doc" Duvalier, Haiti experienced its 2010

earthquake. The Swiss government prevented the return of the money to Duvalier by
passing a law that allows Switzerland to freeze assets if the rule of law has broken down in
a victim country, incapacitating the victim state's ability to make requests (known as the
"Duvalier law"). Because of UNCAC's reliance on action by victim states, Switzerland was
obliged to pass a new domestic law to circumvent the retention of stolen funds by the
Duvalier family.115

3.2 OECD Convention

Parties to the OECD Convention are required to provide mutual legal assistance to other
jurisdictions investigating offences involving the bribery of public officials. Article 3 states
that each State Party "shall take such measures as may be necessary to provide that the bribe
and the proceeds of the bribery of a foreign public official, or property the value of which
corresponds to the proceeds, are subject to seizure and confiscation or that monetary
sanctions of comparable effect are applicable."116 Proceeds are defined as the "profits or
other benefits derived by the briber from the transaction or other improper advantage
obtained or retained through bribery."

The implementation of the OECD Convention is monitored by the OECD Working Group
on Bribery (WGB), composed of all State Parties. The WGB compiled recommendations for
State Parties in the 2009 Recommendation of the Council for Further Combating Bribery of Foreign
Public Officials in International Business Transactions.117 Recommendation XIII asks State
Parties to "consult ... and cooperate with ... authorities in other countries ... in
investigations and other legal proceedings concerning specific cases of bribery, through such
means as the sharing of information spontaneously or upon request, provision of evidence,
extradition and the identification, freezing, seizure, confiscation, and recovery of the
proceeds of bribery of foreign public officials."118

3.3 Other Instruments

There are several other conventions and agencies that place asset recovery obligations on
convention signatories and agency members. For example:

     1. The Arab Forum on Asset Recovery (AFAR), established in 2012, is an initiative
          supporting asset recovery efforts of Arab countries.

     2. The Busan Partnership for Effective Development Cooperation, created in 2011
          under the auspices of the OECD, committed signatories to strengthening processes
          for the tracing, freezing and recovery of illegal assets.119

     3. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is a policy-making body established to "set
          standards and promote effective implementation of legal, regulatory and
          operational measures for combating money laundering, terrorist financing and
          other related threats to the integrity of the international financial system."120 The
          FATF develops recommendations and monitors the progress of its 36 members.

     4. The Council of European Union (EC) Decision Concerning Cooperation Between Asset
          Recovery Offices of the Member States in the Field of Tracing and Identification of Proceeds
          from, or Other Property Related to, Crime requires that member states set up a National
          Asset Recovery Office and cooperate with the recovery offices of member states.121

     5. The EC Framework Decision on the Application of the Principle of Mutual Recognition to
          Confiscation Orders purports to enable judicial decisions of European Union
          countries to be recognized and executed within deadlines.122

     6. The Council of Europe (CoE) Convention on Laundering, Search, Seizure and
          Confiscation of the Proceeds of Crime and on the Financing of Terrorism requires
          parties to enable themselves to freeze, seize and confiscate proceeds of crime.123

     7. The Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the Mutual Recognition
          of Freezing Orders and Confiscation Orders establishes rules under which a Member
          State is to recognize and execute in its territory a freezing order issued by another
          Member State in the framework of criminal proceedings.124

     8. The CoE Criminal Convention provides some support mechanisms for tracing,

4. INTERNATIONAL MUTUAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE AGREEMENTS

4.1 Introduction

Mutual legal assistance (MLA) is a process by which jurisdictions seek and provide
assistance to other jurisdictions in the gathering of evidence, investigation, and prosecution
of criminal cases, and in tracing, freezing, seizing, and confiscating proceeds of crime. It
facilitates cooperation in dealing with transnational and multinational cases of corruption.
Agreements oblige states to cooperate with requests. There are two types of MLA
agreements: bilateral (between two states) and multilateral (between more than two states).
UNCAC, UNTOC, the OECD Convention and the ASEAN MLA Treaty are examples of
multilateral conventions that provide mutual legal assistance in corruption cases.

MLA may be requested for a broad range of anti-corruption activities, as evidenced by
Article 46(3) of UNCAC (set out in Section 4.3). In most instances, a jurisdiction requests the
assistance of another jurisdiction through a formal written request, although MLA can and
is sometimes provided without a formal request.132

The UNODC states the importance of MLA:

          The importance of effective mutual (legal) assistance as a tool to combat
          transnational crime cannot be overstated. Whatever the applicable legal
          system or tradition, criminal investigations and proceedings are based on
          evidence and increasingly that evidence in the criminal context is located
          outside of national borders. As a result, there is now an increased emphasis
          on a global level on the need to develop effective instruments that will allow
          for seeking and rendering assistance with cross border evidence gathering.
          While law enforcement co-operation by way of informal agreement and
          otherwise remains an important component of international cooperation,
          there are inherent limits to it in that it will not generally extend to the use of
          compulsory measures. Similarly, court to court requests, particularly as
          between states of different legal traditions may be of limited application and
          can prove slow and time consuming. For this reason, many states are
          striving to adopt instruments and measures to allow for the rendering of
          formal mutual (legal) assistance in a direct and effective manner.133

In general, MLA is a three-step process that involves (1) preparing for MLA; (2) drafting;
and (3) submitting a request for MLA.134 Prior to drafting a request for MLA, the requesting
authority decides whether to use the MLA channels or another intelligence or informal
method of cooperation and determines the timing for submitting the request for MLA, the

status of the authority requesting MLA, the type of assistance sought, and the legal basis for
the request, as well as what criminal offence(s) are being investigated.135 The request for
MLA must contain basic identification information, and the narrative section sets out the
facts of the case, description of the assistance sought, objectives of the request, any
procedures to be observed, and transcription of the criminal offences.136 Once prepared, the
request may be transmitted via diplomatic channels (as the general rule), via central
authorities, or directly to the executing authority (if the applicable treaty or international
agreement authorizes direct transmission).137

4.2 Legal Basis

The legal basis for mutual legal assistance can arise out of (1) a convention, (2) a unilateral
treaty (one country to another) or a bilateral treaty (between multiple countries), (3)
unilateral and bilateral agreements, and (4) domestic legislation. Executing a large number
of unilateral or bilateral treaties or agreements can be expensive and time consuming,
especially where there are no other treaty arrangements with a country. As an alternative,
some countries, like Australia, Thailand, and Japan, have enacted domestic legislation
authorizing mutual legal assistance to countries where there is no treaty.138 The assistance is
usually premised on promises of reciprocity. However, only treaties can bind states under
international law, and therefore legislation does not oblige the requested jurisdiction to
assist the foreign requesting states.

4.3 UNCAC

Article 46 of UNCAC states:

          1. State Parties shall afford one another the widest measure of mutual
                legal assistance in investigations, prosecutions and judicial proceedings
                in relation to the offences covered by this Convention.

          2. Mutual legal assistance shall be afforded to the fullest extent possible
                under relevant laws, treaties, agreements and arrangements of the
                requested State Party with respect to investigations, prosecutions and
                judicial proceedings in relation to the offences for which a legal person
                may be held liable in accordance with article 26 of this Convention in
                the requesting State Party.

          3. Mutual legal assistance to be afforded in accordance with this article
                may be requested for any of the following purposes:

                they believe that such information could assist the authority in

4.4 OECD Convention

Article 9 states:

          1. Each Party shall, to the fullest extent possible under its laws and
                relevant treaties and arrangements, provide prompt and effective legal
                assistance to another Party for the purpose of criminal investigations
                and proceedings brought by a Party concerning offences within the
                scope of this Convention and for non-criminal proceedings within the
                scope of this Convention brought by a Party against a legal person. The
                requested Party shall inform the requesting Party, without delay, of any
                additional information or documents needed to support the request for
                assistance and, where requested, of the status and outcome of the
                request for assistance.

4.5 Request Processes and Procedures

Requesting assistance varies depending on the jurisdictions and the treaties, agreements or
legislation in place.139 The request must be tailored to the requirements of the requested
jurisdictions and must specify a legal basis for cooperation (i.e., through conventions,
treaties, bilateral agreements, domestic legislation allowing international cooperation or
promises of reciprocity). The request must also be related to a criminal matter, although
assistance with non-conviction based confiscation may be possible. Some jurisdictions
require charges to be filed or a final confiscation order before providing assistance with
seizure or restraint of assets. The UNODC developed a Mutual Legal Assistance Request
Writer Tool to assist in the process.140

UNCAC Article 46 provides considerable detail on the request process under the
convention. This detail is why some commentators note that "Article 46 is a typical example
of what may be called a `mini treaty within a treaty.'"141 Similar mutual legal assistance
provisions can be found in Article 18 of UNTOC.

      4.5.1 US

The details of the US MLA process are summarized at Section 5.1. The 2016 FATF Mutual
Evaluation Report (2016 US FATF MER) concluded that the United States provides
constructive and timely mutual legal assistance across the range of international co-
operation requests, including in relation to money laundering and asset forfeiture.142

139 For a detailed account of a typical asset recovery process involving MLA, see Tom Lasich, "The
Investigative Process - A Practical Approach" in Tracing Stolen Assets, supra note 38, 49 at 51-59.

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

However, there may be barriers to obtaining beneficial ownership information in a timely
way, and tax information is not generally available to foreign law enforcement authorities
for use in non-tax criminal investigations.143 The MER recommends, in particular, allocating
more resources to process the large number of MLA and extradition requests, as well as
taking urgent steps to ensure that adequate, accurate, and current information about
beneficial owners of legal entities is available in a timely manner.144

As of July 2015, the US was actively seeking MLA in 1,542 criminal matters related to money
laundering, terrorist financing, and asset forfeiture.145 Also, between 2009 and 2014, the US
received 1,541 MLA requests in matters involving money laundering, terrorist financing,
and asset forfeiture.146

International asset sharing is encouraged by US authorities and is available even when a
country makes no direct request for a share of forfeited proceeds of crime.147 According to
the MER, since 1989, more than $257 million in forfeited assets were transferred to 47
countries from the Department of Justice Asset Forfeiture Funds (DOJ-AFF), and since 1994,
the Treasury Forfeiture Fund (TFF) transferred more than $37 million to 29 countries.148

Overall, the report concluded that the United States is "largely compliant" with the FATF
Recommendations 37 ("Mutual legal assistance") and 38 ("Mutual legal assistance: freezing
and confiscation"). The following is an excerpt from the MER assessing the US anti-money
laundering and combatting the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) regime:

 Recommendation 37 - Mutual legal assistance

 In its 3rd MER [Mutual Evaluation Report], the U.S. was rated largely compliant with
 these requirements. The technical deficiency related to potential barriers to granting MLA
 requests linked to the laundering of proceeds that are derived from a designated
 predicate offense that is not covered.

 wide range of MLA in relation to the investigation, prosecution and related proceedings

 for ML [money laundering], TF [terrorism finance] and associated predicate offenses. A
 statutory legal framework applies to all MLA requests regardless of whether they are
 based on a letter rogatory, or letter of request: 18 USC §3512. MLA treaties (MLATs)
 themselves are also a legal framework under which MLA requests may be executed.
 Where a bilateral treaty is not in place, the basis for cooperation may often be found in
 multilateral or regional conventions,149 and agreements.150 Additionally, U.S. courts are
 authorized to provide direct MLA to international tribunals: 28 USC §1782.

 Criterion 37.2 - The U.S. has a central authority for transmitting and executing MLA
 requests - DOJ-OIA [DOJ Office of International Affairs] through which must be
 channeled all requests in criminal matters for legal assistance requiring compulsory
 measures. DOJ-OIA has a prioritisation system in place for incoming and outgoing
 requests by which Treaty requests are prioritized above non-treaty requests. Crimes of
 violence, including terrorism cases, are given a high priority. High priority cases are dealt
 with by order of arrival or urgency (e.g. trial deadline). There is flexibility to deviate from
 these prioritizations in exceptional circumstances. However, due to their current IT
 system, the U.S. is only able to monitor progress and time taken to handle a request.

 Criterion 37.3 - MLA is not prohibited or made to be subject to unduly restrictive
 conditions ...

 Criterion 37.4 - The U.S. does not refuse requests for MLA on the sole ground that the
 offense is also considered to involve fiscal matters, even where the applicable MLATs
 exclude fiscal matters from the scope of assistance151.... Likewise, MLA requests are not
 refused on the sole grounds of secrecy or confidentiality requirements on FIs [financial
 institutions] or DNFBP [designated non-financial businesses and professions], except
 where information is protected by the attorney-client privilege. Attorney-client privilege
 may be overcome if it can be shown that the attorney was actively participating in the
 criminal activities of his/her client.

 Criterion 37.5 - The U.S. maintains the confidentiality of MLA requests received, subject
 to fundamental principles of domestic law, in order to protect the integrity of the
 investigation or inquiry.... Where legal process is required, sealing orders are routinely

149 [128] Including, but not exclusively: the Inter-American Convention on Mutual Assistance in
Criminal Matters ("The OAS MLAT"), the Vienna Convention [arts 7-8), the Convention Combating
Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions (OECD) [arts. 9, 11]; the
International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism [arts. 12-16]; the Palermo
Convention [arts. 18, 21]; Convention Against Corruption (Merida) [arts. 46-49]; Council of Europe
Convention on Cybercrime [arts. 25-35].
150 [129] As of May 2015, the U.S. had 70 such accords in place with 85 territories.
151 [130] For instance the MLATs between the US and Switzerland, the Bahamas, and the Cayman
Islands exclude fiscal matters, including offences involving taxes, customs duties, governmental
monopoly charges and/or exchange control regulations, from the scope of available assistance.
Assistance is however generally available for criminal tax matters relating to the proceeds from
criminal offences.

                                                                                                          425
GLOBAL CORRUPTION

 issued on the basis of the country's invocation of a treaty's confidentiality provision and
 factual circumstances that counsel confidentiality.

 Criterion 37.6 - Where MLA requests do not involve coercive actions, the U.S. does not
 make dual criminality a condition for rendering assistance. Most of the bilateral MLATs
 do not require dual criminality as a condition for granting assistance. Where dual
 criminality is a condition, this is usually restricted to requests for compulsory or coercive
 measures. In such instances, gaps in the ML offenses can adversely impact MLA
 particularly when the foreign request is based on ML activity derived from a predicate
 offense that does not fall within the definition of SUA [specified unlawful activity] or the
 foreign request does not identify the underlying predicate offense (see R.3 [Money
 laundering offense] and R.36 [International instruments]). Conduct-based dual criminality
 applies when issuing search warrants necessary to execute a foreign request: 18 USC
 3512(e). There is no dual criminality requirement for most court orders issued pursuant
 to 18 USC §3512 in aid of requests for assistance from foreign authorities.

 Criterion 37.7 - Where dual criminality applies, technical differences between the
 offense's categorization in the requesting State do not prevent the U.S. from providing
 the requested assistance. It is enough to determine that the underlying acts are
 criminalized in both States. The U.S. has not denied any MLA requests on the basis of
 dual criminality (ML, TF and asset forfeiture).

 Criterion 37.8 - The powers and investigative techniques required under R.31 and which
 are otherwise available to domestic competent authorities are also available for use in
 response to MLA requests.... However, the interception of communications can only be
 undertaken as a part of a U.S. investigation.

 Weighting and Conclusion:

 The minor shortcomings identified in R.3 [Money laundering offense] could limit assistance
 when dual criminality applies. The interception of communications can only be
 undertaken as part of a U.S. investigation. The OIA case management system is being
 improved to facilitate the electronic monitoring of the processing of outgoing and
 incoming requests process and the monitoring of the time taken to handle these.

 Recommendation 37 is rated largely compliant.

 Recommendation 38 - Mutual legal assistance: Freezing and Confiscation

 In its 3rd MER, the U.S. was rated largely compliant with these requirements. The
 technical deficiency related to potential barriers to granting MLA request linked to the
 laundering of proceeds that are derived from a designated predicate offense which is not
 covered.

 Criterion 38.1 - The U.S. has a range of authorities to take action in response to requests
 by foreign countries to identify, freeze, seize or confiscate laundered property, proceeds,

426                                                                                             2022

and instrumentalities used or intended for use in ML, TF or associated predicate offenses,
or property of corresponding value including:

     (a) Providing assistance in identifying and tracing assets mainly via informal
          police-to-police communication and information sharing networks
          Additionally, the U.S may obtain evidence for court proceedings on behalf of a
          foreign request including testimony, documents, or tangible items: 18 USC 3512
          (see R.37).

     (b) Restraining or seizing assets located in the U.S. upon the request of a foreign
          country for preservation purposes: 28 USC 2467(d)(3)(A)(i).

     (c) Enforcing foreign confiscation orders. The U.S. may also restrain untainted
          property as long as these are subject to forfeiture and provided all other
          requirements are met: 28 USC 2467.

     (d) Enforcing a foreign confiscation judgment on the condition that the requesting
          country is party to the Vienna Convention, a MLAT or other international
          agreement with the U.S. that provides for confiscation assistance. The offense
          must: i) be an offense for which forfeiture would be available under U.S. Federal
          law if the criminal conduct occurred in the U.S; or ii) is a foreign offense that is a
          predicate for a U.S. ML offense: 28 USC 2467 (a)(2) & 18 USC 1956(c)(7(B).

     (e) Initiating its own civil forfeiture proceedings against any property, proceeds
          and instrumentalities: 18 USC 981(b)(4). In such cases, the U.S. can proceed if it
          can state sufficiently detailed facts to support a reasonable belief that the
          property would be subject to forfeiture under U.S. Federal law, based on its
          own evidence and evidence from the requesting State, of a predicate offense for
          confiscation under U.S. law which would make that the property subject to
          confiscation.

Gaps in the ML offenses and the requirement for dual criminality are potentially an issue
when the predicate offense is not one covered in the U.S. However, no MLA request has
been denied on the basis of dual criminality (ML, TF and asset forfeiture).

Criterion 38.2 - The U.S. has authority to provide assistance to requests for cooperation
made on the basis of non-conviction-based (NCBF) proceedings and related provisional
measures 18 USC 981(b)(4)(A)-(B). Provisional measures may also be carried out under
the enforcement of a foreign judgment any time, before or after, the initiation of
enforcement proceedings by a foreign nation, including NCBF proceedings: 28 USC
2467(d)(3)(A)(1).

Criterion 38.3 - The U.S. has arrangements for coordinating seizure and confiscation
actions with other countries; and for managing and disposing of property frozen, seized,
or confiscated whether by on its own behalf or on behalf of a foreign government.

Criterion 38.4 - The U.S shares the proceeds of successful forfeiture actions with countries
that made possible, or substantially facilitated, the forfeiture of assets under U.S. law as
set out in free-standing international asset sharing agreements or asset sharing provisions
within mutual legal assistance agreements and multilateral treaties by 18 USC §981(i), 21

                                                                                                        427
GLOBAL CORRUPTION

 USC §881(e)(1)(E), and 31 USC §9703(h)(2). AFMLS may negotiate case specific, bilateral
 asset sharing arrangements even in the absence of specific agreement/treaty.

 Weighting and Conclusion:

 In the context of dual criminality requirements, the gaps identified under R.3 [Money
 laundering offense] may be a barrier to providing freezing and confiscation assistance,
 particularly when the predicate offense is not covered in the U.S.

Canadian AML/CFT regime:

                                                            BEGINNING OF EXCERPT

 Recommendation 37 - Mutual legal assistance

 In its third MER [Mutual Evaluation Report], Canada was rated LC [Largely Compliant]
 with former R.36 and SR. V due to concerns about Canada's ability to handle MLA
 requests in a timely and effective manner and about the lack of adequate data that would
 establish effective implementation. Canada's legal framework for MLA was
 supplemented by Canada's new Protecting Canadians from Online Crime Act (PCOCA,
 in force 9 March 2015). The requirements of the (new) R.37 are more detailed.

 Criterion 37.1 - Canada has a sound legal framework for international cooperation. The
 main instruments used are the Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Act
 (MLACMA); the relevant international conventions, the Extradition Act; 57 bilateral
 treaties on MLA in criminal matters, extradition and asset sharing; and MOUs for the
 other forms of assistance to exchange financial intelligence, supervisory, law enforcement
 or other information with counterparts. These instruments allow the country to provide

rapid and wide MLA. In the absence of a treaty, Canada is able to assist in simpler
measures (interviewing witnesses or providing publicly available documents), or, based
in the MLACMA, to enter in specific administrative arrangements, that would provide
the framework for the assistance.

Criterion 37.2 - Canada uses a central authority (the Minister of Justice, assisted by the
International Assistance Group - IAG) for the transmission and execution of requests.
There are clear processes for the prioritization and execution of mutual legal assistance
requests, and a system called "iCase" is used to manage the cases and monitor progress
on requests.

Criterion 37.3 - MLA is not prohibited or made subject to unduly restrictive conditions.
Canada provides MLA with or without a treaty, although MLA without a treaty is less
comprehensive. Requests must meet generally the "reasonable grounds to believe
standard, in relation for example to MLACMA ss 12 (search warrant) and 18 (production
orders). However, certain warrants (financial information, CC, s.487.018, tracing
communications, and new s.487.015) may be obtained on the lower standard of
"reasonable ground to suspect."

Criterion 37.4 - Canada does not impose a restriction on MLA on the grounds that the
offense is also considered to involve fiscal matters, nor on the grounds of secrecy or
confidentiality requirements on FIs or DNFBPs [Designated Non-Financial Businesses
and Professions].

Criterion 37.5 - MLACMA, s.22.02 (2) states that the competent authority must apply ex
parte for a production order that was requested [on] behalf of a state of entity. In addition
to that, the international Conventions signed, ratified and implemented by Canada
include specific clauses requiring the confidentiality of MLA requests be maintained.

Criterion 37.6 - Canada does not require dual criminality to execute MLA requests for
non-coercive actions.

Criterion 37.7 - Dual criminality is required for the enforcement of foreign orders for
restraint, seizure and forfeiture or property situated in Canada. MLACMA, ss.9.3 (3) (a)
and (b) and 9.4 (1) (3) (5) (a) (b) and (c) allow the Attorney General of Canada to file the
order so that it can be entered as a judgment that can be executed anywhere in Canada if
the person has been charged with an offense within the jurisdiction of the requesting state,
and the offense would be an indictable offense if it were committed in Canada. This
applies regardless of the denomination and the category of offenses used.

Criterion 37.8 - Most, but not all of the powers and investigative techniques that are at
the Canadian LEAs' [law enforcement agencies'] disposal are made available for use in
response to requests for MLA. The relevant powers listed in core issue 37.1 are available
to foreign authorities via an MLA request, including the compulsory taking of a witness
statement (according to MLACMA, s.18).... Foreign orders for restraint, seizure and

                                                                                                        429
GLOBAL CORRUPTION

 confiscation can be directly enforced by the Attorney General before a superior court, as
 if it were a Canadian judicial order.

 Weighting and Conclusion

 The range of investigative measures available is insufficient.

 Canada is largely compliant with R.37.

 Recommendation 38 - Mutual legal assistance: freezing and confiscation

 Canada was rated LC with R.38 in the 2008 MER due to the limited evidence of effective
 confiscation assistance, the rare occurrence of sharing of assets and the fact that Canada
 executed requests to enforce corresponding value judgments as fines. The framework
 remains the same.

 Criterion 38.1 - Canada has the authority to take expeditious action in response to
 requests by foreign countries to identify, freeze, seize or confiscate laundered property
 and proceeds from crime (MLACMA, ss.9.3, 9.4 and CC, ss.462.32, 462.33), and
 instrumentalities used in or intended for use in ML [money laundering], predicate
 offenses or TF [terrorist financing]. There is, however, no legal basis for the confiscation
 of property of corresponding value. As was the case during its previous assessment,
 Canada still treats value-based forfeiture judgement as fines, which has limitations and
 cannot be executed against the property. If the fine is not paid, it can be converted into a
 prison sentence. Regarding the identification of financial assets new CC, s.487.018 allows
 the production of financial registration data in response to requests from foreign states.

 Criterion 38.2 - In Canada, MLA is based on the federal power in relation to criminal law.
 Therefore, the enforcement of some foreign non-conviction based confiscation orders is
 not possible under the MLACMA because they were not issued by a "court of criminal
 jurisdiction." However, in cases where the accused has died or absconded before the end
 of the foreign criminal proceedings, the MLACMA applies because the matter would still
 be criminal in nature. Due to Canada's constitutional division of powers, the Government
 of Canada cannot respond to a request for civil forfeiture as such requests fall within the
 jurisdiction of Canada's provinces. However, most of the Canadian provinces have
 already adopted legislation on a civil confiscation regime. Even if Canada is not able to
 provide assistance to requests for cooperation based on NCB proceedings, non-conviction
 based confiscation is possible under Canadian law. Should a foreign state seek to recover
 assets from Canada [through] NCB asset forfeiture, it must hire private counsel to act on
 its behalf in the province where the property or asset is located.

 Criterion 38.3 - a) No particular legal basis is required in Canada for the coordination of
 seizure and confiscation actions. It is a matter primarily for national and foreign police
 authorities at the stage of seizure. Thus, via direct police-to-police contact, arrangements
 are made in relation to any relevant case.

430                                                                                            2022

 b) The Seized Property Management Act sets out the mechanisms for the management
 and, when necessary, the disposition of property restrained, seized and forfeited ...

 Criterion 38.4 - Canada shares confiscated property on a mutual agreement basis, under
 the Seized Property Management Act, s.11. Canada has 19 bilateral treaties regarding the
 sharing and transfer of forfeited or confiscated assets and equivalent funds.

 Weighting and Conclusion

 The seizure and confiscation regime has a deficiency, which is the impossibility of
 confiscation of equivalent value.

 Canada is largely compliant with R.38.154

                                                                 END OF EXCERPT

      4.5.4 Asia-Pacific Countries

Many Asia-Pacific countries experience significant challenges in making MLA requests to
other countries and responding to MLA requests that they receive from other countries. In
1999, some jurisdictions in the Asia-Pacific region began cooperating with each other
through the ADB/OECD Anti-Corruption Initiative for Asia and the Pacific (which is jointly
managed by the OECD and the Asian Development Bank (ADB)) (the Initiative).155 As of
2021, there are 31 members of the initiative who cooperate on a regional basis. In 2005, the
Initiative identified ineffective MLA systems as a serious obstacle to fighting corruption. In
2007, the ADB and OECD published a detailed report on the problems and suggestions for
improvement.156 That report has been followed up by a 2017 ADB/OECD report entitled
Mutual Legal Assistance in Asia and the Pacific: Experiences in 31 Jurisdictions.157 This report
focuses on common challenges, best practices, and practical tools. Annex B of the report
provides statistical data from each country on MLA requests made, received, and rendered.

4.6 Grounds for Refusal of MLA Request under UNCAC and OECD

       Convention

There are several grounds upon which a jurisdiction can refuse a request for mutual legal
assistance. The specific grounds for refusal of a request for mutual legal assistance in the US,
UK, and Canada are summarized in Sections 5.1, 5.2, and 5.3.

1. Dual Criminality. A request may be refused where the requested jurisdiction does not
criminalize the conduct that the requesting jurisdiction is investigating or prosecuting. The
problem may be resolved by employing a conduct-based approach, which involves re-
examining the criminal conduct in order to fit the conduct into the criminal law framework
of the requested jurisdiction. Some countries, for example Canada, do not require dual
criminality for most requests based on treaties.

UNCAC Article 46(9) states the following with respect to the dual criminality requirement:

                (a) A requested State Party, in responding to a request for assistance
                     pursuant to this article in the absence of dual criminality, shall
                     take into account the purposes of this Convention, as set forth in
                     article 1;

                (b) States Parties may decline to render assistance pursuant to this
                     article on the ground of absence of dual criminality. However, a
                     requested State Party shall, where consistent with the basic
                     concepts of its legal system, render assistance that does not
                     involve coercive action. Such assistance may be refused when
                     requests involve matters of a de minimis nature or matters for
                     which the cooperation or assistance sought is available under
                     other provisions of this Convention;

                (c) Each State Party may consider adopting such measures as may be
                     necessary to enable it to provide a wider scope of assistance
                     pursuant to this article in the absence of dual criminality.

The OECD Convention in Article 9 states:

          2. Where a Party makes mutual legal assistance conditional upon the
                existence of dual criminality, dual criminality shall be deemed to exist
                if the offence for which the assistance is sought is within the scope of
                this Convention.

2. Essential Interests. Refusal may occur where the execution of the request could prejudice
the "essential interests" of the requested jurisdiction (i.e., sovereignty, security, burden on
public resources, and public order). Bilateral treaties may specify the essential interests that
allow parties to deny mutual legal assistance. UNCAC also allows denial on grounds of
essential interests:

          Article 46(21). Mutual legal assistance may be refused:

432  2022
                                                             CHAPTER 5 ASSET RECOVERY & MLA

                (b) If the requested State Party considers that execution of the request
                     is likely to prejudice its sovereignty, security, public order or other
                     essential interests.

The meaning of the terms "essential interests" or "public interests" is not precise, which
impairs the effectiveness of international cooperation treaties. Article 5 of the OECD
Convention recognizes that the investigation and prosecution of corruption cases can be
impacted by "considerations of national economic interest, the potential effect upon
relations with another State or the identity of the natural or legal persons involved."

3. Assets of de minimis value. As mutual legal assistance is resource intensive, UNCAC
provides at Article 55(7) that jurisdictions can refuse to assist where the assets involved are
de minimis.

4. Lack of information. Requests must provide sufficient evidence and information to enable
the requested jurisdiction's authorities to meet evidentiary thresholds in their domestic
courts (see Art. 46(21)(a) and Article 55(7)).

5. Lack of due process in requesting jurisdiction. UNCAC Article 46(21)(d) states:

          21. Mutual legal assistance may be refused:

                (d) If it would be contrary to the legal system of the requested State
                     Party relating to mutual legal assistance for the request to be
                     granted.

6. Double jeopardy and ongoing proceedings or investigations in the requested
jurisdiction or severe penalty deemed to be too harsh. A requested state may deny
assistance if the accused person has been acquitted or punished for the conduct underlying
the request for assistance. They may also deny assistance if there are ongoing proceedings
or investigations in the requested state concerning the same crime for which the requesting
state seeks assistance.

7. Immunity. Some public officials are provided with immunity, but immunity can be
waived or subsequently repealed. For instance, in the Ferdinand Marcos case, the successive
Philippines government enabled action to be taken against him by providing a waiver of
immunity. 158

8. Bank Secrecy is not a ground for refusing mutual legal assistance. UNCAC Articles 46(8),
(22) and 40 state the following:

          Article 46 - Mutual legal assistance

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

          8. States Parties shall not decline to render mutual legal assistance
                pursuant to this article on the ground of bank secrecy.

          22. States Parties may not refuse a request for mutual legal assistance on
                the sole ground that the offence is also considered to involve fiscal
                matters.

          Article 40 - Bank secrecy
          Each State Party shall ensure that, in the case of domestic criminal
          investigations of offences established in accordance with this Convention,
          there are appropriate mechanisms available within its domestic legal
          system to overcome obstacles that may arise out of the application of bank
          secrecy laws.

OECD Convention provides a similar obligation in Article 9(3).

9. Reasons must be provided for refusing mutual legal assistance.

UNCAC Article 46(23) states:

          23. Reasons shall be given for any refusal of mutual legal assistance.

10. Mutual legal assistance may also be postponed.

UNCAC Article 46(25) and (26) states:

          25. Mutual legal assistance may be postponed by the requested State
                Party on the ground that it interferes with an ongoing investigation,
                prosecution or judicial proceeding.

          26. Before refusing a request pursuant to paragraph 21 of this article or
                postponing its execution pursuant to paragraph 25 of this article, the
                requested State Party shall consult with the requesting State Party to
                consider whether assistance may be granted subject to such terms
                and conditions as it deems necessary. If the requesting State Party
                accepts assistance subject to those conditions, it shall comply with
                the conditions.

11. Power to Override by Bilateral Agreement. Paragraphs 9 to 29 of UNCAC Article 46 can
be overridden by a bilateral agreement, as per Paragraph 7.

4.7 Barriers to MLA

MLA procedures are challenging for developing nations and nearly impossible for
failing states due to the complexity and variety of formatting requirements (see

434  2022
                                                             CHAPTER 5 ASSET RECOVERY & MLA

Section 6.1.3). The MLA process is time-consuming and often hindered by the difficulty of
tracing the location and ownership of assets.159

When central authorities for MLA are themselves corrupt, their potential to wreak havoc in
MLA procedures is boundless. An example is provided in the case of James Ibori, a former
governor of Delta State in Nigeria, who allegedly stole between $300 million and $3.4 billion
while in public office. Investigations into Ibori by British law enforcement began in 2005.
Assistance was provided by Nigeria's Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC)
during the early stages of the investigation. In Nigeria, the Attorney General is the central
authority for MLA purposes, and part way through the investigations, Michael Aondoakaa
was appointed as the new Attorney General. Aondoakaa actively worked against
investigation and prosecution of Ibori, among others, and, in his capacity as central
authority, demanded that any evidence provided to the UK by the EFCC be returned.
Although Aondoakaa was dismissed in 2010, he provides an example of the potential
problems involved in entrusting MLA responsibilities to central authorities in corrupt
states. 160

The Abacha Loot

Barriers exist even in relatively successful cases of asset recovery. The Abacha case in Nigeria
provides an example of a fairly successful asset recovery effort, although many hurdles were
encountered along the way. General Sani Abacha was Nigeria's last military dictator and
allegedly pilfered between $3 to $5 billion from the country. Nigeria began its efforts to
recover the "Abacha loot" in 1999 when it requested Switzerland to assist in freezing
Abacha's accounts.

Daniel and Maton describe the successes and challenges encountered in the Abacha saga.161
At the time Daniel and Maton wrote their article in 2013, about $2.3 billion had been
recovered by Nigeria, and other funds have been recovered since then. After sixteen years,
Swiss proceedings relating to the Abacha loot were concluded in March 2015 with a decision
to return 360 million to Nigeria.

According to Daniel and Maton, Nigeria's ability to maintain political will from 1999 to the
present has contributed greatly to successes in the asset recovery process. Nigeria also set
up a Special Investigative Panel that uncovered valuable information to assist in MLA
requests. In Switzerland, Nigeria was able to take part in proceedings through the partie civile
procedure. This allowed Nigeria to persuade the Court that the Abacha family was a
criminal organization, thereby shifting the burden of proof to the Abacha family to show
that their funds were legitimate. Since the Abacha family was unable to do so, Nigeria
recovered $500 million. Nigeria promised to devote the money to projects for the benefit of
the Nigerian people and the World Bank was appointed as trustee to ensure the funds were
used properly. These proceedings lasted six years in total.

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

Along with these relative successes, Daniel and Maton also describe the many challenges
encountered during the asset recovery and MLA processes. For example, the UK took four
years to provide the information requested by Nigeria. During this time, the Abacha family
brought two applications for judicial review in the UK, slowing the process. The Abachas
also mounted many challenges to MLA requests in other jurisdictions, using seemingly
endless funding for such legal battles. The process of asset recovery was also hindered by
Nigerian court judgments that were likely the product of bribes. For example, a Nigerian
court complicated the MLA process in the UK by declaring MLA requests unconstitutional.
Liechtenstein's Chief Examining Magistrate was also ordered by a court to refrain from
interviewing Abacha's eldest son on the basis that such an interview would be against the
rule of law and infringe sovereignty. In June 2014, however, Liechtenstein succeeded in
returning $227 million of the Abacha loot to Nigeria. In order to obtain this recovery and
end legal challenges against the Liechtenstein proceedings by the Abacha family, Nigeria
agreed to drop charges against Abacha's eldest son.

Mutual legal assistance is almost always essential to the pursuit of asset recovery in large-
scale corruption cases. The following excerpt from a 2011 StAR/World Bank publication,
entitled Barriers to Asset Recovery: An Analysis of the Key Barriers and Recommendations for
Action,162 starts with a summary of MLA provisions in the US.

 United States

 A. MLA Legal Framework and Preconditions to Cooperation (General)

 A.1. Relevant Laws, Treaties, and Conventions Dealing with or Including a
 Component Relevant for MLA and Asset Recovery

  The United States provides assistance directly based on bilateral and multilateral
       treaties, letters of request, and letters rogatory. The types of assistance available are
       very broad but, with regard to asset recovery, depend on the provisions of the
       applicable treaty or convention to a specific case.

  The United States has entered into bilateral MLA treaties with more than 70
       jurisdictions.... An agreement was also entered into on June 25, 2003, between the
       United States and the European Union concerning mutual legal assistance that,
       among other things, provides a mechanism for more quickly exchanging
       information regarding bank accounts held by suspects in criminal investigations.

 The United States has ratified the Merida Convention and may therefore grant MLA
     directly based on the provisions of the convention. The United States has also
     ratified the Inter-American Convention on Mutual Legal Assistance of the
     Organization of American States; the Vienna, Palermo, and the Financing of
     Terrorism conventions; the Inter-American Convention against Terrorism; the Inter-
     American Convention on Letters Rogatory and the Additional Protocol to the
     Convention; the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public
     Officials in International Business Transactions; and the Inter-American Convention
     against Corruption.

 The United States responds to requests in the form of letters of requests and letters
     rogatory, as well as to MLA requests, pursuant to US Code Title 28 Section 1782 and
     US Code Title 18 Section 3512 even in the absence of a treaty relationship. The
     United States is able to provide broad assistance in response to requests from
     foreign authorities.

A.2. Legal Preconditions for the Provision of MLA

 Most bilateral MLA treaties do not generally require dual criminality. Some but not
     all of them require dual criminality with respect to coercive measures ...

 Many forms of assistance based on letters of request or letters rogatory, including

     the issuance of compulsory measures, do not require dual criminality.

A.3. Grounds for Refusal of MLA

 Grounds for refusals are set out in the applicable bilateral and multilateral
     agreements, such as Article 7 of the Vienna Convention, Article 18 of the Palermo
     Convention, and Article 46 of the Merida Convention.

B. MLA General Procedures

B.1. Central Authority Competent to Receive, Process, and Implement MLA Requests
in Criminal Matters

 The Office of International Affairs of the Department of Justice (OIA) is the U.S.
     central authority for all requests for MLA and coordinates all international evidence
     gathering.

 OIA has attorneys and support staff with responsibilities and expertise in various
     parts of the world and in different substantive areas. The OIA executes MLA
     requests through competent law enforcement authorities.... Requests for freezing,
     seizing, or confiscation of assets are executed in close cooperation with the
     Department of Justice's Asset Forfeiture Money Laundering Section.

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

 C.1. Stage of Proceedings at Which Assistance may be Requested

  Most bilateral treaties allow for the provision of MLA during the investigative stage.
       Equally, OIA may apply to the courts for a production order or a search, freezing, or
       seizing warrant once an investigation has commenced in the requesting country,
       depending on the provisions of the MLA treaty or convention at issue.

 Tracing

 C.2. Available Tracing Mechanisms

  The types of measures available with respect to MLA requests by a specific country
       and with respect to a specific offense depend on the provisions of the applicable
       multilateral and bilateral treaties. In general, bilateral treaties allow for a substantial
       range of measures, including taking the testimony or statements of persons;
       providing documents, records, and other items; locating or identifying persons or
       items; serving documents; transferring persons in custody for testimony or other
       purposes; executing searches and seizures; assisting in proceedings related to
       immobilization and forfeiture of assets and restitution; collection of fines; and any
       other form of assistance not prohibited by the laws of the requested state.

  For requests based on letters of request or letters rogatory, OIA, based on US Code
       Title 18 Section 3512 or Title 28 Section 1782, may request the district court to order
       any person to give a testimony or statement or to produce a document or other
       thing for use in proceedings in a foreign tribunal, including in the course of criminal
       investigations conducted before the filing of formal accusations. Furthermore, OIA
       may apply to a federal judge for issuance of search warrants and other compulsory
       measures.

 C.3. Access to Information Covered by Banking or Professional Secrecy

  Information covered by financial secrecy may be provided, if necessary by a court
       order.

  Information subject to professional legal privilege is protected from disclosure.

 Provisional Measures (Freezing, Seizing, and Restraint Orders)

 C.4. Direct Enforcement of Foreign Freezing and Seizing Orders

  For requests based on a treaty or agreement that provides for assistance in forfeiture
       (for example, the Merida Convention), US Code Title 28 Section 2467 allows for the
       registration and subsequent direct enforcement of foreign restraining orders to
       preserve property that is or may become subject to forfeiture or confiscation. Recent
       case law has called into question the viability of this option in the prejudgment
       context, and the Department of Justice is considering the need for a statutory
       amendment to clarify the congressional intent to enforce foreign prejudgment
       restraining orders.

438                                                                                                 2022

 Requests for enforcement of foreign orders have to be submitted, along with a
     certified copy of the foreign order, to the U.S. attorney general, who will make a
     final decision on whether to grant the request.

C.5. Issuance of Domestic Provisional Measures upon Request by a Foreign
Jurisdiction

 Legal basis: US Code Title 28 Section 2467
 Procedure: OIA, often in conjunction with the Asset Forfeiture and Money

     Laundering Section, may apply to the courts for issuance of a restraining order on
     behalf of the requesting country.
 Evidentiary requirements: The United States may initiate domestic seizing
     proceedings if the requesting country can establish through written affidavit that an
     investigation or proceeding is under way and that there are reasonable grounds to
     believe that the property to be restrained will be confiscated at the conclusion of
     such proceedings. The request has to be made pursuant to a treaty or agreement that
     provides for mutual assistance in forfeiture, and the foreign offenses that give rise to
     confiscation also have to give rise to confiscation under U.S. federal law.

Confiscation

C.6. Enforcement of Foreign Confiscation Orders

 Legal basis: US Code Title 28 Section 2467.
 Procedure: Requests for enforcement of foreign orders, including a copy of the

     foreign order, have to be submitted to the U.S. attorney general, who will in turn
     make a final decision on whether the request should be granted. If the request is
     granted, the attorney general may apply to the district court for enforcement.
 Evidentiary requirements: The requested state must provide a certified copy of the
     judgment and submit an affidavit or sworn statement by a person familiar with the
     underlying confiscation proceedings setting forth a summary of the facts of the case
     and a description of the proceedings that resulted in the confiscation judgment, as
     well as showing that the jurisdiction in question, in accordance with the principles
     of due process, provided notice to all persons with an interest in the property in
     sufficient time to enable such persons to defend against the confiscation and that the
     judgment rendered is in force and is not subject to appeal.

C.7. Applicability of Non-Conviction Based Asset Forfeiture Orders

 The United States can seek the registration and enforcement of a foreign forfeiture
     judgment whether it is for specific property or an order to pay a sum of money,
     whether conviction based or non-conviction based.

                                                                                                        439

 III. OVERVIEW OF CURRENT U.S. FORFEITURE PROCESSES
 A. Preference for Administrative Forfeiture

 Each year, the majority, generally over 60 percent, of federal forfeitures in the U.S. are
 obtained through administrative forfeiture. The reason is that most seizures are not
 contested. This may seem strange at first, but when one considers that most of the
 property seized for forfeiture in the U.S. constitutes large bundles of cash, it is readily
 apparent why many seizures are not challenged, particularly if the person from whom
 the cash was seized is not arrested or later indicted. No one really wants to come forward
 to swear that he or she has an interest in such large amounts of generally quite
 unexplained U.S. currency. Administrative forfeiture is not used for real property or
 businesses. Since 1990, the Customs laws (19 U.S.C. § 1607, et seq.) have permitted
 administrative forfeiture of currency and monetary instruments165 without limit, and of
 other personal property up to a value of $500,000.

163 [98] Practitioners should contact the nearest United States embassy to determine the appropriate
attaché office.

165 [3] Monetary instruments include such items as bank checks, traveller's checks, money orders, and
bearer paper, but not bank or other financial accounts.

                                                             CHAPTER 5 ASSET RECOVERY & MLA

 An administrative forfeiture usually begins when a federal law enforcement agency
 seizes an asset identified during the course of a criminal investigation.166 The investigation
 may be a purely federal one, or may be a task force which also involves state and/or local
 law enforcement agencies. The asset seizure must be based upon "probable cause" to
 believe that the property is subject to forfeiture. Once the asset is seized, attorneys for the
 seizing agency are required by CAFRA [Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act of 2000] to send
 notice to any persons whom the government has reason to believe may have an interest
 in the property. Such notice must be sent within 60 days of the seizure if a federal agent
 seized the property. An administrative forfeiture can also be based upon an "adoptive
 seizure," where a state or local officer has seized the property under the authority of state
 or local law, but then transfers it to federal custody for forfeiture. In that case, the federal
 adopting agency has 90 days after the seizure within which to send notice.... A person
 receiving notice has 30 days within which to file a sworn claim with the seizing agency,
 asking for one of two types of relief: (1) the opportunity to challenge the forfeiture in
 court; or (2) remission or mitigation from the forfeiture.... If no one files a claim after the
 deadlines provided in the notice and publication expire, the property is summarily
 forfeited to the United States. Remission or mitigation may be provided if certain
 guidelines are met.

 B. Civil (Non-Conviction Based) Judicial Forfeiture in the U.S.

 In the United States, non-conviction based ("NCB") forfeiture is known as "civil
 forfeiture." This judicial process may be brought at any time prior to or after criminal
 charges are filed, or even if criminal charges are never filed. It is an action filed in court
 against a property, not against a person.167 Once the U.S. Attorney's Office receives a
 referral from a seizing agency of a seized asset case, that office has 90 days to either file a
 civil judicial case or include the seized asset in a criminal indictment and name it for
 criminal forfeiture. 18 U.S.C. § 983(a)(3)(A). If a civil case is not filed within those 90 days,
 the CAFRA "death penalty" will prevent the United States from ever filing a civil
 forfeiture case. 18 U.S.C. § 983(a)(3)(B). If the asset is included in an indictment and the
 defendant is later acquitted or has a conviction reversed on appeal, the property cannot
 be forfeited. For this reason, many U.S. prosecutors choose to file a timely civil forfeiture
 action and include the property for criminal forfeiture in an indictment. The law also
 allows the prosecutor or the claimant to obtain a "stay" of the civil forfeiture case while a
 criminal investigation is pending. Thus, if the defendant is convicted of an offence which

166 [4] In the US, as in most countries, each agency is responsible for the enforcement of a different
category of criminal laws: for example, the Drug Enforcement Administration ("DEA") investigates
drug crimes; the Federal Bureau of Investigation ("FBI") investigates most white collar crime and
terrorism; and the Immigration and Customs Enforcement ("ICE") and Customs and Border Patrol
("CBP") of the Department of Homeland Security investigate smuggling violations, intellectual
property violations, human trafficking, passport fraud, drug violations at the border and bulk cash
smuggling. Note that not all federal law enforcement agencies have administrative forfeiture
authority.
167 [5] This is why civil forfeiture actions in the U.S. have names like United States v. One Sixth Share,
326 F.3d 36 (1st Cir. 2003) (because civil forfeiture is an in rem proceeding, the property subject to
forfeiture is the defendant); United States v. All Funds in Account Nos. 747.034/278, 295 F.3d 23 (D.C.
Cir. 2002) (civil forfeiture actions are brought against property, not people).

                                                                                                          441
GLOBAL CORRUPTION

will give rise to the forfeiture, the forfeiture may be obtained more easily in the criminal
case, although it will not be final until all appeals are exhausted.

Because civil forfeiture does not depend upon a conviction, it may be filed at any time.
Often the case will be filed under seal before criminal charges are brought, providing for
Warrants of Arrest in Rem to be issued for the assets which may be served by the law
enforcement officers at any time. These warrants are similar to seizure warrants, and are
issued by the presiding judge in the civil forfeiture case. Rule G(8) of the Supplemental
Rules for Certain Admiralty and Maritime Claims ("Rule G(8)") prescribes the procedures
which must be followed in a civil forfeiture action, which include: (1) notice to all
potential claimants, even if notice was already provided in an administrative process; and
(2) full publication notice by either newspaper or internet. Claimants have 30 days from
when they are notified to submit a sworn claim indicating the basis for asserting an
interest in the property (even if a claim was already submitted in an administrative case),
and must, within 20 days after a Claim is filed, file an Answer with the court directly
responding to the allegations in the prosecutor's judicial complaint. If those deadlines are
not met, the prosecutor can seek a "default" judgment of forfeiture, which will generally
be granted, particularly if the claimant is represented by counsel who blew the deadlines!

If a timely claim is filed, the case will follow the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in U.S.
District Court. Civil discovery in the nature of interrogatories and depositions may take
place. Prior to discovery, either side may file for a judgment on the pleadings. Following
discovery, either side may file for summary judgment on legal issues supported by
uncontested facts. If the case survives this "motions practice," either side may request a
trial by civil jury of nine persons, of whom a majority must agree on a verdict of forfeiture
in order for the property to be civilly forfeited to the United States. The government has
to prove by a "preponderance of the evidence" that the property is linked to the
underlying crime as alleged.168 In the United States, civil forfeiture is not available for any
type of "value-based" forfeiture judgment, money judgment, or property which is
equivalent to the criminally-derived or involved property. Such forfeitures require that
the defendant be bound by in personam jurisdiction. Because the jurisdiction in civil
forfeiture is in rem, U.S. law requires a "nexus" to the crime - either as proceeds or
instrumentality, or - in the case of money laundering - an "involvement in" the crime in
some manner.

A Claimant in a civil forfeiture case may take one or both of two approaches to defending
a forfeiture: (1) he or she may challenge the government's ability to sustain its burden to
prove the property has a "nexus" to the crime; and/or (2) he or she may assert an
"innocent owner" status which would deny forfeiture even if the government proves
forfeitability. If the Claimant asserts "innocent owner" status, he or she has the burden to
prove that defence by a "preponderance of the evidence". A civil forfeiture judgment may
be appealed from the U.S. District Court to the U.S. Court of Appeals of that federal
circuit. The appeal is first heard by a three judge panel; and, the losing party may seek
rehearing by the panel or by the entire en banc panel of the circuit's appellate judges. If

168 [6] The "preponderance of the evidence" standard is also known in the United States as "more  2022
likely than not" and abroad is frequently referred to as a "balancing of the probabilities."

the case involves a novel issue or one which has created a conflict between any of the
eleven federal circuits, then certiorari may be granted by the U.S. Supreme Court.

C. Ease of Criminal Judicial Forfeiture in the U.S.

As previously noted and as in most countries providing for criminal forfeiture, criminal
forfeiture in the United States is dependent upon a conviction of a defendant for a crime
which provides a basis for the forfeiture.... Over the years, United States criminal
forfeiture laws have gradually expanded, and in 2000, CAFRA added 28 U.S.C. § 2461(c)
which provides that if any law provides for civil forfeiture, then the prosecutor may also
include a criminal forfeiture for the property in a criminal indictment. Now prosecutors
often seek parallel civil and criminal proceedings against the same property.

Criminal forfeiture is in personam, against the defendant. One drawback to this type of
forfeiture under U.S. law is that only property in which the defendant has a true interest
may be forfeited criminally. Property which is held by "nominees" or straw owners on
behalf of the defendant may be forfeited criminally, but the government must prove that
the defendant is the true owner ...

The greatest advantage which criminal forfeiture holds for prosecutors in the U.S. is that
it affords the possibility of a money judgment for the amount of the proceeds of the crime,
and property involved in the crime. If that property - for example, the direct proceeds
obtained by a fraudulent scheme or the mansion which was used to store narcotics - is no
longer owned by or in the possession of the defendant, the government can get a
judgment against the defendant for an amount equivalent to the value of that property.
Rule 32.2 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure permits the government to seek
forfeiture of "substitute assets" belonging to the defendant. The procedure for obtaining
criminal forfeiture is a bifurcated process. First, the defendant must be found guilty by
proof "beyond a reasonable doubt" by either a judge (if the defendant elects) or by a
unanimous twelve person jury. Or the defendant may decide to plead guilty to the
charged crimes. Following the entry of a guilty verdict or plea which will support
forfeiture, the judge or jury will consider whether the government has shown the required
"nexus" between the property named for forfeiture and the crime of conviction. If
forfeiture is ordered, a Preliminary Order of Forfeiture is entered against the defendant,
which becomes final at sentencing. This order may be appealed, along with the
defendant's convictions. Appeal is taken to the court of appeals for the relevant circuit,
and beyond that to the U.S. Supreme Court if the issues are sufficiently important.

The Preliminary Order of Forfeiture must be served on anyone whom the prosecutor has
reason to believe may have an interest in the property, and must be published unless it is
a money judgment alone. Any interests asserted by third parties are heard in a separate
part of the criminal case called an "ancillary proceeding," which is held after a guilty
verdict or plea against the defendant. To the extent that any third party proves by a
preponderance of the evidence that he or she has an interest in the forfeited property
which is superior to the defendant's, the court must carve out that interest from the final
order of forfeiture.

                                                                                                        443
GLOBAL CORRUPTION

 D. Strategy of Using Criminal vs. Civil Forfeiture Processes

 1. Pros and Cons of Civil Forfeiture

 (i) Pro: Lower standard of proof of the crime and no need for conviction.

 The entire case in a civil forfeiture proceeding need be proven only by a "preponderance
 of the evidence" to a majority of a jury of nine. Thus, if there are proof problems which
 may make it difficult to prove the criminal conduct beyond a reasonable doubt to a
 unanimous jury of twelve, a civil proceeding may be the best venue for the forfeiture. If
 there are other impediments to obtaining a criminal conviction, such as the absence, death
 or incapacity of the defendant, a civil forfeiture proceeding will permit the forfeiture of
 the criminally linked property. This mechanism is exceedingly important in seizures of
 property, such as currency, where often the prosecutor cannot prove the exact crime
 which may have generated the unusual amount of cash, but has some evidence of
 criminal activity - such as a canine alert or ion scan169 positive hit for the presence of
 narcotic solvent or drugs on the money, and perhaps previous criminal activity by the
 property owner which may explain the cash. Because of the lower burden of proof,
 forfeiture may be available in these cases. Also, if a criminal conviction is reversed on
 appeal, a civil forfeiture proceeding (which may have been stayed during the course of
 the criminal case) may rescue the forfeiture.

 (ii) Pro: Property belonging to non-defendant parties may be forfeited

 In a civil case, the prosecutor does not have to prove that the property owner committed
 or participated in the commission of the underlying criminal activity. As long as there is
 proof that the property is sufficiently linked to a crime, and the owner cannot satisfy the
 test for "innocent owner" by a preponderance of the evidence, the property may be
 forfeited.

 ...

 (iii) Cons: Deadlines, duplicated resources, and liability for attorney's fees

 The CAFRA "death penalty" mentioned earlier means that if any of the filing deadlines
 are missed for a seizing agency giving notice, and the prosecutor filing an action, a civil
 forfeiture action is forever barred. Criminal forfeitures are not subject to any deadlines ...

 2. Pros and Cons of Criminal Forfeiture

169 [7] An ion scan is a portable, state-of-the-art mass spectrometry device which ionizes chemical
compounds, generating charged molecules whose mass-to-charge ratios can be measured. Ion scans
are used to detect the presence of explosives, drugs and drug residue in parts per billion. Scans can
detect the particulate residue of over twelve types of narcotic drugs. In addition to scanning currency
for seizure, ion scans are used to inspect cargo containers and luggage, to identify hidden
compartments, and for passenger security at many airports.

(i) Pro: Forfeiture is addressed as part of the same proceeding as the criminal offence

Successfully obtaining forfeiture of all of the property sought for forfeiture in the criminal
case saves an enormous amount of prosecutorial and judicial resources. Quite often, the
court in the civil case will grant a "stay" while the criminal case proceeds. If the defendant
reaches a point in the criminal prosecution of entering into an agreement to plead guilty
to any of the criminal charges, the prosecutor will obtain - as part of that agreement - an
agreement which addresses all of the assets sought for forfeiture. If a plea agreement is
not reached and the case proceeds to trial, a criminal forfeiture judgment (including a
money judgment) may be obtained based upon the same evidence as produced in the
criminal case. Thus, there is no need for extra witnesses, or another court proceeding or
another trial in order to obtain the forfeiture ...

(ii) Pro: A money judgment forfeiture is available and no attorney fees

Most significantly, if the property generated from the crime or used to commit the crime
is no longer available for forfeiture, the prosecutor may request that the judge or jury
enter a money judgment which may be collected against the untainted assets belonging
to the defendant.

This money judgment is available for collection for years after the criminal case concludes.
Finally, if criminal forfeiture is not successful - either because the defendant is acquitted
or because a third party succeeds in obtaining release of the property - the government
is not liable for anyone's attorney's fees.

(iii) Con: Only the defendant's property may be forfeited

Because of this limitation, any legally recognized superior interest by a third party - even
if that person knew of the criminal nature of the property - must be forfeited in a parallel
civil forfeiture case, or it cannot be forfeited. Thus, often both proceedings are required in
order to obtain the maximum forfeiture potential under U.S. law.

IV. PROPERTY SUBJECT TO FORFEITURE UNDER U.S. LAW

A. Proceeds Forfeitures

Although the U.S. forfeiture system provides robust measures which may be used to
deprive criminals of their ill-gotten gains, and U.S. prosecutors aggressively use this
system to its best advantage, the truth is that it is overly complicated even for American
prosecutors and judges. Most countries have enacted generic asset forfeiture laws, such
as the Proceeds of Crime Acts ("POCAs") found in many Commonwealth countries and
threshold crimes forfeiture systems enacted in many civil law countries. In the United
States, property which can be forfeited either civilly or criminally varies greatly from one
offense to another...The Department of Justice has attempted several times to obtain
passage of an all crimes approach with the introduction of Proceeds of Crime Act
legislation. However, the bill has generally been dead-on-arrival in Congress because
there is no apparent urgent need to obtain such a complete overhaul and because of

                                                                                                        445
GLOBAL CORRUPTION

 general political ambivalence toward forfeiture. So, we work with our hodgepodge of
 statutes the best we can.

 The closest to an "all crimes" approach to forfeiture of proceeds in the United States is 18
 U.S.C. § 981(a)(1)(C) which authorizes the forfeiture of the proceeds of over 200 state and
 federal offences. Most of these are subject to forfeiture because they are "specified
 unlawful activities" ("SUAs") within the definition of 18 U.S.C. § 1956(c)(7). All of the UN
 Convention required crimes are included, such as terrorist financing, money laundering,
 arms smuggling, drug crimes, most varieties of fraud (except tax fraud), corruption,
 human trafficking, smuggling, counterfeiting, securities violations, violent crimes, and
 environmental crimes. Others are linked through cross-referencing the RICO law (18
 U.S.C. § 1961) to state crimes such as gambling, arson, kidnapping, murder, obscenity and
 nearly all types of theft. U.S. courts have regarded "proceeds" as including any property,
 real or personal, tangible or intangible, which would not have been obtained "but for"
 the commission of the crime. The civil forfeiture law defines "proceeds" in several ways:
 (1) in cases involving illegal goods, illegal services, unlawful activities, and telemarketing
 and health care fraud schemes, the term "proceeds" means property of any kind obtained
 directly or indirectly, as the result of the commission of the offence giving rise to
 forfeiture, and any property traceable thereto, and is not limited to the net gain or profit
 realized from the offence; (2) in cases involving lawful goods or lawful services that are
 sold or provided in an illegal manner, "proceeds" includes the amount of money acquired
 through the illegal transactions resulting in the forfeiture, less the direct costs incurred in
 providing the goods or services; and (3) in cases involving bank or other financial fraud,
 "proceeds" for forfeiture purposes excludes any amount of fraudulent obligation which
 was repaid.

 Under U.S. law, "proceeds" will also include any increase in value which has occurred to
 property generated from criminal activity. For example, if a house bought with drug
 proceeds increases in value 100 percent in ten years, the entire house is subject to
 forfeiture. "Proceeds" may also include the value of services and benefits received from
 criminal activity, such as human trafficking or forced labour, even if the defendant does
 not actually receive payment for those services. "Proceeds" forfeitures are strong
 medicine; however, they do require that the police and prosecutors trace the property
 obtained from the criminal activity, and in today's era of transnational criminal activity,
 that endeavour can be difficult, if not impossible, in many cases.

 B. Facilitating Property Forfeitures

 "Facilitating property" is considered to be any property which makes the criminal activity
 more likely to occur. This term is the United States' version of an "instrumentalities" of
 crime confiscation. Criminal and civil forfeiture of facilitating property has long been
 permitted in drug cases. Most of the forfeitures permitted under the more generic
 criminal forfeiture law, 18 U.S.C. § 982, and civil forfeiture law, 18 U.S.C. § 981, apply
 only to criminal proceeds. Immigration, telemarketing, identity theft, child pornography
 and alien smuggling are exceptions.

446                                                                                               2022
                                                           CHAPTER 5 ASSET RECOVERY & MLA

CAFRA added the requirement that in "facilitating property forfeitures", the prosecutor
must prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the property had a "substantial
connection" to the underlying offence ...

C. Property "Involved In" Money Laundering

U.S. forfeiture law allows the criminal or civil forfeiture of any property which is
"involved in" a money laundering offence. 18 U.S.C. §§ 981(a)(1)(A) and 982(a)(1). This
concept reaches further than "facilitating" or instrumentality property primarily because
it allows the prosecutor to forfeit also untainted property which has been commingled
with the criminally-related property...The money laundering forfeiture provision is a
popular one among U.S. prosecutors.

The primary limitation to its use is the assertion of the 8th Amendment defence of
"excessive fines and penalties".... In Austin v. United States, 509 U.S. 602, 622 (1993), the
Supreme Court applied the 8th Amendment to civil forfeiture cases, determining that
such forfeitures must be limited to property which is, in some way, "proportional" to the
underlying crime committed.... [C]ourts generally look to the entire circumstances of a
case to determine what is grossly disproportional to the crime, and what is not, for
forfeiture purposes.

V. PROVISIONAL RESTRAINT OF PROPERTY UNDER U.S. LAW

Prosecutors in the U.S. must generally determine whether they will seek to seize or
restrain assets prior to the initiation of either a criminal or civil forfeiture proceeding. A
seizure always precedes an administrative forfeiture proceeding. The law recognizes the
obvious principle that if property can effectively be restrained during the pendency of a
forfeiture case, restraint is generally preferable to an actual seizure, which often requires
significant expenditure of maintenance and storage fees.

A. Restraining Orders

U.S. laws provide a three-stage procedure for obtaining restraining orders against assets
sought for either civil or criminal forfeiture. Prior to the initiation of criminal charges, a
temporary restraining order ("TRO") may be obtained for 14 days upon an ex parte
application and without prior notice to anyone with an interest in the property. The
prosecutor must establish in the application that there is probable cause to believe that
the property is subject to forfeiture and that providing notice would jeopardize the
availability of the property. The 14 day period may be extended upon good cause shown,
permitting serial TRO's until law enforcement agents have completed their "take down"
of a criminal operation. Prior to the expiration of the initial TRO, the prosecutor must
serve the order upon any potential parties in interest.

After affected parties have received notice and been given an opportunity to request a
hearing, the prosecutor must demonstrate that: (1) there is a substantial probability that
the U.S. will prevail on forfeiture and that failure to enter the order could result in the
property's becoming unavailable; and (2) the need to preserve the property outweighs

                                                                                                        447
GLOBAL CORRUPTION

 hardship to the affected parties. The court may then grant a 90-day restraining order,
 which can be extended upon good cause.

 Once a criminal indictment or a civil forfeiture complaint is filed, the prosecutor may
 obtain a permanent pre-trial restraining order. The reason for this provision is that in
 either case, an independent entity has found probable cause to believe that the property
 will be forfeited, thus satisfying possible judicial concerns about violations of the U.S.
 Constitution's 4th Amendment protections against unreasonable searches and seizures.
 In a civil forfeiture, the judge makes that determination based on the civil complaint; in a
 criminal forfeiture, the grand jury makes the determination based upon allegations in the
 indictment ...

 B. Seizure Warrants

 Civil and criminal seizure warrants are both available, with slightly different standards.
 A civil seizure warrant may be issued by the court upon probable cause to believe the
 property is subject to forfeiture (18 U.S.C. § 981(b)), which is usually accomplished by an
 affidavit sworn to by a law enforcement officer. This seizure warrant is used for most
 administrative seizures.

 A criminal seizure warrant requires not only a showing of probable cause for forfeiture,
 but also that a restraining order is insufficient to maintain the property (or its value) for
 forfeiture. This provision confirms that restraint during the course of a forfeiture
 proceeding is preferable; but if the government learns that property is being transferred,
 damaged, or destroyed, a criminal seizure warrant would be available.

 C. Management of Restrained or Seized Assets

 ... [I]ssues of asset management should be considered when deciding whether and when
 to restrain or seize property subject to forfeiture. For example, most vehicles and other
 modes of transportation, such as boats, motorcycles, and recreational vehicles, are
 generally seized because of the depreciation in their value through continued use. Prior
 to seizure, a computation should be undertaken as to whether the overall costs of seizing,
 storing and maintaining the asset will be less than the anticipated sales price.

 ...

 Most financial accounts should generally be simply restrained pending the outcome of
 the proceeding. Some investment accounts may need to be liquidated or converted with
 court approval to maintain their value.

 D. Provisional Restraint of Assets Overseas

 U.S. courts have extraterritorial jurisdiction over assets which are named in either a civil
 forfeiture action or a criminal indictment. The court may order a criminal defendant to
 "repatriate" any property named for criminal forfeiture. 18 U.S.C. §853(e)(4). Penalties for
 a failure to comply with a repatriation order can include a finding of contempt and/or a

448                                                                                             2022

 sentencing enhancement to the defendant for obstruction of justice. Civil forfeiture
 provisions do not have a repatriation option, but the court can take "any action to seize,
 secure ..." the availability of property subject to civil forfeiture, which would include
 ordering any claimants to the case to take action with respect to foreign assets.170 171

                                                                 END OF EXCERPT

The 2016 US FATF MER notes that the federal authorities aggressively pursue high-value
confiscation in large and complex cases and in respect of assets located both domestically
and abroad.172 The law enforcement agencies at the federal level give high priority to both
criminal and civil forfeiture and seek orders forfeiting property of equivalent value as a
policy objective.173 Although there is not much information available at state and local levels,
it appears that civil forfeiture is actively pursued by some states.174

In the US, domestic asset repatriation and restitution are managed at the federal level by the
Department of Justice Assets Forfeiture Funds (DOJ-AFF)175 and the Treasury Forfeiture
Fund (TFF).176 In the 2014 fiscal year, the combined value of assets in the DOJ-AFF and the
TFF was about $4.6 billion,177 and between fiscal years 2010 and 2015, $2.9 billion in forfeited
assets was distributed to victims from the DOJ-AFF.178 During the 2014 fiscal year, the TFF
paid $93.3 million in restitution to victims and shared $68.5 million with other authorities
and $921,000 with foreign countries.179 Asset recovery is facilitated by specialized units

170 [9] One caveat our prosecutors must keep in mind is that if they have made an MLAT request to a
foreign country asking the government to restrain assets, that restraint must be lifted before a
repatriation order can be complied with.

International Unit (which includes the Kleptocracy Team), the Money Laundering and
Forfeiture Unit and the Special Financial Investigations Unit,180 as well as other DOJ units
like the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force (OCDETF).181

The gaps in the US asset recovery legal framework include the fact that not all predicate
offenses include the power to forfeit instrumentalities, as well as the lack of general power
to obtain an order to seize or freeze property of corresponding/equivalent value which may
become subject to a value-based forfeiture order.182 The MER recommends ensuring that all
predicate offenses include the power to forfeit instrumentalities; that law enforcement
authorities are able to seize and freeze pre-conviction, non-tainted assets that are likely to be
required to satisfy a value-based forfeiture order in criminal proceedings; and that the AML
proceeds recovery activities and statistics at the state level are more widely available.183

The case of Teodoro Obiang, Second Vice President of Equatorial Guinea, provides an
example of successful asset recovery by the US DOJ. Civil forfeiture actions against various
assets in the US were settled in October 2014. Under the settlement, Obiang was required to
forfeit a house in California, Michael Jackson memorabilia and a Ferrari, collectively worth
over $30 million. The case brought under the Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative, which
was launched by the DOJ in 2010 and established a dedicated team of prosecutors,
investigators and financial analysts for investigation and prosecution in asset recovery cases.
In accordance with the Initiative's goals, the recovered funds were to be used for the benefit
of the citizens of Equatorial Guinea. $20 million was set aside for a private charitable
organization in Equatorial Guinea, while $10 million was to be forfeited to the US and used
for the benefit of the people of Equatorial Guinea to the extent permitted by law.184

5.2 UK

In their book Corruption and Misuse of Public Office, Nicholls et al. summarize the various
options in the UK for restraining and recovering the proceeds of crime in both the criminal
and civil realms. The following is a summary based on their book.185

Criminal confiscation and restraint orders are used to assist asset recovery in criminal
proceedings. The Crown Court exercises confiscation powers under the Proceeds Of Crime
Act 2002 (POCA).186 Confiscation in the UK is value-based, meaning a defendant must pay a
sum equal to the value of the benefits accrued through criminal conduct. The prosecution
might also request a compensation order for victims, since otherwise confiscated assets are
forfeited to the Crown. The court may also decline to make a confiscation order if the victim
intends to pursue proceedings against the defendant.

In confiscation proceedings, the court will consider whether the defendant has a criminal
lifestyle, which reverses the burden of proof, requiring the defendant to demonstrate that
assets were acquired legitimately. A defendant will have a criminal lifestyle if they are
convicted of offences in Schedule 2 of POCA (money laundering offences are included, but
bribery offences are not), have committed an offence over a period of at least six months and
benefitted from it, or have been convicted of a combination of offences that comprise a
"course of criminal activity." If the defendant does not have a criminal lifestyle, the court
will consider whether they benefitted from particular criminal conduct when determining
the recoverable amount.

Restraint orders are a key pre-confiscation tool that prevent dissipation of assets during
criminal proceedings. Any property in which the defendant has a legal or beneficial interest
will be targeted, including jointly held property and tainted gifts to third parties. Reasonable
living expenses are allowed for the defendant. Restraint orders may be accompanied by
disclosure orders and repatriation orders, which may require, for example, repatriation of
money in offshore accounts.

POCA also provides for non-conviction based forfeiture. The applicant must prove on a
balance of probabilities that the assets were obtained through unlawful conduct, including
conduct occurring abroad, and that the property is in fact held by the defendant. However,
NCB forfeiture, unlike confiscation, does not have a mechanism for compensation orders for
victims. A victim can, however, claim a legitimate interest in recovered property, as the
Nigerian government did in order to recover £1 million in the Alamieseigha case in 2007.

In private actions, claimants have a variety of options to assist in the tracing and preservation
of assets during proceedings. The most important is the freezing injunction, discussed in

University Press, 2017) at 273-297. See also, "Proceeds of Crime" (last updated 19 December 2019),

more detail below. Claimants can also apply for search and seizure orders, which will be
carried out by the claimant's counsel and an independent solicitor, as well as bankers' books
orders which allow the claimant's legal team to inspect bank records without notice to the
defendant. Finally, claimants in private actions can also seek injunctions to preserve assets
and evidence.

 Component Relevant for MLA and Asset Recovery

  The Crime (International Co-operation) Act (CICA) [updated link:
       http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/32/contents] allows for the provision of

  The Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (External Requests and Orders) Order 2005 (POC)
       [updated link: http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2008/302/contents/made] allows
       for the issuance of restraint warrants and the confiscation of assets upon request or
       based on an order issued by a foreign country in both conviction based and non-
       conviction based proceedings.

  The Criminal Justice (International Cooperation) Act 1990 (Enforcement of Overseas
       Forfeitures) Order (CRIJICA) [updated link:
       http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1990/5/contents] regulates the restraining and
       forfeiture of the instrumentalities of crime upon request or based on an order issued
       by a foreign country.

  The United Kingdom has entered into [at least 40 bilateral MLA agreements188]....
  The United Kingdom is a party to the following multilateral agreements, which

       include provisions on mutual legal assistance: the Merida, Vienna, and Palermo

     between Member States of the European Union; and the Harare Scheme. However,
     the United Kingdom may provide MLA directly based only on domestic law and
     not on international treaties.

A.2. Legal Preconditions for the Provision of MLA

 Reciprocity is generally not required for the provision of MLA.
 Dual criminality is not required for most measures under the CICA. However,

     requests for search and seizure for evidentiary reasons as well as restraint and
     confiscation of assets are subject to dual criminality; that is, they cannot be executed
     unless the underlying criminal conduct would be an offense under U.K. law.

A.3. Grounds for Refusal of MLA

 Requests involving double jeopardy will not be executed.
 Requests relating to offenses punishable with the death penalty or relating to trivial

     offense may be refused.
 Requests that affect the U.K. national security or other U.K. essential interests may

     be declined.

B. MLA General Procedures

B.1. Central Authority Competent to Receive, Process, and Implement MLA Requests
in Criminal Matters

 For assistance in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, the U.K. Home Office,
     Judicial Cooperation Unit, is the central authority to receive all requests for MLA.

...

 The central authorities ensure that requests meet the form requirements and the
     requirements under U.K. law and subsequently disseminate requests to the relevant
     domestic authorities for implementation.

...

C. Asset Recovery Specific

C.1. Stage of Proceedings at Which Assistance may be Requested

 Measures pursuant to CICA Sections 13-15 as well as account and customer
     information orders may be issued as soon as an investigation for an offense has been
     initiated in the requesting country.

...

 Search and seizing orders in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland (CICA Section
     17) may be taken only if criminal proceedings have been instituted or an arrest been
     made in the requesting country.

                                                                                                        453

 Tracing

 C.2. Available Tracing Mechanisms

  Obtaining of Evidence (CICA Sections 13-15): Evidence gathering orders may be
       issued if a request is made in connection with criminal proceedings or a criminal
       investigation in the requesting state. In England, Wales, and Northern Ireland,
       suspects cannot be compelled to attend court or be coerced to provide evidence
       under oath for the purposes of MLA ...

  CICA Section 17: Search and seizing warrants for England, Wales, and Northern
       Ireland may be issued if criminal proceedings have been instituted or an arrest has
       been made in the requesting country; if the conduct in question would constitute an
       arrestable offense had it been committed in the United Kingdom; and if there are
       reasonable grounds to suspect that evidence is in the United Kingdom relating to
       the offense ...

  Customer Information Orders (CICA Sections 32 and 37): Orders may be issued
       requiring a financial institution to provide any customer information it has relating
       to the person specified in the order if the specified person is subject to an
       investigation in the requesting country, if the investigation concerns serious
       criminal conduct, if the conduct meets dual criminality, and if the order is sought
       for the purposes of the investigation. A customer information order has effect
       regardless of any restrictions on the disclosure of information that would otherwise
       apply.

  Account Monitoring Orders (CICA Sections 35 and 40): Orders may be issued
       requiring a financial institution specified in the application to provide account
       information of the description specified in the order and at the time and in the
       manner specified if there is a criminal investigation in the requesting country and if
       the order is sought for the purposes of the investigation ...

  Interception of Telecommunication: This measure is available only to parties of the
       EU Convention on Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters.

 C.3. Access to Information Covered by Banking or Professional Secrecy

  Customer or account information orders pursuant to CICA Sections 32, 37, 35, and
       40 have effect regardless of any restrictions on the disclosure of information that
       would otherwise apply. Therefore, they may also be used to obtain information
       covered by banking secrecy.

  Information covered by legal privilege is protected and may not be subject to search
       and seizing warrants.

 Provisional Measures (Freezing, Seizing, and Restraint Orders)

 C.4. Direct Enforcement of Foreign Freezing and Seizing Orders

  Legal basis: Foreign freezing orders are executed through CICA Sections 17 and 18.

454                                                                                            2022
                                                           CHAPTER 5 ASSET RECOVERY & MLA

 Procedure: Direct application of foreign freezing orders through a decision by the
     territorial authority for the part of the United Kingdom in which the evidence to
     which the order relates is situated. Only orders relating to criminal proceedings or
     investigations for an offense listed in the CICA may be directly applicable ...

C.5. Issuance of Domestic Provisional Measures upon Request by a Foreign
Jurisdiction

 Legal basis: POC Articles 8, 58, and 95.
 Procedure: Countries may apply for issuance of a restraint order by the Crown

     Court.
 Evidentiary requirements: An order may be issued if a criminal investigation has

     been started in the requesting country or proceedings for an offense have been
     initiated and not concluded in the requesting country and if there is reasonable
     cause to believe that the alleged offender named in the request has benefited from
     his criminal conduct. The POC provides for the seizing order to extend to any
     "realizable property," which is defined to include any free property held by the
     defendant or by the recipient of a tainted gift.
...

Confiscation

C.6. Enforcement of Foreign Confiscation Orders

 Legal basis: POC Articles 21, 68, and 107.
 Procedure: Foreign conviction-based confiscation orders may be registered and

     subsequently directly enforced in the United Kingdom if the Crown Court is
     satisfied that the conditions of the POC are met.
 Evidentiary requirements: A foreign confiscation order may be executed if it was
     made based on a conviction, if it is in force and final, if giving effect to the order will
     not violate any rights of the Human Rights Act of 1998, and if the property specified
     in the order is not subject to a charge under U.K. law.

C.7. Applicability of Non-Conviction Based Asset Forfeiture Orders

 POC Articles 143 ff. allow for the registration and implementation of (civil)
     forfeiture orders. Article 147 permits an application for a property freezing order to
     preserve property so that it is available to satisfy an external order enforced in the
     United Kingdom by means of civil recovery.

C.8. Confiscation of Legitimate Assets Equivalent in Value to Illicit Proceeds

 Criminal confiscation in the United Kingdom is value-based, that is, the defendant's
     proceeds of crime are calculated as a value and the defendant is then ordered to pay
     that amount. Therefore, equivalent-value confiscation is possible.

                                                                                                        455

 D. Types of Informal Assistance

        Informal assistance may be provided by the police; the Serious Organized Crime
            Agency (FIU) (http://www.soca.gov.uk/), and the Financial Services Authority
            (http://www.fsa.gov.uk/).

 II. Freezing orders

 1. Background

 The order takes its name from Mareva Compania Naviera S.A. v International Bulkcarriers
 S.A. [1975] 2 Lloyd's Rep. 509. The Civil Procedure Rules now refer to it as a freezing
 injunction (CPR 25.1(1)(f)). It developed as a form of recourse against foreign-based
 defendants with assets within the UK and consequently the early authorities assumed
 that the injunction was not available against English-based defendants. In the same vein
 an early judicial guideline for the grant of the order required claimants to establish a risk
 of the removal of assets from the jurisdiction.

 Section 37(3) of the Supreme Court Act 1981 now provides that the injunction may be
 granted to prevent defendants from removing from the jurisdiction `or otherwise dealing
 with' the assets. Section 37 forms the basis of the jurisdiction for granting freezing
 injunctions `in all cases in which it appears to the court to be just and convenient to do so'.
 The Court of Appeal held in Babanaft International Co. S.A. v Bassatne [1990] Ch. 13 that the
 wording of subsection 3 did not restrict the scope, geographical or otherwise, of s.37(1).

189 [97] Practitioners should inquire with the nearest British High Commission to determine the
nearest attaché. [Update -- the Serious Organized Crime Agency was replaced by the National
Crime Agency in 2013. See <https://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/>].

456                                                                                                    2022
                                                           CHAPTER 5 ASSET RECOVERY & MLA

The Civil Procedure Rules currently provide that the injunction may be granted in relation
to assets `whether located within the jurisdiction or not' (CPR 25.1(1)(f)).

2. Purpose and effect

A freezing order prohibits D from unjustifiably dissipating his assets within the
jurisdiction so that there are insufficient or no assets left to satisfy a judgment against him.
To preserve assets pending enforcement, a freezing order can also be obtained post-
judgment. If D has insufficient assets within the jurisdiction to meet the quantum of C's
claim, the court can grant a worldwide freezing order.

3. Penal notice

Freezing orders, as well as search orders, are endorsed with a Penal Notice, which warns
that disobedience of it may be regarded as contempt of court[,] the penalty for which may
be imprisonment, a fine or seizure of assets. Contempt may extend to any third parties
who are notified of the order and do anything which helps or permits a breach [of] its
terms. However, since the English court has no jurisdiction over third parties located
abroad, the worldwide order has to be recognised, registered or enforced by the relevant
foreign courts to be effective. This process is often described as `domesticating' the English
order.

The orders usually freeze assets up to a financial limit, calculated according [to] the value
of C's claim with likely legal costs and interest taken into account ...

A freezing order bites on the individual not his assets (in personam) and as such it does
not grant any proprietary rights over the assets of D. It therefore does not confer on C any
advantage in the event of D's insolvency ...

4. Asset disclosure

The standard freezing order requires D to give details of the value, location and details of
assets within the jurisdiction or elsewhere, for a worldwide freezing order. This enables
C to identify the whereabouts of the assets and notify third parties of the freezing order.
D may refuse to provide some or all of this information if in providing it, he is likely to
incriminate himself. The assertion of self incrimination privilege has been much curtailed
in the United Kingdom (UK) by the Fraud Act 2006 - and in practical terms by the fact
that reliance on the privilege is generally regarded as in effect an admission of liability ...

5. Application and requirements

The application to the court for a freezing order, as well as a search order, is almost
invariably made without notice to D (ex parte).... This is done so as not to `tip off' D and T
about C's intention to commence proceedings or to take any legal steps to secure assets
and/or evidence ...

                                                                                                        457
GLOBAL CORRUPTION

6. Grounds

In order to obtain a freezing order, C needs to show:

          - A good arguable case; and
          - A real risk of unjustifiable dissipation of assets; and
          - That the order is just and convenient in all the circumstances

The court will not automatically conclude that because D is alleged to be dishonest he
cannot be trusted not to dissipate his assets. Careful consideration should therefore be
given in the evidence to the profile and background of D.

7. Cross-undertaking in damages

The court will require C to give a `cross-undertaking in damages' which is a promise to
comply with any order that it may make if it decides that the freezing order caused loss
to D and that D should be compensated for that loss. This may include provision of
security to fortify the cross-undertaking in damages.

8. Full and frank disclosure

On a without notice application the court is being asked to grant a hugely intrusive order
against D who has not had a chance to be heard. Therefore C and his lawyers must give
full and fair disclosure of all the material facts, including what D is likely to argue in his
defence, or against C, or any facts likely to be relied upon. If there has not been full and
frank disclosure, there is a real risk that the court will set aside the order.

...

III. Proprietary injunctions

If C contends that D is holding C's property (which can include cash) or the traceable
proceeds of his property (the `proprietary assets') then the court can grant a proprietary
freezing injunction. Its terms are typically more draconian than a standard (non-
proprietary) freezing order and can restrain any dealings with the proprietary assets so
that D cannot use them to pay for living or legal expenses.

When applying for a proprietary injunction, C needs to show a good arguable case and
that it is just and convenient that the order be granted. He does not need to establish a
risk of dissipation, because the nature of C's claim is that D is holding his assets or the
proceeds of those assets. As a result the proprietary injunction does give C priority over
D's creditors on the asset pool.

IV. Ancillary orders

The English courts have developed a number of orders to assist victims of fraud and
corruption in their fight against those who attempt to delay and obfuscate. These include
specific disclosure orders, which require disclosure of particular documents to help

458                                                                                             2022
                                                           CHAPTER 5 ASSET RECOVERY & MLA

identify the nature and location of assets or passport orders requiring delivery up of all
travel documents and prohibiting D from leaving the jurisdiction.... Third party
disclosure (Norwich Pharmacal) orders require third parties who are mixed up in the
wrongdoing (whether innocently or not) to disclose information that will assist in the
identification of wrongdoers, allow assets to be traced and to establish the validity of
proprietary claims against third parties or tracing assets into the hands of third parties.
Banks through which stolen funds are believed to have passed are an obvious target for
such orders.

In addition, third party freezing orders can be obtained against third parties but only
where there is good reason for believing that assets ostensibly held by third parties are in
reality D's assets. This is known as the Chabra jurisdiction. These orders are particularly
useful where D has structured his affairs through sham trusts or other opaque vehicles so
as to give the impression that he has no interest in the assets in question.

A critical weapon for the claimants is to be found in section 25 of the Civil Jurisdiction
and Judgments Act 1982. Section 25 allows an English court to grant interim relief in aid
of proceedings elsewhere. These are commonly invoked where assets are located in
England, but D is located outside the jurisdiction, in the place where the substantive
proceedings are being conducted. It is not necessary for foreign proceedings to have been
commenced as long as they will be commenced. One can obtain relief in England - subject
to demonstrating a sufficient geographical nexus - which cannot be obtained in the
location of the substantive action.

...

3. General

As technology advances daily, the English Courts have shown themselves, time and
again, to be adept and creative in assisting the victim claimant to recover the proceeds of
fraud and corruption. The last years have seen an explosion of applications made under
Section 25 Civil Jurisdiction and Judgment Acts (see section IV, last paragraph) - this
enables the Courts on application without notice by the victim to utilise the panoply of
weaponry available to the Court to assist a foreigner with jurisdiction in its pursuit of the
fraudster or corrupt official. The dictator, the businessman, the ex-politician or the 419
crook against whom proceedings have been started or are about to be started in a host
domestic state - wherever in the world that may be - can find themselves the subject of
International Freezing and Tracing Order relief where proceedings are commenced in
England on the basis that there is sufficient nexus with England and Wales to justify it.
The nexus can be in terms of the location of property, perhaps a small shareholding in an
operating company in which the defendant has a claimed beneficial interest, even if
owned offshore but beneficially by him, or by the simple expedient of him being present
in England and Wales at a particular time so that service upon him, in personam, can be
effected.

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

In 1980, the Bankers Trust case192 introduced a new type of disclosure order which requires a
bank to furnish information about assets and transactions normally protected by the bank's
duty of confidentiality. In the case involving Nigeria's last military dictator General Sani
Abacha, a UK court was requested to issue a Bankers Trust order requiring named banks to
disclose copies of bank statements, account opening forms, customer information, debit and
credit notes, as well as internal bank memoranda regarding the operation of the accounts.193
As a result, disclosure was obtained from about twenty banks on approximately 100 Abacha
family members, associates and corporate entities.194

 The Assistance of U.K. Law Enforcement

 When trying to trace, freeze, and recover the illicit gains of a corrupt official found either
 to be in or to have been laundered through the United Kingdom, a foreign state may do
 one of the following:

       Invoke the mechanism of mutual legal assistance, and working with a U.K. law
          enforcement agency either

        - restrain assets195 (during a criminal investigation) and having obtained a
            criminal conviction in the foreign state, enforce its own recovery order in
            England and Wales196; or

        - freeze assets and having obtained either an NCB or conviction based asset
            recovery order in the foreign state, give effect to that order by means of an NCB
            asset forfeiture order in England and Wales (known in the United Kingdom as
            civil recovery).197

       Invite a U.K. law enforcement agency to adopt the case for investigation with a
          view to bringing in England and Wales

        - a criminal prosecution in the United Kingdom (if that is feasible) and if a
            conviction is obtained, seek a criminal confiscation order;

        - cash detention and forfeiture (if applicable); or
        - NCB asset forfeiture proceedings (civil recovery) and seek a civil recovery order.

 If a criminal confiscation order is obtained, a compensation order (in favor of a victim)
 may also be made in the same case. A foreign state may also, therefore, intervene in
 criminal confiscation proceedings and seek a compensation order. A criminal confiscation
 order requires the defendant to pay back the value of the benefit from a given crime (the
 proceeds).198 If there are insufficient funds with which to fulfill both a criminal
 confiscation order and a compensation order, the court can require a proportion of the
 realized assets under the criminal forfeiture order to be used to discharge the
 compensation order.199 A detailed consideration of this area is outside the scope of this
 contribution.

 In proceedings for NCB asset forfeiture, the true owner of property is entitled to seek a
 declaration from the civil court that he has a valid claim to the property (or property which
 it represents) because it was unlawfully taken from him.200

 If either a conviction based confiscation or NCB asset forfeiture order is registered and
 enforced in England, the recovered property (or money equivalent) is not automatically
 transmitted to the foreign state and the English court has no power with which to remit
 the property to the foreign jurisdiction. Instead, the proceeds of the recovered property
 (or money equivalent) are placed in the U.K. Government's Consolidated Fund. Some
 countries have entered into asset-sharing agreements with the United Kingdom in respect
 of conviction based confiscation cases. These, however, are not thought to apply to NCB
 asset forfeiture. The United Kingdom is taking steps to enter into either bilateral treaties
 or memoranda of understanding with foreign states with regard to NCB asset forfeiture.
 Asset sharing agreements may also be entered into on a case-by-case basis. With respect
 to corruption cases, the United Kingdom has ratified UNCAC, and as such is mindful of
 its obligations under that Convention.201

                                                                 END OF EXCERPT

and Terrorism (London: HM Treasury, 2007), p. 24. In confiscation proceedings it is not necessary to
link a particular crime to a particular benefit. The court can, therefore, assume that all of the
defendant's properties held over the previous six years are the proceeds of crime. This is known as
the option of "general criminal conduct confiscation." Prior to the making of the confiscation order a
restraint order may be obtained from the court to prevent the dissipation of assets that may later
need to be sold to satisfy the confiscation order.

5.3 Canada

The following excerpt from the 2011 StAR/World Bank publication Barriers to Asset Recovery:
An Analysis of the Key Barriers and Recommendations for Action,202 starts with a summary of
mutual legal assistance provisions in Canada, since MLA is usually essential to the pursuit
of asset recovery in large-scale corruption cases:

                   BEGINNING OF EXCERPT

Canada

A. MLA Legal Framework and Preconditions to Cooperation (General)

A.1. Relevant Laws, Treaties, and Conventions Dealing with or Including a
Component Relevant for MLA and Asset Recovery

 The Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Act (MLACMA) [updated link:
     <http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/M-13.6/>] [as amended Protecting Canadians
     from Online Crime Act203] allows for the provision of MLA. Canada may not provide
     MLA directly based on multilateral conventions but only pursuant to the provisions
     of the MLACM.

 The Canada Evidence Act (EA) [updated link: <http://laws-
     lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-5/>] Section 46 allows for the provision of certain forms
     of MLA, including certain coercive measures, based on letters rogatory if criminal
     proceedings are pending abroad.

 Canada has entered into bilateral treaties with 33 countries ...

 Canada has ratified the Merida Convention, the Inter-American Convention on
     Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters, the Vienna and Palermo Conventions,
     the Organization of American States Inter-American Convention on Mutual
     Assistance in Criminal Matters, and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation
     and Development's Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in
     International Business Transactions.

A.2. Legal Preconditions for the Provision of MLA

 Dual criminality is generally not required for requests based on bilateral or
     multilateral treaties. Administrative agreements with non-treaty states may be
     concluded only for indictable offenses under Canadian law and thus require dual
     criminality.

 Foreign restraint and seizing orders may be enforced directly in Canada only if they

 Reciprocity is required and assumed for countries that have signed a relevant treaty,
     convention, or administrative agreement with Canada. Administrative agreements
     may be entered into for specific cases and in the absence of an applicable treaty.

A.3. Grounds for Refusal of MLA

Pursuant to MLACMA Section 9.4, the minister of justice must refuse requests if there are:

      Reasonable grounds to believe that the request has been made for the purpose
          of punishing a person by reason of his or her race, sex, sexual orientation,
          religion, nationality, ethnic origin, language, color, age, mental or physical
          disability, or political opinion.

      Enforcement of the order would prejudice an ongoing proceeding or
          investigation.

      Enforcement of the order would impose an excessive burden on the resources of
          federal, provincial, or territorial authorities.

      Enforcement of the order might prejudice Canada's security, national interest,
          or sovereignty.

      Refusal of the request is in the public interest.

Further grounds for refusal may be contained in applicable bilateral, multilateral, or
administrative agreements.

B. MLA General Procedures

B.1. Central Authority Competent to Receive, Process, and Implement MLA Requests
in Criminal Matters

 The Ministry of Justice is the central authority to receive any requests for MLA.
 In practice, the ministry performs its function as central authority through the

     International Assistance Group (IAG), which reviews and coordinates the
     implementation of MLA requests. The IAG may receive requests either through
     diplomatic channels or directly from the central authority of the requested entity or
     state.

C. Asset Recovery Specific

C.1. Stage of Proceedings at Which Assistance may be Requested

 Tracing measures under the MLACM are available once a criminal investigation has
     been initiated in the requesting country.

 The measures under the EA, including direct enforcement of foreign freezing and
     seizing orders, are available only after formal charges have been brought before a
     foreign court or tribunal. It is not required that a conviction has been obtained.

                                                                                                        463

 Tracing

 C.2. Available Tracing Mechanisms

  Under MLACMA Section 11 and 12, search warrants may be issued by a Canadian
       court if there are reasonable grounds to believe that an offense has been committed
       under the law of the requesting country, evidence of the commission of the offense
       or information on the whereabouts of a suspect will be found in the place to be
       searched, and it would not be appropriate to issue a production order. The person
       executing the search warrant may seize any thing he believes will afford evidence
       of, has been obtained by, is intended to be used, or has been used in the commission
       of an offense.

  Under MLACMA Section 18, a Canadian judge may issue a production order if
       there are grounds to believe that an offense has been committed under the law of
       the requesting country, and evidence of the commission of the offense or
       information on the whereabouts of the suspect will be found in Canada. Items or
       documents subject to privilege or nondisclosure under Canadian law cannot be
       compelled. EA Section 46 also allows for the issuance of production orders and for
       the compelled testimony of witnesses by Canadian courts if criminal charges have
       been brought in the requesting country.

  Other measures provided for under the MLACMA and the EA include video or
       audio-link of a witness in Canada to proceedings in a foreign jurisdiction, an order
       for the lending of exhibits that have been tendered in Canadian court proceedings,
       an order for the examination of a place or site in Canada, the transfer of a sentenced
       prisoner to testify or assist in an investigation, and service of documents and
       account monitoring orders.

 C.3. Access to Information Covered by Banking or Professional Secrecy

  Privileged information can be obtained pursuant to an MLAT search warrant if any
       information over which privilege is claimed is sealed and filed with the court.

 Provisional Measures (Freezing, Seizing, and Restraint Orders)

 C.4. Direct Enforcement of Foreign Freezing or Seizing Orders

  MLACMA Section 9.3 allows for the direct enforcement of foreign restraint or
       seizing orders if a person has been charged with an offense in the requesting
       jurisdiction and if the offense would be an indictable offense in Canada.

  Upon approval by the minister of justice, the attorney general may file the order
       with the Superior Court of Criminal Jurisdiction of the relevant province. The order
       is then entered as an order of that court and may be executed in Canada.

 C.6. Enforcement of Foreign Confiscation Orders

  Legal basis: MLACMA Section 9.
  Procedure: Subject to approval by the minister of justice, MLACMA Section 9 allows

       for the direct enforcement of foreign confiscation judgments in Canada. Upon
       approval by the minister, the attorney general may file the judgment with the
       Superior Court of Criminal Jurisdiction of the relevant province. The order is then
       entered as the judgment of that court and may be executed in Canada pursuant to
       domestic law.
  Evidentiary requirements: Foreign confiscation judgments may be enforced in
       Canada if the affected person has been convicted of an offense in the requesting
       country, if the offense would be an indictable offense under Canadian law, and if
       the judgment is final. The judgment may extend to any offense-related property or
       any proceeds of crime.

 C.7. Applicability of Non-Conviction Based Asset Forfeiture Orders

  Some but not all provinces in Canada can enforce civil forfeiture orders.

 C.8. Confiscation of Legitimate Assets Equivalent in Value to Illicit Proceeds
  A foreign confiscation order may be enforced under MLACMA section 9 (see C.6.).

 D. Types of Informal Assistance

  Informal assistance may be provided by the FINTRAC (FIU and FI Supervisor)
       (http://www.fintrac.gc.ca/), the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions
       (http://www.infosource.gc.ca/inst/sif/fed04-eng.asp), provincial securities
       regulators, and the police.

  MOUs are required only by FINTRAC (both as supervisor and as FIU). All other

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

(1) Freezing Assets of Corrupt Foreign Officials Act

      a) Preconditions for a Freezing Order or Regulation

The Freezing Assets of Corrupt Foreign Officials Act (FACFOA)206 was introduced in 2011 to
respond to the aftermath of the fall of several dictatorships in the Middle East during the
Arab Spring. The legislation allows the Minister of Foreign Affairs to quickly freeze the
assets of a foreign political figure upon a written request of a foreign government. The
foreign state must also assert that the individual "has misappropriated property of the
foreign state or acquired property inappropriately by virtue of their office or a personal or
business relationship."207 The FACFOA defines a "foreign state" as a state other than Canada
and includes any government or political subdivision of the foreign state as well as any
agency or department of the government or political subdivision.208

Once the foreign state has made a request, the Governor in Council (i.e., the Cabinet) must
ensure that three preconditions are fulfilled before making an order or regulation that
freezes a person's assets. First, the Governor in Council must be satisfied that any persons
targeted for asset seizure qualify as "politically exposed" foreign persons.209 The FACFOA
defines a "politically exposed foreign person" as a person who holds or who has held one
of several enumerated offices in a foreign state. The list includes specific offices such as
"head of state" and "military officer with the rank of general or above." However, the
definition also includes a residual clause specifying that the "holder of any prescribed office
or position" would also fall under the definition of "politically exposed foreign person."210
This residual clause is important because it allows the Governor in Council to prescribe other
government positions as politically exposed foreign persons in regulations under FACFOA.
This power ensures that it would be possible for FACFOA to target corrupt officials who do
not hold an enumerated title, such as former Colonel Gaddafi of Libya (although he has
never actually been the target of an order or regulation under FACFOA).211 The definition of
"politically exposed foreign person" also includes "any person who, for personal or business
reasons, is or was closely associated with such a person [a person holding an enumerated or
prescribed office as defined above], including a family member."212 This language further
expands the category of person who may be the subject of an order or regulation. Second,
before issuing an order or regulation, the Governor in Council must also be satisfied that
"there is internal turmoil or an uncertain political situation in the foreign state." Finally, the
Governor in Council must be satisfied that "the making of the order or regulation is in the

interest of international relations."213 There have, however, been some concerns regarding
the lack of evidence required for the Governor in Council to make an asset seizure regulation
under FACFOA.214

The current FACFOA allows for persons affected by an order or regulation under section 4
to apply for ministerial reconsideration of their status as a "politically exposed person."215
However, the only way to otherwise contest the substantive or procedural validity of an
order or regulation under FACFOA is to apply for judicial review under section 18.1 of the
Federal Courts Act.216

      b) "Freezing" Regulations under FACFOA

Two regulations have been created to freeze assets under FACFOA. The first regulation, in
2011, targeted foreign officials from Tunisia and Egypt,217 and the second, in 2014, targeted
foreign officials from Ukraine.218 The original number of persons listed in those regulations
was 123 for Tunisia, 148 for Egypt, and 18 for Ukraine. The Tunisia and Egypt regulation
has been amended several times. According to media reports, under the Tunisia and Egypt
regulation, the government targeted residential property valued at CDN$2.55 million and
bank accounts containing CDN$122,000.219 However, it is not clear how much of that money
was returned to the people of Tunisia. The FACFOA itself does not provide a mechanism for
the return of assets. Instead, usually a further step, such as an MLA request, is needed to
return the assets.220

Both sets of regulations were extended for an additional five years and each has been the
subject of judicial review by individuals who argue that they should either not be considered

politically exposed foreign persons or that the regulations should not have been extended.
In both cases, the Federal Court of Canada dismissed the applications.

In Djilani v Canada (Foreign Affairs),221 the Court found that the FACPOA and the Tunisia
regulation did not infringe on the applicants' right to liberty and security under the
Canadian Constitution, the process under the legislation was fair, the applicants'
designation as politically exposed foreign persons was warranted, and the decision to
extend the end date of the regulation was justified based on the situation in Tunisia.

In Portnov v Canada (Foreign Affairs),222 the Court found that the Minister was justified in
adding Mr. Portnov's name to the Schedule in the Ukraine regulations based on an assertion
of impropriety by the foreign state. The regulation and the inclusion of Mr. Portnov's name
was extended, despite Ukraine not requesting an extension. In a subsequent proceeding,223
the Court found that, failing evidence of improper considerations, the extension, without a
foreign request, was a valid exercise of the Crown's prerogative over the conduct of foreign
affairs.

      c) Duties to Disclose and Offences for Non-Disclosures

Section 8 of FACFOA imposes a duty on banks and other enumerated or prescribed entities
to determine, on an ongoing basis, whether they are in possession or control of property that
they have reason to believe belongs to a politically exposed foreign person who is the subject
of an order or regulation under section 4. Section 9 of FACFOA imposes an obligation on any
Canadian or person in Canada to report any property that they know to be in their
possession, or knowledge of a property transaction, that is the subject of an order or
regulation under section 4.

Section 10 of FACFOA creates hybrid offences for willfully contravening orders made under
section 4 or the duties imposed by sections 8 and 9. In both cases, the maximum penalties
are five years in prison for an indictable offence or for a summary conviction, a fine of
CDN$25,000 and a maximum of one year in prison.

      d) Economic and Logistical Costs

Several concerns about the economic and logistical burdens individuals and entities face
under FACFOA have arisen. For example, the complexity of Canada's multiple pieces of
legislation governing sanctions means that Canadian companies and banks have to spend
considerable resources to ensure compliance.224 Andrea Charron notes that because the
FACFOA applies to property within Canada, it could impose a particularly onerous burden
on companies or banks involved in domestic real estate transactions.225 It remains unclear

how onerous tracking asset transactions of a relatively small group of individuals really is
or whether the money banks and companies have to spend on compliance goes beyond the
simple cost of doing business in a heavily-regulated industry.

Government institutions currently provide informational support to institutions affected by
FACFOA. While the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions does not have a
legislated role under FACFOA, it provides notice and guidance to federally regulated
financial institutions about duties and expectations under FACFOA regulations. For
example, it issued a notice when the Ukraine regulations were released under the Act.226

(2) Special Economic Measures Act

The Special Economic Measures Act (SEMA)227 allows the Governor in Council to make orders
or regulations taking economic measures against a foreign state. The Governor in Council
can do this in order to implement a call for sanctions from an association of states of which
Canada is a member or "if the Governor in Council is of the opinion that ... a grave breach
of international peace and security has occurred that has resulted or is likely to result in a
serious international crisis."228 The Governor in Council can also order the freezing or
seizure of property belonging to the foreign state, to individuals in that foreign state, or to
nationals of that foreign state not normally residing in Canada.229 Whereas the function of
FACFOA is to aid foreign governments in freezing assets held by members of corrupt former
regimes, SEMA allows Canada to act on its own to further the effectiveness of multilateral
sanctions.230

(3) Sergei Magnitsky Law

Sergei Magnitsky was a well-respected tax lawyer in Russia. Bill Browder, founder and CEO
of Hermitage Capital Management LTD (the largest foreign investment fund in Russia at the
time) was Magnitsky's client. In response to the fraudulent taking of some of Browder's
assets, Magnitsky investigated and discovered a $230 million tax fraud by senior Russian
officials. Once the incident became public, Magnitsky, Browder, and others were
investigated by Russian officials on suspicion of tax fraud. Browder and the others fled
Russia before they could be arrested. Magnitsky refused to leave Russia because he knew he
had done nothing wrong, and he wanted to have the senior Russian officials who were
involved in the theft and tax fraud brought to justice. He was arrested in October 2008 and
grossly tortured and maltreated until his death in prison on November 16, 2009. Why?

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

Because he refused to recant his allegations of official corruption and falsely confess to tax
evasion himself.231

Since Sergei's death, Browder has devoted his life to getting justice for Sergei. One of those
manifestations of justice has been the enactment in the US of the Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law
Accountability Act of 2012 (later known as the Magnitsky Act), which after a long and
suspenseful political ride became law in December 2012.232 The law authorizes the President
to impose visa bans and freeze and seize the assets of Russians responsible for gross
violations of human rights and significant acts of corruption. In 2016, the Magnitsky Act was

expanded to include all foreign officials--Russian or otherwise.233

In October 2017, Canada followed suit by enacting the Justice for Victims of Corrupt Foreign
Officials Act (Sergei Magnitsky Law).234 The Act authorizes visa bans and freezing and seizing
of assets of foreign officials from any country who are responsible for gross human rights
violations and significant corruption. In early November 2017, Canada issued its first round
of sanctions listing 52 human rights violators in Russia, Venezuela, and South Sudan. As of
August 25, 2021 there are now 70 foreign nationals listed under the Act's regulations.235

(4) Criminal Forfeiture of Proceeds of Crime

Canada's Criminal Code236 also deals with the proceeds of crime:

      Section 462.32 provides search and seizure powers of the proceeds of crime;
      Section 462.33 provides for restraint and freezing of the proceeds of crime; and
      Section 462.37 provides for the forfeiture of proceeds of crime.

When property is forfeited under section 462.37, it is forfeited to the government that
prosecuted the offender unless a third party has a valid and lawful interest in the property.
In that case, the property would be returned to that person under section 462.41. This third
party could include a requesting state in the case of corruption of foreign public funds.
Section 462.37(2.1) can be used to issue forfeiture orders for property located outside
Canada, but the order can only be enforced through a request to the foreign state's
government.

Where the offender is convicted of an offence and has subsequently died, or been at large
for more than six months, property can also be forfeited under section 462.38. This property

Property Management Act, provided there is a reciprocal bilateral agreement.237

(5) Effectiveness and Challenges

The 2016 FATF MER assessing the Canadian AML/CFT regime notes that asset recovery is
generally low, although some provinces, such as Quebec, seem to be more effective in
recovering assets linked to crime.238 Canada has made some progress since its 2008
evaluation in terms of asset recovery, but the fact that assets of equivalent value cannot be
recovered hampers the recovery of proceeds of crime, and confiscation results do not
adequately reflect Canada's money laundering risks.239 The MER recommends an increase
in timeliness of access, by competent authorities, to accurate and up-to-date beneficial
ownership information; the use of financial intelligence to investigate money laundering and
trace assets; ensuring that asset recovery is pursued as a policy objective throughout Canada;
and making greater use of the available tools to seize and restraint proceeds of crime other
than drug-related assets and cash, especially proceeds of corruption, including foreign
corruption and other major asset generating crimes.240

Transparency International (TI) released a report in 2014 outlining the difficulties in
recovering assets following the Arab Spring, including problems repatriating assets after
they were frozen under schemes such as FACFOA in Canada. Problems include premature
Mutual Legal Assistance Act requests, lack of evidence-gathering capacity in requesting
countries, and insufficient use of informal channels.241

 5.1 ASSET RECOVERY EFFORTS BY OECD MEMBER COUNTRIES: TAKING STOCK

 In preparing for the Fourth High-Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness in Busan, Korea
 (December 2011), the OECD and the Stolen Asset Recovery (StAR) initiative surveyed
 OECD countries to take stock of their commitments on asset recovery. The survey
 measured the amount of funds frozen and repatriated to any foreign jurisdiction between
 2006 and 2009. It found that during this time, only four countries (Australia, Switzerland,
 the United Kingdom and the United States) had returned stolen assets, totalling USD 276
 million, to a foreign jurisdiction. These countries, plus France and Luxembourg, had also
 frozen a total of USD 1.225 billion at the time of the survey.

 In 2012, the OECD and StAR launched a second survey measuring assets frozen and
 returned between 2010 and June 2012. In this time period, a total of approximately USD
 1.4 billion of corruption-related assets had been frozen. In terms of returned assets, a total
 of USD 147 million were returned to a foreign jurisdiction in the 2010-June 2012 period.
 This is a slight decrease from the USD 276 million recorded from the last survey round.

 ...

 Also, during 2010-June 2012, the majority of returned assets and 86% of total assets frozen
 went to non-OECD countries while in the 2006-09 period asset recovery mainly benefited
 OECD countries.

 Freezing stolen assets

 ... [During 2010-June 2012], Switzerland accounted for the largest volume of frozen assets
 (56%), followed by the United Kingdom (32%) and the United States (8%). These countries
 all have large financial centres and have made asset recovery a political priority.... Many
 OECD countries have not frozen any corruption-related assets to date. While this may be
 due to legal and policy obstacles, it may also be that few illicit assets had been placed in
 these countries to start with.

 Recovered stolen assets

 ... From 2006 to 2009, four OECD member countries reported the return of corruption-
 related assets. More than half, 53%, was returned by Switzerland, and another large share,
 44%, by the United States, while Australia (with 3%) and the United Kingdom (with 1%)
 accounted for much smaller returned amounts. Only three OECD countries had returned

 assets returned) followed by the United States (41%) and Switzerland (14%).

 5.2 ASSET RECOVERY IN THE CONTEXT OF THE ARAB SPRING

 The Arab Spring has helped focus attention on international asset recovery. As long-
 standing governments began to tumble in Tunisia, Egypt and Libya in early 2011, banks
 and governments the world over started freezing billions of dollars held by these
 countries' previous leaders and their associates. For example, a mere hour after Egypt's
 ex-president Hosni Mubarak stepped down in February 2011, the Swiss government
 ordered its banks to freeze his assets held in Switzerland on suspicion that they were the
 proceeds of corruption. Other OECD member countries followed suit. The European
 Union ordered an EU-wide freeze of assets linked to Tunisia's ex-president Zine El
 Abidine Ben Ali in January 2011, and of assets linked to ex-President Hosni Mubarak in
 March the same year. Despite the heightened attention to asset recovery following the
 Arab Spring, relatively few assets have to date been returned to the affected countries,
 and the process of recovering the stolen assets is proving to be both long and cumbersome
 (Cadigan and Prieston, 2011). The main obstacle to returning stolen assets to these
 countries is being able to provide solid enough proof that the assets were gained through
 corruption.

 As a response to these challenges, several OECD member countries have aided the
 process of bringing forth asset recovery cases and delivering such proof. Switzerland has
 sent judicial experts to both Egypt and Tunisia; US investigators and prosecutors have
 visited Egypt, Libya and Tunisia to work directly with their requesting country officials;
 and Canada has provided assistance on asset recovery to Tunisian officials.

 In addition, some governments have taken steps to strengthen domestic inter-agency co-
 operation.

6.1 Challenges to Effective Asset Recovery

After analyzing the data from 2006 to 2012 on asset recovery cases in OECD member
countries, the StAR report, Few and Far: The Hard Facts on Stolen Asset Recovery, concludes
that "a huge gap remains between the results achieved and the billions of dollars that are
estimated stolen from developing countries."243 The report also criticizes OECD members
for the "disconnect between high-level international commitments and practice at the
country level" due to lack of interest and prioritization.244

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

In the conclusion to their 2013 book, Gretta Zinkernagel, Charles Monteith and Pedro Pereira
offer a mixed, but optimistic, assessment of the progress made to date in asset recovery. They
note that:

          [T]he efforts to prosecute international corruption and money laundering
          cases and to successfully recover stolen assets have made considerable
          progress over the last five years. However, not all challenges have been
          overcome and, apart from a handful of cases, little money has effectively
          been recovered, especially in international cases. This has led to frustrations
          among citizens at large, as in the Egypt-Mubarak cases, as well as among
          concerned authorities in requesting and requested states.

          On the other hand, we have seen a clear increase in action: cases under
          investigation with assets at stake have increased exponentially. Ten years
          ago, there were fewer than 60 foreign bribery offenses under investigation,
          with the vast majority of them conducted by the US (which, in these cases
          alone, recovered over USD 5 billion of assets and disgorged profits). Today
          there are over 500 ongoing investigations being conducted by over 50
          different countries.245

Other commentators are more critical. For example, Paul Sarlo states:

          In the context of anti-corruption, the role of the World Bank in StAR, an
          asset-recovery program, is a continuation of its role as a lender - advice-
          driven and inefficacious. "[A]sset recovery is undertaken by states using legal
          procedures, which means that StAR does not investigate cases, prosecute
          cases or request mutual legal assistance." StAR is oxymoronic because it
          results in the World Bank instructing corrupt governments about how to
          recoup stolen loans, even though the governments themselves are probably
          complicit in the peculation [theft] of the loans. The situation is like advising
          the fox that was in the henhouse about how later to return the eggs. Even
          when a government is not involved in the theft of a loan and has legitimate
          interest in its return, prospects for asset recovery are dim because the
          process is a slog, laden with formidable obstacles - twenty-nine to be exact,
          by the World Bank's count.246 "[Asset recovery] requires hacking through
          thickets of international law. It cuts across criminal, civil and administrative
          justice. It relies on cooperation between countries (and between agencies
          within countries) that are often unable or unwilling to share information."247

          ...

          With these impediments to asset recovery, the slogan for StAR should be
          "[e]asy to steal, easier to keep." Although asset recovery may become less

          arduous in the future, countries could have to depend on StAR - with all its
          legal expenses, political red tape, and general complications - much less if
          the World Bank were to perform due diligence before making loans. [some
          footnotes omitted]248

Two main challenges identified in the earlier chapters of Emerging Trends in Asset Recovery249
deal with the complications inherent in transnational legal cooperation and the difficulties
in determining the beneficial ownership of corporations and trusts. Each of these challenges
is briefly discussed below.

      6.1.1 Transnational Communication and Cooperation

Transnational criminal law is a complex area. Successfully prosecuting corruption offences,
including money laundering and recovering assets held in other jurisdictions, requires
efficient communication and close cooperation between all states involved. However,
Rudolf Wyss argues that in practice mutual legal assistance frequently falls short of this
standard. Instead, in many cases "a strange desire to preserve a country's own domestic
legal system coupled with a passive attitude at the beginning of MLA challenges disregard
the keyword `assistance' in mutual legal assistance procedures."250 Wyss explains that:

          The traditional perception of the roles of the requesting and requested
          States often results in a passive attitude on the part of the requested State.
          Some requested States do not even answer requests that seem at first glance
          to have little chance of being accepted. In cases in which responses are
          provided to the requesting State, sometimes after a long period of time, the
          response usually includes a long enumeration of the missing elements in
          the request. Such attitudes and delays on the part of judicial authorities is
          in sharp contrast to the speed with which business transactions can be
          carried out by criminals. In a number of countries complicated channels of
          transmission for MLA requests are still in place. Consequently, not only is
          time lost before the request can reach the hands of the competent
          magistrates but sometimes the whole case-file is lost.

          Other requested countries' practice is to send a standard model of a `perfect'
          MLA request to the requesting magistrate who finds it difficult to
          understand the model, because it is written from the sole viewpoint of the
          requested State and generally does not take into account the legal
          differences of the requesting countries. Requesting States are bombarded
          with manuals, guidebooks and links to Internet pages none of which bring
          any further concrete assistance. From experience, these usually well-
          intended tools can sometimes lead instead to a great deal of confusion

          amongst the investigating authorities or can even discourage them from
          taking further steps or actions.251

Strengthening both official and informal channels of communication between states is
necessary if the MLA process is to function as intended.

The settlements in the VimpelCom corruption scandal offer an example of successful
international cooperation in a foreign bribery case. On February 18, 2016, Amsterdam-based
VimpelCom Limited, an issuer of publicly traded securities in the United States and its
wholly owned Uzbek subsidiary Unitel LLC, admitted to a conspiracy to pay more than $114
million in bribes to a government official in Uzbekistan to enable them to operate in the
Uzbek telecommunications market.252

Pursuant to its agreement with the US Department of Justice, VimpelCom agreed to pay a
criminal penalty of more than $230 million to the US, including $40 million in forfeiture. On
the same day, the Department of Justice filed a civil complaint seeking forfeiture of more
than $550 million held in Swiss bank accounts, which constitute bribes made to the Uzbek
official or funds involved in the laundering of those payments. This action follows an earlier
civil complaint filed by the Department of Justice on June 29, 2015, which sought forfeiture
of more than $300 million in bank and investment accounts held in Belgium, Luxembourg,
and Ireland. In that case the US District Court for the Southern District of New York entered
a partial default judgment (on January 11, 2016) against all potential claimants, other than
the Republic of Uzbekistan. In its verified claim filed on January 26, 2016, Uzbekistan
indicated that on July 20, 2015, the Tashkent Regional Criminal Court issued a final criminal
judgment confirming the rightful ownership of the assets in question by Uzbekistan.253

In its Press Release on the resolution of the criminal case, the US Department of Justice
acknowledged that law enforcement professionals from the Public Prosecution Service of
the Netherlands, the Swedish Prosecution Authority, the Office of the Attorney General in
Switzerland and the Corruption Prevention and Combating Bureau in Latvia provided
significant cooperation and assistance in this matter.254 Law enforcement in Belgium, France,
Ireland, Luxembourg, and the United Kingdom also provided valuable assistance.255 The
case is also an example of extensive domestic cooperation between law enforcement
agencies in the United States, including the DOJ, SEC, the Immigration and Customs

      6.1.2 Need for Mandatory Public Disclosure of Beneficial Ownership

In addition to the difficulties raised by mutual legal assistance, the international financial
system creates its own challenges. Corrupt officials, criminals and those they employ have
created many ingenious ways to disguise the beneficial ownership of illicit funds using
trusts, shell companies, and other vehicles. As pointed out by Jason Sharman, shell
companies in most countries can be set up easily and inexpensively online, without any
connection required between the beneficial owner's location and the jurisdiction of
incorporation.256 This allows criminals to frustrate investigations by ensuring that the
corporate service provider and the money launderer are in separate jurisdictions. Out of date
company registries, particularly in developing countries, add further difficulty to tracing the
beneficial owner.257 While significant gains have been made in financial regulation, driven
in part by the FATF, this enhanced regulation has sparked new innovations by criminals. As
Markus Schulz explains:

          For decades, banks and financial institutions have identified beneficial
          owners as part of their AML [anti-money-laundering] program. Therefore,
          those years of experience should make it easy to identify beneficial owners.
          The challenges, however, have not much changed over the years. If
          anything, it may be even harder today to identify beneficial ownerships
          than it was in the past. People who have something to hide, like money
          launderers, corrupt politicians, rogue employees and fraudsters, seek to
          channel illegitimate funds through the system. At the same time as banks
          and financial institutions have increased their efforts to make it harder to
          abuse the system, criminals are getting smarter at exploiting the system.258

Schulz recommends an improved system for identifying politically exposed persons (PEPs)
as well as regulations requiring company registers to maintain a record of beneficial
ownership.259 Sharman recommends the establishment of "a new global standard
mandating that all registries contain the identity of all beneficial owners and that this
information be publicly accessible to all."260 Sharman also recommends an improved system
for identifying politically exposed persons.261 For a more detailed discussion of disclosure of
beneficial ownership in the UK, the US, and Canada, see Section 6.1.2.1, 6.1.2.2 and 6.1.2.3.

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

The Global Organization of Parliamentarians Against Corruption (GOPAC)262 also
advocates for further transparency through the identification of beneficial owners. GOPAC
recommends requirements for financial institutions to demand a declaration of beneficial
ownership and impose strict "know your customer" measures.263

A significant development in the global movement towards mandatory disclosure of
beneficial ownership was implemented through the Extractive Industries
Transparency Initiative (EITI).264 EITI is briefly discussed in Chapter 9, Section 5.2.1. In
December 2015, the EITI Board decided that disclosure of the beneficial ownership of
companies involved in the extractive industries must be mandatory.265 The EITI Standard
was reissued in February 2016 and now requires disclosure of beneficial ownership. The
second requirement of the EITI Standard sets out the timeline and requirements for
how the beneficial ownership disclosure were to be gradually implemented beginning
in 2017 (and culminating in public disclosure by 2020).266

Global concern about the use of shell corporations, trusts, nominee directors, and
shareholders to hide beneficial ownership of criminal proceeds has reached a new level of
concern.267 For asset recovery and AML regimes to be effective, authorities must be able to
identify the natural persons who actually own and benefit from a given corporation's bank
account, real property, or other assets. In 2013, the G8 made a commitment to transparency
of company ownership, and in 2014 the G20 adopted 10 high-level principles on beneficial
ownership transparency. However, TI's 2018 Review still found that "[e]leven G20 countries
have `weak' or `average' beneficial ownership legal frameworks. This has dropped from 15
in 2015, but progress is too slow."268

          6.1.2.1 UK

In 2015, the UK government enacted Part 7 of the Small Business, Enterprise & Employment
Act 2015 (SBEE),269 which amended the Companies Act 2006270 "to require companies to keep
a register of people who have significant control over the company (PSCs)."271 The SBEE
inserted Part 21A of the Companies Act 2006, which identifies which companies are required
to maintain a register. The only companies exempted from the register are "DTR5 issuers"
and companies exempted by regulation. These exempt companies are companies which "are
bound by disclosure and transparency rules (in the UK or elsewhere) broadly similar to the
ones applying to DTR5 issuers."272 DTR5 issuers are "principally companies whose shares
are traded on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange and AIM."273 Thus, UK
companies that were previously not subject to transparency and disclosure rules are now
subject to the mandatory public disclosure of persons with significant control over the
company. The Limited Liability Partnerships (Register of People with Significant Control)
Regulations 2016 (UK)274 also require some Limited Liability Partnerships to keep a registry
of persons with significant control. Persons with significant control, which include, amongst
other things, persons with 25% or more of the shares in a company, are fully defined in the
Companies Act 2006 Schedule 1A.275 The beneficial ownership registry also applies to
"Politically Exposed Persons" who hold a share of 5% or more of a company.

Under the rules instituted under the SBEE, companies are required to keep a registry of
people with significant control. The Companies House registry is available to law
enforcement officials investigating money laundering or engaged in criminal asset recovery.
The failure to keep a registry of persons with significant control or to file an annual report
with Companies House are offences, subject to penalties of fines, imprisonment, and
freezing of assets or interests.276

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

          (i) Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies

Following the Paradise Papers leak in 2017, the UK Overseas Territories and Crown
Dependencies came under scrutiny for their role in facilitating corruption and money
laundering. In response, anti-corruption practitioners have advocated for greater
transparency through publicly-accessible beneficial ownership registers.

Ali Shalchi & Federico Mor's 2021 briefing paper states:

          All British Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies have or will
          introduce public company beneficial ownership registers. An amendment
          introduced by MPs to the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act 2018
          intended to require the UK Government to legislate to ensure British
          Overseas Territories introduce such registers by the end of 2020, although
          the Government interpreted this provision differently and British Overseas
          Territories have now committed to introduce such registers by the end of
          2023. Crown Dependencies have also committed to do so after the EU
          reviews the implementation of its own public registers, in 2022 or 2023.277

On June 19, 2019, the Crown Dependencies revealed their commitment to tabling publicly-
accessible beneficial ownership registries legislation by the end of 2023.278 In July 2020,
eight Overseas Territories (OTs) (namely, Anguilla, Bermuda, Cayman Islands, the
Falkland Islands, Montserrat, the Pitcairn Islands and St Helena, Ascension Island and
Tristan da Cunha, and the Turks and Caicos Islands) announced commitments to
introduce publicly accessible registers.279

          (ii) Property Ownership Transparency

As of yet, the UK land registries do not disclose beneficial ownership.280 However, the UK
does intend on introducing a beneficial ownership register for overseas-owned UK
companies. Despite steps taken to introduce this register since Prime Minister David
Cameron's 2016 announcement "[warning] foreign companies ... that they will be required
to disclose the beneficial ownership of UK property, including around 100,000 properties in
England and Wales owned by foreign companies," including a Draft Bill in 2018, positive
feedback on the Bill by a Joint Committee in 2019, and further statements of commitment to
the effort in 2020, a timetable for introducing the register is yet to be announced.281 Instead,
responses on this issue have been vague at best, and evasive at worst:

          In a Ministerial Statement on 21 July, 2020, Paul Scully, Minister for Small
          Business, Consumers and Labour Markets, noted the Government's
          commitment to introduce the register:

                The Government committed in primary legislation, through Section
                50 of the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act 2018, to report
                to Parliament annually on the progress that has been made towards
                putting in place such a register. The register is included as one of
                the key measures of the UK's Economic Crime Plan 2019-2022[1],
                and the December 2019 Queen's Speech included a commitment to
                progress the required legislation.

          However, he did not commit to a timetable for the legislation:

                This register will be novel, and careful consideration is needed
                before any measures are adopted, as it is imperative that the register
                is as robust as it reasonably can be, with reliable data and sufficient
                deterrent effects to make it clear that the UK property market is not
                a safe haven for dirty money. Engagement with members of civil
                society, business and the property market throughout all nations of
                the United Kingdom has been ongoing to ensure the proposed
                measures work equitably across the country.

          An answer to a parliamentary question asked by Dame Margaret Hodge in
          September 2020, enquiring about the timetable for the proposal, referred her
          back to the July statement above. A response on 3 February, 2021 to a similar

          question tabled by Labour MP Dan Carden said that the Government "will
          legislate when Parliamentary time allows".

          During the Second Reading of the Financial Services Bill 2012-21 on
          Monday, 9 November, 2020, in response to a request from SNP Treasury
          Spokesperson Alison Thewliss for an update on the status of the
          Registration of Overseas Entities Bill, Economic Secretary to the Treasury
          John Glen replied that "I think I have demonstrated that I have quite a lot
          to deal with in the Treasury, but I would be very happy to correspond with
          the hon. Lady further on the status of that Bill." [footnotes omitted]282

          (iii) Trusts

In 2017, the UK enacted a beneficial ownership register for trusts.283 When the register was
introduced, it was originally only accessible to law enforcement.284 However, the EU's Fifth
Anti-Money Laundering Directive (5AMLD) now requires data in the register to be
disclosed to persons who demonstrate a "legitimate interest."285 Additionally, 5AMLD
expanded the register's reach to all UK trusts, other than the specified exceptions.286

          6.1.2.2 US

The lack of beneficial ownership laws is one of the most significant loopholes in the AML
and counter terrorism financing laws in the US. The Department of Treasury introduced the
Customer Due Diligence Final Rule287 to close this gap. The Final Rule became effective July
11, 2016, and institutions were required to comply by May 11, 2018. There are three core
requirements introduced by the rule:

          (1) identifying and verifying the identity of the beneficial owners of
                companies opening accounts;

          (2) understanding the nature and purpose of customer relationships to
                develop customer risk profiles; and

          (3) conducting ongoing monitoring to identify and report suspicious
                transactions and, on a risk basis, to maintain and update customer
                information.288

Under the Final Rule, beneficial owners can stem from two prongs. The "ownership prong"
includes every individual who directly or indirectly owns 25% or more of a company. Under
the "control prong," a beneficial owner is a single individual with significant responsibility
to control, manage or direct the legal entity.289 Each company will therefore have between
one and five beneficial owners.

The Final Rule does not apply retroactively, meaning it only applies to accounts opened on
or after May 11, 2018.290

On January 2, 2021, the US Senate voted to override President Trump's veto of an omnibus
bill, which included the Corporate Transparency Act of 2019.291 The statute amended Title 31
of the United States Code and required the creation of a registry of beneficial owners within
FinCEN of certain entities formed or registered to do business in the United States.292

          6.1.2.3 Canada

Canada currently lags behind other countries in adopting beneficial ownership laws. As
Transparency International Canada (TI Canada) notes, "[i]n Canada, more rigorous identity
checks are done for individuals getting library cards than for setting up companies."293 TI

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

Canada rates Canada's compliance with the G20 principle as being weak or very weak in 7
of 10 principles.

In their 2016 Report, TI Canada notes "[a]s a testament to the secrecy afforded in Canada,
the law firm at the centre of the Panama Papers leak, Mossack Fonseca, marketed Canada to
its clients as an attractive place to set up anonymous companies."294 At that time, Canada
had approximately 3.4 million business corporations295 and an estimated millions of trusts.296
Trusts are treated as private contracts and can be guarded by attorney-client privilege.
Trusts provide a greater degree of anonymity to beneficial owners than corporations.297 This
level of secrecy is a huge hindrance to law enforcement efforts.

Nominees are individuals or entities appointed to act on behalf of a beneficial owner. They
add another layer of secrecy to companies.298 Nominee owners are a common means of
money laundering and hiding crime proceeds through real estate. TI Canada noted that a
study in 2004 found that "of 149 proceeds of crime cases successfully pursued by the RCMP
... nominee owners were used in over 60% of real estate purchases made with laundered
funds."299 TI Canada noted that of the 42 high-end properties sold in Vancouver in the
previous five years, 26% were bought by students or homemakers with no visible known
income or wealth.300

A beneficial ownership regime is crucial for Canada to have an effective, proactive regime
to combat corruption, money laundering, as well as offences such as drug trafficking and
fraud, and to assist in the recovery of proceeds of corruption and other crimes. The key
recommendation made by TI Canada in this regard is:

          The Government of Canada should work with the provinces to establish a
          central registry of all companies and trusts in Canada, and their beneficial
          owners. The registry should be available to the public in an open data
          format. Corporate directors and trustees should be responsible for
          submitting beneficial ownership information and keeping it accurate and
          up to date.301

Other recommendations include the following:

           Nominees should be required to disclose that they are acting on
                another's behalf, and the beneficial owners they represent should be
                identified.

295 Ibid at 17. As there is no central registry for corporations in Canada, TI Canada contacted each
provincial and territorial registry, noting the basic data was not readily available to registry
employees in most parts of Canada.

           Corporate registries should be given adequate resources and a
                mandate to independently verify the information filed by legal
                entities, including the identities of directors and shareholders.

           Beneficial ownership information should be included on property title
                documents, and no property deal should be allowed to proceed
                without that disclosure.

           The Government of Canada should make it mandatory for all
                reporting sectors - including real estate professionals - to identify
                beneficial ownership before conducting transactions.

           All government authorities in Canada should require beneficial
                ownership disclosure as a prerequisite for companies seeking to bid
                on public contracts.302

Another problem Canada faces in requiring mandatory disclosure of beneficial ownership
is the finding of the SCC in Reference re Securities Act,303 that a national securities commission
would be unconstitutional. As a result, TI Canada voiced concerns regarding Canada's
ability to reach a national consensus or impose a national requirement on beneficial
ownership transparency requirements.304

There is change on the horizon for Canada, however. Due to its federalist form of
government, companies can be incorporated federally or provincially, resulting in the need
for either 11 corporate registries of beneficial ownership or one, all-encompassing registry.
The Canadian government has started down the latter route with public consultations.305 It
is also possible for the provinces, which have constitutional authority over property and
civil rights, to create beneficial ownership registries for property transactions. British
Columbia was the first to do so, enacting the Land Owner Transparency Act (LOTA).306 That
legislation mandates disclosure of the names of beneficial owners of land, including
companies. The effectiveness of beneficial ownership registries revolves around the quality
of information received; its authentication; whether the registry is public or private, or an
amalgam of both; and whether there is effective enforcement. LOTA has already been
criticized by observers, leaving it to be seen whether it achieves its intended goals.307

      6.1.3 Other Challenges

Developing countries face additional challenges due to a lack of resources, expertise,
investigative experience, foreign contacts, and institutional stability for pursuing complex
transnational asset recovery proceedings and MLA requests. The MLA system is particularly
impossible for failing states. Section 4 of Canada's FACFOA aims to deal with failed states
by allowing the freezing of assets on request from countries experiencing "political turmoil"
or "an uncertain political situation."308 The "Duvalier law" in Switzerland represents
another attempt to fill in the gaps of the international asset recovery framework in relation
to states where the rule of law has broken down (see Section 3.1 for more on the "Duvalier
law").309

Political immunity presents another barrier to asset recovery. In some states, immunities
have been extended to protect various public officials, who are then able to use immunities
to block or delay investigation and prosecution for corruption or money laundering.310

Mark Vlasic also pointed out that lack of political will often hinders asset recovery: "often,
when states compare the costs of pursuing an asset recovery agenda to uncertain benefits,
the risk of stepping outside the status quo is more than they are willing to take on."311
Stephen Kingah notes that requesting countries must hire an "army of attorneys" and
expensive firms specializing in asset tracing.312 To make matters worse, many jurisdictions

which are often exorbitant.313 This dissipation of assets can discourage originating countries
from pursuing asset recovery proceedings.

Returned assets may be further reduced by asset sharing agreements with the requested
country. As Matthew Stephenson points out, although Article 57(5) of UNCAC requires
states to enable the return of all confiscated property, Article 14(3)(b) of UNTOC allows
states to consider negotiating case-by-case asset sharing agreements.314 Originating
countries may lack the resources for these lengthy negotiations and may find themselves in
a weak negotiating position since the requested country has custody of the confiscated
assets.

The authors of Barriers to Asset Recovery also point out that inadequate enforcement of AML
measures, particularly regulation of gateways into financial centres, prevents the
interception of stolen assets.315 In the StAR publication, Left out of the Bargain: Settlements in
Foreign Bribery Cases and Implications for Asset Recovery, the authors outline asset recovery
challenges resulting from the increasing use of settlements, as opposed to full trials, in
foreign bribery cases.316 In 365 settlements between 1999 and mid-2012, sanctions amounting
to $6 billion were imposed by countries other than the corrupt official's country. Of that $6
billion, only $197 million (3.3%) was returned to the corrupt official's country. Between mid-
2012 and the end of April 2016, monetary sanctions totalling $4 billion were imposed, but
only $7 million (0.18%) was returned to the corrupt official's country.317 That pitiful figure
arose from just one case in which a settlement (a deferred prosecution agreement) was
entered into by the Serious Fraud Office of the UK and Standard Bank in November 2015,
and required the latter to pay $6 million in compensation and $1 million in interest to
Tanzania.318 Also, between 1999 and mid-2012, roughly $556 million was returned or
ordered returned in cases where the jurisdiction of enforcement and the jurisdiction of the
corrupt foreign officials were the same, whereas between mid-2012 and the end of April 2016
this sum amounted to just $137,325.319 Beginning in April 2014, the Office of the Attorney
General of Switzerland (OAG) opened dozens of investigations in relation to the Petrobras
corruption scandal, resulting in $800 million in assets being frozen, and in March 2016 the
OAG announced that $70 million of frozen assets were to be unblocked and returned to

Brazil.320 In 2019, Swiss prosecutors stated that CHF365 million had been returned so far to
Brazil, with over CHF700 million having been seized.321

According to the authors of Left out of the Bargain, settlements are often lacking in
transparency with negotiations taking place behind closed doors.322 Further, affected
countries are often unaware of ongoing cases in other countries until they are over. Even
when affected countries have the opportunity to participate in negotiations elsewhere, for
example as a partie civile, they often lack the resources and knowledge of other legal systems
to follow through.323 The authors suggest that countries pursuing settlements inform
affected countries of the facts of the case and legal avenues to asset recovery, such as seeking
a restitution order.324 StAR also recommends that states permit third parties to be included
in settlement agreements in foreign bribery cases.

Finally, the desire to respect civil liberties presents another obstacle to crafting effective asset
recovery regimes. As explained by Julio Bacio-Terrancino, asset recovery initiatives have the
potential to infringe on property rights and the presumption of innocence, as well as rights
to privacy and a fair trial during investigation and other rights in relation to the offence of
illicit enrichment (see below).325

6.2 Emerging Tools in Asset Recovery

StAR found that OECD members are increasingly turning to less traditional avenues of asset
recovery. Instead of waiting for slow mutual legal assistance requests from corrupt officials'
jurisdictions, some jurisdictions have initiated their own investigations.326 Although
criminal confiscation is generally considered the most obvious tool in asset return, many

cases analyzed by StAR used administrative actions for freezing assets, NCB confiscation,
reparation payments, and settlement agreements to facilitate the return of assets.327

Some other new techniques for pursuing asset recovery have emerged in recent years and
are discussed below.

(1) Illicit Enrichment Offences

The offence of illicit enrichment assists in asset recovery by relaxing proof burdens.
Prosecutors only need to prove that a defendant cannot justify their illicit funds through
legitimate income sources. Article 20 of UNCAC requests states to consider establishing a
criminal offence of illicit enrichment. Because the offence has the potential to deteriorate the
presumption of innocence and the privilege against self-incrimination, critics discourage the
creation of the offence in states with a weak rule of law and weak governance. Prosecutorial
discretion also makes the offence vulnerable to abuse.328

(2) Unexplained Wealth Orders

The UK government recommended the creation of a system of unexplained wealth orders
(UWOs) in the Criminal Finances Bill introduced in the UK House of Commons on October
13, 2016.329 Australia already has a system for making unexplained wealth orders in five of
its six states and all of its territories.330 The UK Criminal Finances Act 2017331 (Act) (which
came into force on January 31, 2018) is aimed at targeting the revenue generated by
organized crime, with a particular focus on money laundering and terrorist finance.332
Perhaps the most novel and potentially controversial power introduced by the Act is the
introduction of unexplained wealth orders, which place a burden on individuals whose
assets are disproportionate to their income to explain the origin of their wealth.333 The Act
amends POCA to allow a court to make an UWO upon application from an enforcement

authority such as the Crown Prosecution Service or the SFO.334 The Court must be satisfied
that the respondent has property valued over £100,000. The Court must also be satisfied that
"there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that the known sources of the respondent's
law fully obtained income would have been insufficient for the purposes of enabling the
respondent to obtain the property."335 Finally, the Court must be satisfied either that there
are reasonable grounds to suspect that the respondent, or a person connected with the
respondent, is involved in serious criminal activity, or that the respondent is a "Politically
Exposed Person" (PEP).336 A PEP is defined as a person who has been "entrusted with
prominent public functions by an international organisation or by a State other than the
United Kingdom or another EEA State,"337 or a family member or close associate of such a
person.

If granted, a UWO places a requirement on the respondent to explain the source of their
assets within a specified period of time.338 If the respondent fails to respond in the specified
period, the assets will then be considered "recoverable property" and subject to civil
forfeiture under Part 5 of POCA. If a respondent purports to comply with the UWO, the
enforcement agency may undertake further enforcement or investigatory proceedings. The
Act also makes it an offence to knowingly or recklessly make "a statement that is false or
misleading in a material particular" when purporting to comply with a UWO. Statements
made when attempting to comply with an UWO would not be admissible as evidence
against a respondent in criminal proceedings.339 Section 2 of the Act amends POCA to
provide for freezing of assets identified in an UWO, while section 3 amends POCA to allow
for enforcement of UWOs overseas.340

TI assessed the Act while it was at the bill stage for its possible human rights impact and
concluded that there are sufficient safeguards included in the legislation to prevent UWOs
from being abused.341

(3) Other Measures

The Criminal Finances Bill also introduced five other measures aimed at criminal proceeds in
addition to the UWO regime, namely disclosure orders (sections 7 and 8); changes to
strengthen the suspicious activity report regime (section 11); new civil powers for proceeds
of crime recovery (sections 14-16); terrorist financing powers (sections 35-43); and corporate
offences of failure (sections 44-52).

     (a) Proceeds of Crime Recovery

The Act creates new civil powers that allow law enforcement agencies to seize proceeds of
crime that are stored in bank accounts or in non-cash valuables such as jewels or precious
metals. 342

(4) New Forms of Civil Damages

New measures of damages provide another useful tool in asset recovery. As pointed out by
Emile van der Does de Willebois and Jean-Pierre Brun, those who pay bribes are rarely
caught, which could encourage the perception that compensation orders are merely a cost
of doing business.343 Punitive damages would increase deterrence and encourage plaintiffs
to bring actions. The emerging concept of social damages provides another recourse for
victims of corruption and is already employed in Costa Rica. The concept is explained by
van der Does de Willebois and Brun:

          To ensure full compensation and deterrence when punitive damages are not
          applicable, other jurisdictions have tried to use the concept of social
          damages. In some jurisdictions, a social damage may be defined as the loss
          that is not incurred by specific groups or individuals but by the community
          as a whole. This could include damages to the environment, to the
          credibility of the institutions, or to collective rights including health,
          security, peace, education, good governance, and good public financial
          management. It is different from damages to collective rights, which belong
          to a restricted and identifiable group of individuals or legal entities. Social
          damage can be pecuniary and nonpecuniary.344

(5) Financial Disclosure for Public Employees

Richard Messick points out that financial disclosure requirements for public employees are
also useful in asset recovery. Disclosure can provide evidence of a predicate offence if
discrepancies exist between an official's disclosed finances and other records. Messick
recommends that states create a criminal offence around non-reporting to support asset
recovery actions. The author also recommends following Trinidad's example in making
forfeiture of an asset automatic when an official knowingly omits the asset from disclosure
statements.345

(6) Donor Assistance to Assist Poor Countries in Pursuing Asset Recovery

Finally, Mason recommends that aid agencies contribute resources to asset recovery
proceedings in donor countries as a means to assisting development in donee countries,
since donees often lack the resources to carry out MLA requests and transnational

1. INTRODUCTION

The economic and social costs of corruption are massive. The possible consequences provide
a major incentive for global anti-corruption measures, exemplified by the widespread
adoption of the UNCAC and the OECD Convention.

Anti-corruption enforcement is a vital part of the fight against global corruption. Prevention
of corruption before it occurs is the ideal goal. However, when prevention fails and
corruption occurs, investigation and punishment of corrupt offenders becomes critical.
Robust enforcement instills public confidence that states will not sit idly by while
corporations and individuals pursue illicit profits at the expense of the global citizenry.
Effective detection, prosecution, and sanctioning of corrupt offenders will also have a
deterrent effect, which is crucial to prevention. The strongest disincentive to corruption is a
high likelihood of being caught and brought to justice.1

Significant advances have been made in anti-corruption enforcement globally, and an era of
increased investigation and prosecution of corruption offences has begun in many countries
including the US, UK, and Canada. But is enough being done? Even in countries with highly
active enforcement regimes, it is probable that only a very small proportion of corrupt
behaviour is actually discovered and prosecuted.

This chapter discusses the international provisions that mandate effective methods for
investigation, prosecution, and sanctioning of corruption offences and the implementation
of these enforcement provisions in the US, UK, and Canada. Different structural approaches
to anti-corruption enforcement around the globe are introduced, followed by a brief
examination of the powers and techniques necessary for enforcement.

This chapter also discusses some of the costs of enforcement. Although significant, the costs
involved in fighting corruption are not at the forefront of the global discussion. Anti-
corruption enforcement takes financial and human resources, intelligence and technology,
as well as perseverance in the face of political risk. Corruption investigations involve
corporations and public officials in positions of power who can oppose and retaliate against
those who investigate and prosecute their crimes.

Anti-corruption enforcement can become entangled with international relations, generating
considerable financial and socio-political costs for the enforcing State Party. In the case of
BAE, discussed in Chapter 1, Section 10, the UK would have paid a high price to prosecute
BAE's bribery of Saudi officials. According to news reports, Prince Bandar of Saudi Arabia
threatened to withdraw security and intelligence support for UK soldiers in Iraq and to

1 Because "[s]uccessful detection of corruption depends upon insiders to report wrongdoing," Rose-
Ackerman points out the tension between the need to deter and to detect corruption offences: "One
conundrum for anti-corruption efforts is the possible tension between the goals of signaling credible
expected punishments and using the law to induce perpetrators to provide evidence." See Susan
Rose-Ackerman, "The Law and Economics of Bribery and Extortion" (2010) 6 Ann Rev L Soc Sci 217
at 221-222.

cancel an $80 billion aircraft contract with BAE.2 Faced with the loss of strategic support that
would endanger British lives in Iraq and the loss of a contract which would cost British jobs
at home, UK Prime Minister Tony Blair pressured Attorney General Lord Goldsmith to drop
the UK Serious Fraud Office (SFO)'s investigation into BAE's alleged bribery of Saudi
officials; Goldsmith (and thus the SFO) reluctantly acquiesced, eventually "agree[ing] to find
a plausible justification for halting the investigation."3 Faced with the cost to Britain, Tony
Blair effectively stopped the prosecution, but he may have decided differently if he had
taken a wider view of the global cost of corruption and considered its negative effect on
millions of the world's poorest people.4 The BAE case thus illustrates an important point:
political will is essential to effective enforcement of anti-corruption measures. It is
impossible to realize this political will by narrowly focusing on domestic concerns. The
consequence is that the independence of the enforcement process is compromised.

In Canada, the "SNC-Lavalin affair" provides a more recent illustration of the same point.
SNC-Lavalin Group Inc., a construction company based in Montreal, was investigated for
alleged bribes related to the company's operations in Libya. The company lobbied to
negotiate a deferred prosecution agreement (known as a "remediation agreement" in
Canada) with the prosecution.5 The Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), who reports to
the Attorney General, informed the Attorney General that she would not invite SNC-Lavalin
to negotiate a remediation agreement. The Attorney General accepted the DPP's decision
and refused to intervene. Later, however, Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau was found to
have used his position of authority over the Attorney General to seek to influence her
decision on whether to overrule the DPP.6 While SNC-Lavalin would eventually enter a
guilty plea, the political and public fallout was nonetheless significant: the former Attorney
General was ejected from the government caucus, and increased public scrutiny was
directed towards the remediation agreement as an enforcement tool.

These cases illustrate the reality that political interests can hinder the investigation or
prosecution of corruption. Foreign corruption offences involve a distinct, political
dimension which can manifest itself amidst enforcement efforts and undermine
prosecutorial independence. For instance, Prime Ministers Blair and Trudeau could
rationalize their conduct by pointing to the potential effect of sanctions on the public labour
force, thereby elevating domestic political concerns over global ones. From the perspective

also paid fines in the UK for bribery offences committed in Tanzania. See Chapter 1, Section 10.

5 The remediation agreement is a relatively new enforcement tool in Canada. Remediation
agreements are explored in depth in Section 6.3.3.

of critics at least, the conclusion which irresistibly follows is that some actors really are "too
big to prosecute."7

To prevent states from improperly interfering with the prosecution of corruption, it has been
suggested that corruption should be made an international crime to be prosecuted in an
international court. As discussed in Chapter 1, Section 1, over 100 world leaders have signed
a declaration for the creation of an International Anti-Corruption Court. However, this is an
unrealistic solution on the grounds that heads of states are unlikely to be persuaded to add
corruption to the small list of international crimes any time soon. There is also a movement
to have grand corruption treated as a violation of international human rights, which could
therefore be dealt with through international human rights processes. For more
information, see Chapter 1, Section 1.4.4.

Further complicating enforcement is the fact that bribery of foreign public officials is, by its
nature, extraterritorial. When a company bribes or attempts to bribe a foreign official, the
jurisdiction of at least two countries is engaged--the country in which the company is based
and the country in which the foreign official is based.8 This raises fundamental questions
about whether, and how, to coordinate investigative efforts where there may be discrete
interests and distinct levels of ability to conduct investigations among the involved
countries. Where coordination cannot be achieved, a risk arises that offenders will be subject
to prosecutions in multiple jurisdictions for the same conduct. Arguably, this is contrary to
the principle of "double jeopardy." It may also dissuade actors from self-reporting or
cooperating with investigating authorities. These risks are canvassed in Section 7.

2. INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS

Criminalization of corrupt behaviour is meaningless without robust law enforcement. To
support the overall anti-corruption scheme of UNCAC, chapters III (Criminalization and
law enforcement) and IV (International cooperation) include provisions that facilitate the
effective investigation and prosecution of corruption offences. While narrower in scope than
UNCAC, the OECD Convention also contains provisions to promote effective law
enforcement.

Broadly speaking, law enforcement provisions in the conventions cover the following areas:

     (1) Immunities and Pre-Trial Release of Defendants;
     (2) Specialized Anti-Corruption Enforcement Bodies;
     (3) Discretionary Power to Investigate and Prosecute Corruption;
     (4) Investigatory Power to Search Financial Records;

FCPA Blog <http://www.fcpablog.com/blog/2011/4/19/was-bae-too-big-to-debar.html>.
8 This, of course, is the most basic example. The corporate structure and operations of a multinational
company may involve underlying conduct that attracts jurisdiction from several different countries.

     (5) Protection of Witnesses, Victims, Whistleblowers and Participants;
     (6) International Cooperation in Investigation and Cooperation;
     (7) Jurisdiction for Prosecution and Transfer of Criminal Proceedings;
     (8) Extradition; and
     (9) Use of Special Investigative Techniques.

As ratifiers of UNCAC and the OECD Convention, the US, UK, and Canada are required to
implement the provisions of the conventions in their domestic statutes and law enforcement
practices. In the sections that follow, the convention requirements and the manner in which
the US, UK, and Canada have implemented each of these nine enforcement topics will be
described.

Section 2.1 begins by considering the reviewing mechanisms by which each country's
implementation of the convention requirements is monitored.

2.1 Peer Review Process

State Parties are held accountable for implementing the anti-corruption measures of the
conventions by the peer country review reports (in the case of UNCAC) and Phase 3 Reports
(in the case of the OECD Convention). These reviews also allow State Parties to respond to
the reviewing group's recommendations regarding more effective ways to implement
provisions of the anti-corruption conventions and to offer feedback in respect to the fight
against corruption in their country.

Some have criticized UNCAC's implementation review mechanism for the lack of depth and
rigour it involves. Although the country review reports are completed by expert teams from
randomly selected peer countries, the reports are largely "desk reviews" of the self-
assessments completed by the countries being reviewed. Country visits by the expert teams
are not mandatory and are contingent upon consent of the country being reviewed. In
addition, even though the UN resolution adopting the review mechanism encouraged
governments to include civil society and private sector input during the review process, a
country being reviewed is not required to include input from these important sources.
Notwithstanding these criticisms, the peer country review reports provide good summaries
of the apparent implementation of anti-corruption law enforcement provisions in the US,
UK, and Canada.

The OECD's review mechanism is regarded by many as more rigorous than the UNCAC
review. The Phase 3 reports are written by two peer countries that act as lead examiners. The
country being reviewed responds to a detailed questionnaire designed to elicit information
concerning the country's implementation of the OECD Convention and previous
recommendations of the OECD Working Group on Bribery. Each Phase 3 report involves a
mandatory on-site visit led by the two peer countries to determine the veracity of the
information on the questionnaire. The peer country reports are assessed by the entire
Working Group on Bribery, made up of representatives from all State Parties to the Anti-

2.2 UNCAC and OECD Provisions and their Implementation

For the sake of this discussion, the relevant provisions of the UNCAC and the OECD
Convention are not quoted verbatim. Instead, the content of the UNCAC provisions is
summarized based on the Legislative Guide for the Implementation of the United Nations
Convention against Corruption (Legislative Guide).9 Likewise, the OECD Convention provisions
are summarized rather than quoted.10 Summaries of the US,11 UK,12 and Canadian13
provisions in this section are largely from Executive Summaries produced by the UNODC's
Implementation Review Group of the United Nations Convention against Corruption.

      2.2.1 Immunities and Pre-Trial Release

UNCAC

Article 30 (mandatory) requires State Parties to:

      Maintain a balance between immunities provided to their public officials and their
          ability to effectively investigate and prosecute offences established under the
          Convention (para. 2); and

      Ensure that pre-trial and pre-appeal release conditions take into account the need
          for the defendants' presence at criminal proceedings, consistent with domestic law
          and the rights of the defence (para. 4).

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

OECD Convention

There is no mention of immunities or pre-trial release/detention.

US

Public officials are not immune from criminal and civil prosecution. However, US
prosecutors have the power to grant public officials immunity from prosecution for
corruption or other crimes, if those officials agree to provide information and assistance in
the investigation and prosecution of others involved in corruption.

Measures to ensure that an accused person does not flee or leave the country pending trial
are within the purview of the judicial authorities as set out in well-established federal and
state laws governing bail and pre-trial release.

UK

There are no automatic immunities or jurisdictional privileges accorded to UK public
officials, including Members of Parliament, in relation to the investigation, prosecution or
adjudication of UNCAC offences. Prosecutors have the power to enter into immunity
agreements in exchange for assistance in investigating others. However, it is more common
to reduce an informant's sentence by two-thirds (one-third for the guilty plea and an
additional one-third for the information and cooperation in investigation and prosecution
of others).

Measures to ensure that an accused person does not flee or leave the country pending trial
are within the purview of well-established laws governing bail and pre-trial release.

Canada

There are no general immunities for Canadian political, executive or civil service officials
engaged in criminal conduct (unless authorized by law for a specific and unique
circumstance). Prosecutors have the power to enter into immunity agreements in exchange
for information or assistance in investigating others.

The Criminal Code sets out measures to be taken with regard to the pre-trial detention and
conditional release of persons being prosecuted, taking into account the need to ensure
public safety and the accused's appearance at subsequent proceedings.

Autocratic and Kleptocratic Countries

By way of contrast, it should be noted that some of the most kleptocratic regimes in the
world have enacted immunity laws which protect the President and/or other senior officials
from prosecution for accepting bribes and robbing their nations' wealth.

Several examples are illustrative. An extreme example is that of Teodoro Obiang, who was
appointed as Vice President of Equatorial Guinea by his father, the President, and given
immunity from corruption charges--notwithstanding the fact that the country's

500  2022
                                                    CHAPTER 6 INVESTIGATION & PROSECUTION

Constitution did not provide for a vice president position. This, of course, suggests that the
appointment was solely for the purposes of providing immunity.14 In Nigeria, the
Constitution provides immunity to the president, vice-president, and state and deputy state
governors of all 36 states. According to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission in
Nigeria, this immunity was exploited by an estimated 31 out of the 36 state governors, such
as the corrupt Ibori of Delta State.15 In Cameroon, President Paul Biya has been in power
since 1982 and is immune from prosecution. Amendments to the Constitution since his
presidency began have removed presidential term limits, meaning Biya can be president for
life, and also created immunity for presidents after leaving office, meaning he is protected
even after his presidency ends.16 In Romania, the National Anti-Corruption Directorate is
facing hurdles in charging Prime Minister Victor Ponta, for conflict of interest, money
laundering, forgery, and tax evasion. Ponta's majority in Parliament blocked attempts to lift
Ponta's immunity in June 2015, and his party is trying to pass laws making the prosecution
of graft more difficult.17 Presidential pardons can also be used to protect corrupt officials
from the law, as demonstrated by the former Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan's
pardon of former state governor Diepreye Alamieyeseigha, who had been convicted of
corruption offences.18

      2.2.2 Specialized Enforcement Bodies

UNCAC

Article 36 (mandatory) requires State Parties, in accordance with the fundamental principles
of their legal system:

      To ensure they have a body or persons specializing in combating corruption
          through law enforcement and that such body or persons is sufficiently
          independent and free from undue influence; and

      To provide sufficient training and resources to such body or persons.

Article 38 (mandatory) requires that State Parties take measures to encourage cooperation
between their public authorities and law enforcement. Such cooperation may include:

      Informing law enforcement authorities when there are reasonable grounds to
          believe that offences established in accordance with Articles 15 (bribery of national
          public officials), 21 (bribery in the private sector) and 23 (laundering of proceeds of
          crime) have been committed; or

      Providing such authorities all necessary information, upon request.

Article 39 (mandatory) requires State Parties:

      To take measures consistent with their laws encouraging cooperation between
          private sector authorities (financial institutions, in particular) and law enforcement
          authorities regarding the commission of offences established in accordance with
          the Convention (para. 1); and

      To consider encouraging its nationals and habitual residents to report the
          commission of such offences to its law enforcement authorities (para. 2).

OECD Convention

Article 5 provides that:

          Investigation and prosecution of bribery shall not be influenced by
          consideration of national economic or political issues, nor by the identity of
          persons involved.

Annex I ("Good Practice Guidelines on Implementing Specific Articles of the Convention")
provides the following guidance in respect to implementing Article 5:

          Complaints of bribery of foreign public officials should be seriously
          investigated and credible allegations assessed by competent authorities.

          Member countries should provide adequate resources to law enforcement
          authorities so as to permit effective investigation and prosecution of bribery
          of foreign public officials in international business transactions, taking into
          consideration Commentary 27 to the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention.

Recommendation IX: Reporting Foreign Bribery provides that member countries should
ensure that:

          i) easily accessible channels are in place for the reporting of suspected acts
                of bribery of foreign public officials in international business
                transactions to law enforcement authorities, in accordance with the
                member country's legal principles;

          ii) appropriate measures are in place to facilitate reporting by public
                officials, in particular those posted abroad, directly or indirectly
                through an internal mechanism, to law enforcement authorities of
                suspected acts of bribery of foreign public officials in international
                business transactions detected in the course of their work, in accordance
                with the member country's legal principles;

          iii) appropriate measures are in place to protect from discriminatory or
                disciplinary action public and private sector employees who report in
                good faith and on reasonable grounds to the competent authorities

                suspected acts of bribery of foreign public officials in international
                business transactions.

US

Section 3.3.1 describes the US enforcement bodies that deal with allegations of corruption.

UK

Section 3.3.2 describes the UK enforcement bodies that deal with allegations of corruption.

Canada

Section 3.3.3 describes the Canadian enforcement bodies that deal with allegations of
corruption.

Commentary

While the US, UK, and Canadian law enforcement bodies are generally recognized as
independent and honest, that is not the case in many other countries, which makes
enforcement of anti-corruption laws in those countries infrequent and arbitrary. It also
reduces or prevents the possibility of any meaningful coordination between countries with
more sophisticated, independent enforcement bodies and countries who lack them.

Both the UNCAC and the OECD Convention call for adequate resources for law
enforcement. Considering the size and impact of corruption committed by businesses from
the US, UK, and Canada, it seems that the UK and Canada are seriously under-resourced,
certainly in comparison to the US.

In particular, Canada provides a case study illustrating the difference between adopting
legislation to implement obligations into domestic law, on the one hand, and seriously
enforcing those laws, on the other. While the Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act
(CFPOA)19 came into force in 1999, Canada devoted virtually no resources to enforcement
for the next nine years. In fact, it was not until 2008 that Canada established a specific body
for the purposes of CFPOA enforcement. In 2008, the Canadian government established the
International Anti-Corruption Team (IACT) within the RCMP's Commercial Crime Branch.
The IACT consisted of two teams, one in Ottawa and one in Calgary (the corporate home of
many companies in the extractive resources sector). Predictably, enforcement activity
increased in the years following.20 However, these two teams were dismantled five years
later and reassigned to other somewhat-related matters.

      2.2.3 Discretionary Power

UNCAC

Article 30 (non-mandatory) mandates that State Parties consider or endeavour:

          To ensure that any discretionary legal powers relating to the prosecution of
          offences established in accordance with the Convention maximize the
          effectiveness of law enforcement in respect of those offences and act as a
          deterrent (para. 3).

Article 36 (mandatory) requires State Parties, in accordance with the fundamental principles
of their legal system, to grant law enforcement the necessary independence to carry out its
functions effectively without undue influence.

OECD Convention

Article 5, as discussed in Section 2.2.2, and the Commentary to that Article, are directed at
ensuring impartial and transparent enforcement of bribery of foreign public officials.

US

Traditionally, prosecutors in common law systems have had very broad and independent
discretionary powers to prosecute or decline to pursue allegations of violations of criminal
law. Those discretionary powers are constrained only by considerations such as strength of
the evidence, deterrent impact, adequacy of other remedies and collateral consequences, and
in general are not supposed to include political or economic factors. At the federal level,
prosecutorial discretion over criminal law is vested solely in the Department of Justice and
the Attorney General. Allegations of prosecutorial misconduct can be brought before the
courts at any time, including allegations of selective prosecution based on a number of
prohibited factors.

In terms of prosecuting foreign and transnational bribery, the UNCAC Implementation
Review Group noted that US law enforcement was effective in combatting and deterring
corruption and, within the framework of prosecutorial discretion and other aspects of the
US legal system, had developed a number of good practices demonstrating a significant
enforcement level in the US.

UK

The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) exercises very broad and independent discretion over
the prosecution of criminal offences under the general supervision of the Director of Public
Prosecutions, whose office helps ensure that prosecutions do not involve political
interference. In spite of this independence, as mentioned in the introduction to this chapter,
the investigation of bribery allegations against Prince Bandar of Saudi Arabia and BAE was
halted by the Prime Minister for economic and military purposes despite the SFO's intention
to pursue charges, but at least that influence was openly exercised in public.

                                                    CHAPTER 6 INVESTIGATION & PROSECUTION

The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) investigates and prosecutes domestic and foreign corruption
cases. The SFO is an independent department, headed by a Director, under the general
supervision of the Attorney General. SFO prosecutors are subject to the CPS's Code for Crown
Prosecutors. (In Scotland, investigation and prosecution of crimes are under the direction of
the Lord Advocate.)

The SFO receives a core budget from Her Majesty's Treasury, which can be supplemented
as necessary to enable the office to take on large cases. In 2019-20, the budget was £60.6
million. Until 2013-14, the SFO received a portion of money recovered from investigations.
However, as this was infrequent and highly unpredictable, the SFO agreed all proceeds
would go to the Treasury with a fixed sum added to the SFO's funding.21

Canada

In carrying out their duties in the public interest, Canadian prosecutors exercise wide
discretion over which criminal charges are pursued and they are obliged to exercise fair,
impartial, and independent judgement in those decisions. Guidance is provided in the Public
Prosecution Service of Canada Deskbook (PPSC Deskbook), as well as in confidential practice
directives.

In general, the provincial ministries of justice are delegated authority to prosecute Criminal
Code offences (including domestic corruption cases), while the federal Public Prosecution
Service of Canada (PPSC) prosecutes CFPOA offences.22

      2.2.4 Investigatory Power to Search Financial Records

This topic is also covered in Chapter 5.

UNCAC

In accordance with Article 31 (mandatory), State Parties must, to the greatest extent possible
under their domestic system, have the necessary legal framework to enable:

      The identification, tracing and freezing or seizure of the proceeds and
          instrumentalities of crime covered by the Convention, for the purpose of eventual
          confiscation (para. 2); and

      The empowerment of courts or other competent authorities to order that bank,
          financial or commercial records be made available or seized. Bank secrecy shall not
          be a legitimate reason for failure to comply (para. 7).

21 "About Us" (last visited 19 August 2021), online: Serious Fraud Office

22 There are, however, exceptions to the rule. The R v Niko Resources Ltd, 2011 CarswellAlta 2521 (QB)
[Niko Resources] and R v Griffiths Energy International, 2013 AJ No 412 (QB) [Griffiths Energy] cases are
two such examples. A fuller discussion of Niko Resources can be found in Chapter 2.

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

Article 40 (mandatory) requires State Parties to ensure that, in cases of domestic criminal
investigations of offences established in accordance with the Convention, their legal system
has appropriate mechanisms to overcome obstacles arising out of bank secrecy laws.

OECD Convention

Article 9 dealing with Mutual Legal Assistance provides:

          3. A Party shall not decline to render mutual legal assistance for criminal
                matters within the scope of this Convention on the ground of bank
                secrecy.

Recommendation III also states:

          each Member country [should] take concrete and meaningful steps in
          conformity with its jurisdictional and other basic legal principles to examine
          or further examine the following areas:
          ...

               vi) laws and regulations on banks and other financial institutions to
                     ensure that adequate records would be kept and made available for
                     inspection and investigation.

US

UNCAC's peer review of US legislation concluded that US law was in compliance with
Article 40 on bank secrecy. The Review Report noted that the US authorities may wish to
have in mind that, in terms of implementation, bank secrecy may also apply to the activities
of professional advisors that could be linked to those of their clients under investigation (for
example, the activities of lawyers acting as financial intermediaries).

The peer review report noted that assistance is not denied on the grounds of bank secrecy
or solely on the ground that the related offense involves fiscal matters.

UK

The UK is generally compliant with UNCAC Article 40. The provision of information by
financial institutions is generally governed by dated case law, which still holds as good
practice addressing how and why confidentiality may be breached.23 Bank records are also
available by search warrant and through mandatory bank reporting of suspicious
transactions.

The UK has a value-based confiscation system. Confiscation, as well as the detection,
freezing, seizing and administration of property, are mainly covered in a comprehensive

manner by the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 and the Sentencing Act 2020. The basic regulations
in England and Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland are identical.

Canada

Bank secrecy does not prevent the prosecutor from requesting, and upon a court order,
obtaining financial records relating to the proceeds of crime.

The mechanisms for identification and freezing criminal assets are set forth in the Criminal
Code under section 462.3. Related provisions require banks and other financial institutions
to report all transactions over CDN$10,000.

Canada has also enacted the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act
to implement specific measures to detect and deter money laundering and to facilitate the
investigation or prosecution of money laundering offences.24 The statute establishes record
keeping and client identification requirements for financial services providers, as well as
reporting requirements for suspicious activity. The Act also created the Financial
Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC), which is Canada's
financial intelligence unit.

      2.2.5 Witness, Victim, Whistleblower, and Participant Protection

Protection of whistleblowers is examined in detail in Chapter 13.

UNCAC

In accordance with Article 32 (mandatory), and bearing in mind that some victims may also
be witnesses (Article 32, paragraph 4), State Parties are required:

      To provide effective protection for witnesses, within available means (para. 1).
          This may include:
                - Physical protection (para. 2 (a));
                - Domestic or foreign relocation (para. 2 (a)); and/or
                - Special arrangements for giving evidence (para. 2 (b));

      To consider entering into foreign relocation agreements (para. 3); and
      To provide opportunities for victims to present views and concerns at an

          appropriate stage of criminal proceedings, subject to domestic law (para. 5).

Article 33 (non-mandatory) directs State Parties to consider providing measures to protect
persons who report offences established in accordance with the Convention to competent
authorities.

                - To provide concrete assistance towards depriving offenders of the

                suspected acts of bribery of foreign public officials in international
                business transactions.

US

The United States relies on a wide range of protection measures for witnesses and victims.
Protection is provided not only to persons that actually testify in criminal proceedings, but
also to potential witnesses, as well as the immediate and extended family members of the
witnesses and the persons closely associated with them, if an analysis of the threat
determines that such protection is necessary.

From an operational point of view, the protection of witnesses' and victims' physical
security can be secured through the Federal Witness Security Program,25 if these persons
meet the requirements for participation in that program. Other procedures are also in place
to provide limited protection through financial assistance for relocation.

With regard to the protection of reporting persons, the federal Whistleblower Protection Act of
1989 makes the Office of the Special Counsel (OSC) responsible for, inter alia, protecting
employees, former employees, and applicants for employment from twelve statutory
prohibited personnel practices, as well as receiving, investigating and litigating allegations
of such practices.

The protection of witnesses may also be extended to cooperating informants and defendants
who agree to become government trial witnesses. The discretionary powers of the

prosecution services are of relevance. In addition to granting immunity, prosecutors often
negotiate a plea agreement with a defendant to induce that defendant's cooperation by
dismissing one or more of the charges, and/or by recommending that the defendant receive
a lower sentence in exchange for their cooperation.

UK

UK chief officers of police and heads of law enforcement agencies have access to an extensive
range of measures to protect witnesses, based on the provisions of the Serious Organized
Crime and Police Act 2005 (SOCPA), including full witness protection programmes involving
witness relocation, a change of identity and a high degree of confidentiality. These measures
fully cover the requirements of Article 32.

The same can be said about the protection of reporting persons. The Public Interest Disclosure
Act 1998 amending the Employment Rights Act 1996 added whistleblowers to the list of those
given special protection against dismissal or other detrimental treatment, and Northern
Ireland has enacted similar legislation.

The protection and safety of persons who cooperate is the same in the UK as for witnesses
under Article 32. Additionally, in England and Wales, section 82 of SOCPA makes special
provision for the protection of witnesses and certain other persons involved in investigations
or legal proceedings. Other implementing laws (including for Scotland and Northern
Ireland) are referenced in the UN Report on the UK's compliance with UNCAC.

Canada

Mechanisms exist to protect witnesses, including measures that may be used in court to
protect witnesses during their testimony. The federal Witness Protection Program of Canada
is administered by the RCMP and offers assistance to persons who are providing evidence
or information, or otherwise participating in an inquiry, investigation or prosecution of an
offence. Protection measures may include relocation inside or outside of Canada,
accommodation, change of identity, counselling, and financial support to ensure the
witness's security or facilitate the witness's re-establishment to become self-sufficient.

With regard to persons reporting corruption, section 425.1 of the Criminal Code makes it a
criminal offence for an employer to demote, terminate, or otherwise affect or take
disciplinary action against an employee who reports a possible offence under any federal or
provincial act or regulation, either before a report takes place or in retaliation after a report
is made. In addition, the Public Servants Disclosure Protection Act (PSDPA) provides a
mechanism for public servants to make disclosures of wrongdoing, and established the
office of the Public Sector Integrity Commissioner to investigate those alleged wrongdoings
and investigate complaints of reprisals. The PSDPA also provides members of the public
with protection from reprisal by their employers for having provided, in good faith,
information to the Public Sector Integrity Commissioner concerning alleged wrongdoing in
the federal public sector. Other protections are available at the provincial level.

                                                                                                          509

      2.2.6 International Cooperation

Mutual legal assistance is dealt with in Chapter 5, Section 4.

UNCAC

Article 43 (mandatory) provides:

          State Parties shall cooperate in criminal matters in accordance with Articles
          44 to 50 of this Convention. Where appropriate and consistent with their
          domestic legal system, State Parties shall consider assisting each other in
          investigations of and proceedings in civil and administrative matters
          relating to corruption.

Article 46 (mandatory) provides:

          State Parties shall afford one another the widest measure of mutual legal
          assistance in investigations, prosecutions and judicial proceedings in
          relation to the offences covered by this Convention (para. 1).

Article 48 (mandatory) on law enforcement cooperation fleshes out the requirements of
Articles 43 and 46 by requiring State Parties to cooperate with the law enforcement bodies
of other State Parties through communicating, coordinating investigations, providing
support, exchanging information, etc. It is recommended that in order to give effect to the
requirements of Article 48, bilateral or multilateral agreements should be entered into by
law enforcement bodies.

Article 49 (non-mandatory) on joint investigations provides:

          State Parties should consider conducting joint investigations and forming
          joint investigative bodies to that effect.

OECD Convention

Article 9 (mandatory) on Mutual Legal Assistance states:

          1. Each Party shall, to the fullest extent possible under its laws and
                relevant treaties and arrangements, provide prompt and effective legal
                assistance to another Party for the purpose of criminal investigations
                and proceedings brought by a Party concerning offences within the
                scope of this Convention and for non-criminal proceedings within the
                scope of this Convention brought by a Party against a legal person. The
                requested Party shall inform the requesting Party, without delay, of any
                additional information or documents needed to support the request for
                assistance and, where requested, of the status and outcome of the
                request for assistance.

          2. Where a Party makes mutual legal assistance conditional upon the
                existence of dual criminality, dual criminality shall be deemed to exist
                if the offence for which the assistance is sought is within the scope of
                this Convention.

Article 11 (mandatory) provides:

          For the purposes of Article 4, paragraph 3 on consultation, Article 9 on
          mutual legal assistance and Article 10 on extradition, each Party shall
          identify to the Secretary-General of the OECD an authority or authorities
          responsible for making and receiving requests, which shall serve as a
          channel of communication for these matters for that Party, without
          prejudice to other arrangements between Parties.

US

The US considers the UNCAC provisions as a sufficient legal basis for law enforcement
cooperation in respect to the offenses covered by UNCAC. Additionally, the country has
entered into bilateral or multilateral agreements or arrangements on direct cooperation with
many foreign law enforcement agencies.

The presence of law enforcement attachés abroad and the extensive use of the informal law
enforcement channels in appropriate instances is commended by the UN Review Committee
as good practice. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) of the Department
of the Treasury, which is the US financial intelligence unit (FIU) and part of the Egmont
Group, also plays a significant role in promoting information sharing with foreign
counterparts in money laundering cases.

The US has concluded bilateral and multilateral agreements that allow for the establishment
of joint investigative bodies. Joint investigations can also take place on a case-by-case basis,
at the level of informal law enforcement cooperation, and entail information sharing and
cooperation on developing effective investigative strategies.

UK

UK law enforcement authorities engage in broad, consistent and effective cooperation with
international counterparts to combat transnational crime, including UNCAC offences. This
cooperation relates, inter alia, to exchanges of information, liaising, law enforcement
coordination and the tracing of offenders and of criminal proceeds. A particularly prominent
role in such activities is played by the Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA), and
examples of SOCA's activities were provided during the UNCAC Review of UK laws.
Important roles are also played by the SFO, the City of London Police, the specialized units
of the Metropolitan Police, and other law enforcement authorities. The level and
effectiveness of these activities indicates effective compliance with UNCAC Article 48.

                                                                                                          511
GLOBAL CORRUPTION

Investigating authorities in the UK make use of the mechanism of joint investigation teams
(JITs), in particular with civil law jurisdictions in Europe, when their use will mitigate
problems in receiving intelligence and investigative cooperation from those jurisdictions.

The UK has, and utilizes, the ability to cooperate with foreign law enforcement authorities,
often through regular MLA procedures, in the use of special investigation techniques,
including covert surveillance and controlled deliveries.

The UNCAC Review of UK laws also indicates that the UK handles a high volume of MLA
and international cooperation requests with an impressive level of execution. The efficient
operations of the UK in this sphere are not only carried out by regular law enforcement
authorities, such as the Home Office and the Metropolitan Police, but also through the
effective use of specialized agencies, such as the SFO and SOCA, to deal with requests
involving particularly complex and serious offences, including offences covered by
UNCAC. The effective use of this unique organizational structure merits recognition as a
success and good practice under the Convention. In addition, the operations of aid-funded
police units directed at illicit flows and bribery related to developing countries constitute a
good practice in promoting the international cooperation goals of UNCAC. Similarly, the
UK's efforts to assist in building the capacity of law enforcement authorities in developing
nations, with the goal of enabling them to investigate and prosecute corruption offences,
also constitutes good practice.

Canada

The Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC) has a
mandate to exchange financial intelligence with other State Parties in relation to money
laundering and terrorist financing. Information received by FINTRAC is shared as
appropriate with Canadian police and other designated agencies. Such information can also
relate to corruption offences: between March 31, 2019 and March 31, 2020, FINTRAC
received 227 queries for information from foreign financial intelligence units in relation to
money laundering and terrorist activity financing, and provided 234 disclosure packages.26

To further enhance cooperation in law enforcement, the RCMP has liaison officers deployed
worldwide. Combined with the establishment of the International Anti-Corruption Team at
the RCMP, this provides a strong institutional framework for international cooperation in
investigations. Furthermore, the RCMP recently concluded a memorandum of
understanding with Australia, the UK, and the US on the establishment of an International
Foreign Bribery Task Force, which will strengthen existing cooperative networks between
the participants and outline the conditions under which relevant information can be shared.

The potential for joint investigations is evaluated on a case-by-case basis. They are most
often conducted on the basis of a memorandum of understanding or exchange of letters

between the RCMP and a foreign agency partner. Such joint investigations can, however,
also be conducted without a formal agreement.

      2.2.7 Jurisdiction and Transfer of Criminal Proceedings

UNCAC

Article 42 (mandatory) at paragraph 5 states:

          If a State Party exercising its jurisdiction under paragraph 1 or 2 of this
          article has been notified, or has otherwise learned, that any other State
          Parties are conducting an investigation, prosecution or judicial proceeding
          in respect of the same conduct, the competent authorities of those State
          Parties shall, as appropriate, consult one another with a view to
          coordinating their actions.

Article 47 (mandatory) on transfer of criminal proceedings provides:

          State Parties shall consider the possibility of transferring to one another
          proceedings for the prosecution of an offence established in accordance
          with this Convention in cases where such transfer is considered to be in the
          interests of the proper administration of justice, in particular in cases where
          several jurisdictions are involved, with a view to concentrating the
          prosecution.

OECD Convention

Article 4 (mandatory) states:

          3. When more than one Party has jurisdiction over an alleged offence
                described in this Convention, the Parties involved shall, at the request
                of one of them, consult with a view to determining the most appropriate
                jurisdiction for prosecution.

US

The US authorities reported no cases of transfer of criminal proceedings involving US
citizens to foreign fora, due partly to the national policy of seeking extradition of US citizens
alleged to have committed offenses under US jurisdiction.

US authorities will sometimes decline to prosecute foreign offenders under FCPA
jurisdiction when these offenders are facing prosecution for the same acts of corruption in a
foreign jurisdiction. For example, there was no US prosecution under the FCPA of Griffiths
Energy Inc. on the grounds that the company's bribery was adequately prosecuted and
punished in Canada.27 However, this is a matter of discretion for DOJ prosecutions. As

27 Griffiths Energy, supra note 22.

                                                                                                          513
GLOBAL CORRUPTION

discussed in Section 7, the DOJ may prosecute an offender even if a prosecution for the same
underlying conduct has been concluded in another jurisdiction.

UK

Although UK authorities indicated that it is possible to transfer proceedings to other
jurisdictions and to accept such transfers, it does not appear to have any specific legislative
or treaty mechanisms to effectuate such transfers. The transfer of proceedings under current
UK practice involves simply accepting a foreign file for examination by UK prosecution
authorities. If an independent basis for jurisdiction exists within the UK, the prosecution
authorities may exercise discretion to undertake prosecution. In such cases, evidence is
obtained via traditional MLA procedures. Domestic procedures and guidelines provide a
practical basis under which the UK can entertain requests that cases pending in foreign
jurisdictions be prosecuted in the UK. The UNCAC Implementation Review Group
concluded that the UK complies with Article 47 of the Convention.

Canada

While the transfer of criminal proceedings is not specifically addressed in the domestic
legislation of Canada, the UNCAC review indicated that the discretion available to
Canadian prosecution services is exercised so as to facilitate the processing of cases in the
most appropriate jurisdiction.

      2.2.8 Extradition28

UNCAC

Article 44 (mandatory) recommends that:

          State Parties streamline the extradition of accused persons to the territory of
          the requesting State Party so that they may stand trial for corruption
          offences.

OECD Convention

Article 10 (mandatory) states:

          3. Each Party shall take any measures necessary to assure either that it can
                extradite its nationals or that it can prosecute its nationals for the offence
                of bribery of a foreign public official. A Party which declines a request
                to extradite a person for bribery of a foreign public official solely on the

28 Sometimes politics play a role in extradition proceedings. For example, in 2015, an Austrian court
refused to extradite Dmytro Firtash, a Ukrainian national, to the US after the DOJ laid charges for
violations of the FCPA committed in India. Firtash is a pro-Russian Ukrainian and argued that the
DOJ was motivated by political concerns. The court agreed with Firtash and criticized the DOJ. See

                ground that the person is its national shall submit the case to its
                competent authorities for the purpose of prosecution.

US

The US extradition regime, based on a network of treaties supplemented by conventions, is
underpinned by a solid legal framework allowing for an efficient and active use of the
extradition process. The shift from rigid list-based treaties to agreements primarily based on
the minimum penalty definition of extraditable offenses (in most cases deprivation of liberty
for a maximum period of at least one year, or a more severe penalty) for establishing double
criminality has given the extradition system much more flexibility, and should be
highlighted as a good practice.

The US policy of extraditing its own nationals constitutes a good practice since it can assist
in dealing with issues of double jeopardy, jurisdiction, and coordination.

The US authorities indicated that no implementing legislation was required for Article 44 of
the UNCAC. It was further reported that the US may only seek extradition or grant an
extradition request on the basis of a bilateral extradition treaty, and therefore UNCAC alone
cannot be used as the basis for extradition. It can, however, expand the scope of the
extraditable offense when a bilateral treaty is already in place.

The US does not refuse extradition requests solely on the ground that the offense for which
extradition is sought involves fiscal matters.

The US has bilateral extradition treaties with 133 states or multilateral organizations, such
as the European Union. All incoming and outgoing extradition requests are reviewed and
evaluated by the Office of International Affairs, DOJ, and the Office of the Legal Adviser,
Department of State.29

UK

The UK has a complex but comprehensive legislative framework for enabling the extradition
of fugitives. The complexity of the framework derives in part from the fact that the
procedures and requirements for extradition may vary depending on the legislative
category that the requesting state falls into, as well as which region of the UK (England and
Wales, Northern Ireland or Scotland) is involved.

The UNCAC Review makes clear, however, that the UK is able to extradite to all states, even
those which are in neither Category 1 (EU Member States) nor Category 2 (designated non-
EU Member States) of the Extradition Act 2003.30 Under section 193 of the Extradition Act 2003,
if a state is a party to an international convention to which the UK is also a party, the UK
may designate the state under section 193 and thereby allow extradition to that state. No
designations have been made under section 193 regarding UNCAC. Nevertheless, where an

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

extradition request is received from a state that is not a designated extradition partner and
the person sought is wanted for conduct covered by a convention that the UK has ratified,
the UK will consider whether to enter into a "special extradition arrangement" under section
194. In this manner, the UK may comply with the extradition requirements of UNCAC.

While UNCAC could seemingly be a legal basis for extradition under section 193 of the
Extradition Act 2003, the UK did not indicate whether the necessary designation under this
section was made with respect to State Parties to UNCAC. It was observed that UNCAC has
never served as the basis for an extradition from the UK.

It is nevertheless clear that the UK's extradition framework satisfies the requirements of the
Convention regarding offences subject to extradition and the procedures and requirements
governing extradition. The fact that the UK has criminalized UNCAC offences as
"equivalent conduct offences" would seem to reduce any concerns regarding requirements
for double criminality, one of the primary issues of concern in chapter IV of UNCAC.
Similarly, the UK's willingness and ability to extradite its own nationals was favourably
noted.

While the UK would appear to require the provision of prima facie evidence to enable
extradition to UNCAC partners who would not qualify as Category 1 or Category 2
territories under UK legislation, the UNCAC Review Group indicated that these evidentiary
requirements are applied in a flexible and reasonable manner.

Similarly, the review indicates that the differences between extradition procedures in
Scotland and other parts of the UK are of more technical than substantive significance and
do not affect the review's conclusion that the UK complies with the requirements of the
Convention.31

Canada

In Canada, extradition is provided for under bilateral and multilateral agreements to which
Canada is a party and, in limited circumstances, through a specific agreement under
Canada's Extradition Act.32 Canada has signed 51 bilateral extradition conventions and is also
a party to four multilateral treaties. Canada also accepts UNCAC as the legal basis for
extradition where it does not have an existing agreement in place with a requesting State
Party and has informed the Secretary-General of the UN accordingly. UNCAC has been used
as the legal basis for extradition on a number of occasions.

Dual criminality is a prerequisite to grant extradition, but a flexible, conduct-based test is
applied to this requirement under section 3 of the Extradition Act. In addition, the offence in
relation to which extradition is sought must be subject to a punishment of no less than two
years, meaning that all acts covered by UNCAC (with the exception of illicit enrichment, in

relation to which Canada made a reservation upon ratification of the Convention) are
extraditable offences. Canada permits the extradition of its nationals.

In accordance with Article 44, paragraph 4 of the Convention, none of the offences
established in accordance with UNCAC are considered political offences. Canada also meets
the requirements of Article 44, paragraph 16 of the Convention by not denying extradition
requests for the sole reason that they are based on fiscal matters.

Canada has taken effective steps to simplify the evidentiary requirements and procedures
in relation to extradition proceedings which has resulted in more efficient processing of
extradition cases. Under the Extradition Act, Canada is able to provisionally arrest an
individual in anticipation of a request for extradition.

The Supreme Court of Canada in Lake v Canada (Minister of Justice)33 explained that the
process of extradition from Canada has two stages, a judicial and executive one. As the Court
states:

          The first stage consists of a committal hearing at which a committal judge
          assesses the evidence and determines (1) whether it discloses a prima facie
          case that the alleged conduct constitutes a crime both in the requesting state
          and in Canada and that the crime is the type of crime contemplated in the
          bilateral treaty; and (2) whether it establishes on a balance of probabilities
          that the person before the court is in fact the person whose extradition is
          sought. In addition, s. 25 of the Extradition Act, S.C. 1999, c. 18 (formerly s.
          9(3) of the Extradition Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. E-23), empowers the committal
          judge to grant a remedy for any infringement of the fugitive's Charter rights
          that may occur at the committal stage: Kwok, at para. 57.
          After an individual has been committed for extradition, the Minister
          reviews the case to determine whether the individual should be
          surrendered to the requesting state. This stage of the process has been
          characterized as falling "at the extreme legislative end of the continuum of
          administrative decision-making" and is viewed as being largely political in
          nature: Idziak v. Canada (Minister of Justice), 1992 CanLII 51 (SCC), [1992] 3
          S.C.R. 631, at p. 659. Nevertheless, the Minister's discretion is not absolute.
          It must be exercised in accordance with the restrictions.34

Under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the Extradition Act, those subject to an
extradition request benefit from due process and fair treatment throughout relevant
proceedings. Furthermore, under both existing international agreements and the domestic
provisions of the Extradition Act, Canada is required to refuse an extradition request when

it is based on motives of a discriminatory nature, such as the race, sex, language, religion or
nationality of the person.35

      2.2.9 Special Investigative Techniques

UNCAC

Article 50 (mandatory) requires:

          State Parties employ special investigative techniques in combating
          corruption. These techniques include using controlled delivery (i.e.,
          allowing illicit activity to go forward under surveillance to gather evidence
          for prosecution), electronic surveillance and undercover operations where
          appropriate.

OECD Convention

No mention of investigative techniques.

US

US laws permit controlled deliveries,36 electronic surveillance and undercover operations in
accordance with legal limits and constitutional protections.37 For further discussion, see
Section 4.

UK

The UK has cooperated with foreign law enforcement authorities.

UK laws permit controlled deliveries, electronic surveillance and undercover operations in
accordance with legal limits, which include reliance on the abuse of process doctrine.38 For
further discussion, see Section 4.

3. ENFORCEMENT BODIES

3.1 UNCAC and OECD Provisions

Article 36 of UNCAC, along with other international conventions (e.g., Article 20 of the
Council of Europe Criminal Law Convention on Corruption) requires State Parties to
empower specialized persons or bodies to fight corruption by investigating and prosecuting
corruption offences. Without a standardized institutional blueprint for enforcement bodies,
however, countries vary widely in their structural approaches to enforcement.

Article 36(b) of UNCAC requires State Parties "to grant the body or persons the necessary
independence to carry out its or their functions effectively without undue influence." This
"necessary independence" requirement is vital to effective enforcement, but the term is
vague and not uniformly implemented. The Legislative Guide recommends the creation of
entirely new enforcement bodies independent from existing law enforcement organizations
to satisfy UNCAC's requirements. It also suggests that specializing and enlarging the power
of an existing enforcement organization may be an appropriate course of action depending
on the State Party's particular circumstances.40

Article 5 of the OECD Convention instructs that Parties should not be influenced by their
own economic interests or international strategic concerns when investigating and
prosecuting corruption. The article does not, however, specify the means by which Parties
should achieve such independence.

The lack of specific guidance on how to ensure independence in anti-corruption enforcement
underscores the difficulty of preventing political and economic interests from influencing
investigations and prosecutions. Creating an independent enforcement system is easier said
than done. This is particularly acute in those jurisdictions, such as the US, UK, and Canada
where the roles of minister of justice (a member of the executive) and attorney general (the
top prosecutor) are carried out by the same individual. The extent to which the attorney
general can maintain prosecutorial independence while also serving as a member of the
government is perhaps rightly questioned.41 Whatever structure the enforcement body

takes, it must be sufficiently independent from government to ensure that its decisions to
enforce anti-corruption measures are not compromised by national or international
governmental concerns or, worse, by corrupt government officials.

The OECD publication, Specialised Anti-Corruption Institutions: Review of Models,42 provides a
summary of the criteria for effective enforcement bodies and a good survey of the different
types of enforcement bodies in operation around the world:43

                                                            BEGINNING OF EXCERPT

 Both the United Nations and the Council of Europe anti-corruption conventions establish
 criteria for effective specialized anti-corruption bodies, which include independence,
 specialisation, the need for adequate training and resources [see articles 6 and 36 of
 UNCAC and article 20 of the Council of Europe Criminal Law Convention on Corruption]. In
 practice, many countries face serious challenges in implementing these broad criteria.

        Independence primarily means that the anti-corruption bodies should be
            shielded from undue political interference. Thus, genuine political will to fight
            corruption is the key prerequisite for independence. Such political will must be
            embedded in a comprehensive anti-corruption strategy. The independence level
            can vary according to specific needs and conditions. Experience suggests that it
            is structural and operational autonomy that are important, along with a clear
            legal basis and mandate for a special body, department or unit. This is
            particularly important for law enforcement bodies. Transparent procedures for
            the director's appointment and removal, proper human resources management,
            and internal controls are important elements to prevent undue interference.
            Independence should not amount to a lack of accountability: specialised services
            should adhere to the principles of the rule of law and human rights, submit
            regular performance reports to executive and legislative bodies, and enable
            public access to information on their work. Furthermore, no single body can
            fight corruption alone. Inter-agency co-operation, and co-operation with civil
            society and businesses are important factors to ensure their effective operations.

        Specialisation of anti-corruption bodies implies the availability of specialised
            staff with special skills and a specific mandate for fighting corruption. The
            forms and level of specialisation may differ from country to country, as there is
            no one successful solution that fits all. For instance, the Council of Europe
            Criminal Law Convention on Corruption clarifies the standard for law
            enforcement bodies, which can require the creation of a special body or the
            designation of several specialised persons within existing institutions.
            International trends indicate that in OECD countries, specialisation is often
            ensured at the level of existing public agencies and regular law enforcement
            bodies. Transition, emerging and developing economies often establish separate

          specialised anti-corruption bodies often due to high corruption-levels in existing
          agencies. In addition, these countries often create separate specialised bodies in
          response to pressure from donors and international organisations.

      Adequate resources, effective means and training should be provided to the
          specialised anti-corruption institutions in order to make their operations
          effective. Specialised staff, training and adequate financial and material
          resources are the most important requirements. Concerning specialised law
          enforcement anti-corruption bodies, an important element to properly orient
          them is the delineation of substantive jurisdictions among various institutions.
          Sometimes, it is also useful to limit their jurisdiction to important and high-level
          cases. In addition to specialised skills and a clear mandate, specialised anti-
          corruption bodies must have sufficient powers, such as investigative capacities
          and effective means for gathering evidence. For instance, they must have legal
          powers to carry out covert surveillance, intercept communications, conduct
          undercover investigations, access financial data and information systems,
          monitor financial transactions, freeze bank accounts, and protect witnesses. The
          power to carry out all these functions should be subject to proper checks and
          balances. Teamwork between investigators, prosecutors, and other specialists,
          e.g. financial experts, auditors, information technology specialists, is probably
          the most effective use of resources.

Considering the multitude of anti-corruption institutions worldwide, their various
functions, and performance, it is difficult to identify all main functional and structural
patterns. Any new institution needs to adjust to the specific national context taking into
account the varying cultural, legal and administrative circumstances. Nonetheless,
identifying "good practices" for establishing anti-corruption institutions, as well as trends
and main models is possible. A comparative overview of different models of specialised
institutions fighting corruption can be summarised, according to their main functions, as
follows:

      Multi-purpose anti-corruption agencies. This model represents the most
          prominent example of a single-agency approach based on key pillars of
          repression and prevention of corruption: policy, analysis and technical
          assistance in prevention, public outreach and information, monitoring,
          investigation. Notably, in most cases, prosecution remains a separate function.
          The model is commonly identified with the Hong Kong Independent
          Commission against Corruption and the Singapore Corrupt Practices
          Investigation Bureau. It has inspired the creation of similar agencies on all
          continents. This model can be found in Australia (in New South Wales),
          Botswana, Lithuania, Latvia, Poland, Moldova and Uganda. A number of other
          institutions, for instance, in the Republic of Korea, Thailand, Argentina and
          Ecuador, have adopted elements of the Hong Kong and Singapore models, but
          follow them less rigorously.

      Specialised institutions in fighting corruption through law enforcement. The
          anti-corruption specialisation of law enforcement can be implemented in

                                                                                                        521
GLOBAL CORRUPTION

            detection, investigation or prosecution bodies. This model can also result in
            combining detection, investigation and prosecution of corruption into one law
            enforcement body/unit. This is perhaps the most common model used in OECD
            countries. This model is followed by the Norwegian National Authority for
            Investigation and Prosecution of Economic and Environmental Crime Økokrim,
            the Central Office for the Repression of Corruption in Belgium, the Special
            Prosecutors Office for the Repression of Economic Offences Related to
            Corruption in Spain, but also by the Office for the Prevention and Suppression
            of Corruption and Organised Crime in Croatia, the Romanian National Anti-
            Corruption Directorate, and the Central Prosecutorial Investigation Office in
            Hungary.

 This model could also apply to internal investigation bodies with a narrow jurisdiction to
 detect and investigate corruption within the law enforcement bodies. Good examples of
 such bodies can be found in Germany, the United Kingdom and Albania. For example, in
 the UK, investigation of police corruption is handled by the Independent Police
 Complaints Commission (IPCC).

 ...

 Assessing performance is a challenging task for anti-corruption agencies, and many
 agencies lack the skills, expertise, and resources to develop adequate methodologies and
 monitoring mechanisms. Few agencies have rigorous implementation and monitoring
 mechanisms in place to trace their performance, and to account for their activities to the
 public. At the same time, showing results might often be the crucial factor for an anti-
 corruption institution to gain, or retain public support and fend off politically-motivated
 attacks. The report recommends that anti-corruption agencies develop their monitoring
 and evaluation mechanisms to examine and improve their own performance and to
 improve public accountability and support.

 While many anti-corruption bodies created in the past decade have achieved results and
 gained public trust, the experience in emerging and transition economies shows that
 establishing a dedicated anti-corruption body alone cannot help to reduce corruption. The
 role of other public institutions, including various specialised integrity and control
 bodies, and internal units in various public institutions is increasingly important for
 preventing and detecting corruption in the public sector. This trend converges with the
 approach of many OECD countries where specialised anti-corruption units were
 established in law enforcement agencies, while the task of preventing corruption in the
 public sector and in the private sector was ensured by other public institutions as part of
 their regular work.

      3.1.1 Hong Kong's Independent Commission

Hong Kong provides an instructive blueprint for effective enforcement bodies. Hong Kong's
Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) has achieved laudable independence
and has been extensively copied by countries with systemic corruption problems:

          Inspired by the success story of Hong Kong's anti-corruption commission
          and its three-pronged approach to fighting corruption and also encouraged
          by international conventions, many countries around the world, including
          in Eastern Europe, established specialised bodies to prevent and combat
          corruption. Creating such bodies was often seen as the only way to reduce
          widespread corruption, as existing institutions were considered too weak
          for the task, or were considered to be part of the corruption-problem and
          could therefore, not be part of the solution for addressing it.44

The features of Hong Kong's ICAC are distinctive. As Ian Scott points out:

          Hong Kong's Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) is often
          regarded as a model of the way in which efforts to prevent and control
          corruption should be organized and implemented. Its achievement in
          transforming Hong Kong from a place where corrupt practices were
          accepted to a place in which they are the exception has been widely admired
          and studied.... [T]he ICAC's success is attributed to its distinctive
          characteristics, which may be said to form a syndrome in the sense that each
          of its features is thought to be necessary for the organization to work well.45
          These distinctive characteristics of the ICAC are as follows:

                 A unitary body with sole authority over corruption control rather
                     than multiple anti-corruption organizations operating
                     simultaneously;

                 Independence from the Hong Kong government;

                 Structural divisions that reflect the ICAC's three-pronged
                     approach: Corruption Prevention, Community Relations, and
                     Operations Departments;

                 Wide policing powers including the right of arrest and detention;

years on freedom of expression, pro-democracy activities, and opposition of any kind to Beijing's
policies and plans, has led to a politicalization of the ICAC, which threatens its longstanding
reputation for impartiality and independence from government influence: James Griffiths, "Once the

                     government;

                 Personnel that are not susceptible to corruption;

                 The political will to combat corruption; and

                 Public support and goodwill towards the ICAC (the organization
                     has been voted the most trusted organization in Hong Kong
                     several times).

There has been some debate as to whether the Hong Kong model should be followed widely
or whether the structure of the ICAC works only in the specific cultural context of Hong
Kong. Bertrand de Speville provides an in-depth discussion of the merits of Hong Kong's
ICAC and an answer to critics who view the ICAC model as impractical for other countries.46

      3.1.2 Quebec's UPAC

In 2011, Quebec became the first province in Canada to create a permanent anti-corruption
enforcement agency. UPAC, the Unité permanente anticorruption (Permanent
Anticorruption Unit), consists of staff seconded from six different governmental agencies:
Sûreté du Québec (police); Revenu Québec (tax collection); Ministère des Transports (roads
and infrastructure); Commission de la construction du Québec (responsible for labour
relations in the construction industry); and Ministère des Affaires municipales (municipal
affairs). UPAC started in 2011 with 200 employees and a $31 million budget. By 2016, UPAC
had grown to 320 employees and a budget of $48 million.47 UPAC is headed by the Anti-
Corruption Commissioner, a role created through the provincial Anti-Corruption Act.48

From 2011 to October 2016, UPAC charged 169 individuals and 14 businesses with domestic
criminal corruption offences, resulting so far in 27 individuals convicted. There have also
been penal investigations of regulatory offences leading to charges against 59 individuals
and 45 businesses, resulting thus far in convictions of 13 individuals and 9 businesses. In
addition, UPAC does significant work in the prevention of corruption. It has held 774

sessions on corruption and improper use of public office, which were attended by over
22,000 public office holders and workers.49

As set forth in the Anti-Corruption Act, the "mission of the Commissioner is to ensure, on
behalf of the state, the coordination of actions to prevent and to fight corruption in
contractual matters within the public sector. The Commissioner exercises the functions
conferred on the Commissioner by this Act, with the independence provided for in this
Act."50 The Anti-Corruption Commissioner has a mandate to:

      Coordinate investigations in relation to the Criminal Code, penal and fiscal law;
      Receive, record and examine disclosures of wrongdoings;
      Make recommendations to governmental and public administrators; and
      Play an educative and preventative role in the fight against corruption.51

One of the highest profile cases involving UPAC is the arrest and guilty plea of Gilles
Vaillancourt, mayor of Laval from 1989 to 2012. Vaillancourt was arrested in 2013 as part of
a sweep by UPAC that saw 36 individuals arrested. Following a guilty plea, Brunton J
accepted a joint submission for a 6-year prison sentence and restitution of about $7 million,
much of which was hidden in Swiss bank accounts.52

      3.1.3 Guatemala's External Commission

In creating the International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG) in 2006,
Guatemala became the first country to adopt an external foreign body to help fight
corruption. CICIG was formed out of an agreement between the UN and Guatemala after a
request for support from the Government of Guatemala. The CICIG operated as an
independent body which supported the investigation of serious crimes and strengthened
national judicial institutions in Guatemala.53

Guatemala, as a post-conflict country with a large populace, presented a particularly fertile
ground for corruption. With upwards of 17 million residents, the Republic of Guatemala is
Central America's most populous country. The country endured a civil war from 1960 to
1996 that saw over 200,000 people either killed or "disappeared" at the hands of the
government.54 As Nina Lakhani writes, a "1996 peace deal ended the conflict but not the

criminality. Instead, new groups infiltrated politics, security forces and the criminal justice
system, operating with almost total impunity."55 Approximately 6,000 homicides occur in
Guatemala annually (about twenty times more per capita than in Canada) and corruption
reaches the highest levels of civil servants and elected officials. In 2015, Transparency
International (TI) scored Guatemala 28/100, ranking it 123 of 168 countries based on
perceptions of corruption.56 In 2021, Guatemala received a score of 25/128, and the country
now ranks 150 out of the 180 countries.57

Backed by the UN, CICIG began operating in Guatemala in 2007. During its operations,
CICIG had a staff complement of 150 individuals who had come from about 20 countries
and a budget of $12-15 million per year,58 close to half of which was funded by the US.59
CICIG's mandate was to be extended by the Guatemalan congress every two years. It
worked with the Public Prosecutors Office, National Civil Police, and other state institutions
to combat crimes committed by clandestine security groups and to implement measures
aimed at strengthening the justice system.60 CICIG's enforcement efforts led to the arrests of
hundreds of individuals, including former President Otto Pérez Molina, who resigned from
office in 2015.61

While CICIG's mandate was broader than anti-corruption reform, anti-corruption efforts
had been prioritized by Iván Velásquez Gómez, CICIG's commissioner between 2013 and
2019.62 Velasquez, a former investigating judge of Columbia's Supreme Court, set five
priorities for CICIG: 1) contraband 2) administrative corruption 3) illegal campaign
financing 4) judicial corruption, and 5) drug trafficking and money laundering.63

Despite a rocky start, which included the resignation of two commissioners in its first five
years,64 CICIG experienced a breakthrough through an investigation dubbed "La Linea."
This investigation involved customs officials taking bribes to reduce duties. The case

eventually resulted in a presidential resignation and ignited a social movement. Over the
course of eight months, CICIG and the prosecutor's office investigated a network of senior
state officials who were alleged to have defrauded customs revenues. The investigation
intercepted some 66,000 telephone calls and over 6,000 electronic messages. On April 16,
2015, 21 suspects were arrested.65

On September 1, 2015, following months of protests, Congress voted to remove Molina's
presidential immunity, a measure that passed 132-0.66 The following day, President Molina
resigned as president. Molina was arrested on September 3, 2015.

In the election that followed, Guatemalan voters demonstrated that they would no longer
tolerate corruption in the government. Jimmy Morales, a political outsider and former
television comedian, ran for president with a slogan "Ni corrupto, ni ladrón" (neither corrupt
nor a thief). Morales won the election with 67% of the vote.

Based on these developments, CICIG could be credibly cited as a blueprint for eradicating
established practices of corruption even where corruption had reached the highest echelons
of government. For example, a poll in 2015 found CICIG to be Guatemala's most trusted
institution with 66% positive rating, well beyond the trust of the police (26%), judges (25%),
Congress (12%) and the Presidency (11%).67

The success of CICIG led to calls for similar institutions to be set up in other countries. For
example, the Organization of American States and the government of Honduras signed an
agreement to establish the Support Mission Against Corruption and Impunity in Honduras
(MACCIH), which began operating on April 19, 2016.68 MACCIH has full autonomy and
independence to work with government institutions to dismantle corruption and impunity.
MACCIH's efforts are focused on: 1) prevention and fighting against corruption 2) reform
of criminal justice 3) political-electoral reform, and 4) public security.69

However, in January 2019, President Morales announced that CICIG would be expelled
from Guatemala as a result of "serious violations" of national and international laws. This
was nine months prior to the expiration of CICIG's mandate. Commentators were quick to
suggest that the true motivation of the expulsion was to insulate the President and other
members of the Guatemalan ruling elite from investigations which were already
underway.70 Tensions had arisen between President Morales and Commissioner Velásquez

dating back to early 2017, when prosecutors charged President Morales' brother and son
with fraud. 71

When President Morales' term ended in 2020, he was succeeded by President Alejandro
Giammattei. Giamattei and the Attorney General appointed Juan Francisco Sandoval, an
internationally-recognised anti-corruption advocate, as head of Guatemala's Special
Prosecutors Office Against Impunity (FECI). But in July 2021, Sandoval was summarily fired
after the FECI continued to investigate the country's political and financial elite, including
President Giammettei.72 The firing of Sandoval puts a nail in the coffin of independent
corruption prosecutions in Guatemala for the foreseeable future.

The success of CICIG and, unfortunately, the circumstances of its demise are instructive.
CICIG could continue to do its work only to the extent that the Government of Guatemala
would permit. Where the commission and the government enjoyed a collaborative
relationship, CICIG clearly did effective work. On the other hand, the investigation of
President Morales shows a potential weakness in this structure: if the work of the
commission depends on the strength of its relationship with the government, any
investigation that implicates the head of state could undermine the entire operation.

3.2 Levels of Independence in Enforcement

A problem in many developing countries is not only the relative lack of independence of
enforcement bodies, but a lack of resources and power. Martin Painter argues that
"independence" is overstated as an enforcement body ideal. Independence can be symbolic
and is largely irrelevant if the enforcement body lacks the power to truly enforce anti-
corruption measures.73 "[I]n the matter of investigation," writes Painter, "it is the raw
operational power of the [anti-corruption agency] that seems to matter, as much if not more
than its purported political independence."74

His sentiment appears to be confirmed by the very low rates of corruption in certain
developed countries like Sweden, for example, where enforcement bodies are powerful, but
not independent from government. In 2013, Sweden ranked third on TI's Corruption
Perception Index, though it has no specialized anti-corruption agency. Like the US and
Canada (except Quebec), Sweden's anti-corruption forces are organized as units within the
general police force and prosecution service. Comparing Sweden to under-developed
countries with systemic corruption problems may be a fool's errand given the wide cultural
and economic divide that separates them.75

For anti-corruption enforcement bodies, an organizational framework which gives the
appearance of independence is also no guarantee of effectiveness. Bangladesh is a leading
example. In the executive summary from UNCAC's country review report of Bangladesh,
the expert team of reviewers concluded that the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) in
Bangladesh is sufficiently independent because it is comprised of three commissioners who
are appointed by the President, are not eligible for reappointment and cannot be removed
from their positions unless strict procedures are followed.76 But this "independence" is
superficial at best. In the ACC's investigation of SNC-Lavalin's alleged bribery of
Bangladeshi public officials in the Padma bridge case (discussed in Chapter 1), the
independence of the ACC was seemingly compromised by the self-interest of high-ranking
Bangladeshi politicians.

Bangladesh Minister of Communications Syed Abul Hossain was the most senior public
official allegedly involved in the SNC-Lavalin bribery. Ultimate award of the engineering
contract required his approval and he allegedly stood to gain $2 million as a bribe (4% of the
$50 million contract). In the wake of the bribery allegations, Hossain resigned from his
position in the Prime Minister's cabinet, after which the Prime Minister called him a
"patriot." Subsequently, Hossain was not charged with bribery as a result of the ACC's
investigation. The World Bank convened an external panel of experts to assess the
completeness and fairness of the ACC's initial investigation. While agreeing with the ACC's
decision to investigate the seven persons who were formally charged, the external panel's
final report, issued in February 2013, stated that "there was no legal reason to exclude the
name of the former Minister of Communications from the initial list of persons to be
investigated.... Thus, as of the date of this report, the Panel cannot conclude that the activity
of the ACC constitutes a full and fair investigation."77 In September 2014, the ACC
concluded, however, that no bribery or conspiracy had taken place. It recommended the

acquittal of all seven accused persons in spite of what appears to be very convincing
evidence collected by the World Bank and Canadian investigators.

According to an article in Bangladesh's leading newspaper, The Daily Star, the ACC's
politically-motivated decision not to charge Hossain and their final conclusion that no
bribery had taken place was not surprising. The Daily Star claims these actions just provide
further proof of the enforcement body's lack of independence and effectiveness: "[T]he
ACC's credibility is mired in controversy once again. Its failure to gather evidence in the
Padma bridge case has again proved that the anti-[corruption] watchdog fails to go ahead
with the case against individuals enjoying the blessing of the government higher-ups."78

Some measure of independence from government is necessary at both the investigatory and
prosecutorial stages. For example, it may be counter-productive for an enforcement body
that has complete investigatory independence to submit its findings to a governmental
prosecution agency, especially if the investigation is into the activities of the prosecutors
themselves. In the well-documented corruption case of former Pennsylvania Attorney
General Ernie Preate,79 the Pennsylvania Crime Commission, which investigated Preate, had
independent power to begin investigations, interview witnesses under oath, gather
evidence, and subpoena financial records. They performed a protracted investigation into
Preate despite intense political pressure to refrain from doing so. Eventually, the
Commission gathered enough evidence for an airtight case against Preate, but having no
prosecutorial authority, they were in the awkward position of lobbying the Pennsylvania
Attorney General's office to prosecute the incumbent Attorney General. The Pennsylvania
Attorney General's office did not prosecute, but Preate was eventually prosecuted by the
federal government for racketeering and corruption offences. He was convicted and
sentenced to two year's imprisonment, but not before the Pennsylvania Crime Commission
was disbanded by Preate's political allies in the state legislature.

3.3 Investigative and Prosecutorial Bodies

Unlike Hong Kong with its ICAC, the US, UK, and Canada (except Quebec) do not have
unitary anti-corruption bodies with independence from government and monopolies over
law enforcement. Each of these countries has multiple national agencies working together
to combat domestic and international corruption.

The following descriptions of the US, UK, and Canadian anti-corruption law enforcement
structures are derived from the executive summaries of UNCAC's country review reports,
which form part of the first cycle of the UNCAC review mechanism. The UNCAC review
mechanism is briefly discussed in Chapter 1.

The following excerpt is from the UNCAC Country Review Report of the United States of
America:80

                                                            BEGINNING OF EXCERPT

 Primary responsibility for enforcement aspects of the UNCAC lies with the U.S.
 Department of Justice (DOJ).

 Regarding corruption of domestic officials, DOJ has a dedicated unit within its Criminal
 Division in Washington, D.C., the Public Integrity Section, which specializes in enforcing
 the nation's anti-corruption laws. The promotion and implementation of the prevention
 provisions of [UNCAC] Chapter II are carried out by a number of government entities
 through a variety of systems and programs.

 DOJ's Public Integrity Section was created in 1976 to consolidate into one unit DOJ's
 responsibilities for the prosecution of criminal abuses of the public trust by government
 officials. The Section currently has 29 attorneys working full-time to prosecute selected
 cases involving federal, state, or local officials, and also to provide advice and assistance
 to prosecutors and investigators in the 94 United States Attorneys' Offices around the
 country. The Criminal Division supplements the resources available to the Public
 Integrity Section with attorneys from other sections within the Criminal Division -
 including the Fraud, Organized Crime and Racketeering, Computer Crimes and
 Intellectual Property, and Asset Forfeiture and Money Laundering sections, to name just
 four - and from the 94 U.S. Attorneys Offices.

 The United States federal judicial system is broken into 94 separate districts, 93 of those
 districts are assigned a senior prosecutor (called the United States Attorney, who is an
 official of DOJ) and a staff of prosecutors to enforce federal laws in that district. (One U.S.
 Attorney serves in two districts.) Those offices, in addition to the Public Integrity Section,
 also enforce the United States anti-corruption laws.

 DOJ has also dedicated increased resources to combating domestic public corruption. The
 Federal Bureau of Investigation, for example, currently has 639 agents dedicated to
 investigating public corruption matters, compared to 358 in 2002. Using these resources,
 DOJ aggressively investigates, prosecutes, and punishes corruption of and by public
 officials at all levels of government (including local, state, and national public officials),

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

 in all branches of government (executive, legislative, and judicial), as well as individuals
 from major United States political parties.

 For example, DOJ recently convicted one former Member of Congress of substantial
 public corruption charges, and has indicted a sitting Member of Congress on significant
 corruption and other charges. DOJ also recently convicted two former state governors of
 bribery offences, and conducted a large-scale bribery investigation into the activities of a
 well-known Washington, D.C. lobbyist. To date, that investigation has netted a total of 11
 bribery-related convictions. Those convictions have included a guilty plea by the former
 Deputy Secretary of the Department of the Interior and the jury conviction of a former
 official of the United States General Services Administration, among others.

 Statistically, DOJ has increased its enforcement efforts against public corruption in recent
 years. Over the period from 2003 to 2009 (the most recent period for which data is
 available), the Department charged 8,203 individuals with public corruption offences
 nationwide and obtained 7,149 convictions. In addition, over the five-year period from
 2001 to 2005, the Department charged 5,749 individuals with public corruption offences
 nationwide and obtained 4,846 convictions. Compared with the preceding five year
 period from 1996-2000, the 2001-2005 figures represent an increase of 7.5 percent in the
 number of defendants charged and a 1.5 percent increase in the number of convictions.

 Three governmental agencies have primary responsibility for the prosecution of bribery
 of foreign officials: the DOJ's dedicated foreign bribery unit within the Criminal
 Division's Fraud Section; the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) International Anti-
 Corruption Unit; and the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) dedicated foreign
 bribery unit. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) Unit of the Fraud Section of the
 DOJ Criminal Division handles all criminal prosecutions and for civil proceedings against
 non-issuers, with investigators from the FCPA Squad of the Washington Field Office of
 the FBI. The Fraud Section formed its dedicated unit in 2006 to handle prosecutions,
 opinion releases, interagency policy development, and public education on the foreign
 bribery offense. In total, the Fraud Section has the equivalent of 12-16 attorneys working
 full-time on FCPA matters. The goal is to increase this figure to 25.

 Prosecutors from a local United States Attorney`s Office and the Asset Forfeiture and
 Money Laundering Section often assist in specific cases.

 In 2008, the FBI created the International Corruption Unit (ICU) to oversee the increasing
 number of corruption and fraud investigations emanating overseas. Within the ICU, the
 FBI further created a national FCPA squad in its Washington, D.C. Field Office to
 investigate or to support other FBI units investigating FCPA cases. The United States
 Department of Homeland Security also has a specialized unit dedicated to the
 investigation and prosecution of foreign corruption.

 The SEC Enforcement Division is responsible for civil enforcement of the FCPA with
 respect to issuers of securities traded in the United States. In January 2010, the Division
 created a specialized FCPA unit with approximately 30 attorneys. In addition, the SEC

 has other trained investigative and trial attorneys outside the FCPA Unit who pursue
 additional FCPA cases. The FCPA Unit also has in-house experts, accountants, and other
 resources such as specialized training, state-of-the-art technology and travel budgets to
 meet with foreign regulators and witnesses.

 ...

 Beyond domestic efforts, the United States works internationally to build and strengthen
 the ability of prosecutors around the world to fight corruption through their overseas
 prosecutorial and police training programs. Anti-corruption assistance programs are
 conducted bilaterally and regionally, including at various U.S.-supported International
 Law Enforcement Academies established in Europe, Africa, Asia and the Americas.
 Assistance efforts involve the development of specialized prosecutorial and investigative
 units, anti-corruption task forces, anti-corruption commissions and national strategies,
 internal integrity programs, and specific training on how to investigate and prosecute
 corruption.

 For example, DOJ, in coordination with the Department of State, sends experienced U.S.
 prosecutors and senior law enforcement officials to countries throughout the world to
 provide anti-corruption assistance, both on short term and long term assignments. On a
 long term basis, DOJ has posted Resident Legal Advisors (RLA's) and Senior Law
 Enforcement Advisors (SLEA's) throughout the world to work with partner governments
 on anti-corruption efforts and to assist our partners with building sound and fair justice
 systems and establishing non-corrupt institutions. They provide specialized anti-
 corruption assistance, tailored to partner country needs, including pilot programs on
 asset recovery. They offer expertise on a broad array of anti-corruption measures, such as
 legislative drafting and institutional development, through consultations, workshops,
 seminars and training programs. DOJ's international assistance programs are coordinated
 by the Criminal Division's Office of Overseas Prosecutorial Development, Assistance and
 Training (OPDAT) and International Criminal Training Assistance Program (ICITAP).

                                                                 END OF EXCERPT

In April 2016, the DOJ announced an enhanced FCPA enforcement strategy. Part of the
strategy involved increasing enforcement resources. The Fraud Section of the DOJ increased
its FCPA unit by more than 50% by adding 10 more prosecutors, while the FBI established
three new squads dedicated to FCPA enforcement. The new strategy also emphasized
strengthening coordination with foreign counterparts.81

    b) Law enforcement agencies which play a role in tackling corruption

    87. The Attorney General for England and Wales (with his deputy known as the
    Solicitor General) is the Minister of the Crown responsible in law for superintending
    the main prosecuting authorities, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), headed by the
    Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), and the Serious Fraud Office (SFO), headed by
    its Director (previously also the Revenue and Customs Prosecutions Office, which has
    been merged with the CPS since 1 January 2010). A protocol was published in July
    2009 which sets out the relationship between Attorney General and the Director of
    Public Prosecutions and the Director of the Serious Fraud Office. The Attorney
    General for England and Wales also holds the separate office of Advocate General for
    Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland has its own Attorney General.

    88. In England, Wales and Northern Ireland, prosecutions for offences under the
    main anti-corruption legislation, The Bribery Act 2010, require the personal consent
    of the Director of one of the main prosecuting authorities (The Director of Public
    Prosecutions, the Director of Public Prosecutions for Northern Ireland, the Director of
    the Serious Fraud Office, or the Director of Revenue and Customs Prosecutions). This
    replaced a previous requirement for the consent of the Attorney General.

    89. In Scotland, the head of prosecutions is the Lord Advocate, who supervises
    the work of the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS or Crown Office),
    with the other Law Officer, the Solicitor General. In Scotland, most serious corruption
    cases are handled by the Serious and Organised Crime Division contained within the
    Crown Office. In appropriate cases Crown Office works closely with UK agencies;
    protocols are in place between COPFS and CPS and also between COPFS and SOCA.
    A protocol is also being developed between COPFS and the SFO regarding a number
    of matters. Some orders (e.g. those under the Proceeds of Crime Act) can be enforced
    across the UK. Otherwise a procedure is in place for Scottish warrants to be backed
    by a magistrate in England and Wales before enforcement.

    90. The Public Prosecution Service (PPS) is the principal prosecuting authority in
    Northern Ireland. In addition to taking decisions as to prosecution in cases
    investigated by the police in Northern Ireland, it also considers cases investigated by

other statutory authorities, such as HM Revenue and customs. The PPS is headed by
the Director of Public Prosecutions for Northern Ireland.

91. The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) is responsible for investigating and
prosecuting serious or complex fraud cases, and is the lead agency in England and
Wales for investigating and prosecuting cases of overseas corruption. Approximately
100 investigators work in the SFO's Bribery and Corruption Business Area. This
investigates and prosecutes both domestic and foreign corruption cases. The SFO's
Proceeds of Crime Unit is responsible for the restraint, freezing and confiscation of
assets both in relation to suspected fraud and corruption cases.

92. The UK police service comprises 52 territorial police forces (43 for England
and Wales, eight for Scotland - soon to be reduced to one - and one in Northern
Ireland), along with four special police forces: the Ministry of Defence Police, the
British Transport Police Force, the Civil Nuclear Constabulary, and the Scottish Drug
Enforcement Agency. Police in the Crown Dependencies of Jersey and Guernsey are
members of the UK Police Service, even though they are outside the UK prosecutorial
system. Corruption-related specialised units exist within the Metropolitan Police ("the
Met") and the City of London police (CoLP). The City of London Police, based in
London's financial centre, is the UK's National Lead Police Force for Fraud. In
addition to an Economic Crime Department the CoLP has an Overseas Anti-
Corruption Unit, sponsored by DFID, which, alongside the SFO, handles all UK
international foreign corruption cases. The Metropolitan Police has a Proceeds of
Corruption Unit that investigates foreign Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs)
committing theft of state assets. It also has a Fraud Squad that investigates domestic
corruption in the public sector.

93. The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) was established by
the Police Reform Act 2002 and began work on 1 April 2004. The IPCC deals with
complaints and allegations of misconduct against the police in England and Wales.
The IPCC has a Lead Commissioner for corruption and an Operational Lead for
corruption at Director Level. The Police Complaints Commissioner for Scotland and
the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland are the independent equivalents of the
IPCC in Scotland and Northern Ireland respectively.

94. The Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA) was established by the Serious
Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 (SOCPA). Its functions are set out in that Act
and (in relation to civil recovery functions) in the Serious Crime Act 2007. The
functions are to prevent and detect serious organised crime; to contribute to its
reduction in other ways and the mitigation of its consequences; and to gather, store,
analyse and disseminate information on organised crime. SOCA works in close
collaboration with UK intelligence and law enforcement partners, the private and
third sectors, and equivalent bodies internationally. In Scotland, the SCDEA has a
primary role in preventing and detecting serious organised crime. SOCA houses the
UK's Financial Intelligence Unit (UKFIU). The unit has national responsibility for

                                                                                                      535
GLOBAL CORRUPTION

    receiving analysing and disseminating financial intelligence submitted through the
    Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) regime, and receives over 200,000 SARs a year.
    These are used to help investigate all levels and types of criminal activity, from benefit
    fraud to international drug smuggling, and from human trafficking to terrorist
    financing. SOCA also has an Anti-Corruption Unit which supports UK partners
    (police and/or prosecutors) in tackling corruption that enables organised crime and
    works to increase knowledge of the use of corruption in support of organised crime.
    The unit also tackles corruption directed against SOCA, or public sector corruption
    impacting on SOCA.

    95. The Financial Services Authority (FSA) regulates most of the UK's financial
    services sector. It has a wide range of rule-making, investigatory and enforcement
    powers in order to meet its statutory objectives, which include the reduction of the
    extent to which it is possible for a financial business to be used for a purpose
    connected with financial crime. Financial crime includes fraud and dishonesty,
    money-laundering and corruption.

    96. The FSA does not enforce the Bribery Act. However, authorised firms are
    under a separate, regulatory obligation to identify and assess corruption risk and to
    put in place and maintain policies and processes to mitigate corruption risk. The FSA
    can take regulatory action against firms who fail adequately to address corruption
    risk; for example, the FSA has fined two firms for inadequate anti-corruption systems
    and controls. The FSA does not have to obtain evidence of corruption to take action
    against a firm.

    97. Plans were published in June 2011 which set out in more detail plans to create
    in 2013 a new National Crime Agency (NCA) to enhance the UK law enforcement
    response to serious and organised criminality. The NCA will be UK-wide and will
    respect the devolution of powers to Scotland and Northern Ireland. Building on the
    capabilities of SOCA, the NCA will comprise of distinct operational Commands
    including an `Economic Crime Command' (ECC) dealing with economic crimes
    (defined as including fraud, bribery and corruption). The ECC is planned to provide
    a national strategic and coordinating role with respect to the collective response to
    fraud, bribery and corruption across the UK organisations tackling these areas, which
    includes police forces, SFO, CPS, FSA, the Office of Fair Trading, Department for
    Business, Innovation and Skills, Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs and the
    Department for Work and Pensions. It will also have operational investigative
    capabilities focused on fraud, bribery and corruption linked to the areas of criminality
    which are the focus of the NCA's other Commands organised crime, border policing
    and the child exploitation and online protection centre (CEOP).

    98. There are a number of coordination groups which bring together the different
    agencies working on international corruption issues. The Politically Exposed Persons
    (PEPs) Strategic Group, which meets quarterly, provides a strategic lead and
    coordinates government departments and agencies to tackle money laundering by

536                                                                                             2022

    corrupt PEPs. With the planned creation of the NCA in 2013, a new group was
    established in 2012 to interface between the NCA build on economic crime and the
    DFID-funded cross-agency work on international anti-corruption. This is the
    International Corruption Intervention Group which co- ordinates activity between the
    DFID funded overseas corruption units (the Metropolitan Police Service Proceeds of
    Corruption Unit; the City of London Police Overseas Anti- Corruption Unit and the
    Serious Organised Crime Agency International Corruption Intelligence Cell).

                                                                 END OF EXCERPT

The NCA replaced the SOCA in 2013. Corruption investigations are overseen by the NCA's
Economic Crime Command. Additionally, the City of London Overseas Anti-Corruption
Unit, established in 2006 and funded by the Department for International Development,
investigates corruption and bribery in developing countries.

      3.3.3 Canada

The following extract is from the Executive Summary of the Review of Implementation of the
United Nations Convention against Corruption:

          Specialized services responsible for combating economic crimes and
          corruption have been established in the Royal Canadian Mounted Police
          ("RCMP"). In February 2005, the RCMP appointed a commissioned officer
          to provide functional oversight of all RCMP anti-corruption programmes.
          The corruption of foreign public officials is specifically referenced in the
          RCMP Commercial Crime Program's mandate, which includes major fraud
          cases and corruption offences.
          In 2008, the RCMP established the International Anti-Corruption Unit,
          which comprises two seven-person teams based in Ottawa and Calgary.
          This structure is currently undergoing a reorganization process to make
          available additional resources and expertise in the investigation of
          corruption and other complex cases in the newly established Sensitive
          Investigations Unit. The Unit's mandate will include carrying out
          investigations of the CFPOA of Canada, related criminal offences and
          assisting foreign enforcement agencies or governments with requests for
          international assistance (asset recoveries and extraditions).83

The RCMP also promotes its work by developing educational resources for external
partners, using information pamphlets and posters for distribution and presentation to
Canadian missions abroad, that describe the RCMP's work and the negative effects of
corruption.

                                                                                                          537
GLOBAL CORRUPTION

In 2013, the RCMP disbanded the International Anti-Corruption Units and reorganized their
resources for investigating corruption. The International Anti-Corruption Program is now
managed under the umbrella of the RCMP Federal Policing Criminal Operations (FPCO)
directorate. The FPCO provides subject matter expertise internally and externally to national
and international partners, including other government departments. RCMP investigators
in the National Division (Ottawa) are responsible for investigating offences under the
CFPOA and, as of 2014, the RCMP has the exclusive authority to lay an information (i.e.,
initiate a charge) in respect to CFPOA offences.84

Restricting the burden of investigation and prosecution to the RCMP has the potential to
hamper enforcement capability.85 On the other hand, the RCMP has striven toward an
integrated approach to anti-bribery efforts. The RCMP has established a tip-line partnership
with the Competition Bureau regarding allegations of bid-rigging, bribery, price fixing,
conflict of interest, false invoicing and product switching. RCMP Headquarters also has an
established point of contact within the Department of Justice's International Assistance
Group to ensure priority is given to requests for mutual legal assistance in foreign bribery
matters.86

The Public Prosecution Service of Canada (PPSC) was created in 2006 to discharge the
criminal prosecution mandate of the Attorney General of Canada for all federal criminal
offences, including those under the CFPOA. The PPSC is an independent organization,
reporting to Parliament through the Attorney General. The PPSC has established a subject
matter expert position located in Ottawa for international corruption cases to help ensure a
consistent approach to the prosecution of CFPOA offences.87

Unlike in the US, Canadian securities regulation authorities cannot investigate and
prosecute CFPOA breaches and have not undertaken administrative enforcement
proceedings for foreign corrupt practices.88 Transparency International Canada

recommends that Canada involve provincial securities regulators in CFPOA enforcement in
a similar manner to the US Securities Exchange Commission.89 However, the inherent
institutional challenges are worth noting. Unlike the US, Canada does not have a centralized
securities regulator at the federal level. Securities regulation is managed through separate
regulators for each of the ten provinces and three territories. This may add an extra, though
not insurmountable, obstacle toward engaging Canadian securities commissions in the
enforcement of CFPOA breaches.

3.4 Cooperation Agreements

International cooperation between State Parties and between enforcement bodies is an
integral part of investigating international corruption. The Legislative Guide to UNCAC
summarizes it well:

          Ease of travel from country to country provides serious offenders with a
          way of escaping prosecution and justice. Processes of globalization allow
          offenders to more easily cross borders, physically or virtually, to break up
          transactions and obscure investigative trails, to seek a safe haven for their
          person and to shelter the proceeds of crime. Prevention, investigation,
          prosecution, punishment, recovery and return of illicit gains cannot be
          achieved without effective international cooperation.90

Recognizing this, Article 46 of UNCAC and Article 9 of the OECD Convention require State
Parties to provide Mutual Legal Assistance (MLA) to other State Parties investigating and
prosecuting corruption. See Chapter 5, Section 4 for a more thorough description of MLA.
See also Section 2.2.6, for a discussion of cooperative investigations across borders.

In brief, MLA may take the form of bilateral agreements between states, multilateral
agreements between multiple states, or, in the absence of formal agreements, states can and
do informally provide MLA to each other. Article 46(30) of UNCAC states that:

          States Parties shall consider, as may be necessary, the possibility of
          concluding bilateral or multilateral agreements or arrangements that would
          serve the purposes of, give practical effect to or enhance the provisions of
          this article.

In addition to MLA, which often involves the bureaucratic formalities of state-to-state
communication, Article 48 of UNCAC requires cooperation between State Parties' law
enforcement bodies (i.e., police-to-police). Article 48(2) recommends that the law

89 Transparency International Canada has noted that this lack of availability of conditional sentences
or discharges is problematic for the prosecution of less severe violations of the CFPOA. See

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

enforcement bodies of State Parties enter into direct bilateral or multilateral cooperation
agreements with other State Parties' enforcement bodies to streamline international
corruption investigations and prosecutions.

The International Foreign Bribery Task Force (IFBTF) is an example of a multilateral police-
to-police agreement between enforcement bodies. Australia, Canada, the UK, and the US
signed a memorandum of understanding in May 2013 to create the IFBTF. It was formed to
support the four countries' commitments to mutual legal assistance under the OECD
Convention and UNCAC. Under the terms of the agreement, the Australian Federal Police,
Canadian RCMP, City of London Police's Overseas Anti-Corruption Unit, and the FBI
commit to working collaboratively to strengthen investigations into foreign bribery crimes
by providing an efficient means of sharing knowledge, skills and methodologies, as well as
providing swift assistance to one another.

4. INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL INVESTIGATIONS

For the purposes of this section, it is important to distinguish between internal and external
corruption investigations. External investigations are those performed by public
enforcement bodies into allegations of corruption against individuals and corporations,
while internal investigations are conducted internally by a company's board, management,
or in-house counsel as part of that company's internal compliance program or in response
to reports of corruption within their own company. Internal compliance programs and the
role of the corporate lawyer are discussed at length in Chapter 8. In brief, most large
corporations have internal compliance programs to monitor the legality of their
international business activities and to prevent violations of anti-corruption legislation.

As discussed in Section 6.2.1, evidence of a corporation's strong internal compliance
program (including accounting procedures and controls) can serve as an affirmative defence
to a corruption charge under the UK Bribery Act. In prosecutions under the FCPA, evidence
of a corporation's strong internal compliance program and cooperation with external
investigations is often the basis for declining to charge, entering into a deferred prosecution
agreement or reducing the sentence in cases where bribery convictions are obtained. There
are additional reasons why a company would choose to conduct an internal investigation:

      To gather evidence and prepare a defence or negotiation strategy for
          prosecutions, enforcement actions and/or litigation with shareholders;

      To fulfill management's fiduciary duty to the company's shareholders and
          satisfy shareholder concerns; and

      To assess the effectiveness of internal accounting procedures.

The board may hire outside counsel to conduct or manage the internal investigation. There
is a significant financial cost incurred when a company is subject to a corruption
investigation. As Mike Koehler notes, before settling with a company, enforcement agencies
will ask where else the conduct may have occurred, necessitating a team of lawyers, forensic
accountants and other specialists to travel and investigate around the world. Avon, which

settled with the SEC and DOJ for $135 million, spent $350 million in pre-enforcement
expenses from 2009-2011.91 Insurance carriers have responded with products
covering investigation costs during corruption investigations.92

The following sections briefly discuss sources and methodologies of both internal and
external investigations.

4.1 Internal Sources

      4.1.1 Anonymous Reports

Robust internal compliance programs (discussed more fully in Chapter 9) generally
include a mechanism for receiving anonymous reports from employees or others
about suspected corrupt conduct.

In the US, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which was enacted in response to the highly
publicized accounting scandals at Enron and WorldCom, requires publicly traded
corporations to provide an anonymous channel for whistleblowing employees to
report wrongdoing.93 The Act also prohibits employers from taking adverse retaliatory
action against whistleblowers.94 The FCPA Resource Guide states that "[c]ompanies may
employ, for example, anonymous hotlines or ombudsmen"95 to satisfy the
anonymous reporting mechanism requirement.

The following is an example of an internal investigation that was initiated after
receiving tips from an anonymous source and an employee whistleblower. The excerpt is
from a 2011 Annual Financial Report filed by the Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company with
the SEC:

          In June 2011, an anonymous source reported, through our confidential
          ethics hotline, that our majority-owned joint venture in Kenya may have
          made certain improper payments. In July 2011, an employee of our
          subsidiary in Angola reported that similar improper payments may have
          been made in Angola. Outside counsel and forensic accountants were
          retained to investigate the alleged improper payments in Kenya and

          Corrupt Practices Act. We do not believe that the amount of the payments
          in question in Kenya and Angola, or any revenue or operating income
          related to those payments, are material to our business, results of
          operations, financial condition or liquidity.

          As a result of our review of these matters, we have implemented, and are
          continuing to implement, appropriate remedial measures and have
          voluntarily disclosed the results of our initial investigation to the U.S.
          Department of Justice ("DOJ") and the Securities and Exchange
          Commission ("SEC"), and are cooperating with those agencies in their
          review of these matters. We are unable to predict the outcome of the review
          by the DOJ and SEC.96

In early 2015, the SEC charged Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company with violating the books
and records provisions of the FCPA because of the bribes discussed above.97 Goodyear
neither admitted nor denied the allegations, but agreed to pay more than $16 million to settle
the charges.98 The SEC credited Goodyear for the "company's self-reporting, prompt
remedial acts, and significant cooperation with the SEC's investigation."99 Furthermore,
Goodyear announced that the DOJ had closed their inquiry and would not be charging the
company with any criminal offences.100

      4.1.2 Internal and External Accounting

As discussed in Chapter 2, "books and records" offences are an integral part of anti-
corruption legislation. In order to satisfy the general accounting requirements of anti-
corruption legislation and various other regulatory provisions, such as the provisions of the
US Securities Exchange Act,101 public corporations are obliged to perform regular internal and
external audits and regularly release published accounts of their business performance.
Auditors may discover accounting discrepancies that suggest corruption activity, leading to
an internal investigation.

      4.1.3 Competitor Complaints

Corrupt behaviour often occurs in situations where a company is in direct competition with
other companies and seeks to gain an advantage over them (such as public tendering
processes). Indeed, as discussed in Chapter 1, the OECD Convention is specifically focused
on corrupt behaviour which confers an improper business advantage. Any improper
advantage necessarily disadvantages the company's business competitors. If these
competitors suspect that a company is gaining an advantage through corruption--for
example, that a contract is awarded to a company because it bribed a public official--the
competitors are motivated to report their suspicions to the management of the company or
to the relevant enforcement bodies.

Whether a competitor reports its suspicions to the competing company itself or to law
enforcement depends on factors like the seniority of the employees under suspicion and the
perceived strength of a company's internal compliance program. Interestingly, in Dow
Jones' "Anti-Corruption Survey Results 2014," only 33% of companies surveyed reported
ever having lost business to competitors because of corruption, and this number appears to
be falling.102 While a majority of the companies agreed that bribery should always be
reported, only 13% of companies reported ever having taken action against a corrupt
competitor.

      4.1.4 External Investigation Reports

A company may not realize it is under suspicion for corruption until it learns that an external
enforcement body is conducting an investigation into its actions and the actions of its
employees. Companies learn of external investigations through a variety of sources: media
reports, search warrants, subpoenas, arrest reports, etc. When a company learns that an
external investigation is underway, it should immediately initiate its own internal
investigation, preserve documents, interview witnesses, and generally cooperate with
the external enforcement bodies in order to gain cooperation credit. See Chapters 7 and
8 for more discussion on this point.

      4.1.5 Other Sources

A company may be alerted to the corrupt behaviour of its employees through various other
sources. For example, in the notable FCPA case, US v Kay, the impugned foreign payments
came to the attention of the SEC after Mr. Kay voluntarily revealed this information to
company counsel. The US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit described it in this way:

          In 1999, ARI [Kay's and Murphy's employer] retained a prominent Houston
          law firm to represent it in a civil suit. Preparing for this suit, the lawyers
          asked Kay for background information on ARI's rice business in Haiti. Kay

          volunteered that he had [made or authorized payments to Haitian customs
          officials], explaining that doing so was part of doing business in Haiti. Those
          lawyers informed ARI's directors. The directors self-reported these
          activities to government regulators.

          The SEC launched an investigation into ARI, Murphy, and Kay. Murphy
          and Kay were eventually indicted on twelve counts of violating the FCPA.103

4.2 Internal Investigations by Corporations: Five Basic Steps

As discussed above, corporations are incentivized to fully investigate reports of corruption
against their own officers and employees, and to voluntarily disclose the results of those
investigations to the relevant enforcement authorities. Internal investigations may show that
there was no wrongdoing or that the corporation met the standard of care required for an
affirmative defence to corruption charges under, for example, the UK Bribery Act. At the very
least, evidence of a robust internal investigation and voluntary disclosure weighs in the
company's favour at the sanction stage. Additionally, corporations may be motivated to
internally investigate reports of corruption rather than suffer the hardship and ignominy of
external investigations by the relevant enforcement bodies.

In order to accomplish all of this, an internal investigation must be carried out in a thorough
and logical manner such that external auditors and enforcement bodies will accept the
findings of the internal investigation. In serious cases, it is highly advisable to hire external
counsel known to the enforcement body for high competence and unquestioned integrity to
conduct the internal investigation.

While the exact contours of an internal investigation will be case and company-specific,
Robert Tarun and Peter Tomczak provide an instructive summary of five basic steps for
meeting a standard of thoroughness and precision in an internal investigation, which are
reviewed below.104

      4.2.1 Determine Scope of the Allegation

Understanding the nature and scope of the allegation is vital to engaging in a logical and
adequate investigation. For example, if it is alleged that a regional manager who has
overseen the company's business operations in Southeast Asia for the past five years bribed
a public official in Malaysia, the scope of the investigation should include all the company's
business activities in Southeast Asia for the past five years. Narrowly focusing on recent
activities in Malaysia alone would likely be inadequate to accomplish the company's goal of
discovering all of its corruption-related liabilities. An investigation with inadequate scope
will not be credible to the relevant enforcement bodies and will not garner the same
mitigation of sanctions as a more thorough investigation.

      4.2.2 Develop Facts through Interviews and Document Review

Prompt action is required to preserve documentation and to interview witnesses upon
learning of corruption allegations. When assessing the cooperation of a company, public
enforcement bodies evaluate how promptly and effectively the internal investigation
secured both documentary and electronic evidence.

Forensic accounting firms should be hired to assist in performing thorough searches of
company communications, financial records and public information. Comprehensive email
searches have become standard in the contemporary context and must be thorough to
establish a credible investigation.

      4.2.3 Assess Jurisdictional and Legal Issues

The company must assess suspected corrupt acts in light of the overlapping application of
anti-corruption legislation in different jurisdictions. For example, if the company's activities
fall under concurrent US and UK jurisdiction under the FCPA and the Bribery Act, the
company's legal strategy will be different than if the UK has jurisdiction alone. Legal issues
discussed in Chapters 2 and 3, such as jurisdiction, party liability, corrupt intent, knowledge,
vicarious liability, and defences, will need to be considered in light of the specific legislation
violated by the alleged corrupt activities. Additionally, negotiating settlement agreements
and mitigated sanctions will differ depending on which enforcement bodies have
jurisdiction.

      4.2.4 Report to the Company

Once internal investigators have gathered all possible evidence and considered the
jurisdictional and legal issues, the next step is consulting with the company, whether that be
an individual executive, board of directors or other committee. At this stage, various
decisions must be made, including whether the company will voluntarily disclose
information to the relevant enforcement bodies, terminate the employment of individuals
involved, repudiate business contracts, or attempt to negotiate deferred prosecution or non-
prosecution agreements.

      4.2.5 Recommend and Implement Remedial Measures

The case of German conglomerate Siemens provides a model response for companies who
discover corruption liabilities. A massive multinational company with 400,000 employees
operating in 191 countries, Siemens implemented remedial measures on a grand scale after
it became public that they were involved in widespread and systematic corrupt business
activities. While the penalties imposed on Siemens were enormous (combined penalties of
over $1.6 billion), the SEC and DOJ applauded Siemens for their extensive global
investigation, the overhaul of their internal compliance program and the implementation of
a state of the art anti-corruption compliance program. In order to conduct their investigation,
Siemens retained over 300 lawyers, forensic analysts and others to untangle transactions all

                                                                                                          545
GLOBAL CORRUPTION

over the world, with lawyers and an outside auditor accumulating 1.5 million billable
hours.105 Siemens now employs hundreds of full-time compliance personnel.106

The lesson for all companies, whether they have 10 employees or 400,000, is that the
implementation of thorough and effective remedial measures can assure enforcement bodies
and positively sway public opinion. The final step in any internal investigation should be to
assess what remedial measures should be taken and recommend their implementation to
the company's executives, board of directors, or compliance committee.

4.3 External Sources

Corruption activity which leads to an external investigation may be detected proactively or
reactively. Proactive detection involves undercover investigation, wiretaps, integrity testing
and other forms of intelligence interception gathered by special investigative techniques,
discussed below. Reactive detection, however, is by far the most common origin of external
investigations; enforcement bodies are advised of corruption activity by a credible source
and based on that information, they launch an investigation.

      4.3.1 Voluntary Disclosures

According to Koehler, "voluntary disclosures are the single largest source of corporate FCPA
enforcement actions."107 This reflects the reality that corporations, especially those with
internal compliance programs and various regulatory auditing requirements, are in the best
position to know whether they have committed any corruption offences. Additionally, the
DOJ and the SEC strongly encourage voluntary disclosures and advise corporations that if
they disclose violations and cooperate with enforcement, they may escape prosecution in
some circumstances or their penalties will be significantly less severe.108 According to

105 Siri Schubert & T Christian Miller, "At Siemens, Bribery Was Just a Line Item", The New York Times
(20 December 2008), online:
<http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/21/business/worldbusiness/21siemens.html>.
106 The long list of Siemens' remedial measures is detailed in Tarun & Tomczak, supra note 80 at 557-
560.
107 Koehler, supra note 91 at 173.
108 In the Canadian context, one could ask whether the new owners of Griffiths Energy International
(supra note 22), who voluntarily disclosed bribes in Chad, received any significant reduction in
sentence, compared to Niko Resources (supra note 22), which did not self-disclose. Griffiths Energy
paid $10.35 million (fine) whereas Niko Resources paid nearly $9.5 million (fine and victim
surcharge). Griffiths Energy also spent $5 million on its internal investigation, which it turned over
to the RCMP, saving the RCMP a significant amount of money, whereas Niko Resources cost the
RCMP approximately $1 million in investigation expenses. The major difference in the two cases was
the size of the bribe: $2 million in the Griffiths case compared to $200,000 in the Niko Resources case.
On the other hand, Griffiths Energy implemented a robust anti-corruption policy after the initial
investigation revealed bribery, while Niko Resources did not. Thus, the Court put Niko Resources on
probation for three years and required implementation of an anti-corruption compliance program as
a condition of probation.

                                                    CHAPTER 6 INVESTIGATION & PROSECUTION

Koehler, "in 2012, 50 percent of all corporate FCPA enforcement actions were the result of
voluntary disclosures."109

Despite promises of leniency in the US, the actual benefit to a corporation of voluntarily
disclosing corruption violations is often unclear. Recent studies, cited by Koehler, show no
difference between the fines and penalties levied against disclosing and non-disclosing
companies. Indeed, Tarun and Tomczak write, "the SEC, especially through aggressive
disgorgement of profits, can quickly eviscerate the credit the DOJ has extended to companies
for voluntary disclosure and substantial cooperation in FCPA investigations."110

On the other hand, in 2014, Andrew Ceresney, the Director of the SEC Division of
Enforcement, maintained that cooperation is "always in the company's best interest."111
Ceresney pointed out that the SEC offers incentives such as non-prosecution agreements and
reduced penalties, and is committed to "making sure that people understand there will be
such benefits."112 In cases of "extraordinary cooperation," Ceresney notes that penalties will
be significantly lower. For example, in 2014, Layne Christensen Co. was charged with
making improper payments to African officials, but thanks to self-reporting and
cooperation, its penalty was reduced to 10% of the disgorgement amount, as opposed to the
usual penalty of closer to 100% of the disgorgement amount. Ceresney also warned that the
consequences will be worse and opportunities to gain credit through cooperation will be lost
if a company chooses not to self-report and the SEC subsequently discovers violations
through investigation or whistleblowers. A company's failure to self-report could also
indicate that their compliance program and controls were inadequate.

In the UK, the SFO issued, in 2009, guidance on dealing with foreign corruption.113 The
guidance encouraged UK companies to voluntarily disclose corruption offences with the
promise of more lenient negotiated civil settlements, rather than criminal prosecutions.114
The Balfour Beatty case is a prime example. Balfour Beatty self-reported bribery payments
made to secure engineering and construction contracts as part of a UNESCO project to
rebuild the Alexandria Library in Egypt.115 As a result of the company's voluntary
disclosure, the SFO agreed not to bring criminal charges and required the relatively low

amount of £2.5 million to be returned as a civil recovery.116 The SFO's guidance was updated
in 2012 in response to criticisms that the previous approach had been too "corporate-
friendly," indicating "a return to a more prosecutorial way of running the SFO."117 In a
speech given in 2016, Ben Morgan, the Joint Head of Bribery and Corruption in the UK,
noted that deferred prosecutions cannot be "a cosy deal," but must be sufficiently lenient to
reward self-reporting and cooperation. Morgan also noted that some view a discount of one
third of the fine as an insufficient incentive. Previous deferred prosecution agreements
demonstrate the willingness of UK courts to consider a discount of up to 50% in the right
circumstances, as the court did in the UK's second case involving the use of the new DPA
option.118 In 2020, the SFO published a new chapter in its Operational Handbook on how
Crown Prosecutors implement DPAs.119 While this addition does not represent "dramatic
changes to the SFOs policies and practices regarding consideration and credit available for
self-reporting and co-operation as part of negotiated resolutions ... it does provide
additional clarity."120

      4.3.2 Whistleblowers

UNCAC recognizes the reality that many instances of corruption will never come to light if
witnesses to corrupt activity do not come forward with information. These witnesses face
dangerous repercussions if they blow the whistle and are unlikely to come forward without
adequate resources in place to protect them. Articles 32 and 37 of UNCAC require State
Parties to provide effective protection to witnesses and participants in corruption offences
who are willing to supply information and assistance to enforcement bodies. Article 33 of

                                                    CHAPTER 6 INVESTIGATION & PROSECUTION

UNCAC recommends that State Parties consider extending these same protections to all
persons who report corruption offences.

Recent legislative reforms in the US may result in an increase in the number of corruption
investigations sparked by whistleblowers in the near future. Under section 922 of the Dodd-
Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, if a whistleblower's information
leads to an enforcement action, the whistleblower will be entitled to an award of 10 to 30
percent of any resulting monetary sanctions in excess of $1 million. Pursuant to legislative
reforms that came into force in 2021, the Anti-Money Laundering Act 2020 enhanced the anti-
money laundering whistleblower program. Under the new program, whistleblowers may
obtain an award of up to 30% of all monetary sanctions recovered in enforcement actions
resulting from their tips.121

Meanwhile, in the UK, the Director of the SFO is a prescribed person for the purposes of
whistleblower legislation. From April 1, 2019 to March 31, 2020, the SFO Intelligence
Division reported that it had managed 128 whistleblowing disclosures. Of those, the SFO
took further action in relation to 121 disclosures, including by: delivering a personalised
response to the whistleblower, requesting additional information from the whistleblower,
conducting further enquiries, or making contact with partner law enforcement and
regulatory agencies.122

See Chapter 13 for more on whistleblower laws and policies.

      4.3.3 Competitor Complaints

Competitor complaints may result in external investigations. The Hydro Kleen123 case, which
resulted in the first conviction under Canada's CFPOA, began with a competitor complaint.

Hydro Kleen Systems Inc., a Canadian company, competed with other industrial cleaning
companies, including Innovative Coke Expulsion Inc. (ICE), for contracts in the US and
Canada. The employees of both companies often travelled back and forth across the US-
Canada border with industrial cleaning equipment. To facilitate easy movement of its
employees and equipment across the border, Hydro Kleen paid bribes to a US border guard.
The border guard, on his own initiative, also began to deny ICE employees' admission to
the US on multiple occasions. The border guard also improperly photocopied confidential

2020), online: <https://www.sfo.gov.uk/download/annual-report-on-whistleblowing-disclosures-
2019-20/>. The SFO is required to publish an annual report concerning the number of whistleblowing
disclosures made by workers about their employers. To be included in the report, the disclosure
must be a "qualifying" disclosure. This means: (1) the worker reasonably believes that the
information disclosed is substantially true and relates to, inter alia, a serious fraud, and (2) the
Director of the SFO reasonably believes that in the reasonable belief of the worker the disclosure is
made in the public interest and tends to show, inter alia, a criminal offence.

ICE documents that he had required the employees to present, which he then passed on to
Hydro Kleen. When ICE became aware, the company reported the guard's conduct, and
their suspicions about Hydro Kleen to an Alberta court and received a court order to search
Hydro Kleen's premises for the confidential ICE documents. After the resulting
investigation, Hydro Kleen pled guilty to bribing a public foreign official under the
CFPOA. 124

The Padma Bridge case also provides a possible example of a competitor complaint. As
discussed in Chapter 1, Section 1.2, after the initial bidding process for the Padma River
Bridge project, SNC-Lavalin was reportedly in second position behind the Halcrow Group,
a multinational engineering firm based in the UK, who had submitted a lower and more
competitive bid. Following the alleged bribery conspiracy, however, SNC-Lavalin moved to
first position and was awarded the bridge contract. As financiers of the Padma Bridge
project, the World Bank initiated an investigation into the alleged bribery conspiracy, but it
is easy to imagine that SNC-Lavalin's competitor, the Halcrow Group, was upset by the
cloak and dagger bidding process and reported their suspicions to the World Bank.

      4.3.4 Diplomatic Embassies and Trade Offices

Diplomats and ambassadors are tasked with fostering strong relations with foreign states,
and foreign trade offices are tasked with improving a country's business trade in foreign
countries and protecting the reputation of the country's businesses. The pall of corruption
detracts from the goals of both diplomats and trade officials; as such, they are motivated to
swiftly address corruption concerns regarding their own countries' citizens and businesses,
and report their findings to the proper authorities.

For example, a Canadian diplomat was instrumental to the instigation of an investigation
and the ultimate conviction obtained in R v Niko Resources Ltd under the CFPOA. In the
agreed statement of facts submitted during the Niko Resources case, it came to light that "the
RCMP investigation into Niko Canada began after the Canadian Department of Foreign
Affairs and International Trade (DFAIT) alerted the RCMP on June 20, 2005, to news stories
concerning a possible violation of the Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act by the Niko
family of companies."125 DFAIT was informed of the possible corruption by David Sproule,
Canada's High Commissioner to Bangladesh, after reading a Daily Star article which
reported that Niko had "gifted" a luxury SUV to a Bangladeshi minister. For another
example of involvement of a foreign trade office in a bribery case, see R v Karigar.126

      4.3.5 Cooperative Foreign Enforcement Bodies

bodies often refer investigations or exchange information about corruption activity that lead

to external investigations. For example, in 2007 the DOJ in the US referred their investigation
into Innospec Ltd. to the UK's SFO.127

      4.3.6 Non-Governmental Organizations

Non-governmental organizations like TI are instrumental in reporting corruption activity.128
Beginning in 2003, TI began operating Advocacy and Legal Advice Centres (ALACs) around
the globe to empower witnesses and victims of corruption to fight back. As of the date of
writing, over 270,000 people have contacted ALACs and their reports of corrupt activity
have been passed on to enforcement bodies and recorded by TI in their role as advocates for
change.

4.4 Elements of External Investigation

The following extract from Tony Kwok Man-Wai's "Effective Investigation of Corruption
Cases: The Hong Kong Experience"129 provides a good overview of the elements of a
corruption investigation.130 While Kwok's paper is focused on investigations carried out by
Hong Kong's ICAC, the requisite elements are similar for police investigations of bribery in
other countries.

                                                            BEGINNING OF EXCERPT

    A. Introduction

    The Hong Kong Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) is popularly
    regarded as a successful model in fighting corruption, turning a very corrupt city
    under colonial government into one of the relatively corruption-free places in the
    world. One of the success factors is its three-pronged strategy -- fighting corruption
    through deterrence, prevention and education. All three are important but in my
    view, deterrence is the most important. That is the reason why ICAC devoted over
    70% of its resources into its Operations Department, which is responsible for
    investigating corruption. Nearly all of the major corruption cases I have dealt with
    were committed by people in high authority. For them, they have certainly been
    educated about the evil of corruption, and they may also be subject to certain degrees
    of corruption prevention control. But what inspired them to commit corruption? The
    answer is simply greed, as they would weigh the fortune they could get from
    corruption against the chance of being discovered. If they think that it is a low risk,
    high-return opportunity, they will likely succumb to the temptation. So how can we

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

deter them from being corrupt? The only way is to make them realize that there is a
high risk of being caught. Hence the Mission of the ICAC Operations Department is
-- to make corruption a high-risk crime. To do that, you need a professional and
dedicated investigative force.

B. Difficulties of Investigating Corruption

Corruption is regarded as one of the most difficult crimes to investigate. There is often
no scene of the crime, no fingerprints, no eye-witnesses to follow up. It is by nature a
very secretive crime and can involve just two satisfied parties, so there is no incentive
to divulge the truth. Even if there are witnesses, they are often parties to the
corruption themselves, hence tainted with doubtful credibility when they become
prosecution witnesses in court. The offenders can be equally as professional as the
investigators and know how to cover up their trails of crime. The offenders can also
be very powerful and ruthless in enforcing a code of silence amongst related persons
through intimidation and violence to abort any investigation. In this modern age, the
sophisticated corrupt offenders will make full advantage of the loopholes across
jurisdictions and acquire the assistance of other professionals, such as lawyers,
accountants and computer experts in their clandestine operations and to help them
launder their corrupt proceeds.

C. Corruption and Organized Crime

Corruption rarely exists alone. It is often a tool to facilitate organized crimes. Over the
years, ICAC has investigated a wide range of organized crimes facilitated by
corruption. Law enforcement officers have been arrested and convicted for corruptly
assisting drug traffickers and smugglers of various kinds; bank managers for covering
up money laundering for the organized crime syndicates; hotel and retail staff for
perpetuating credit card fraud. In these cases, we need to investigate not only
corruption, but some very sophisticated organized crime syndicates as well.

D. Prerequisites for an Effective Investigation

Hence, there is an essential need for professionalism in corruption investigations.
There are several prerequisites to an effective corruption investigation:

     a. Independent -- corruption investigations can be politically sensitive and
          embarrassing to the Government. The investigation can only be effective if it
          is truly independent and free from undue interference. This depends very
          much on whether there is a top political will to fight corruption in the
          country, and whether the head of the anti-corruption agency has the moral
          courage to stand against any interference.

     b. Adequate investigative power -- because corruption is so difficult to
          investigate, you need adequate investigative power. The HK ICAC enjoys
          wide investigative power. Apart from the normal police power of search,

552                                                                                          2022
                                           CHAPTER 6 INVESTIGATION & PROSECUTION

     arrest and detention, it has power to check bank accounts, intercept
     telephone communications, require suspects to declare their assets, require
     witnesses to answer questions on oath, restrain properties suspected to be
     derived from corruption, and hold the suspects' travel documents to prevent
     them from fleeing the jurisdiction. Not only is the ICAC empowered to
     investigate corruption offences, both in the Government and private sectors,
     they can investigate all crimes which are connected with corruption. I must
     hasten to add that there is an elaborate system of checks and balances to
     prevent abuse of such wide power.

c. Adequate resources -- investigating corruption can be very time-consuming
     and resource intensive, particularly if the cases cross jurisdictions. In 2007,
     the HK ICAC's annual budget amounted to US$90M, about US$15 per
     capita. You may wish to multiply this figure with your own country's
     population and work out the anti-corruption budget that needs to be given
     to be the equivalent of ours! However, looking at our budget from another
     angle -- it represents only 0.3% of our entire Government budget or 0.05%
     of our Gross Domestic Product (GDP). I think you will agree that such a
     small "premium" is a most worthwhile investment for a clean society.

d. Confidentiality -- it is crucial that all corruption investigations should be
     conducted covertly and confidentially, at least before an arrest is made, so as
     to reduce the opportunities for compromise or interference. On the other
     hand, many targets under investigation may prove to be innocent, and it is
     only fair to preserve their reputation before there is clear evidence of their
     corrupt deeds. Hence in Hong Kong, we have a law prohibiting any one,
     including the media, from disclosing any details of ICAC investigation until
     overt action such as arrests and searches have been taken. The media once
     described this as a "press gag law" but they now come to accept it as the
     right balance between press freedom and effective law enforcement.

e. International mutual assistance -- many corruption cases are now cross-
     jurisdictional and it is important that you can obtain international assistance
     in the areas such as locating witnesses and suspects, money trails,
     surveillance, exchange of intelligence, arrest, search and extradition, and
     even joint investigation and operation.

f. Professionalism -- all the investigators must be properly trained and
     professional in their investigations. The HK ICAC strives to be one of the
     most professional law enforcement agencies in the world. ICAC is one of the
     first agencies in the world to introduce the interview of all suspects under
     video, because professional interview techniques and the need to protect the
     integrity of the interview evidence are crucial in any successful corruption
     prosecution. The investigators must be persons of high integrity. They must
     adhere strictly to the rule of confidentiality, act fairly and justly in the
     discharge of their duties, respect the rights of others, including the suspects

                                                                                                 553
GLOBAL CORRUPTION

               and should never abuse their power. As corruption is so difficult to
               investigate, they need to be vigilant, innovative and prepared to spend long
               hours to complete their investigation. ICAC officers are often proud of their
               sense of mission, and this is the single most important ingredient of success
               of ICAC.

         g. An effective complaint system -- No anti-corruption agency is in a position
               to discover all corrupt dealings in the society by itself. They rely heavily on
               an effective complaint system. The system must be able to encourage quality
               complaints from members of the public or institutions, and at the same time,
               deter frivolous or malicious complaints. It should provide assurance to the
               complainants on the confidentiality of their reports and if necessary, offer
               them protection. Since the strategy is to welcome complaints, customer
               service should be offered, making it convenient to report corruption. A 24-
               hour reporting hotline should be established, and there should be a quick
               response system to deal with any complaints that require prompt action. All
               complaints, as long as there is substance in them, should be investigated,
               irrespective of how minor the corruption allegation. What appears to be
               minor in the eyes of the authority may be very serious in the eyes of the
               general public!

    E. Understanding the Process of Corruption

    It should be helpful to the investigators to understand the normal process of
    corruption, through which the investigators would be able to know where to obtain
    evidence to prove the corruption act. Generally a corrupt transaction may include the
    following steps:

         1. Softening up process -- it is quite unlikely that a government servant would
               be corrupt from his first day in office. It is also unlikely that any potential
               bribe-offerer would approach any government servant to offer bribes
               without building up a good relationship with him first. Thus there is always
               a "softening up process" when the briber-offerer would build up a social
               relationship with the government servant, for example, inviting him to
               dinner and karaoke, etc. Thus the investigator should also attempt to
               discover evidence to prove that the government servant had accepted
               entertainment prior to the actual corrupt transaction.

         2. Soliciting/offering of bribe -- when the time is ripe, the bribe-offerer would
               propose to seek a favour from the government servant and in return offer a
               bribe to him. The investigator should attempt to prove when and where this
               had taken place.

         3. Source of bribe -- when there is agreement for the bribe, the bribe-offerer
               would have to withdraw money for the payment. The investigator should

554                                                                                             2022
                                                CHAPTER 6 INVESTIGATION & PROSECUTION

          attempt to locate the source of funds and whether there was any third
          person who assisted in handling the bribe payment.
     4. Payment of bribe -- The bribe would then be paid. The investigator should
          attempt to find out where, when and how the payment was effected.

     5. Disposal of bribe -- On receipt of the bribe, the receiver would have to
          dispose the cash. The investigator should try to locate how the bribe was
          disposed, either by spending or depositing into a bank account.

     6. Act of abuse of power - To prove a corruption offence, you need to prove
          the corrupt act or the abuse of position, in return for the bribe. The
          investigator needs to identify the documents or other means proving this
          abuse of authority.

The task of the investigator is to collect sufficient evidence to prove the above process.
He needs to prove "when", "where", "who", "what", "how" and "why" on every
incidence, if possible.

However this should not be the end of the investigation. It is rare that corruption is a
single event. A corrupt government servant would likely take bribes on more than
one occasion; a bribe-offerer would likely offer bribes on more than one occasion and
to more than one corrupt official. Hence it is important that the investigator should
seek to look into the bottom of the case, to unearth all the corrupt offenders connected
with the case.

F. Methods to Investigate Corruption

Investigating corruption can broadly be divided into two categories:

1. Investigating past corruption offences
2. Investigating current corruption offences

     1. Investigating Past Offences

The investigation normally commences with a report of corruption and the normal
criminal investigation technique should apply. Much will depend on the information
provided by the informant and from there, the case should be developed to obtain
direct, corroborative and circumstantial evidence. The success of such investigations
relies on the meticulous approach taken by the investigators to ensure that "no stone
is left unturned". Areas of investigation can include detailed checking of the related
bank accounts and company ledgers, obtaining information from various witnesses
and sources to corroborate any meetings or corrupt transaction, etc. At the initial
stage, the investigation should be covert and kept confidential. If there is no evidence
discovered in this stage, the investigation should normally be curtailed and the
suspects should not be interviewed. This would protect the suspects, who are often
public servants, from undue harassment. When there is a reasonable suspicion or

                                                                                                      555
GLOBAL CORRUPTION

    evidence discovered in the covert stage, the investigation can enter its overt stage.
    Action can then be taken to interview the suspects to seek their explanation and if
    appropriate, the suspects' home and office can be searched for further evidence.
    Normally further follow-up investigation is necessary to check the suspects
    explanation or to go through the money trails as a result of evidence found during
    searches. The investigation is usually time-consuming.

         2. Investigating Current Corruption Offences

    Such investigation will enable a greater scope for ingenuity. Apart from the
    conventional methods mentioned above, a proactive strategy should always be
    preferred, with a view to catch the corrupt redhanded. In appropriate cases, with
    proper authorities obtained, surveillance and telephone intercepts can be mounted on
    the suspects and suspicious meetings monitored. A co-operative party can be
    deployed to set up a meeting with a view to entrap the suspects. Undercover
    operation can also be considered to infiltrate into a corruption syndicate. The pre-
    requisites to all these proactive investigation methods are professional training,
    adequate operational support and a comprehensive supervisory system to ensure that
    they are effective and in compliance with the rules of evidence.

    As mentioned above, corruption is always linked and can be syndicated. Every effort
    should be explored to ascertain if the individual offender is prepared to implicate
    other accomplices or the mastermind. In Hong Kong, there is a judicial directive to
    allow a reduction of 2/3 of the sentence of those corrupt offenders who are prepared
    to provide full information to ICAC and to give evidence against the accomplices in
    court. ICAC provides special facilities to enable such "resident informants" to be
    detained in ICAC premises for the purpose of debriefing and protection. This
    "resident informant" system has proved to be very effective in dealing with
    syndicated or high-level corruption.

    G. Investigation Techniques

    To be competent in corruption investigations, an investigator should be professional
    in many investigation techniques and skills. The following are the essential ones:

          Ability to identify and trace persons, companies and properties
          Interview technique
          Document examination
          Financial Investigation
          Conducting a search & arrest operation
          Surveillance and observation
          Acting as undercover agent
          Handling informers

556                                                                                        2022

      Conducting an entrapment operation

H. Professional Investigative Support

In order to ensure a high degree of professionalism, many of the investigation
techniques can be undertaken by a dedicated unit, such as the following:

      Intelligence Section
          - as a central point to collect, collate, analyze and disseminate all
               intelligence and investigation data, otherwise there may be a major
               breakdown in communication and operations.

      Surveillance Section
          - a very important source of evidence and intelligence. Hong Kong ICAC
               has a dedicated surveillance unit of over 120 surveillance agents, and
               they have made significant contributions to the success of a number of
               major cases.

      Technical Services Section
          - provide essential technical support to surveillance and operations.

      Information Technology Section
          - it is important that all investigation data should be managed by
               computer for easy retrieval and proper analysis. In this regard,
               computers can be an extremely useful aid to investigations. On the other
               hand, computers are also a threat. In this modern age, most personal and
               company data are stored in computers. The anti-corruption agency must
               possess the ability to break into these computers seized during searches
               to examine their stored data. Computer forensics is regarded as vital for
               all law enforcement agencies worldwide these days.

I. Financial Investigation Section

The corruption investigations these days often involve sophisticated money trails of
proceeds of corruption, which can go through a web of off-shore companies and bank
accounts, funds, etc. It is necessary to employ professionally qualified investigative
accountants to assist in such investigations and in presenting such evidence in an
acceptable format in court.

      Witness Protection Section
          ICAC has experienced cases where crucial witnesses were compromised,
          with one even murdered, before giving evidence. There should be a
          comprehensive system to protect crucial witnesses, including 24-hour

                                                                                                      557
GLOBAL CORRUPTION

              protection, safe housing, new identity and overseas relocation. Some of these
              measures require legislative backing.

    J. Conclusion and Observation

    In conclusion, the success factors for an effective corruption investigation include:

          An effective complaint system to attract quality corruption reports
          An intelligence system to supplement the complaint system and to provide

               intelligence support to investigations
          Professional & dedicated investigators who need to be particularly effective

               in interviewing techniques and financial investigation
          More use of proactive investigation methods, such as entrapment and

               undercover operations
          Ensure strict confidentiality of corruption investigation, with a good system

               of protection of whistleblowers and key witnesses
          International co-operation

                                                                 END OF EXCERPT

4.5 Investigative Strategy

Charles Monteith, an anti-corruption specialist with working experience at both the
International Centre for Asset Recovery (ICAR) and the SFO, wrote a brief, informative
chapter on the importance of establishing an investigative strategy and plan when dealing
with corruption allegations.131 Monteith points out that planning and strategizing are
instrumental in meeting the unique challenges posed by corruption cases. These challenges
include the overwhelming amounts of data involved in untangling transactions and tracing
assets, dealing with aggressive defence lawyers and a disinterested public, and the time
lapse before corrupt conduct is brought to light. The transnational nature of many
corruption cases creates other challenges and calls for mutual trust, cooperation,
coordination, and information sharing. Careful planning is needed to navigate these features
of cross-border investigations.

The author outlines the key pieces of a successful investigation. As multiple agencies are
often involved in each corruption case, cooperation between agencies is required to set the
stage for the investigation. This means choosing a lead agency, allocating responsibilities
and sharing information. Monteith also stresses the importance of assembling a team of

Monteith & Pedro Gomes Pereira, eds, Emerging Trends in Asset Recovery (Bern: Peter Lang, 2013) at
183.

558                                                                                                 2022
                                                    CHAPTER 6 INVESTIGATION & PROSECUTION

intelligence officers, financial investigators, analysts, and lawyers in order to ensure the right
expertise is available at the right time.

Monteith also recommends that an investigative plan cover the following key components.
First, the plan must take into account the features of the corrupt activity, such as where,
when, by whom, and how corruption occurs. Second, a strategy is needed to meet the
evidential requirements for proving the offence. Agencies must determine how to turn
intelligence into admissible evidence and how to fill gaps in the evidence.

Third, investigating authorities must develop a plan for the implementation of investigative
powers and techniques in order to avoid improper use of those techniques. A plan also
assists investigators in sifting through vast amounts of evidence, focusing the investigation,
and reaching the goal of connecting assets to corrupt conduct. This part of the plan should
cover how an agency will use open access intelligence, human intelligence, and financial
intelligence, as well as searches and seizures, compulsory requests for information,
compulsory interviews, arrest and interview, and covert actions. The strategy should
address how investigators will circumvent the weaknesses, pitfalls, and timing issues
involved with these tools. A strategy for ensuring the success of MLA requests for
information is also important, along with a plan for coordinating cross-border surprise raids.

Fourth, the investigating agency should plan out media communications to promote public
confidence. Investigating agencies should stress that proper gathering of evidence takes
time, since the public might have unrealistic expectations surrounding the time frame of an
investigation. Finally, Monteith recommends that the investigative plan be evaluated and
adapted throughout the investigation to reflect new evidence.

4.6 Investigative Techniques

As Kwok's paper notes, detecting corruption and gathering evidence of corruption can be
both difficult and time-consuming.132 Effective enforcement has many elements, two of
which are well-trained and well-funded investigators who have the investigative powers
essential to the task. However, the bestowing of investigative powers on investigators must
be subject to checks and balances in respect to all persons' fundamental privacy interests.
For that reason, in common law countries like the US, UK, and Canada, investigative
techniques which involve a significant invasion into a person's reasonable expectation of
privacy of person or property normally require a judicial warrant--i.e., prior approval for
the search or interception granted by an independent judicial officer who finds there are
reasonable grounds to believe evidence of corruption will be found by the search or
interception. Without reasonable grounds, searches and interceptions are generally illegal.
While the laws on electronic interception, monitoring, and search and seizure vary in the

132 Kwok, supra note 129 at 52.

                                                                                                          559
GLOBAL CORRUPTION

US,133 UK,134 and Canada,135 each country authorizes such techniques subject to significant
checks and balances. Electronic surveillance generally includes eavesdropping,
wiretapping, and intercepting communications from cell-phones (both oral and text
messages), emails, and postal services.136

      4.6.1 International Provisions

                     UNCAC

Article 50 states:

          1. In order to combat corruption effectively, each State Party shall, to the
          extent permitted by the basic principles of its domestic legal system and in
          accordance with the conditions prescribed by its domestic law, take such
          measures as may be necessary, within its means, to allow for the
          appropriate use by its competent authorities of controlled delivery and,
          where it deems appropriate, other special investigative techniques such as
          electronic or other forms of surveillance and undercover operations, within
          its territory, and to allow for the admissibility in court of evidence derived
          therefrom.

         ...

          4. Decisions to use controlled delivery at the international level may, with
          the consent of the States Parties concerned, include methods such as
          interception and allowing the goods or funds to continue intact or to be
          removed or replaced in whole or in part.

The investigative techniques mentioned in Article 50--controlled delivery, electronic or
other forms of surveillance and undercover operations--are legally authorized in the US,
UK, and Canada, subject to legal restrictions which balance the individual's right to privacy
and the state's interest in law enforcement.

      4.6.2 Controlled Deliveries

Controlled deliveries are a common technique in the investigation of offences such as
possession of illegal drugs or stolen goods, and, though less likely, could be used to
investigate ongoing bribery. Controlled deliveries involve investigation during the
commission of a crime rather than afterward. For example, the police may believe that A is
in possession of drugs, stolen goods or proceeds of crime and that A is going to deliver those
goods to B, the kingpin or higher official of the organized activity. Rather than arrest A, the
police will follow A to the delivery point in order to discover the identity of B and facilitate
the arrest of both A and B. Controlled deliveries are lawful in the US,137 UK,138 and Canada.139
They raise no special concerns.

      4.6.3 Integrity Testing versus Entrapment

While Article 50 of UNCAC does not specifically mention integrity testing (also referred to
as "virtue testing"), the United Nations Handbook on Practical Anti-Corruption Measures for
Prosecutors and Investigations (UN Handbook)140 promotes integrity testing as an "extremely
effective ... investigative tool as well as ... an excellent deterrent."141 Moreover, the UN
Handbook encourages the use of random integrity testing and targeted integrity tests based
on suspicion.142 For example, integrity testing has been used very effectively by the New
York Police Department to detect internal corruption143 and in the UK to detect the presence
of issues (not amounting to criminal offences) in private institutions.144 Integrity testing,
especially when coupled with video surveillance, can be very intrusive and is therefore
generally subject to the rules of entrapment (discussed below), as well as criminal procedure
and human rights legislation.145 In some countries integrity testing is illegal unless there is
reasonable suspicion that the persons being tested are violating a particular law.146

146 For example, in Canada this would be considered an abuse of process and a violation of the
section 8 right to privacy under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. See also Section 4.6.3.3. In
the UK, it is not clear whether virtue or integrity testing a person without reasonable suspicion (i.e.,
"randomly") amounts to unlawful entrapment: see Simester et al, Simester and Sullivan's Criminal

                                                                                                          561
GLOBAL CORRUPTION

A distinction is drawn in some legal systems between integrity testing and entrapment. In
short, integrity testing is the presenting (usually by an undercover police officer or agent) of
an opportunity to commit a crime, for example by asking a person "would you like to buy
some marijuana" or "would you like to pay me a bribe to avoid my arresting you for
speeding." Entrapment goes beyond offering an opportunity to commit a crime and involves
active persuasion and inducement to commit the crime. An important distinction is whether
the integrity testing is based on "reasonable suspicion" or whether it is entirely "random."

                     US

There is no unified approach to the defense of entrapment in the US.147 Instead, there are
two major approaches: (a) a subjective approach and (b) an objective approach.148 Federal
courts149 and a majority of state courts follow the subjective approach, also called the
Sherman-Sorrells doctrine.150 This approach has a two-step test: (1) was the offense induced
by a government agent; and (2) was the defendant predisposed to commit the type of offense
charged?151 There are a variety of factors taken into account during this test.152 The focus of
the Sherman-Sorrells doctrine is on the propensity of the defendant to commit the offense
rather than the officer's actions.153

The objective approach, also known as the Roberts-Frankfurter154 approach, is followed by
a few state courts.155 This approach uses a test which focuses on the conduct of the
government agent and determines if the offense was induced by the agent "employing
methods of persuasion or inducement, which create a substantial risk that such an offense
will be committed by persons other than those who are ready to commit it."156 When the test
is being applied it is necessary to consider the surrounding circumstances.157 These two
approaches differ in procedure, including whether a judge or jury considers the issue.158
Under both approaches a finding of entrapment will normally lead to an acquittal, but no
defense is available for offenses of bodily harm.159

There is also debate in the US about whether entrapment should be considered an excuse
(leading to an acquittal) or a non-exculpatory defense.160 In two cases, the courts
acknowledged that a finding of entrapment may sometimes be used as a due process (non-
exculpatory) defense leading to a stay of proceedings.161 As a result, LaFave suggests that "a
`reasonable suspicion' prerequisite may ... emerge as an aspect of the due process limits
upon encouragement activity" to curb over-involvement by the government.162

                     UK

The House of Lords has traditionally affirmed that there is no substantive defence of
entrapment available in English law.163 Instead, a finding of entrapment could lead to
exclusion of evidence or result in a reduced sentence on the basis that the entrapment
constituted an abuse of process.164 However, in response to a European Court of Human
Rights decision,165 the House of Lords in R v Loosely and Attorney General's Reference (No 3 of
2000)166 concluded that when a defendant has been entrapped to an extent that the continued
prosecution of a crime "amounts to an affront to the public conscience," the appropriate
remedy for that abuse of process is a stay of proceedings.167 This holding acknowledges in
effect a non-exculpatory defence of entrapment.168

When determining whether entrapment has occurred the court considers multiple factors,
including whether the investigation was undertaken in good faith.169 If the investigation was
based on reasonable suspicion of an individual, group of individuals or a specific location,
the court will likely find the investigation was undertaken in good faith.170 The good faith
criterion has the effect of curbing the use of random virtue integrity testing based on
speculation, as these types of investigations may lead to a stay of proceedings for abuse of
process.171

The test described in R v Loosely applies to all covert investigations.172 As stated by Nicholls
et al., investigators must investigate, not create, the offence.173 Investigators therefore must
be cautious when deploying undercover agents and participating sources or when

conducting intelligence-led integrity testing, which responds to intelligence that a target is
or may be committing crime.174

                     Canada

In Canada, entrapment is a non-exculpatory defence and a finding of entrapment will result
in a stay of proceedings for abuse of process.175 Under Canadian law, entrapment can occur
in two situations: (a) "the authorities provide a person with an opportunity to commit an
offence without acting on a reasonable suspicion that this person is already engaged in a
criminal activity or pursuant to a bona fide inquiry, [or,] (b) although having such a
reasonable suspicion or acting in the course of a bona fide inquiry, they go beyond providing
an opportunity and induce the commission of an offence."176

In regard to (a), the Supreme Court of Canada has created a threshold of reasonable
suspicion or bona fide inquiries before random virtue testing is lawful.177 Random virtue
testing involves law enforcement officers approaching individuals randomly (i.e., without
reasonable suspicion that an individual is already engaged in a particular criminal activity)
and presenting them with the opportunity to commit a particular crime. The Supreme Court
of Canada held that random virtue testing is an improper use of police power.178 However,
the Court has also acknowledged an exception. Under this exception, law enforcement
officials may present any individual with an opportunity to commit a particular offence
during a bona fide inquiry into a sufficiently defined location if it is reasonably suspected that
criminal activity is occurring in that location.179

In regard to (b), the Court has outlined relevant factors for consideration when determining
whether the police have gone beyond providing an opportunity and instead induced the
commission of an offence.180 Courts will objectively assess the conduct of the police and their
agents rather than assessing the effect of the police conduct on the accused's state of mind.181

The biggest challenge to the application of the entrapment test in recent years has arisen in
the buying and selling of drugs using cell-phones, referred to as dial-a-dope cases. The SCC

considered these type of cases in R v Ahmad182 and R v Li.183 A majority of the Court (5-4)
reaffirmed the two-part entrapment defence set out in R v Mack184 and R v Barnes,185 and then
proceeded to examine and further explain the first branch of entrapment (i.e., virtue or
integrity testing) in the context of the various forms of dial-a-dope operations.

While entrapment normally involves undercover police operations, some undercover
operations cannot constitute entrapment because they are used to detect past crimes, not
induce future crimes. In Canada, the most controversial form of this covert police activity is
the "Mr. Big Operation."186

      4.6.4 Obtaining Financial Reports

Corruption investigations usually involve obtaining and analyzing financial records. How
do law enforcement investigators obtain access to the relevant financial records?

                     US

The majority of FCPA investigations involve voluntary disclosure and cooperation by the
company under investigation. In those cases, relevant financial documents are handed over
to the DOJ or SEC investigators voluntarily. As noted in Chapter 5, banks and other financial
institutions are required to report suspicious money transactions. These reports, and other
forms of information, will frequently provide the probable grounds or probable cause
required to get a warrant to search and seize financial records in respect to suspected
offenses of corruption or bribery. In the US, grand jury investigations are common and
financial records can be obtained by the issuance of subpoenas duces tecum, although
subpoenaed documents are subject to attorney-client privilege, particularly if the subpoena
is directed to the target of the grand jury investigation.

Where the official actions involve civil enforcement of SEC anti-bribery and books and
records violations, a "formal order of investigation" can be issued privately by the SEC
which carries with it a subpoena power for financial records.187

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

                     UK

In addition to the general police power to apply to a court for a search and seizure warrant,
section 2 of the Criminal Justice Act 1987 grants power to the Director of the SFO to compel
disclosures orally and in writing of information and documents relevant to an SFO
investigation. There are limits on the use that can be made of statements obtained from the
person under investigation and certain information is protected by solicitor-client privilege.
The SFO disclosure orders are frequently directed to banks, accountants or other
professional consultants and can override duties of confidence, but are only enforceable
against UK institutions and persons.188 The Act also creates offences and sanctions for those
who refuse to comply with an order to disclose information.189

                     Canada

Domestic corruption offences are enforced by the relevant municipal or provincial police
agencies. Enforcement of foreign bribery offences under CFPOA is conducted by special
units within the RCMP. Unlike the Director's power in the SFO to order disclosure of
relevant financial orders, no similar power exists for the RCMP or for municipal or
provincial police. Instead, the police must obtain search warrants from a court in order to
obtain financial records, unless of course the person or company under investigation is fully
cooperating with the police. For example, in R v Griffiths Energy International, the company,
under a new board of directors, voluntarily reported the company's acts of corruption and
handed over to the RCMP the results of their extensive internal investigation.190 On the other
hand, in the SNC-Lavalin investigation and subsequent charges related to corruption in
Libya and Tunisia, the RCMP executed a search warrant on SNC-Lavalin headquarters in
Montreal in April 2012.

      4.6.5 Forensic Accountants

Detection and proof of corruption normally requires careful analysis of financial records and
related communications. Forensic accountants are a necessity in such circumstances and are
an integral part of the investigation team. Their evidence will frequently be the foundation
of corruption charges and prosecution.

In The Law of Fraud and the Forensic Investigator, David Debenham asserts that
"[u]nderstanding the rules of evidence is a critical part of the forensic accountants' skill
set."191 Potentially relevant evidence should always be brought forward, unless it is covered
by privilege, to ensure the investigation has access to all pertinent documents. Debenham
suggests that even potentially illegally-obtained evidence can be brought forward,
particularly in civil proceedings. Often relevant evidence is left out due to
misunderstandings about the law of evidence and too easily assumed privilege.192 Where

                                                    CHAPTER 6 INVESTIGATION & PROSECUTION

privilege is asserted, possibly in an attempt to veil wrongdoing, forensic accountants must
be well informed on the legal rules of evidence in order to navigate the situation.

Forensic accountants should also be attentive to conflicts of interest. If a forensic accountant
has accepted a retainer to investigate financial statements of a client, a conflict of interest can
arise if they discover evidence of criminal activity. If the conflict involves a former client or
if the accountant is acting as a corporate auditor, the accountant's fiduciary duties may
prevent them from disclosing confidential information to persons other than their client.

5. DISPOSITIONS RESULTING FROM INVESTIGATIONS

When warranted by the evidence collected in a corruption investigation, individuals and/or
organizations involved in alleged corrupt conduct can be subject to a range of civil and
criminal procedures and sanctions. The state's choice to proceed with civil and/or criminal
procedures is dependent on a large number of factors and also varies from country to
country.

If a person or organization is charged with a criminal offence of bribery or corruption in
common law countries like the US, UK, or Canada, they have the choice to plead guilty to
the charges or to plead not guilty, in which case the prosecutor will have to prove their guilt
beyond a reasonable doubt in a trial before a judge alone, or a judge and jury. If the accused
persons plead guilty or are found guilty at their trial, the judge will then sentence the
offenders (e.g., impose a term of imprisonment, probation, suspended sentence, fine and/or
a forfeiture order). In addition, there may be other consequences that flow from a conviction.
The consequences can include restrictions on global travel, loss of civil privileges to drive,
vote, hold public office, act as a lawyer or a broker, etc. or debarment from the right to bid
for government or NGO projects.

The investigation and uncovering of corrupt behaviour will not always result in the laying
of criminal charges. In some cases, the evidence may not be strong enough to establish
"proof beyond a reasonable doubt." In some countries, only individuals, not organizations,
may be charged and tried for a crime. In these countries, UNCAC requires that the
organization be subject to civil or administrative liability for corruption. Even in countries
like the US, UK, and Canada, which allow organizations to be charged and convicted
criminally, the relevant authorities may decide not to pursue criminal charges and instead
pursue the individuals and/or organizations involved in corrupt actions through civil and
administrative proceedings and remedies.

5.1 Criminal Options and Procedures

Pursuing corruption through the criminal process involves three components:

          (1) Charging policies and the choice of charges;

                                                                                                          567
GLOBAL CORRUPTION

          (2) Guilty plea negotiations, settlement agreements or prosecution by
                trial; and

          (3) Sentencing an offender after a guilty plea or after a conviction at trial.

5.2 Civil Options and Procedures

Civil procedures may be undertaken as an alternative to criminal charges or as a supplement
to criminal charges. These civil procedures may include:

          (1) Civil forfeiture proceedings (freezing, seizing and recovery of illegally
                obtained assets);

          (2) Civil or administrative penalties (usually fines and/or suspension of
                licenses to operate); and

          (3) Civil actions for damages, contractual restitution or disgorgement of
                profits.

5.3 Comparative Data on Remedies for Foreign Bribery

The summary of data in Figure 6.1 is based on 427 foreign bribery convictions and sanctions
imposed on 263 individuals and 164 collective entities.193

      As of 2014, 427 cases in OECD countries involving punishment of foreign bribery
          were reported to the OECD. Figure 6.1 reflects how foreign bribery was punished
          and includes data from cases where several types of sanctions were imposed.

      The chart includes data on compensation for victims, civil damages, and state costs
          related to the case. The proceeds of compensation were either paid to NGOs
          designated by law or as restitution to the government of the country where the
          bribery took place.

      Article 3(3) of the OECD Convention requires confiscation of the instrument of the
          bribe and its proceeds (or property of an equivalent value). Thus, the number of
          cases involving confiscation should be high. The low percentage of confiscation in
          these statistics may be explained by situations in which the proceeds of foreign
          bribery are confiscated from companies while individuals face fines and a prison
          or suspended sentence.

      The data also shows very low numbers of debarment despite the 2009 OECD
          Recommendation for further Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in
          International Business Transactions, which encouraged debarment of enterprises
          which have been proven to have bribed foreign public officials in contravention of
          international law. However, European Union Member Countries are required to

It is important to note that 69% of sanctions were imposed through settlement procedures,
while 31% were imposed through convictions.

Not listed in Figure 6.1 are the substantial costs of foreign bribery enforcement actions that
either cannot be quantified in monetary terms or do not constitute official sanctions, such as:

           Reputational damage and loss of trust by employees, clients, and
                consumers;

           Legal fees;
           Monitorships; and
           Remedial action within the company.

Figure 6.2 illustrates the monetary sanctions imposed as a percentage of profits obtained. It
is based on 37 foreign bribery cases occurring between February 15, 1999 and June 1, 2014.

      For 37 cases out of the 261 involving fines, data was available to determine the
          distribution of total sanctions imposed as a percentage of the profits gained from
          payment of the bribe. In 46% of these cases, the monetary sanction was less than
          50% of the proceeds obtained by the defendant as a result of bribing foreign public
          officials.

      In 41% of the cases, monetary sanctions ranged from 100% to more than 200% of
          the proceeds of the corrupt transaction. The majority of these cases were
          concluded in the United States where the value of the financial sanction against a
          company involved in a foreign bribery transaction almost always includes
          confiscation (or disgorgement) of the proceeds of the foreign bribery offence.

      The highest amount in combined monetary sanctions imposed in a single case
          totals approximately EUR 1.8 billion; while the highest combined prison sentence
          imposed in a single case for conspiracy to commit foreign bribery is 13 years.

6. CHARGING POLICIES

All prosecuting bodies have technical standards and procedures that must be followed in
entering criminal charges or launching civil enforcement actions. Examples of these
standards are discussed in this section. Notwithstanding these formal guidelines, the
decision to prosecute invariably requires the prosecutor to be satisfied there is a reasonable
likelihood that the defendant can be convicted, and the public interest will be served by
prosecution.

6.1 US

As described in Section 3.3.1, the US has two enforcement bodies tasked with prosecuting
FCPA offenses: (i) the DOJ, which is solely responsible for criminal prosecutions and civil
proceedings against non-public issuers; and (ii) the SEC, which is responsible for civil

195 Ibid at 28.                                                                      2022

                                                    CHAPTER 6 INVESTIGATION & PROSECUTION

enforcement actions against public issuers (corporations that are publicly traded on a US
stock exchange or otherwise required to file securities documents with the SEC), as well as
the agents and employees of public issuers.

The jurisdiction of the DOJ and SEC necessarily overlap in a large number of cases.
According to Koehler, it is common for the DOJ and SEC to simultaneously prosecute the
same FCPA offenses and to coordinate the announcement and resolution of their
enforcement actions on the same day.196 The DOJ and SEC may also coordinate with other
jurisdictions and announce settlements on the same day. Companies and individuals being
investigated for FCPA violations must be cognizant of the coordinated power of the DOJ
and SEC and may negotiate with the two bodies accordingly. For example, a corporation
willing to accept a hefty settlement with the SEC involving disgorgement of profits may be
able to negotiate more lenient treatment by the DOJ in the criminal proceedings. The DOJ
and SEC may also offset sanctions in light of fines received in foreign jurisdictions.

Koehler is critical of FCPA enforcement in the US and believes it is heavily in need of reform.
Because of the expense of defending against FCPA enforcement actions and the negative
effect the process can have on a company's public image, Koehler believes many companies
are motivated to accept resolution agreements (discussed below) with the DOJ and SEC even
when the case against them is not strong:

          In short, the net effect of the above DOJ and SEC enforcement policies, and
          the `carrots' and `sticks' embedded in them, is often to induce business
          organizations subject to FCPA scrutiny to resolve enforcement actions for
          reasons of risk aversion and not necessarily because the enforcement
          agencies have a superior legal position. Business organizations are further
          motivated to resolve FCPA enforcement actions, including those based on
          aggressive enforcement theories, because the DOJ resolution vehicles
          typically do not result in any actual prosecuted charges against the
          company and the SEC resolution vehicles typically used traditionally have
          not required the company admit the allegations.197

      6.1.1 DOJ

The DOJ has jurisdiction to prosecute and pursue criminal convictions. In determining
whether and how to resolve an FCPA matter, DOJ prosecutors are guided by the Principles
of Federal Prosecution,198 in the case of individuals, and the Principles of Federal Prosecution of

The Principles of Federal Prosecution are set out in the US Attorney's Manual at chapter 9-
27.000. These principles guide DOJ prosecutors in making the core decisions within their
jurisdiction--commencing or declining prosecution, selecting charges, and plea bargaining.
In deciding whether to initiate a prosecution, DOJ prosecutors are directed by the following
general principle:

          A. The attorney for the government should commence or recommend
                federal prosecution if he/she believes that the person's conduct
                constitutes a federal offense, that the admissible evidence will probably
                be sufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction, and that a substantial
                federal interest would be served by the prosecution, unless, in [their]
                judgment, prosecution should be declined because:

                     1. The person is subject to effective prosecution in another
                           jurisdiction; or

                     2. There exists an adequate non-criminal alternative to
                           prosecution.201

As this principle makes clear, the prosecutor's belief that the person's conduct constitutes a
federal offense and that the admissible evidence will probably be sufficient to obtain a
conviction is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for commencing prosecution.

The prosecution must also serve a "substantial federal interest." To determine whether a
substantial federal interest exists, the prosecutor is advised to weigh all relevant
considerations, including: the nature and seriousness of the offense; the deterrent effect of
prosecution; the person's culpability in connection with the offense; the person's history
with respect to criminal activity; the person's willingness to cooperate in the investigation
or prosecution of others; and the probable sentence or other consequences if the person is
convicted.202

                                                    CHAPTER 6 INVESTIGATION & PROSECUTION

The Principles of Federal Prosecution of Business Organizations (Principles of Federal Prosecution)
are codified in US Attorney's Manual at chapter 9-28.000.203 These principles guide the
prosecution of corporate crime. Generally, DOJ prosecutors apply the same factors in
determining whether to charge a corporation as they do with respect to individuals.
However, several additional factors require consideration. These principles are:

      the nature and seriousness of the offense, including the risk of harm to the
          public;

      the pervasiveness of wrongdoing within the corporation, including the
          complicity in, or the condoning of, the wrongdoing by corporate management;

      the corporation's history of similar misconduct, including prior criminal, civil,
          and regulatory enforcement actions against it;

      the corporation's willingness to cooperate with the government's
          investigation, including as to potential wrongdoing by the corporation's
          agents;

      the adequacy and effectiveness of the corporation's compliance program at the
          time of the offense, as well as at the time of a charging or resolution decision;

      the corporation's timely and voluntary disclosure of wrongdoing;

      the corporation's remedial actions, including any efforts to implement an
          adequate and effective corporate compliance program or to improve an
          existing one, to replace responsible management, to discipline or terminate
          wrongdoers, or to pay restitution;

      collateral consequences, including whether there is disproportionate harm to
          shareholders, pension holders, employees, and others not proven personally
          culpable, as well as impact on the public arising from the prosecution;

      the adequacy of remedies such as civil or regulatory enforcement actions,
          including remedies resulting from the corporation's cooperation with relevant
          government agencies; and

      the adequacy of the prosecution of individuals responsible for the
          corporation's malfeasance.

Several factors compel the DOJ prosecutor to consider the corporation's pre-indictment
conduct, e.g., cooperation, voluntary disclosure of wrongdoing, and remediation or
restitution.204 Cooperation is defined broadly as helping the DOJ ascertain the identity of
corrupt actors and providing the DOJ with disclosure of relevant facts and evidence.205

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

However, according to Koehler, the history of DOJ enforcement shows that even raising
legal arguments and disputing the DOJ's enforcement theory is classified as "not
cooperating" and can lead to the DOJ bringing criminal charges.206

The Principles of Federal Prosecution also govern the use of alternatives to criminal charges.
The use of these alternatives is seen as a desirable middle ground between declining
prosecution and pursuing criminal charges. Evaluating the factors described above, DOJ
prosecutors may conclude that they have insufficient evidence to obtain a conviction or that
the public interest would not be best served by prosecuting the alleged offender. In such
cases, the DOJ prosecutor may choose to pursue an alternative to criminal charges as
opposed to declining prosecution altogether.

                     Defense Counsel Submissions ("White Papers")

DOJ prosecutors can only pursue a prosecution if the evidence against the accused would
"probably be sufficient" to obtain a conviction and a "substantial federal interest" would be
served. It follows that if defense counsel can present compelling reasons why the case
against their client will not succeed, they stand an excellent chance of preventing charges
from ever being brought or pursued.

In the US, most reasonable federal prosecutors share their theories and view of a case's
evidence at the conclusion of a corruption investigation and give defense counsel the
opportunity to make oral or written presentations detailing the reasons why charges should
not be brought, or why the charges should be reduced to lesser ones.

There are no formal guidelines for these defense counsel presentations, commonly called
"white papers" or position papers, but defense counsel generally use the factors outlined in
the Principles of Federal Prosecution to argue that their clients should not be charged.

White papers are presented in the context of settlement offers and negotiations, so they are
privileged documents under the rules of evidence. If a prosecutor proceeds with criminal
charges after defense counsel has submitted a white paper, the contents of the paper are
inadmissible as evidence against the defendant at trial.

      6.1.2 SEC

The SEC Division of Enforcement's Enforcement Manual outlines various policies and
procedures for the investigation of potential violations of US securities laws.207 The
Enforcement Manual also sets forth the guiding principles that SEC staff will consider when
determining whether to open or close an investigation and whether civil charges are
warranted.

207 US Securities and Exchange Commission Division of Enforcement, Enforcement Manual, (28 Nov
2017) [SEC Enforcement Manual], online (pdf):

574                                                                                             2022
                                                    CHAPTER 6 INVESTIGATION & PROSECUTION

SEC staff may become aware of potential FCPA violations in a variety of ways including:
complaints from the public; tips from whistleblowers, public sources such as media reports;
and referrals from other government agencies or self-regulatory organizations. The SEC also
uses more proactive investigative techniques. In 2020, the SEC announced its first
enforcement actions arising out of the Division of Enforcement's EPS Initiative, which
"utilizes risk-based data analytics to uncover potential accounting and disclosure violations
caused by, among other things, earnings management practices."208

The threshold determination for opening a new investigation is low because the purpose of
an investigation is to gather additional facts to help evaluate whether an investigation would
be an "appropriate use of resources." In determining whether to open an investigation, SEC
staff will consider several factors, including: the statutes or rules potentially violated; the
egregiousness of the potential violation; the potential magnitude of the violation; whether
the potentially harmed group is particularly vulnerable or at risk; whether the conduct is
ongoing; whether the conduct can be investigated efficiently and within the statute of
limitations period; and whether other authorities, including federal or state agencies or
regulators, might be better suited to investigate the conduct. SEC staff may also consider
whether the case involves a possibly widespread industry practice that should be addressed,
whether the case involves a recidivist, and whether the matter gives SEC an opportunity to
be visible in a community that might not otherwise be familiar with SEC or the protections
afforded by the securities laws.209

                     Defense Counsel Submissions ("Wells Submission")

When the SEC contemplates bringing an enforcement action against a respondent, they send
a "Wells Notice" to the respondent informing them of the substance of the charges that the
SEC intends to bring. This notice affords the respondent the opportunity to submit a written
statement presenting facts and legal arguments to convince the SEC not to bring any action.
Much like white papers in criminal cases, these written statements are called "Wells
Submissions" in SEC cases (named after the chair of a committee that recommended the
implementation of "Wells Notices" in SEC enforcement actions).

Prior to recommending the commencement of proceedings against a defendant, the SEC
investigative staff will hear the Wells Submissions. These submissions may address factual
issues, reliability of evidence and the appropriateness of the injunctive relief sought by the
SEC. Unlike white papers, Wells Submissions are not protected by settlement privilege and
they can be used as evidence against a defendant in subsequent proceedings. Counsel must
be very careful in what information they include in their Wells Submission.

      6.1.3 Alternatives to Criminal Charges

As alternatives to criminal conviction, the DOJ and SEC may pursue other resolution
agreements referred to above, which include: (i) Non-Prosecution Agreements (NPA); (ii)
Deferred Prosecution Agreements (DPA); and (iii) SEC "neither admit nor deny"
settlements. These resolution vehicles are discussed below.

(i) NPAs

An NPA is a private agreement between the DOJ and the alleged offender agreeing to a
certain set of facts and legal conclusions. In essence, an NPA is a contract where both sides
provide consideration: the DOJ agrees not to prosecute the alleged offender for its alleged
offenses and allows the company to continue doing business in the international
marketplace, while the alleged offender agrees to certain terms, including implementing
compliance undertakings and paying the equivalent of criminal or civil fines and penalties.
Under the NPA, the DOJ maintains the right to file charges but refrains from doing so to
allow the company to demonstrate its good conduct during the term of the NPA. Thus, if
the alleged offender breaches the NPA, the DOJ may file charges.

An NPA is not filed with a court but is instead maintained by the parties. Typically, NPAs
are not made public. However, where an NPA is with a company for FCPA-related offenses,
the agreement is made publicly available through the DOJ's website.

(ii) DPAs

A DPA is a written agreement between the DOJ and an alleged offender. Unlike NPAs, DPAs
are filed with a court; thus on their face, they are similar to plea agreements. DPAs contain
facts and legal conclusions agreed to by both parties and the alleged offender promises to
fulfill compliance requirements and pay criminal penalties. In an NPA, the DOJ agrees not
to prosecute the alleged offender if the terms of the agreement are satisfied. In a DPA, the
DOJ agrees to defer prosecution of the alleged offender for a stipulated period of time. If the
terms of the agreement are fulfilled, the DOJ agrees to drop all charges. A DPA allows a
person or company to avoid a formal guilty plea and will signal resolution of the matter to
important audiences such as lenders, investors, and customers.210

Criticism of NPAs and DPAs

Those, like Koehler, who are critical of the dominant use of NPAs and DPAs, point to their
lack of transparency.211 Negotiations for the agreements are privately held behind closed
doors and NPAs are not filed with any court. In addition, most NPAs and DPAs include
"muzzle clauses" preventing companies from commenting publicly on DOJ investigations,
the circumstances of the alleged offenses, or the subsequent NPAs. The consequences for
violating a muzzle clause can be severe.

210 Tarun & Tomczak, supra note 80 at 253.  2022
211 Koehler, supra note 91 at 64-66.

                                                    CHAPTER 6 INVESTIGATION & PROSECUTION

In 2012, a financial institution named Standard Chartered agreed with the DOJ to enter into
a DPA with a standard muzzle clause and a criminal penalty of $230 million.212 A few
months later during an earnings call with investors, Standard Chartered's chairman made
benign comments about clerical mistakes that the company had made which led to its
criminal penalty. Upon hearing of the comments, DOJ prosecutors demanded a transcript
of the conference call and threatened to bring criminal charges if the company's chairman
did not make a full, public retraction of the comments.213

Koehler summarizes his critical view of the imbalanced power dynamic involved in NPA
and DPA negotiations as follows:

           The DOJ can use its leverage and the "carrots" and "sticks" it possesses
                to induce business organizations under scrutiny to resolve an
                enforcement action and pay a criminal fine.

           The DOJ can use an NPA or DPA to insulate its version of facts and
                enforcement theories from judicial scrutiny.

           In the resolution agreement, the DOJ can include a "muzzle clause"
                prohibiting anyone associated with the company from making any
                statement inconsistent with the DOJ's version of the facts or its
                enforcement theories.

           If the DOJ believes, in its sole discretion, that a public statement has
                been made contradicting its version of the facts of its enforcement
                theories, the DOJ can "pounce" and threaten to bring actual criminal
                charges. 214

On the other hand, some commentators criticize DPAs for allowing companies that are "too
big to fail" to escape criminal liability. District Judge Jed S. Rakoff is highly critical of the
increasing tendency to prosecute companies instead of individuals, and of the "too big to
fail" mentality, which implies that the rich can escape criminal prosecution. On the subject
of prosecution of companies and DPAs, Rakoff states:

          Although it is supposedly justified because it prevents future crimes, I
          suggest that the future deterrent value of successfully prosecuting
          individuals far outweighs the prophylactic benefits of imposing internal
          compliance measures that are often little more than window-dressing. Just
          going after the company is also both technically and morally suspect. It is
          technically suspect because, under the law, you should not indict or
          threaten to indict a company unless you can prove beyond a reasonable
          doubt that some managerial agent of the company committed the alleged
          crime; and if you can prove that, why not indict the manager? And from a
          moral standpoint, punishing a company and its many innocent employees

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

          and shareholders for the crimes committed by some unprosecuted
          individuals seems contrary to elementary notions of moral responsibility.215

(iii) SEC "Neither Admit nor Deny" Settlements

According to Koehler, the typical vehicle for resolution of an SEC FCPA enforcement action
is the "neither admit nor deny" settlement where a corporation agrees to pay civil penalties
and institute compliance controls without admitting or denying any of the SEC's
allegations.216

While the SEC announced in 2010 that it approved the use of NPAs and DPAs in civil
enforcement actions, the use of such agreements is rare--and, according to the Enforcement
Manual, they are restricted to very limited circumstances.217 By 2014, NPAs and DPAs had
only been used to resolve two SEC FCPA enforcement actions,218 although Koehler expects
to see greater use of these resolution vehicles in the future.219 In 2016, the SEC announced
two NPAs connected to bribes paid to Chinese officials by foreign subsidiaries of American
companies.220

Critics of "neither admit nor deny" resolution methods argue that these settlements are used
merely to make the settling of cases more expedient. An alleged offender who disputes the
facts and the SEC's enforcement theory will often be motivated to settle with the SEC just to
make the case go away. Thus, many companies who dispute any wrongdoing are forced to
pay civil penalties. On the other hand, corporations who know they have engaged in
egregious conduct can resolve the matter without publicly admitting any wrongdoing.

In view of this criticism, the SEC amended its "neither admit nor deny" settlements policy
in 2012, announcing "that the settlement language would not be included in SEC
enforcement actions involving parallel: (i) criminal convictions; or (ii) NPAs or DPAs that
include admissions or acknowledgements of criminal conduct."221 In 2013, the SEC
announced that alleged offenders would not be able to enter into settlement agreements
without admitting wrongdoing in certain cases where the alleged misconduct harmed large
numbers of investors, was particularly egregious, or where the alleged offender obstructed
the SEC's investigative process.222

      6.1.4 SEC Policy on Cooperation

In determining whether to credit a company for self-policing, self-reporting, and/or
cooperation, the SEC is guided by the 2001 SEC Statement on the Relationship of Cooperation to
Agency Enforcement Decisions, often called the Seaboard Report.223 The Seaboard Report applies
to all SEC matters, as well as FCPA offenses, and outlines 13 criteria the SEC will consider.224
The Seaboard Report also identifies four broad measures of a company's cooperation
including:

     1. Self-policing prior to the discovery of the misconduct, including establishing
          effective compliance procedures and an appropriate tone at the top;

     2. Self-reporting of misconduct when it is discovered, including conducting a
          thorough review of the nature, extent, origins and consequences of the
          misconduct, and promptly, completely and effectively disclosing the misconduct
          to the public, to regulatory agencies and to self-regulatory organizations;

     3. Remediation, including dismissing or appropriately disciplining wrongdoers,
          modifying and improving internal controls and procedures to prevent recurrence
          of the misconduct, and appropriately compensating those adversely affected; and

     4. Cooperation with law enforcement authorities, including providing the
          Commission staff with all information relevant to the underlying violations and
          the company's remedial efforts.225

The 13 criteria do not limit the SEC, nor do they guarantee that the SEC will not follow
through with an enforcement action--even if a company has satisfied all of the criteria.226

In January 2010, the Seaboard Report was supplemented and strengthened by a series of
measures including the 2010 SEC Policy Statement Concerning Cooperation by Individuals in Its
Investigation and Related Enforcement Actions.227 These 2010 measures were designed to clarify
the incentives for individuals and companies who provide early assistance in SEC
investigations. Furthermore, the 2010 measures formally recognized cooperation tools
available in SEC enforcement matters including cooperation agreements, deferred

prosecution agreements, and non-prosecution agreements.228 Finally, the 2010 policy on
individual cooperation delineated four criteria the SEC will consider when determining
whether and how much to credit cooperation by an individual, including:

          1. The assistance provided by the cooperating individual;
          2. The importance of the underlying matter;
          3. The societal interest holding the individual accountable; and
          4. The risk profile of the cooperating individual.229

These criteria are similar to the 13 criteria in the Seaboard Report for evaluation of company
cooperation by the SEC.230

An employee of a company may wish to cooperate with the SEC and provide information;
however, Tarun and Tomczak recommend that defense counsel "seek [an immunity request
from the SEC] before a client makes a statement of cooperation."231 If an individual can
provide testimony and/or facilitate cooperation that will significantly assist in the
investigation, the SEC may arrange for an immunity order to protect that individual against
criminal prosecution.232

                     Declination

The FCPA Corporate Enforcement Policy (CEP) provides that, when a company has voluntarily
self-disclosed misconduct in an FCPA matter, fully cooperated, and timely and

appropriately remediated, there will be a presumption that the DOJ will decline prosecution
absent aggravating circumstances.233

Aggravating circumstances which may warrant a criminal resolution include, inter alia,
involvement by executive management of the company in the misconduct; a significant
profit to the company from the misconduct; pervasiveness of the misconduct within the
company; and criminal recidivism.234 However, even where aggravating circumstances
exist, the DOJ may still decline prosecution, as it did in several cases in which senior
management engaged in the bribery scheme.235

The CEP also provides for limited credit in certain circumstances:

      For instance, if a criminal resolution is warranted for a company that has
          nevertheless voluntarily self-disclosed, fully cooperated, and timely and
          appropriately remediated, the DOJ:

                o will accord, or recommend to a sentencing court, a 50% reduction off the
                     low end of the Guidelines fine range (except in the case of a criminal
                     recidivist); and

                o generally will not require appointment of a monitor if a company has
                     implemented an effective compliance program.

      If a company does not voluntarily self-disclosure, but nevertheless fully
          cooperates, and timely and appropriately remediates, the company will receive, or
          the DOJ will recommend to a sentencing court, up to a 25% reduction off the low
          end of the Guidelines fine range.

The CEP also recognizes the potential benefits of corporate mergers and acquisitions,
particularly when the acquiring entity has a robust compliance program in place and
implements that program as quickly as practicable at the merged or acquired entity.
Accordingly, where a company undertakes a merger or acquisition, uncovers misconduct
by the merged or acquired entity through thorough and timely due diligence or, in
appropriate instances, through post-acquisition audits or compliance integration efforts, and
voluntarily self-discloses the misconduct and otherwise takes action consistent with the
CEP, there will be a presumption of a declination in accordance with and subject to the other
requirements of the CEP. In appropriate cases, an acquiring company that discloses

misconduct may be eligible for a declination, even if aggravating circumstances existed as
to the acquired entity.

Declinations "awarded" under the CEP are made public.236 A declination is awarded
pursuant to the CEP if it would have been prosecuted or criminally resolved except for the
company's voluntary disclosure, full cooperation, remediation or restitution, etc.

For example, in 2012 the DOJ charged Garth Peterson, the former managing director for
Morgan Stanley's Real Estate Group in China, with conspiring to evade internal accounting
controls. However, neither the DOJ nor the SEC charged Morgan Stanley.237 Tarun and
Tomczak assert there were multiple reasons why the DOJ and SEC may elect to decline
charging a company: the company was the victim of a rogue employee; the company
provides repeated ethics training; the bribe was small; an internal investigation followed the
discovery of the problem; remedial action including discipline was taken; the company had
strong internal controls in place; or the company voluntarily disclosed the misconduct and
fully cooperated with the investigation.238

      6.1.6 Patterns in FCPA Enforcement

As discussed in Section 1, the investigation and prosecution of corrupt behaviour can be
compromised by strategic state interests. When substantial criminal and civil penalties are
in play at the level of prosecution, outside interests can bring intense pressure not to
prosecute or engage in enforcement proceedings against defendants. Provisions like Article
36 of UNCAC and Article 5 of the OECD Convention address this by mandating that
enforcement bodies should be created with the necessary independence to remain
uninfluenced by State Parties' other interests.

But is it possible to actually achieve this kind of independence? It is trite to say that law
enforcement does not occur in a vacuum, free from all context. In "Cross-National Patterns
in FCPA Enforcement," Nicholas McLean undertakes an empirical analysis of US
enforcement actions under the FCPA.239 Using enforcement data over a ten-year period
(2001-2011), McLean investigates four possible determinants for decreased or increased
enforcement in cases involving foreign officials: i) corruption levels in the foreign country
ii) level of US foreign direct investment (FDI) in the foreign country iii) level of international
cooperation between the US and the foreign country, and iv) US foreign policy interests.
Each of the variables was subject to equivocal hypotheses. On one hand, one might expect
to see more FCPA cases involving countries with high levels of recorded corruption. It seems
logical that in countries where corruption is a common part of doing business, more FCPA
violations will occur. However, if a country has a reputation for widespread corruption, the

consequent increased risk of incurring criminal liability by doing business in that country
could produce a chilling effect on US business there, leaving fewer FCPA cases involving
that country.

Similarly, it seems likely that in countries where US FDI is higher and more business
transactions are occurring, there is a greater chance that US companies will become ensnared
in FCPA violations leading to prosecutions. However, more US FDI in a country also means
that the domestic economic interests of the US are more tied to that country. This kind of
state interest can have a suppressive effect on prosecutions if there is a lack of prosecutorial
independence because the state does not want corruption prosecutions to hurt its domestic
economy.

Due to the challenging cross-border nature of global corruption investigations and the fact
that prosecutors generally do not try cases that they cannot win, it seems likely that more
cases would be brought where US authorities were able to gather evidence via international
cooperation. This would lead to a higher number of FCPA cases involving countries with
which the US has effective international cooperation agreements. Of course, if there is
greater cooperation between the two countries, the US may be more likely to allow the
cooperating country's prosecutors to try the case under its own anti-corruption legislation.

Finally, one might expect there to be less FCPA cases involving countries with close strategic
ties to the US, and more FCPA cases involving countries with no strategic importance to the
US or with which the US has hostile relations. This would be the worst case scenario,
showing that US foreign policy interests lead to selective prosecution of corruption offenses.

Interestingly, McLean's conclusions suggest that FCPA cases are not unduly influenced by
other US policy interests. Increased FCPA enforcement occurs involving countries with
higher levels of corruption, increased US FDI and greater international cooperation with the
US. However, there is no variation in FCPA enforcement associated with US foreign policy
interests.

The SFO is an independent government department in the UK which only prosecutes the
most serious or complex cases of fraud.240 The SFO is a specialist prosecuting authority
which is unique in the UK insofar as it both investigates and prosecutes its cases.241 The
Criminal Justice Act 1987 established the SFO and its primary investigative tools.242

The work of the SFO is guided by a series of policies and protocols, including:243

     1. The Code for Crown Prosecutors;244
     2. Attorney General's Guidance on Plea Discussions in Cases of Serious or Complex

          Fraud; 245

As with any criminal case, the SFO begins by applying The Code for Crown Prosecutors when
deciding whether to prosecute. The Code for Crown Prosecutors prescribes a two-stage test for
charging an offender (the "Code Test"). The first stage--the "evidential stage"--requires
there to be sufficient evidence for the prosecutor to consider there is a "realistic prospect of
conviction."251 The second stage--the "public interest stage"--requires a weighing of public
interest factors for and against a prosecution.252

                                                    CHAPTER 6 INVESTIGATION & PROSECUTION

The Code for Crown Prosecutors sets out the following considerations which will be relevant
to the assessment of the public interest:

           How serious is the offence committed?253
           What is the level of culpability of the suspect?254
           What are the circumstances of and the harm caused to the victim?255
           What was the suspect's age and maturity at the time of the offence?256
           What is the impact on the community?257
           Is prosecution a proportionate response?258
           Do sources of information require protecting?259

Several of these factors will be salient to the prosecution of corporate wrongdoers,
principally the seriousness of the offence. As Peter Alldridge points out, there is arguably
"an inherent public interest in bribery being prosecuted in order to give practical effect to
Parliament's criminalization of such behaviour."260 Bribery is a serious offence, as evidenced
by the maximum sentence of ten years' imprisonment.

However, other factors (e.g., the suspect's age and maturity at the time of the offence) may
be less salient to corporate bodies. Therefore, further direction is supplied by the Guidance
on Corporate Prosecution:

     Additional factors in favour of prosecution

     a. A history of similar conduct ...

     b. The conduct alleged is part of the established business practices of the company;
     c. The offence was committed at a time when the company had an ineffective
     corporate compliance programme;

     d. The company had been previously subject to warning, sanctions or criminal
     charges and had nonetheless failed to take adequate action to prevent future
     unlawful conduct, or had continued to engage in the conduct;

     e. Failure to report wrongdoing within reasonable time of the offending coming to
     light; (the prosecutor will also need to consider whether it is appropriate to charge
     the company officers responsible for the failures/ breaches);

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

     f. Failure to report properly and fully the true extent of the wrongdoing.261

     Additional public interest factors against prosecution

     a. A genuinely proactive approach adopted by the corporate management team
     when the offending is brought to their notice, involving self-reporting and
     remedial actions, including the compensation of victims ...

     b. A lack of a history of similar conduct involving prior criminal, civil and
     regulatory enforcement actions against the company ...

     c. The existence of a genuinely proactive and effective corporate compliance
     programme;

     d. The availability of civil or regulatory remedies that are likely to be effective and
     more proportionate ...

     e. The offending represents isolated actions by individuals, for example by a rogue
     director.

     f. The offending is not recent in nature, and the company in its current form is
     effectively a different body to that which committed the offences ...

     g. A conviction is likely to have adverse consequences for the company under
     European Law, always bearing in mind the seriousness of the offence and any
     other relevant public interest factors ...

     h. The company is in the process of being wound up.262

According to Monteith, the SFO's general approach is that "ethical businesses running into
difficulties"263 will not face prosecution, whereas companies that continually engage in
corruption and see corruption as a means of getting ahead are likely to be prosecuted.
Aggravating and mitigating factors, such as whether there was a breach of position of trust,
will also be considered before proceeding with a prosecution.264 Finally, prosecutors must
be careful not to consider national economic interests while making the decision to charge,
as this would be contrary to Article 4 of the OECD Convention.265

See Chapter 2, Section 4 for more considerations when determining whether to prosecute
facilitation payments.

The Director of Public Prosecutions or the Director of the SFO must also give personal
consent for prosecutions under the Bribery Act.266

      6.2.2 Plea Agreements

Compared with the US, formal negotiated plea agreements are a relatively recent concept in
the UK. Since 2009, the Attorney General's Guidelines on Plea Discussions in Cases of Serious or
Complex Fraud have enabled plea agreements between prosecutors and potential defendants
prior to charge, whether following self-reporting or an SFO investigation (as in the case of
BAE). In criminal cases, plea agreements allow the defendant and the prosecutor to agree on
an admission of facts and an appropriate sentence or penalty.

However, a judge makes the final sentencing decision. Judicial discretion in sentencing is a
key component of judicial independence in the UK. The judge's role is not simply to "rubber
stamp" settlements.267 This is forcefully summarized by the trial judge in R v Innospec.268

Innospec Ltd., a UK subsidiary of a US firm, pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiracy to
corrupt and agreed to pay a fine. Its parent, Innospec Inc., entered into a global settlement
with the SFO and DOJ, pursuant to which it agreed to pay a fine. Lord Justice Thomas (later
Lord Chief Justice) reluctantly approved,269 but he was highly critical of the process under
which the settlement was concluded. He specifically rejected the notion that the director of
the SFO could enter into an agreement with an offender as to sanction:

          The court was faced with an agreement made between the DOJ, the SEC,
          the OFAC and SFO as to the division of the sum these bodies had considered
          Innospec was able to pay. This was not a matter that received judicial
          determination in either the UK or the US (save that inherent in the Federal
          District Court's approval of the plea agreement). As it is the position in both
          the US and the UK that it is for the court ultimately to determine the
          sanction to be imposed for the criminal conduct, an agreement between
          prosecutors as to the division, even if it had been within the power of the
          Director of the SFO (which as I have explained it was not), cannot be in
          accordance with basic constitutional principles ...

          ...

          I have concluded that the Director of the SFO had no power to enter into the
          arrangements made and no such arrangements should be made again.270

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

The agreed-upon statement of facts in a plea agreement can also constrain a judge in
sentencing, since the charges are limited by those facts. For example, in the BAE case, bribery
was clearly at play, but the admission of facts allowed only for accounting charges.271 The
court warned that in extreme situations, charges might be too inappropriate for a judge to
allow the case to proceed. The court also criticized the fact that the wording of the SFO press
release formed part of the plea agreement with BAE.272

The Stolen Asset Recovery Initiative (StAR) has criticized plea agreements in the UK for their
lack of transparency.273 Although a public hearing takes place to determine the sentence,
settlement documents are not made public. Agreements are only made public in rare cases,
and some settlement agreements include a confidentiality clause preventing prosecutors
from disclosing certain information.

      6.2.3 Alternatives to Criminal Charges

                     Civil Forfeiture

Civil (non-conviction based) forfeiture, discussed in Chapter 5, Section 2, allows the SFO to
recover the proceeds of crime. Non-conviction based civil recovery orders were first
intended as a fallback mechanism for situations in which criminal proceedings would not
succeed. However, in 2009, the Home Secretary and Attorney General issued guidance
advising civil forfeiture as an alternative even when criminal proceedings are possible.274
Alldridge points out that this shift occurred after a new asset recovery incentive scheme was
established, under which 50% of civil recovery goes to the investigating, prosecuting and
enforcing body.275

                     DPAs

Due to the difficulty of meeting the high threshold of initiating a charge and securing the
successful prosecution of corporate offenders, the UK also introduced deferred prosecution
agreements (DPAs) through the Crime and Courts Act 2013276 as an alternative to criminal
prosecution. This occurred after the UK government published initial plans in May 2012 for
the introduction of DPAs, receiving an overwhelmingly positive response with 86% of

respondents supporting the proposals.277 The very idea of DPAs is somewhat novel for UK
prosecutors, given that plea bargaining is not as significant a part of the criminal justice
system as it is in the US.278 Michael Bisgrove and Mark Weekes caution that the
"[i]ntroduction of the alternative is clearly not supposed to be a gold standard for
prosecution but a compromise, allowing for effective punishment and regulation within a
reasonable timeframe, where, in their absence, there might be none."279 As of April 2021, the
UK has concluded nine DPAs.280

The Deferred Prosecution Agreements Code of Practice (DPA Code),281 issued pursuant to the
Crime and Courts Act 2013, guides the DPA process.282 An invitation to negotiate a DPA is a
matter for the prosecutor's discretion, which is exercised in light of the factors established
in the DPA Code.283

Like the Code for Crown Prosecutors, the DPA Code prescribes a two-stage test that a
prosecutor must apply before entering into a DPA. The first stage is the evidential stage,
which is met if (a) the evidentiary stage of the full Code Test is met or (b) there is reasonable
identification evidence and grounds to believe that further investigation will establish a
realistic prospect of conviction in accordance with the full Code evidentiary test.284 The
second stage is the public interest stage, which is met if the public interest would be served
by entering into a DPA rather than a prosecution. The more serious the offence at issue, the
more likely prosecution will serve the public interest instead of a DPA.285 The specific public
interest factors for consideration are set out in detail at sections 2.8.1 through 2.10 of the DPA
Code, largely adopting the factors set out in the Code for Crown Prosecutors and Guidance for
Corporate Prosecution.286

If a DPA is appropriate, it must be approved by a court at a preliminary hearing.287 A court
must also approve the agreement once the terms are settled.288 The prosecutor will then

indict the person, but suspend the indictment pending satisfactory performance of the terms
set out in the DPA.289 Once these terms are satisfied, the SFO will dismiss all charges.

The DPA negotiations are confidential, and information disclosed during the negotiations is
subject to the Crime and Courts Act 2013. The prosecutor must disclose information to ensure
the parties to the negotiation are informed and the information is not misleading.290 A DPA
must be governed by clear, agreed-upon terms that are "fair, reasonable, and
proportionate."291 Generally, terms will include an end date, an agreement to cooperate with
the investigation, a financial order, cost of the prosecutor, activity restrictions and reporting
obligations.292 A financial order under a DPA may require victim compensation, payment of
a penalty, charitable donations, or disgorgement of profits.293 The terms can also require a
monitor to ensure compliance and report misconduct.294 In the event of a breach of the terms
of the DPA, the prosecutor must notify the court. Small breaches can be rectified without
court intervention, or through a court-approved remedy and cost award. If a material breach
occurs or the court does not approve a remedy, the DPA may be terminated.295 If the DPA is
terminated due to breach by the offender, the prosecutor can lift the indictment and
reinstitute criminal proceedings if the full Code Test is established.296

                     Civil Settlement

Furthermore, as described in Section 4.3.1, the SFO issued guidance in 2009 to encourage
companies to self-report violations of the Bribery Act. Companies that voluntarily disclose
corruption offences are treated more leniently and may be able to negotiate civil settlements
in lieu of criminal sanctions. This is an attractive alternative for companies because they can
control publicity and avoid the automatic consequences of a criminal conviction.297

In determining whether to negotiate a civil settlement or proceed with criminal charges, the
SFO considers the following:

      The sincerity of the board of directors' remorse and their commitment to
          improving corporate compliance in the future;

      The willingness of the directors to cooperate with the SFO in future
          investigations; and

      The willingness of the directors to resolve the matter transparently, pay a civil
          penalty and allow external monitoring.

Where directors of a company have profited from corrupt conduct or been personally
involved in the offences, the company will be prosecuted criminally, regardless of whether
the offence is voluntarily disclosed. This reflects the SFO's "zero tolerance" policy for Bribery
Act offences. In such cases, however, voluntary disclosure may be favourably taken into
account during criminal plea negotiations.298

The increased use of non-conviction based forfeiture, DPAs, and civil settlements represents
a shift away from the use of criminal prosecution to punish bribery. Alldridge is wary of this
trend, warning that "[t]he possibility of the power of money operating to prevent adverse
publicity and the other effects of convictions is a clear one to which regard must be had."299
On the other hand, these enforcement tools--which are certainly more attractive to those
who may be charged with corruption offences--may reflect the continued primacy of self-
reporting and cooperation from corporate bodies as part of successful enforcement efforts.

6.3 Canada

      6.3.1 Prosecution Policies and Guidelines

Section 91(27) of the Constitution Act, 1867, gives exclusive jurisdiction to the federal
Parliament to enact legislation in respect of criminal law and procedure. Accordingly, unlike
the US, Canada has one Criminal Code governing criminal law. In Canada, the federal
government has delegated its powers to prosecute crimes in the Criminal Code to provincial
attorneys-general.300 Domestic bribery offences, including breach of trust by a public officer,
are in the Criminal Code; thus, provincial prosecutors are responsible for prosecuting those
crimes.301 Each province has its own written and unwritten policies on the prosecution of
crimes. For example, provincial prosecutorial guidelines for Ontario and British Columbia
are available online.302

However, Parliament has also chosen to place some crimes in legislation outside of the
Criminal Code. There are some crimes enacted in other federal statutes such as the Controlled

298 See Nicholls et al, supra note 38 at 287-289 for a description of the SFO's process in negotiating civil
settlements.
299 Alldridge, supra note 243 at 239.
300 There are a few examples in which the Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c C-46, grants jurisdiction to
prosecute to both federal and provincial authorities.
301 In Canada, there are 10 provinces and three territories. The territories have fewer legislative
powers than the provinces. The federal government has not delegated prosecution of criminal
offences in the Criminal Code, ibid, to the territories. Thus, federal prosecutors are responsible for
Criminal Code prosecutions in those 3 territories.

Drugs and Substance Act,303 the Competition Act,304 the Customs Act,305 and, importantly for this
discussion, the CFPOA. The federal government, represented by federal prosecutors, is
responsible for prosecuting all criminal offences that are not in the Criminal Code. The PPSC
is an independent agency led by a Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), which fulfills the
role of federal prosecutor in Canada. Bribery of foreign public officials and books and
records offences with the purpose of bribing a foreign official are crimes enacted in the
CFPOA. Thus, the PPSC is responsible for deciding whether to prosecute an offence under
the CFPOA.306

In September 2014, a new PPSC Deskbook was issued containing directives and guidelines
which all federal prosecutors must follow.307 These directives and guidelines instruct federal
prosecutors in all aspects of the exercise of their prosecutorial discretion.

Much like the guidelines in the US and the UK, the PPSC Deskbook sets out a two-fold test
for deciding whether to prosecute federal offences. The first step is to determine whether
there is a "reasonable prospect of conviction." This requires the prosecutor to objectively
assess the whole of the evidence likely to be available at trial, including any credible
evidence that would favour the accused, to determine whether there is a reasonable prospect
of conviction.308

The second step is to determine whether a prosecution would "best serve the public
interest." With respect to the public interest, the prosecutor must consider: the seriousness
or triviality of the offence, the harm caused, the victim impact, the individual culpability of
the alleged offender, the need to protect confidential informants and the need to maintain
confidence in the administration of justice.309

In contrast, several "irrelevant criteria" are expressly recognized:

          a. The race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, sexual
                orientation, political associations, activities or beliefs of the accused or
                any other person involved in the investigation;

          b. Crown counsel's personal feelings about the accused or the victim;

          c. Possible political advantage or disadvantage to the government or any
                political group or party; or

          d. The possible effect of the decision on the personal or professional
                circumstances of those responsible for the prosecution decision.310

Part V of the PPSC Deskbook provides specific directions and guidance for certain types of
prosecutions. Among these are CFPOA offences and prosecutions. At Part 5.8, the Deskbook
provides the following guidance on the decision of whether to prosecute a CFPOA offence:

          Like any decision regarding whether or not to prosecute, prosecutions
          under the CFPOA (Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act) must be
          instituted or refused on a principled basis and must be made in accordance
          with the guideline "2.3 Decision to Prosecute". In particular, Crown counsel
          should be mindful of s. [Article] 5 of the [OECD] Convention which states:

                     5. Investigation and prosecution of the bribery of a foreign
                     public official shall be subject to the applicable rules and
                     principles of each Party. They shall not be influenced by
                     considerations of national economic interest, the potential
                     effect upon relations with another State or the identity of
                     the natural or legal persons involved.

          Crown counsel should record in writing the reasons for deciding or
          declining to institute proceedings. Such reasons may be highly relevant in
          dispelling any suggestion of improper political concerns influencing
          prosecutorial decision-making.

The PPSC Deskbook also provides guidance with respect to coordination and annual reports
for the prosecutions under the CFPOA. The guideline calls for federal coordination of all
CFPOA investigations and charges, recognizing the "inherent international dimension of
prosecutions under the CFPOA and the potential impact on Canada's relationship with other
states."311 It also provides data collection procedures for CFPOA offences to enable the
tabling of an Annual Report to Parliament as required by section 12 of the CFPOA.312

Prior to the publication of the PPSC Deskbook, Canadian authorities indicated to the OECD
Working Group on Bribery (WGB) that the PPSC was in the process of revising its federal
prosecution guidelines. In the OECD Phase 3 evaluation of Canada's compliance with the
OECD Convention, the WGB recommended Canada clarify that considerations of national
economic interest, the potential effect upon relations with another state or the identity of the
natural or legal persons involved are never proper.313 In Canada: Follow-up to the Phase 3
Report and Recommendations (2013), the Canadian authorities responded that:

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

          understanding the Deskbook's guidance in its proper context would lead to
          the conclusion that Article 5 considerations would not come into play in the
          decision of whether or not to prosecute offences under the CFPOA.314

But they further advised:

          This said, the PPSC has been re-writing the Federal Prosecution Service
          Deskbook.... The chapter of the Deskbook dedicated to the CFPOA is part
          of this review process, and consideration is being given to including specific
          reference to Article 5 of the Convention.315

Gerry Ferguson, in a previous edition of this chapter, doubted that the PPSC Deskbook fully
implements Article 5 of the OECD Convention. Ferguson expressed his doubt in this way:

          In section 3.3 of the Deskbook ... point c states that "political advantage or
          disadvantage" is not a relevant factor to consider in the decision to
          prosecute, but that expression does not capture the main concern in Article
          5 of the OECD Convention. Article 5 states that decisions to investigate or
          prosecute "shall not be influenced by considerations of national economic
          interest, the potential effect upon relations with another State or the identity
          of the natural or legal persons involved." The discontinuation of the
          investigation and prosecution in the BAE case in England, ... raises these
          very factors. Section 3.2 of Part 5.8 on CFPOA prosecutions, quoted above,
          simply says the prosecutor "should be mindful of s.5 of the Convention."
          The direction to be "mindful" is a far cry from declaring that the factors of
          national economic interest, etc., should not be considered in making
          investigation and prosecution decisions for CFPOA offences.

Ferguson's concerns certainly gain new significance in light of the SNC-Lavalin affair,
previewed in Section 1. Although national economic interest and the identity of the accused
are expressly irrelevant in deciding whether to prosecute a CFPOA offence, Prime Minister
Trudeau nevertheless attempted to interfere in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion. That
Prime Minister Trudeau was unsuccessful suggests that prosecutors are aware of the policies
which guide them. That the Prime Minister even attempted to do so (and rationalized the
effort in terms of the public interest), however, shows the potential hollowness of the policy.

      6.3.2 Background to Implementing DPAs

Until recently, the deferred prosecution agreement as an enforcement tool was noticeably
absent from Canada's enforcement regime. Prior to 2018, Canada lacked the DPA for the
resolution of any criminal charge. The absence of this enforcement tool, which had been

                                                    CHAPTER 6 INVESTIGATION & PROSECUTION

adopted previously in the US and the UK, was frequently the subject of academic and legal
commentary.316

In 2017, the Government of Canada announced it would conduct a public consultation
seeking input on a possible Canadian DPA regime. They conducted this public consultation
throughout 2017. Government officials met with 370 participants and received 75 written
submissions.

The Government then published a report which summarized the views of the participants.317
The majority of participants supported the implementation of a Canadian DPA regime. In
general, participants expressed the view that DPAs could be a useful, additional tool for
prosecutors to use at their discretion in appropriate circumstances to address corporate
criminal wrongdoing. They were further of the view that DPAs could result in effective,
proportionate, and dissuasive sanctions, while also meeting other objectives, such as helping
to identify corporate and individual criminal liability (for example, by encouraging self-
reporting and requiring corporate accused to identify implicated individuals for prosecution
purposes); enhancing compliance and improving corporate culture; and reducing the
potential negative impact of a conviction on innocent third parties.318

However, some participants doubted there was a demonstrable need for DPAs. They
expressed concern that DPAs could be viewed as favouring large companies over small
companies and individual offenders.319

      6.3.3 Remediation Agreement Regime

On September 19, 2018, the Criminal Code was amended to introduce the Canadian
equivalent of a DPA, known as a "Remediation Agreement." The Code expresses the
purposes of the remediation agreement regime as follows:

     a. to denounce an organization's wrongdoing and the harm that the
          wrongdoing has caused to victims or to the community;

     b. to hold the organization accountable for its wrongdoing through effective,
          proportionate and dissuasive penalties;

     c. to contribute to respect for the law by imposing an obligation on the
          organization to put in place corrective measures and promote a
          compliance culture;

316 See, e.g., Connor Bildfell, "Justice Deferred: Why and How Canada Should Embrace Deferred
Prosecution Agreements in Corporate Criminal Cases" (2016) 20:2 Can Crim L Rev 161. Bildfell
examines the use of DPAs in the US and the UK and the advantages and concerns surrounding their
use before proposing that Canada adopt DPAs in limited and controlled circumstances. See also

     d. to encourage voluntary disclosure of the wrongdoing;

     e. to provide reparations for harm done to victims or to the community; and

     f. to reduce the negative consequences of the wrongdoing for persons--
          employees, customers, pensioners and others--who did not engage in the
          wrongdoing, while holding responsible those individuals who did engage
          in that wrongdoing.320

In Chapter 7, the remediation agreement regime, as a sanction for bribery and corruption
offences, is described in detail. The focus in this chapter is to describe how remediation
agreements work as part of overall enforcement activity in Canada.

With respect to enforcement, the principal significance of the remediation agreement regime
is that it expands an otherwise limited range of enforcement tools in Canada. The Corruption
in Canada: Definitions and Enforcement report highlights some of the limitations in Canadian
foreign bribery initiatives:

      Under the CFPOA, only criminal prosecutions can be brought against legal
          entities, unlike in the US where the SEC has a parallel civil investigative
          and prosecutorial power.

      There are no provisions providing for voluntary disclosure or self-
          reporting to regulatory authorities.

      Although Canada has disclosure protection law, it does not encourage
          disclosure by offering financial incentives, as is the case in the US.
          Incentives may encourage corporations to cooperate with authorities.

      The CFPOA does not provide for any debarment sanctions following an
          individual's or business' conviction for bribery or books and records
          provisions (although debarment consequences are found elsewhere: see
          Chapter 7, Section 8.6).321

                     Remediation Agreement Negotiation Procedure

In 2020, the PPSC Deskbook was updated to provide guidance with respect to negotiating a
remediation agreement. The test for determining whether a remediation agreement is
appropriate reflects the test for prosecuting a criminal offence generally.322 However, two
features of the remediation agreement regime make it distinct from other decisions
involving prosecutorial discretion. The first is that remediation agreements can be used only
for corporate defendants. The second is that, while the individual prosecutor is responsible
for carrying out the negotiation, the prosecutor must receive the Attorney General's consent
before inviting a corporation to negotiate a remediation agreement.

                                                    CHAPTER 6 INVESTIGATION & PROSECUTION

As a threshold issue, a remediation agreement may be considered only if there is a
reasonable prospect of conviction. A remediation agreement is an alternative to traditional
prosecution and should only be pursued if a prosecution is otherwise viable. Further, the
prosecutor must be satisfied this threshold is met on the basis of a full law enforcement
investigation. An internal investigation from the organization is no substitute.323

If the threshold test is met and the prosecutor is of the view that a remediation agreement is
appropriate, then a series of approvals must be sought, culminating ultimately with the
consent of the Attorney General. The prosecutor may recommend to the Chief Federal
Prosecutor (CFP) that the consent of the Attorney General should be sought. If the CFP
agrees that negotiation of a remediation agreement is in the public interest, they must advise
the Deputy DPP of the intention to seek the Attorney General's consent and prepare a legal
memorandum explaining how the requirements have been satisfied. If the Deputy DPP
agrees, then they will forward the recommendation to the DPP who, on behalf of the
Attorney General, will make the final decision as to whether to invite the accused to
negotiate a remediation agreement.324 The Attorney General is vested with final authority to
approve the invitation to a corporate accused to negotiate a remediation agreement.325

Throughout this process, the "public interest" takes primacy and constrains the exercise of
the prosecutor's discretion. The Code enumerates several factors that must be considered as
part of the public interest:

     a. the circumstances in which the act or omission that forms the basis of the
          offence was brought to the attention of investigative authorities;

     b. the nature and gravity of the act or omission and its impact on any victim;

     c. the degree of involvement of senior officers of the organization in the act
          or omission;

     d. whether the organization has taken disciplinary action, including
          termination of employment, against any person who was involved in the
          act or omission;

     e. whether the organization has made reparations or taken other measures to
          remedy the harm caused by the act or omission and to prevent the
          commission of similar acts or omissions;

     f. whether the organization has identified or expressed a willingness to
          identify any person involved in wrongdoing related to the act or omission;

     g. whether the organization--or any of its representatives--was convicted of
          an offence or sanctioned by a regulatory body, or whether it entered into a
          previous remediation agreement or other settlement, in Canada or
          elsewhere, for similar acts or omissions;

     h. whether the organization--or any of its representatives--is alleged to have
          committed any other offences, including those not listed in the schedule to
          this Part; and

     i. any other factor that the Crown counsel considers relevant.326

While all of the listed factors must be considered, the weight given to each will be case
specific. Additionally, if the organization is accused of a CFPOA offence, the Code specifically
sets out that consideration must not be given to the national economic interest, the potential
effect on relations with a foreign state, or the identity of the organization or any individual

At the time of writing, no remediation agreements have been announced in Canada.

No doubt, the SNC-Lavalin affair has attracted heightened public scrutiny toward the
remediation agreement as an enforcement tool. Even prior to the scandal, some critics openly
surmised that the remediation agreement regime was enacted specifically to resolve the
charges against SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. Given the fallout of the SNC-Lavalin affair, one can
only suppose that the first remediation agreement will be of significant interest--to the legal
profession, to the business world, and to the public at large.

Whether remediation agreements will be effective in realizing their purported advantages--
self-reporting, promoting accountability, fostering a compliance culture and enhancing
public confidence in addressing corporate wrongdoing--remains to be seen. As between the
models adopted in the US and the UK, Canada has adopted a model more similar to that of
the UK. The remediation agreement is subject to court approval but, unlike the UK, no
preliminary application must be made to the court before concluding the agreement. This
may be an insufficient level of judicial oversight to allay some of the concerns regarding the
imposition of a DPA regime in Canada.

Ultimately, the true measure of the impact of remediation agreements on Canadian
enforcement activity remains to be seen. However, the tool arrives at a time when there is
increased domestic and international pressure on Canada to enhance its enforcement efforts
against global corruption and bribery. In this regard, one cannot view the introduction of a
DPA regime in Canada solely as a welcome development from the perspective of corporate
actors and their counsel. The introduction of a more flexible tool to enforce foreign bribery
and corruption offences may be viewed favourably by Canadian enforcement authorities,
which lacked mechanisms other than traditional prosecution and guilty pleas for the
purposes of enforcement.

7. CONCURRENT JURISDICTION ISSUES

Issues of concurrent jurisdiction are inevitable given the extraterritorial nature of foreign
bribery offences. The offence of bribery of foreign officials involves at least two countries--
the one in which the offender resides, and the one in which the foreign public official resides.
Yet, the offence remains one of domestic law and is prosecuted by domestic authorities. This
raises the possibility that individuals or corporations charged with corruption offences may
find themselves subject to criminal proceedings in multiple jurisdictions for the same
underlying conduct.

7.1 Parallel Proceedings

While the global effort to increase enforcement against corruption is generally positive, it
does lead to some potentially problematic issues. One such issue is the problem of parallel
proceedings referenced earlier: multiple countries could bring enforcement efforts against a
single actor based on the same offending conduct.

As Jay Holtmeier notes, when the FCPA was enacted in 1977, the US took the lead in global
corruption enforcement.328 Other major global players have recently come on board,
including Germany and the UK. The UK has become a more active prosecutor of foreign
bribery with the passing of the Bribery Act in 2010. China amended its corruption law in 2011
to include corruption of foreign public officials, but has done nothing so far to enforce that
law.329 Brazil strengthened its domestic and foreign corruption laws with the Clean Company
Act in 2003.330 These and other pieces of legislation have led to instances of overlapping or
concurrent jurisdiction in which multiple states may prosecute the same corrupt activity.

As discussed, the potential for a multiplicity of prosecutions follows naturally from the
extraterritorial nature of the foreign bribery offence. It may also be the by-product of
international cooperation between enforcement bodies. However, the limits to the extent of
this "cooperation" must be noted. Though a pure, principled desire to fight corruption is the
ideal, enforcement bodies can be motivated (for political reasons and otherwise) to justify
their operations with highly publicized convictions. Thus, if multiple enforcement bodies
have cooperated in a corruption investigation (especially where they have devoted extensive
resources), each enforcement body may still be motivated to prosecute the corruption
offence themselves, regardless of how many other enforcement bodies have jurisdiction.

Parallel proceedings may take on various forms. The most basic form is the "carbon copy"
prosecution. The term was originally coined by Andrew Boutros and Markus Funk to
describe successive, duplicative prosecutions by multiple sovereigns arising out of the same

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

or similar underlying conduct.331 The quintessential example involves a corporation
resolving bribery charges by way of an NPA, DPA or plea agreement in one jurisdiction and
subsequently being subject to investigation or prosecution in another jurisdiction based on
those admissions.332

As Holtmeier notes, "carbon copy" prosecutions offer the advantage of allowing the second
enforcer to piggyback on the efforts of the original jurisdiction, which can increase
enforcement overall.333 Oftentimes corruption occurs in countries where they do not have
resources to investigate and prosecute the matter. If the country could utilize another
jurisdiction's investigation, however, it may successfully prosecute a corruption offence
where it would otherwise be practically impossible.

Holtmeier identifies the TSKJ joint venture334 prosecutions as an example of "carbon copy"
prosecutions. The case involved huge bribes to Nigerian officials for access to liquid natural
gas reserves. In 2010, the four companies involved reached a settlement agreement with the
authorities in the US for a total of $1.5 billion. A concurrent investigation in Nigeria led to
subsequent settlements of $126 million. In addition, a court in the UK approved a civil
settlement against one of the companies and all the four companies agreed to penalties
imposed by the African Development Bank. Finally, an Italian court imposed fines on one
of the companies.335 The "publicly available information does not suggest to what extent, if
any, the penalties imposed in one jurisdiction played a role in the calculation of penalties
imposed by other authorities [in other jurisdictions]."336

Not all forms of parallel proceedings are simple "carbon copies" of the first jurisdiction's
prosecution. The prosecution of a single bribe in a single country may open the door to a
larger, more complex web of corruption offences spanning extended periods of time across
multiple jurisdictions. In these cases, different authorities may prosecute different aspects of
a bribery scheme that occurred in different places at different times.

Holtmeier provides the example of enforcement action against Siemens AG. In 2008,
Siemens entered settlements with the US and Germany for $800 million and $569 million
respectively. The US settlements involved conduct in Latin America, the Middle East, and
Bangladesh, while the German charges involved corruption in Spain, Venezuela, and China.
In the five years following these settlements, Siemens reached settlements with the World
Bank in relation to fraud allegations in Russia ($100 million), with Switzerland in relation to

a subsidiary's actions in Russia ($65 million), and with Nigeria ($46.5 million) and Greece
(£270 million) for corruption in those countries.337

From the perspective of the enforcing jurisdiction, the advantages of parallel proceedings
are clear, irrespective of the form that it takes. Parallel proceedings can promote anti-
corruption efforts overall, particularly when the second jurisdiction otherwise lacks the
resources to mount a full investigation and prosecution on its own. Such resources are not
limited solely to the material resources necessary to conduct a massive investigation either
(although this is a significant advantage). These resources could also include the sheer
institutional expertise and human resources that certain jurisdictions have developed over
a longer period of time than others.

That said, obvious risks are generated by the informal character of parallel proceedings and
the absence of any binding mechanism to resolve issues of overlapping jurisdiction in the
OECD Convention or UNCAC. These risks are discussed in greater detail below.

7.2 Risks of Parallel Proceedings

      7.2.1 Double Jeopardy

Double jeopardy--or ne bis in idem (not twice for the same thing)--is a principle of
fundamental justice which stipulates that it is unjust for an accused to be prosecuted and
convicted twice for the same offence.338 This principle is widely-accepted and
uncontroversial, at least in most Western democracies. The application of the principle to
the global corruption context is much less settled.

The prospect of parallel proceedings squarely gives rise to the concern regarding double
jeopardy. A parallel proceeding (most obviously in the form of a "carbon copy" prosecution)
arguably violates the principle of double jeopardy by imposing duplicative penalties for the
same conduct.339 This raises a fundamental question: does the principle of double jeopardy
protect an offender prosecuted by one country from prosecution by a different country for
the same (or similar) conduct?

The answer is not straightforward. For instance, the doctrine of "dual sovereignty" has been
developed by the US Supreme Court when faced with double jeopardy issues as between
state governments and the federal government. This doctrine could theoretically apply to
international anti-corruption enforcement, as suggested by Anthony Colangelo:

          The [dual sovereignty] doctrine "is founded on the ... conception of crime
          as an offense against the sovereignty of the government." It holds that
          "[w]hen a defendant in a single act violates the (peace and dignity) of two
          sovereigns by breaking the laws of each, he has committed two distinct
          `offences.'" No violation of the prohibition on double jeopardy results from

337 Ibid at 504.
338 See generally, Martin L Friedland, Double Jeopardy (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1969).

                                                                                                          601
GLOBAL CORRUPTION

          successive prosecutions by different sovereigns, according to the Court,
          because "by one act [the defendant] has committed two offences, for each of
          which he is justly punishable. The defendant, in other words, is not being
          prosecuted twice for the same "offence," if another sovereign successively
          prosecutes for the same act-even if the second sovereign prosecutes using a
          law identical to that used in the first prosecution.340

However, there are difficulties with the proposition. The first is a difficulty based on
principle--it appears to leave a loophole in the basic rights of the accused. The second is the
practical difficulty--many corruption investigations and prosecutions depend on the
voluntary disclosure and cooperation of the company or individual suspected of corrupt
activity. Faced with a multiplicity of prosecutions in various countries with different
sanctioning procedures, suspects may be significantly more reluctant to cooperate with
enforcement bodies, which could have a deleterious effect on anti-corruption enforcement.
The trend today for multinational companies is to try to negotiate a coordinated global
settlement with all potential prosecuting countries at the same time (see Section 7.3.2).

A related issue is raised. The US is a global leader in terms of its enforcement capacity and
efforts. The dual sovereignty doctrine appears to permit the DOJ to re-prosecute an offender
for the same conduct even if a prosecution has been concluded by a foreign state. Against
this backdrop, multinational corporations may reasonably conclude that the US will be the
"ultimate arbiter" on the "adequacy" of criminal outcomes in other countries.341 Therefore,
they may be incentivized to negotiate first with the US DOJ and deal with their local
prosecutors thereafter.342

In May 2018, the US Deputy Attorney General announced a new DOJ policy to prevent
"piling on." The aim of this policy is to "discourage disproportionate enforcement of laws
by multiple authorities."343 Under the policy, which has been incorporated into the US Justice
Manual, DOJ prosecutors should:

          endeavor, as appropriate, to coordinate with and consider the amount of
          fines, penalties, and/or forfeiture paid to other federal, state, local, or foreign

          enforcement authorities that are seeking to resolve a case with a company
          for the same misconduct.344

Although it is perhaps a valuable effort towards addressing the issue of overlapping
jurisdiction, it is still deficient in key areas. As a policy, it is not binding. The policy also lacks
concrete detail. This prevents a measure of predictability in terms of how the policy will be
followed. As the Deputy Attorney General conceded in the same speech, "Sometimes,
penalties that may appear duplicative really are essential to achieve justice and protect the
public."345

Ideally, the principle contained in Article 4.3 of the OECD Convention and in Article 42 of
UNCAC would be "translated" into a more immediate and effective rule in national anti-
bribery legislation. However, the exact contours of such a rule would be difficult to define.
While a domestic policy or the non-binding encouragement of "consultation" contained in
the conventions may not suffice in mitigating the very real risks of parallel proceedings, it is
not clear that a strict double jeopardy rule is the solution.

First, there may be no principled basis for an "international double jeopardy" rule. A tenet
of international law is that international conventions, such as the UNCAC and the OECD
Convention, are enforceable only by implementation of the convention through domestic
legislation. In this way, when countries pursue prosecution of foreign bribery offences, they
are, strictly speaking, prosecuting domestic criminal offences. One may challenge, with
some force, the notion that a sovereign ought to be prevented from pursuing a prosecution
under their own domestic legislation because another sovereign has done so under its
domestic legislation.

Beyond the more philosophical concern, a practical concern is also raised. A strict double
jeopardy rule could potentially incentivize countries to be the first to secure a conviction
against an offender. This could create a culture of competition with respect to enforcement,
as opposed to cooperation.346

      7.2.2 Unnecessary Deterrence

Holtmeier notes that in addition to being fundamentally unfair, multiple enforcement
actions can lead to punishments that are harsher than needed for future deterrence.347 This
can be a waste of resources for enforcement agencies and lead to increased costs of doing
business. If penalties are too high, companies will spend increased amounts of money on

344 "s 1-12.100 -- Coordination of Parallel Criminal, Civil, Regulatory, and Administrative
Proceedings" in Justice Manual, supra note 198, online: <https://www.justice.gov/jm/jm-1-12000-
coordination-parallel-criminal-civil-regulatory-and-administrative-proceedings>.
345 Rosenstein, supra note 343.
346 Moreover, the potential deleterious effects of this outcome could be significant. For instance, one
could easily imagine the protections of an accused being eroded in the name of a more "efficient"
prosecution and conviction procedure. Alternatively, one could imagine a country that lacks
investigative resources from pursuing enforcement when a country like the UK and the US, with
more robust resources, is involved.
347 Holtmeier, supra note 328 at 516.

                                                                                                          603
GLOBAL CORRUPTION

monitoring, which hinders their ability to provide competitive pricing. This could lead
companies, according to Holtmeier, to pull out of a country if the risk of doing business in
that country is too great.348 In its 2010 settlement with Panalpina World Transport (Holding)
Ltd., the US DOJ noted that the company had ceased operations in one of the countries in
which the corrupt behaviour occurred. In its 2015 settlement with Goodyear Tire & Rubber
Company, the SEC "touted the divestiture of foreign subsidiaries."349 Such withdrawal of
companies from corrupt countries could be seen as both desirable and undesirable. On one
hand, withdrawal from corrupt countries will prevent companies from engaging in and thus
supporting bribery in those countries. On the other hand, a company's withdrawal from a
corrupt country could be detrimental to the overall economic well-being of that country.

      7.2.3 Chilling Effect on Self-Reporting

Holtmeier states that a final reason to avoid duplicative enforcement actions is the chilling
effect on self-reporting. The author suggests that a "company may be willing to take the risk
that misconduct will remain undetected by law enforcement"350 and direct resources to
internal investigations rather than facing the possibility of years of investigations in multiple
jurisdictions.

7.3 Approaches to Multijurisdictional Enforcement

As more countries actively pursue corruption cases, the probability that companies will face
concurrent prosecutions is increased. Mechanisms to avoid duplicative punishments are
discussed below.

      7.3.1 Offsetting Monetary Penalties

Offsetting penalties gives a company "credit" for monetary penalties that have been paid
for the same or similar conduct. Holtmeier suggests that offsetting provides a partial remedy
for the unfairness of duplicative penalties.351 However, it may be difficult to determine the
right amount to offset, and there is no guarantee that agencies will reduce penalties due to
those previously imposed. Holtmeier notes that in its 2014 settlement with Alstom, the US
DOJ did not appear to credit penalties paid to Switzerland and the World Bank for similar
conduct; in fact, the DOJ pointed to these other penalties as evidence of Alstom's repeated
wrongdoing.352

      7.3.2 Coordinated Actions and Settlements

Companies may enter into settlements with multiple jurisdictions at the same time. For
example, in 2011, Johnson & Johnson resolved a FCPA violation in the US on the same day
that the SFO in the UK announced a civil recovery related to the same matter. Holtmeier

350 Ibid at 516-17.
351 Ibid at 506-507.

                                                    CHAPTER 6 INVESTIGATION & PROSECUTION

sees this as "a step in the right direction," but cooperation and coordination may not produce
a single resolution and additional countries could always bring future charges.353

In 2017, Rolls-Royce announced that it reached agreements in principle with prosecutors in
the UK, US, and Brazil to resolve multiple bribery and corruption incidents by
intermediaries in a number of foreign countries. In the UK, the company has agreed to the
payment of $599 million under a DPA plus the costs of the SFO investigation. The DPA must
still be approved by a court. The company further agreed to a payment of $170 million to US
DOJ and a payment of $25.5 million to Brazil.354

      7.3.3 Enforcement Comity and Declinations

The doctrine of comity informs international anti-corruption enforcement. Comity generally
entails reciprocity and the extension of courtesies from one jurisdiction to another when the
laws of both are involved. Though multiple states may legitimately exercise concurrent
jurisdiction over corruption offences, the principle of comity might lead one state's
enforcement body to defer to another state's enforcement body in the prosecution of
corruption offences.355

Articles 42.5 and 47 of UNCAC and Article 4.3 of the OECD Convention are provisions
regarding comity in enforcement actions. Both UNCAC and the OECD Convention
recommend that enforcement bodies communicate with one another during investigations
and state that prosecutions should take place in the most appropriate jurisdiction. It appears
that enforcement comity is at least a factor in US prosecutions under the FCPA. In "The
Twilight of Comity," Weber Waller writes that "both the Justice Department and the Federal
Trade Commission (FTC) routinely consider comity factors in exercise of their prosecutorial
discretion."356

According to Holtmeier, one jurisdiction may decline to prosecute a corruption offence on
the basis that a company has resolved charges for the same or similar conduct elsewhere.357
Since a rationale for forgoing prosecution is rarely given, it is difficult to predict situations
in which one jurisdiction will drop charges. Holtmeier discusses the DOJ's decision to drop

357 Holtmeier, supra note 328 at 511. There is no precise definition of declination, which can be
considered broadly as any legal scrutiny that does not lead to an enforcement action or narrowly as
an instance in which an enforcement agency has concluded it could succeed in a prosecution but
nonetheless decides not to pursue the prosecution. See Mike Koehler, "The Need For A Consensus
`Declination' Definition" (15 January 2013), online (blog): FCPA Professor

the investigation into Dutch-based SBM Offshore following the company's $240 million
settlement with Dutch prosecutors. The DOJ's decision may have been influenced by the fact
that a potential offsetting of the Dutch penalty could negate any penalty collectible in the
US, as well as considerations of jurisdiction and evidence.358

The solution to balancing all these concerns may be to encourage greater transparency and
detail in enforcement policies. While non-binding, policies are designed to encourage a
consistent standard across a certain body, in this case, enforcement bodies. However, in
order to give effect to a certain level of predictability for an accused corporation, policies
ought to (1) particularize the criteria that would cause the country to defer to enforcement
efforts in another jurisdiction and (2) better particularize the circumstances in which they
would not do so.

PART A: CRIMINAL SENTENCES AND COLLATERAL CONSEQUENCES

1. INTRODUCTION

In Chapter 2, the main corruption offences--both domestic and foreign--are described and
the maximum punishment for those offences is set out. In this chapter, the sentencing
principles which guide the selection of an appropriate sentence in individual cases are
briefly described, and the actual sentences imposed in some corruption cases are provided
as illustrations of how those sentencing principles are applied in practice.

2. UNCAC

The United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC) has very little in the way of
requirements or specific guidance for sanctions and sentencing in corruption cases and does
not set out any minimum or maximum sentences for corruption offences.1 Article 30 contains
the main provisions with respect to sanctions. The Article includes mandatory and non-
mandatory provisions.

The mandatory provisions require each State Party to:

      Provide for sanctions that take into account the gravity of the offence (Article 30(1));
      Provide for an appropriate balance between any immunities or jurisdictional

          privileges accorded to its public officials for the performance of their functions and
          the possibility, when necessary, of effectively investigating, prosecuting, and
          adjudicating offense established in accordance with the UNCAC (Article 30(2));
      Take appropriate measures to ensure that decisions on release pending trial or
          appeal take into consideration the need to ensure the presence of the defendant at
          subsequent criminal proceedings (Article 30(4)); and
      Take into account the gravity of the offence concerned when considering the
          eventuality of early release or parole of persons convicted of such offences (Article
          30(5)).

The non-mandatory provisions require each State Party to:

      Consider establishing procedures through which a public official accused of an
          offence established in accordance with the UNCAC may, where appropriate, be
          removed, suspended or reassigned by the appropriate authority (Article 30(6));

      Consider establishing procedures for the disqualification for a period of time
          determined by domestic law of persons convicted of offences established in

force 14 December 2005) [UNCAC], online (pdf):

                                                                                                          609
GLOBAL CORRUPTION

          accordance with the UNCAC from (a) holding public office and (b) holding office in
          an enterprise owned in whole or in part by the State (Article 30(7)); and
      Endeavour to promote the reintegration into society of persons convicted for
          offences established pursuant to the UNCAC (Article 30(10)).

Additional guidance is provided in Articles 12(1), 26(4), 35, and 37(2).

Article 12(1) provides that "each State Party shall take measures, in accordance with ... its
domestic law ... to provide effective, proportionate and dissuasive civil, administrative or
criminal penalties" for violation of corruption prevention standards and offences involving
the private sector.

Article 26(4) requires each State Party to "ensure that legal persons held liable in accordance
with this article are subject to effective, proportionate and dissuasive criminal or non-
criminal sanctions, including monetary sanctions."

Article 35 requires each State Party to take such measures as may be necessary to ensure that
entities or persons who have suffered damage as a result of an act of corruption have the
right to initiate legal proceedings against those responsible for that damage in order to
obtain compensation.

Article 37(2) provides that State Parties shall consider mitigation of punishment (or
immunity from prosecution under Article 37(3)) for accused persons who provide
"substantial cooperation" in the investigation or prosecution of corruption offences.

3. OECD CONVENTION

Like the UNCAC, the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials
in International Business Transactions (OECD Convention)2 does not stipulate specific
penalties but sets out general guidance with respect to sanctions and sentencing for bribery
of foreign public officials. Article 3 of the OECD Convention comprises the main provisions
on sanctions.

Paragraph 1 of Article 3 requires that bribery of foreign officials "shall be punishable by
effective, proportionate and dissuasive criminal penalties" comparable to the penalties for
corruption of domestic officials. Article 8(2) has a similar penalty requirement for books and
records offences.

Paragraph 2 of Article 3 requires those State Parties who do not recognize the concept of
"corporate criminal liability" in their legal systems to ensure that corporations are "subject

to effective, proportionate and dissuasive non-criminal sanctions, including monetary
sanctions, for bribery of foreign public officials."

Paragraph 3 of Article 3 requires each State Party to take necessary steps for seizure and
confiscation of the proceeds of bribery.

Besides those mandatory provisions, paragraph 4 requires each State Party to "consider"
imposing additional civil or administrative sanctions for the bribery of a foreign public
official.

4. US SENTENCING

Bribery of US officials is criminalized under both state and federal criminal law. This book
only deals with corruption offenses involving US federal officials under the US Code3 and
foreign public officials under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA).4 Sentences for
offenders under these laws are guided by the US Sentencing Commission's Guidelines
Manual (Guidelines).5

       Federal Guidelines

The Guidelines were adopted in 1984 and were originally mandatory. In 2005, the US
Supreme Court in US v Booker held that the mandatory nature of the Guidelines violated the
US Constitution.6 Since that time, the sentencing range for each case set out in the Guidelines
has been treated by sentencing courts as advisory, rather than mandatory. The Guidelines are
designed to bring a reasonable degree of uniformity to similar offenses committed by similar
offenders in similar circumstances. The recommended sentencing range (described in
months of imprisonment) is determined by putting the severity of the offense on one axis
(there are 43 different offense levels) and the severity of the offender's prior criminal record
on the other axis (there are six categories of seriousness for the prior record). Where the two
axes intersect, the Guidelines give a recommended advisory range of sentence in terms of
months. Departures from that range are made where the circumstances of a case warrant
departure. The Sentencing Table (see Table 7.1) is also divided into four zones, the effects of
which are described below.

                 Offense Seriousness

In the Guidelines, each offense is assigned a "base level" of offense seriousness and that base
level will then be increased or decreased depending on the existence of specified aggravating
or mitigating circumstances. For example, for offering, giving, soliciting or receiving a bribe,

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

the offense base level is 12. If the offender is a public official, the base level is 14 and if the
offense involved more than one bribe, the offense level rises to 16.

      4.1.2 Criminal History of the Offender

An offender can receive an elevated sentence due to their prior criminal history. They receive
one point for each prior sentence,7 two points if the prior sentence was for a period of
incarceration of at least 60 days, and three points if the prior sentence was for a period of
imprisonment exceeding one year and one month.8

      4.1.3 Zones

The Sentencing Table is also divided into four zones.9 Zone A (for the least serious offenses)
indicates that a sentence of probation without any prison time would also be a fit sentence.
Zone B indicates that the offender should serve at least a short period (no less than 30 days)
in prison, while the remainder of the sentence could be served in community confinement
(e.g., home detention, etc.). Zone C indicates that offenders should serve at least one half of
the sentence in prison and the remainder could be served in community confinement. Zone
D indicates that the minimum number of months set out in the specific recommended
sentencing range (each range has a minimum and a maximum) should be served in prison.

7 As stated in the USSG (2018), supra note 5 at § 4A1.2(a)(1), "[t]he term "prior sentence" means any
sentence previously imposed upon adjudication of guilt, whether by guilty plea, trial, or plea of nolo
contendere, for conduct not part of the instant offense" and § 4A1.2(a)(3) "[a] conviction for which the
imposition or execution of sentence was totally suspended or stayed shall be counted as a prior
sentence." Certain offenses are excluded from calculation, including offenses for which the sentence
was imposed more than ten years prior to the instant offense (or five years if the prior offense was
committed prior to the offender's eighteenth birthday) and certain minor offenses such as
hitchhiking and public intoxication. The offender can receive a maximum of four points for sentences
that do not result in incarceration for at least 60 days, whereas two points are given for each prior
sentence of at least 60 days and three points for each prior sentence exceeding one year and one
month.

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

4.2 Procedure and Guiding Principles

The sentencing of a criminal offender involves three steps, which has been explained by US
District Judge John Adams:

          Criminal sentencing is often described as a three-step process. A district
          court must begin the process by calculating the advisory guideline range
          suggested by the United States Sentencing Commission. Rita v. United
          States, 551 U.S. 338, 351, 127 S. Ct. 2456, 168 L. Ed. 2d 203 (2007) ("The
          sentencing judge ... will normally begin by considering the presentence
          report and its interpretation of the Guidelines."). In so doing, the Court
          must determine the offense level for the crimes for which the defendant has
          been convicted and the defendant's criminal history. See United States v.
          Boyd, No. 3:07-CR-3, 2008 WL 4963198, at *14-16 (E.D.Tenn. Nov. 18, 2008).

          Next, the Court must determine whether a variance or departure from the
          advisory guideline range would be appropriate. United States v. Collington,
          461 F.3d 805, 807 (6th Cir. 2006).

          Finally, a sentencing court must independently evaluate each of the factors
          in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a), which details the considerations that a district court
          must weigh before sentencing a criminal defendant. Although the
          Guidelines form a starting point in the district court's analysis under 18
          U.S.C. § 3553(a), a district court may not presume that the sentence
          suggested by the Guidelines is appropriate for an individual criminal
          defendant. A district court may hear arguments by prosecution or defense
          that the Guidelines sentence should not apply. In this way, a sentencing
          court subjects the defendant's sentence to the thorough adversarial testing
          contemplated by federal sentencing.11

Under § 3553 of Title 18 of the US Code, the factors to be considered in imposing a sentence
are:

          The court shall impose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary,
          to comply with the purposes set forth in paragraph (2) of this subsection.
          The court, in determining the particular sentence to be imposed, shall
          consider--

                     (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history
                           and characteristics of the defendant;

                     (2) the need for the sentence imposed--

                           (A) to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote
                                      respect for the law, and to provide just punishment
                                      for the offense;

                           (B) to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct;

                                                               CHAPTER 7 SANCTIONS & REMEDIES

                            (C) to protect the public from further crimes of the
                                       defendant; and

                            (D) to provide the defendant with needed educational or
                                       vocational training, medical care, or other correctional
                                       treatment in the most effective manner;

                      (3) the kinds of sentences available;
                      (4) the kinds of sentence and the sentencing range established

                            for--
                            (A) the applicable category of offense committed by the

                                       applicable category of defendant as set forth in the
                                       guidelines [issued by the Sentencing Commission]--
                                       ...
                      (5) any pertinent policy statement [issued by the Sentencing
                            Commission]--
                            ...
                      (6) the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among
                            defendants with similar records who have been found guilty
                            of similar conduct; and
                      (7) the need to provide restitution to any victims of the offense.12

4.3 Specific Corruption Related Guidelines

Chapter 2 of the Guidelines contains information for offenses which are either directly related
to corruption or contain aspects of corruption if they are committed on or by a public official.
§ 2C1.1 of the Guidelines deals with the following offenses: Offering, Giving, Soliciting or
Receiving a Bribe; Extortion Under Color of Official Right; Fraud Involving the Deprivation
of the Intangible Right to Honest Services of Public Officials; and Conspiracy to Defraud by
Interference with Governmental Functions. § 2C1.1 is one of the most commonly applied
guidelines for corruption of a public official. As noted, the base level for this offense is 14 if
the defendant is a public official, which in the Sentencing Table (see Table 7.1) corresponds
to a guideline range of 15-21 months.

      4.3.1 Seriousness of Offense

The following factors are also relevant in determining the offense level. Under § 2C1.1 of the
Guidelines, the offense level can be increased in the following circumstances:

           (1) If the offense involved more than one bribe or extortion, increase by 2
                 levels.

12 18 USC § 3553.

                                                                                                           615
GLOBAL CORRUPTION

          (2) If the value of the payment, the benefit received or to be received in
                return for the payment, the value of anything obtained or to be obtained
                by a public official or others acting with a public official, or the loss to
                the government from the offense, whichever is greatest, exceeded
                $6,500, increase by the number of levels from the table in §2B1.1 (Theft,
                Property Destruction, and Fraud) corresponding to that amount.

          (3) If the offense involved an elected public official or any public official in
                a high-level decision-making or sensitive position, increase by 4 levels.
                If the resulting offense level is less than level 18, increase to level 18.

          (4) If the defendant was a public official who facilitated (A) entry into the
                United States for a person, a vehicle, or cargo; (B) the obtaining of a
                passport or a document relating to naturalization, citizenship, legal
                entry, or legal resident status; or (C) the obtaining of a government
                identification document, increase by 2 levels.13

As noted in item (2), the value of the bribe is relevant and calculated based on the greatest
of the following four measures:

     a) the value of the payment;

     b) the benefit received or to be received in return for the payment;

     c) value of anything obtained or to be obtained by a public official or others acting
          with a public official; or

     d) the loss to the government from the offense.

Table 7.2 is a representation of how the offense level increases are calculated.

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

Using the greatest of the four specified measures can lead to large increases in offense level.

In United States of America v Jeffery Edwards,15 an asbestos inspector, Jeffrey Edwards, was
appealing his sentence of 33 months in prison for bribery and extortion. Edwards issued a
permit to a contracting company to conduct asbestos abatement. He told the company that
he would allow them to use a less costly abatement procedure than he believed was required
by the applicable regulations if they paid him $10,000. The FBI videotaped this exchange,
and he was subsequently arrested and convicted. Before the District Court, the parties
agreed that § 2C1.1 of the Guidelines applied but disagreed on the amount of level
enhancement. Edwards argued the Court should consider the value of the bribe, $10,000,
and apply a two-level increase. The government argued that the less costly procedure made
a difference of $200,000, corresponding to a ten-level increase. The Court found the cost
difference to be $100,000 and increased the offense level by eight, making the guideline range
30-37 months. The 33-month sentence imposed by the District Court under this range was
upheld on appeal.

In United States of America v Quincy Richard Sr,16 the offender, a former member of a school
board, pledged to support an applicant for School Board Superintendent in exchange for
$5,000. A co-accused also was to receive $5,000. The applicant for Superintendent was a
government informant. Following a trial, Richard was found guilty of conspiracy to commit
bribery and two counts of bribery. Richard was sentenced to 33 months in prison and three
years' supervised release per count to be served concurrently. The district court increased
the offense level by two levels because the two bribes totaled $10,000. Richard appealed on
various grounds, including that he should be responsible for, at most, $5,000. The Court of
Appeal upheld the entire sentence including the two-level increase, noting that the total
bribe was the greatest amount of the bribe or loss to the government.

In United States of America v Charles Gary-Don Abbey,17 Abbey, a city administrator, accepted
a free building lot from a land developer. The offender was convicted of conspiracy to bribe
a public official, solicitation of a bribe, and extortion by a public official and was sentenced
to 15 months imprisonment. The sentencing court applied a four-level enhancement due to
the value of the lot exceeding $20,000. Abbey argued on appeal "that the land was basically
worthless because he had to pay certain assessments on it after receipt, and further that the
only relevant criteria was his subjective impression of the property's value." The court
rejected this argument, finding the value of loss ordinarily means fair market value, which
is determined objectively. The government presented evidence of surrounding lots selling
for more than $20,000 and the bank from whom Abbey sought a mortgage estimated the
lots' value at $40,000. The district court applied the value over $20,000 and the Court of
Appeal held that value was "not clearly erroneous" and upheld the sentence.

Pennsylvania. After a multi-year undercover investigation by the FBI, in July 2019

corruption offences resulting in a multi-year conspiracy to take bribes from vendors doing
business with the city.19 Before sentencing, the final Presentence Investigation Report (PSR)
prepared by the United States Probation Office determined that the base offence level for
Courtright under the sentencing guidelines, as a public official, was fourteen. It then found
that the following enhancements were applicable: (1) a two-level enhancement because there
were multiple bribes involved; (2) a four-level enhancement because Courtright was in a
"high-level decision-making or sensitive position;" (3) a four-level enhancement arising
from Courtright's role as a leader or organizer of criminal activity involving five or more
participants or which was otherwise extensive. Finally, although Courtright had only
collected around $50,000 in cash payments (Courtright argued it was closer to $18,000), the
PSR applied a sixteen-level enhancement because the "benefit received" in exchange for
illegal payments to Courtright was between $1,500,000 and $3,500,000. Courtright's primary
challenge was to this last enhancement. The offender was ultimately unsuccessful in a later
decision, which determined that the sixteen-level enhancement had been correctly applied.20
On October 2, 2020, Courtright was sentenced to seven years' imprisonment and a $25,000
fine,21 significantly less than the recommended sentencing guideline range of 292-365
months imprisonment.

      4.3.2 Positions of Elevated Trust

In cases of public corruption, the position of power and degree of breach of trust is
considered in sentencing. As stated, under § 2C1.1 of the Guidelines, a four-level increase is
given if the offense involves an elected public official or high-level decision-making or
sensitive position, and if the resulting offense level is less than 18, it is to be increased to
level 18.

In United States of America v Bridget McCafferty,22 McCafferty, a former judge, was convicted
of 10 counts of making false statements to FBI agents arising out of a corruption investigation
of another public official. The offense level was 6, with its corresponding guideline range for
sentencing from 0-6 months. The district court applied a 5-level adjustment moving the
range to 8-14 months and sentenced McCafferty to 14 months. The upward departure and
ultimate sentence were both upheld on appeal, with the Court stating: "For a sitting judge
to knowingly lie to FBI agents after she had unethically steered negotiations in a case to
benefit her associates is a shock to our system of justice and the rule of law."23

In one of the highest profile corruption cases in the last decade, former Illinois Governor
Rod Blagojevich was sentenced to 14 years in prison following 18 corruption convictions,

most notably his attempt to "sell or trade" the United States Senate seat that had become

conspiracy, wire fraud, extortion conspiracy, attempted extortion and making false

Zagel stated "[t]he harm here is not measured in the value of property or money. The harm
is the erosion of public trust in government."25 On appeal, the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals
vacated five of the convictions on a technicality and ordered a re-sentencing; further leave
to the Supreme Court was denied. Despite the reduced number of convictions, the 14-year
sentence was upheld at a re-sentencing in August 2016. Blagojevich's lawyer further
appealed the sentence,26 but on April 21, 2017 the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the
original sentence.27

United States of America v Richard Renzi involved the trial and sentencing of a former Arizona
Congressman in respect to a $200,000 bribe payment (resulting in a 10-level enhancement).28
Renzi was sentenced to 36 months imprisonment and his friend and business partner was
sentenced to 18 months imprisonment. In affirming the sentences, the Court noted the
substantial power granted to Renzi, stating:

          The Constitution and our citizenry entrust Congressmen with immense
          power. Former Congressman Renzi abused the trust of this Nation, and for
          doing so, he was convicted by a jury of his peers. After careful consideration
          of the evidence and legal arguments, we affirm the convictions and
          sentences of both Renzi and his friend and business partner, Sandlin.29

United States of America v Richard McDonough30 involved the trial and sentencing of Richard
McDonough and Salvatore DiMasi, the former Speaker of the Massachusetts House of
Representatives, for bribes in relation to business transactions. DiMasi received a sentence
of 96 months (8 years) imprisonment (the guideline range was 235 to 293 months) and
McDonough was sentenced to 84 months (7 years) imprisonment (the guideline range was
188 to 235 months). The guideline range for DiMasi and McDonough was identical except
for the enhancement given to DiMasi as a public official.

United States of America v Joseph Paulus involved the sentencing of Paulus, a former district
attorney who accepted 22 bribes over the course of a two-year period for agreeing to

favourable treatment of a defence lawyer's clients.31 Paulus was sentenced to 58 months
imprisonment (nearly 5 years), an upward departure from the guideline range of 27 to 33
months. The court justified their upward departure based on the nature of the trust
breached, the number of bribes over a substantial period of time and the difficulty in
detecting corruption. The Court stated:

          Bribery, by its very nature, is a difficult crime to detect. Like prostitution, it
          occurs only between consenting parties both of whom have a strong interest
          is [sic] concealing their actions. And often, when it involves public
          corruption as in this case, one of the parties occupies a position of public
          trust that makes him, or her, an unlikely suspect. In light of these facts, it is
          unusual to uncover even one instance of bribery by a public official, let
          alone twenty-two. This fact takes the case outside of the heartland.... That
          there was interference with a government function to an unusual degree
          and a loss of public confidence in government as a result of his offense are
          facts that this court has found. But the question of how to measure such
          impact and assign a numeric adjustment in the applicable offense level
          under the Guidelines is a matter of judgment. Such matters cannot be
          quantified, or at least easily quantified.... For these reasons, and for the
          reasons set forth on the record in court, the defendant is sentenced to a term
          of fifty-eight months.32

United States of America v Robert F McDonnell,33 dealt with an appeal by McDonnell, the
former Governor of Virginia, of his convictions for conspiracy to commit honest-services
wire fraud, committing honest services wire fraud, and obtaining property under colour of
official right. McDonnell accepted $175,000 in loans, gifts and other benefits from Jonnie
Williams (chief executive officer of Star Scientific) while in office. Williams was invited to
meetings and introduced to state employees. Williams wanted to have state universities
evaluate a nutritional supplement produced by a company he owned. A successful
conviction required proof that McDonnell committed (or agreed to commit) an "official act"
in exchange for loans and gifts. The Supreme Court of the United States overturned
McDonnell's convictions, confirming that not every action taken by a public official while in
office will qualify as an "official act" for the purposes of 18 USC § 201:

          An "official act" is a decision or action on a "question, matter, cause, suit,
          proceeding or controversy." That question or matter must involve a formal
          exercise of governmental power, and must also be something specific and
          focused that is "pending" or "may by law be brought" before a public
          official. To qualify as an "official act," the public official must make a
          decision or take an action on that question or matter, or agree to do so.
          Setting up a meeting, talking to another official, or organizing an event--
          without more--does not fit that definition of "official act".... Because a
          typical meeting, call, or event is not of the same stripe as a lawsuit before a

          court, a determination before an agency, or a hearing before a committee, it
          does not count as a "question" or "matter" under §201(a)(3).34

The Supreme Court of the United States noted that, at trial, several of McDonnell's
subordinates testified that he had asked them to attend a meeting but not that anything more
was expected. If that was truly what McDonnell had agreed to do when he accepted the
loans and gifts, then the necessary decision or action was not present. McDonnell's
conviction was vacated.

United States of America v David Johnson and Reginald T Walton35 involved an appeal of the
sentences of David Johnson and Reginald T. Walton. Walton, Johnson and others
orchestrated a scheme which allowed them to pocket money while selling the city of
Indianapolis' properties through a non-profit loophole. The two were indicted and found
guilty of wire fraud, honest services wire fraud and conspiracy to engage in money
laundering. Walton was also convicted of receiving bribes. Walton was sentenced to 108
months in prison, below the guideline range of 135-168 months. Johnson was sentenced to
66 months, which was below the guideline range of 87-108 months. On appeal, among other
things, they challenged the sentencing enhancement they received because Walton was a
public official in a high-level decision-making position. The Court found no clear error in
the district court's decision to apply the enhancement to both sentences. Walton, as director
of the Land Bank, was in a sensitive position. He had "inordinate" discretion over
transferring Land Bank properties. "Walton did not have overt influence over his superiors,
but his resolutions were scarcely scrutinized, giving him de facto control over how and to
whom Land Bank Properties were sold."36 The sentences imposed by the district court were
upheld.

United States of America v Aniello Palmieri,37 dealt with an appeal by Aniello Palmieri of his
sentence after he pleaded guilty to mail fraud. Palmieri was Director of the Division of
Facilities Management for Union Country, New Jersey, and assisted in selecting vendors for
building materials, tools, and other supplies. From 2006-2010, Palmieri participated in
kickback schemes, verified false and inflated invoices and received a portion of vendors'
wrongful profits in return. On appeal, in upholding a four-level enhancement imposed by
the District Court for being a public official in a high-level decision-making or sensitive
position, the Court noted that Palmieri was a countywide director earning over six figures.
Palmieri could not act officially on the County's behalf, but "he exercised substantial
influence through recommendations to his superiors."38

In United States of America v Raushi J Conrad,39 the offender appealed the convictions for
acceptance of bribes by a public official and conspiracy to commit bribery, as well as the
sentence of 48 months in prison. Conrad, while employed at the United States Department
of Commerce, had accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars in payments and renovation

work at his home from a James Bedford. In return, he took official acts to steer government
contracts to companies owned by Bedford. One of Conrad's arguments on appeal was that
the District Court erred in applying the sentencing enhancement for public officials in high-
level decision-making positions. Conrad felt that he did not hold a high-level decision-
making position, had simply a mid-level position within the Commerce Department, and
did not have direct decision-making authority. Unfortunately for Conrad, during the
investigation he specifically told a special agent that the decision to hire Bedford's company
was "his decision." The Court noted that "although Appellant did not have independent
authority to award the contract, the record reflects that as the official leading the data
migration project, Appellant's recommendation of who should win the contract was given
substantial deference.... Indeed, there [was] no evidence in the record that any of the
individuals who passed along Appellant's recommendation did any research into Bedford's
Images whatsoever, and instead simply relied on Appellant's recommendation since he was
the project manager for the data migration project."40

United States of America v Felipe Zamora41 dealt with an appeal by Felipe Zamora of his
sentence. In jail awaiting resentencing for past offences, Zamora began paying a guard to
smuggle in contraband. When he was discovered, he pleaded guilty to bribing a public
official. The district court applied a four-level enhancement because the offence involved a
public official in a high-level decision-making or sensitive position. Zamora was sentenced
to 60 months, which was above the guideline range whether a four-level enhancement was
applied or not. On appeal, Zamora argued that a prison guard is a low-level official and that
he did not hold a sensitive position, making the four-level enhancement inappropriate. The
Court noted that the Guidelines' commentary, which generally binds on issues of
interpretation, indicated that those who are "similarly situated" to law enforcement officers
are in a sensitive position. The Court determined that prison guards are similarly situated
to law enforcement officers for the purposes of § 2C1.1 and upheld Zamora's sentence.

While § 2C1.1 deals with one of the most common corruption offenses, there are other
guidelines which apply to offenses which are either directly related to corruption or have an
element of corruption if they are committed by a public official.42

4.4 Imposition of Fines

Criminal offenders can also be fined as part of their sentence. Under 18 USC § 3571, fines for
individual offenders may be no more than the greatest of:

     (1) the amount specified in the law setting forth the offense;

     (2) the applicable amount under subsection (d) of this section [not more than
          the greater of twice the value of the loss caused to another by the offense
          or twice the value of the defendant's gain from their criminal behaviour,

The factors governing the imposition of a fine are found in 18 USC § 3572:

          (a) Factors To Be Considered -- In determining whether to impose a fine,
                and the amount, time for payment, and method of payment of a fine,
                the court shall consider, in addition to the factors set forth in section
                3553 (a)--

                     (1) the defendant's income, earning capacity, and financial
                           resources;

                     (2) the burden that the fine will impose upon the defendant, any
                           person who is financially dependent on the defendant, or any
                           other person (including a government) that would be
                           responsible for the welfare of any person financially
                           dependent on the defendant, relative to the burden that
                           alternative punishments would impose;

                     (3) any pecuniary loss inflicted upon others as a result of the
                           offense;

                     (4) whether restitution is ordered or made and the amount of
                           such restitution;

                     (5) the need to deprive the defendant of illegally obtained gains
                           from the offense;

                     (6) the expected costs to the government of any imprisonment,
                           supervised release, or probation component of the sentence;

                     (7) whether the defendant can pass on to consumers or other
                           persons the expense of the fine; and

                     (8) if the defendant is an organization, the size of the organization
                           and any measure taken by the organization to discipline any
                           officer, director, employee, or agent of the organization
                           responsible for the offense and to prevent a recurrence of such
                           an offense.

          (b) Fine Not to Impair Ability to Make Restitution -- If, as a result of a
                conviction, the defendant has the obligation to make restitution to a
                victim of the offense, other than the United States, the court shall
                impose a fine or other monetary penalty only to the extent that such
                fine or penalty will not impair the ability of the defendant to make
                restitution.44

For the offense of bribery of domestic public officials and witnesses in 18 USC § 201, fines
are determined by the above sections or may be up to three times the value of the thing given
or offered to the official. This applies to both the bribe payer and the bribe receiver, meaning
the penalty for both may be based on the amount of the bribe. Rose-Ackerman notes that
this symmetry in the maximum fine fails to reflect the "asymmetries in gains between bribe
payers and recipients."45 Under subsection (2) above, the bribe payer's gains may be taken
into account; however, Rose-Ackerman argues that gains should be multiplied to reflect the
probability of detection in order to effectively deter bribery.

4.5 Sentencing Corporations and Other Organizations

The Guidelines provide the following general principles for the sentencing of organizations:

          First, the court must, whenever practicable, order the organization to
          remedy any harm caused by the offense. The resources expended to remedy
          the harm should not be viewed as punishment, but rather as a means of
          making victims whole for the harm caused.

          Second, if the organization operated primarily for a criminal purpose or
          primarily by criminal means, the fine should be set sufficiently high to
          divest the organization of all its assets.

          Third, the fine range for any other organization should be based on the
          seriousness of the offense and the culpability of the organization. The
          seriousness of the offense generally will be reflected by the greatest of the
          pecuniary gain, the pecuniary loss, or the amount in a guideline offense
          level fine table. Culpability generally will be determined by six factors that
          the sentencing court must consider. The four factors that increase the
          ultimate punishment of an organization are: (i) the involvement in or
          tolerance of criminal activity; (ii) the prior history of the organization; (iii)
          the violation of an order; and (iv) the obstruction of justice. The two factors
          that mitigate the ultimate punishment of an organization are: (i) the
          existence of an effective compliance and ethics program; and (ii) self-
          reporting, cooperation, or acceptance of responsibility.

          Fourth, probation is an appropriate sentence for an organizational
          defendant when needed to ensure that another sanction will be fully
          implemented, or to ensure that steps will be taken within the organization
          to reduce the likelihood of future criminal conduct.

          These guidelines offer incentives to organizations to reduce and ultimately
          eliminate criminal conduct by providing a structural foundation from
          which an organization may self-police its own conduct through an effective
          compliance and ethics program. The prevention and detection of criminal
          conduct, as facilitated by an effective compliance and ethics program, will

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

          assist an organization in encouraging ethical conduct and in complying
          fully with all applicable laws.46

The Guidelines set out the base fine for an organization:

          (a) The base fine is the greatest of:
                (1) the amount from the table in subsection (d) below corresponding
                     to the offense level determined under §8C2.3 (Offense Level); or
                (2) the pecuniary gain to the organization from the offense;47 or
                (3) the pecuniary loss from the offense caused by the organization, to
                     the extent the loss was caused intentionally, knowingly, or
                     recklessly.48

The Guidelines set out a fine of $8,500 for an offense level of 6 or less, which gradually rises
to $150 million for an offense level of 38 or more. Each offense level increases the amount of
the fine. For example:

Table 7.3 Offense Level Fine Table49

Offense Level  Amount
6 or less      $8,500
8              $15,000
15             $200,000
22             $2,000,000
30             $20,000,000
36             $80,000,000
38 or more     $150,000,000

Fines are also multiplied based on the organization's culpability score. The culpability score
is based on a number of factors including prior criminal history, involvement of high-level

chances of being caught are far below 100%. See Rose-Ackerman, supra note 45 at 225.

The FCPA sets out the criminal penalties for corruption offenses. All FCPA criminal offenses
are prosecuted by the Department of Justice (DOJ). The Resource Guide to the FCPA (DJSEC
Resource Guide), produced by the DOJ and the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC), sets
out ten factors relevant in determining whether to seek indictment or an NPA, DPA or SEC
civil settlement, and in determining the terms of those dispositions. The DJSEC Resource
Guide repeatedly emphasizes that voluntary early disclosure of possible FCPA violations and

cooperation in the investigation of those violations will be key factors in obtaining more
lenient treatment from the DOJ or SEC. Ten factors are considered in conducting an
investigation, determining whether to charge a corporation, and negotiating pleas or other
agreements:

           the nature and seriousness of the offense, including the risk of harm to
                the public;

           the pervasiveness of wrongdoing within the corporation, including
                the complicity in, or the condoning of, the wrongdoing by corporate
                management;

           the corporation's history of similar misconduct, including prior
                criminal, civil, and regulatory enforcement actions against it;

           the corporation's willingness to cooperate with the government's
                investigation, including as to potential wrongdoing by the
                corporation's agents;

           the adequacy and effectiveness of the corporation's compliance
                program at the time of the offence, as well as at the time of a charging
                or resolution decision;

           the corporation's timely and voluntary disclosure of wrongdoing;

           the corporation's remedial actions, including any efforts to implement
                an adequate and effective corporate compliance program or to
                improve an existing one, to replace responsible management, to
                discipline or terminate wrongdoers, or to pay restitution;

           collateral consequences, including whether there is disproportionate
                harm to shareholders, pension holders, employees, and others not
                proven personally culpable, as well as impact on the public arising
                from the prosecution;

           the adequacy of remedies such as civil or regulatory enforcement
                actions, including remedies resulting from the corporation's
                cooperation with relevant government agencies; and

What Are the Potential Consequences for Violations of the FCPA?

The FCPA provides for different criminal and civil penalties for companies and
individuals.

Criminal Penalties

For each violation of the anti-bribery provisions, the FCPA provides that corporations and
other business entities are subject to a fine of up to $2 million. Individuals, including
officers, directors, stockholders, and agents of companies, are subject to a fine of up to
$250,000 and imprisonment for up to five years.

For each violation of the accounting provisions, the FCPA provides that corporations and
other business entities are subject to a fine of up to $25 million. Individuals are subject to a
fine of up to $5 million and imprisonment for up to 20 years. Under the Alternative Fines
Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3571(d), courts may impose significantly higher fines than those provided
by the FCPA--up to twice the benefit that the defendant obtained by making the corrupt
payment, as long as the facts supporting the increased fines are included in the indictment
and either proved to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt or admitted in a guilty plea
proceeding. Fines imposed on individuals may not be paid by their employer or principal.

U.S. Sentencing Guidelines

When calculating penalties for violations of the FCPA, DOJ focuses its analysis on the U.S.
Sentencing Guidelines (Guidelines) in all of its resolutions, including guilty pleas, DPAs,
and NPAs. The Guidelines provide a very detailed and predictable structure for
calculating penalties for all federal crimes, including violations of the FCPA. To determine
the appropriate penalty, the "offense level" is first calculated by examining both the
severity of the crime and facts specific to the crime, with appropriate reductions for
cooperation and acceptance of responsibility, and, for business entities, additional factors
such as voluntary disclosure, pre-existing compliance programs, and remediation.

The Guidelines provide different penalties for the different provisions of the FCPA. The
initial offense level for violations of the anti-bribery provisions is determined under §
2C1.1, while violations of the accounting provisions are assessed under § 2B1.1. For
individuals, the initial offense level is modified by factors set forth in Chapters 3, 4, and 5
of the Guidelines to identify a final offense level. This final offense level, combined with
other factors, is used to determine whether the Guidelines would recommend that
incarceration is appropriate, the length of any term of incarceration, and the appropriate
amount of any fine. For corporations, the offense level is modified by factors particular to
organizations as described in Chapter 8 to determine the applicable organizational
penalty.... For violations of the accounting provisions assessed under § 2B1.1, the
procedure is generally the same, except that the specific offense characteristics differ. For
instance, for violations of the FCPA's accounting provisions, the offense level may be
increased if a substantial part of the scheme occurred outside the United States or if the

                                                                                                         629
GLOBAL CORRUPTION

 defendant was an officer or director of a publicly traded company at the time of the offense.
 For companies, the offense level is calculated pursuant to §§ 2C1.1 or 2B1.1 in the same
 way as for an individual--by starting with the base offense level and increasing it as
 warranted by any applicable specific offense characteristics. The organizational guidelines
 found in Chapter 8, however, provide the structure for determining the final advisory
 guideline fine range for organizations.

 ...

 Civil Penalties

 Although only DOJ has the authority to pursue criminal actions, both DOJ and SEC have
 civil enforcement authority under the FCPA. DOJ may pursue civil actions for anti-bribery
 violations by domestic concerns (and their officers, directors, employees, agents, or
 stockholders) and foreign nationals and companies for violations while in the United
 States, while SEC may pursue civil actions against issuers and their officers, directors,
 employees, agents, or stockholders for violations of the anti-bribery and the accounting
 provisions.

 For violations of the anti-bribery provisions, corporations and other business entities are
 subject to a civil penalty of up to $21,410 per violation. Individuals, including officers,
 directors, stockholders, and agents of companies, are similarly subject to a civil penalty of
 up to $21,410 per violation, which may not be paid by their employer or principal.

 For violations of the accounting provisions in district court actions, SEC may obtain a civil
 penalty not to exceed the greater of (a) the gross amount of the pecuniary gain to the
 defendant as a result of the violations or (b) a specified dollar limitation. The specified
 dollar limitations are based on the nature of the violation and potential risk to investors,
 ranging from $9,639 to $192,768 for an individual and $96,384 to $963,837 for a company.
 SEC may obtain civil penalties both in actions filed in federal court and in administrative
 proceedings. [footnotes omitted]

The size of penalties for FCPA cases has continued to increase. Eight of the ten largest
penalties have been imposed since 2017. Harry Cassin lists the top ten largest combined DOJ
and SEC penalties as of October 2020 in Table 7.5:

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

Several of these mega-corruption cases have also led to additional penalties imposed by
foreign jurisdictions. The Airbus SE case, currently ranked as the second largest FCPA
settlement, is one example. After four years of investigation, Airbus agreed to pay $4 billion
in fines to settle a four-year corruption investigation that spanned the globe. From 2004 to
2016, Airbus had bribed public officials in a number of countries to buy its satellites and
planes. In addition to penalties paid to the DOJ, Airbus agreed to pay 2.1 billion to French
authorities, as well a 991 million to the UK's Serious Fraud Office, to settle charges of
bribery. That said, the DOJ did agree to credit Airbus anything it paid to French authorities
(up to a total of $1.8 billion).54 Concurrent enforcement and carbon copy prosecutions are
discussed in Chapter 6, Section 7.

4.7 Comments on FCPA Enforcement

Bribery under the FCPA differs from bribery under 18 USC § 201, as confirmed recently in
United States of America v Ng Lap Seng.55 Ng Lap Seng paid two UN ambassadors in excess of
$1 million to secure a UN commitment to use his real estate development site for an annual
conference. The defendant was convicted of paying and conspiring to pay bribes and
gratuities in violation of 18 USC §§ 371, 666 and FCPA §§ 78dd-2, 78dd-3, along with related
money laundering charges. The District Court sentenced Seng to serve concurrent 48-month
prison terms on each of the six counts and had to forfeit $1.5 million along with paying a $1
million fine. Seng was also ordered to pay $302,977.20 in restitution to the UN. Seng
appealed the conviction based, in part, on an argument that jury instructions as to both § 666
and the FCPA were deficient after McDonnell. Seng argued that FCPA bribery and § 666
bribery require proof of an official act satisfying the McDonnell standard. The United States
Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit disagreed. It distinguished the decision in
McDonnell, holding that the FCPA, unlike 18 USC § 201, does not require any kind of "official
act."

It is also notable that FCPA enforcement typically takes a different form from enforcement
under the US Code. Deferred Prosecution Agreements (DPAs) and Non-Prosecution
Agreements (NPAs) have become the dominant method for resolving FCPA enforcement
actions, despite the fact that "such resolution vehicles are not subjected to any meaningful
judicial scrutiny."56 Almost all FCPA resolutions involve a DPA or NPA. Koehler states that
"nearly all corporate FCPA enforcement actions in this new era are negotiated behind closed
doors in the absence of meaningful judicial scrutiny."57 With DPAs, the DOJ calculates the

value of the benefit allegedly received in a non-transparent way, and when resolution is via
an NPA, the calculation of the fine amount is not transparent.58

Dylan Tokar v US Department of Justice59 evidences how difficult it can be to obtain a clear
view of the larger picture when a DPA is used. Dylan Tokar, a reporter for an anti-corruption
publication, sought records regarding the selection of corporate compliance monitors for
fifteen corporations who entered into DPAs with the DOJ to resolve FCPA cases. After
narrowing his request following discussions with the DOJ and even submitting a second
FOIA request for any objection letters filed by the relevant corporations, Mr. Tokar still had
not received any productions and filed a lawsuit. The DOJ eventually provided a table with
the information sought in his first response and the letters he had requested in his second,
but they contained redactions. The DOJ moved for summary judgement and Tokar cross-
moved for summary judgment challenging the redactions. The Court found that Mr. Tokar
was entitled not only to a table containing the information he had requested, but to the
relevant documents themselves. It also determined that the redaction of names/related
personal identifying information of individuals nominated but not selected to be monitors,
as well as their firms when those firms were small, was impermissible under either FOIA
exemption 6 or 7(c). The Court held:

          The Court concludes that while DOJ has demonstrated that these
          individuals have more than a de minimis privacy interest in their anonymity,
          the public interest in learning these individuals' identities outweighs that
          privacy interest, and therefore, the individuals' names and firms must be
          released.60

In its analysis, the Court commented:

          It is true, as DOJ points out, that Mr. Tokar would have had a much easier
          time learning about the inner workings of the monitor selection process if
          DOJ had simply responded to his initial FOIA request, rather than
          encouraging him to narrow its scope. However, the D.C. Circuit has
          recognized that "a relevant public interest could exist where [a list of names]
          might provide leads for an investigative reporter seeking to ferret out what
          government is up to".... This sort of aggregating, for the purpose of
          discovering what the government is up to, is precisely what Mr. Tokar
          intends to do here. Because Mr. Tokar has demonstrated that the release of
          even this small amount of information will serve the public interest, to an
          extent that outweighs the candidates for these lucrative positions' interest
          in keeping their identities secret, the Court finds the unselected candidates'
          names cannot be properly withheld pursuant to Exemption 6.61

In 2016 the DOJ introduced another form of enforcement under the FCPA, declination with
disgorgement letter agreements. Under these agreements, the resolving company agrees

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

that they will disgorge money to the DOJ and in exchange, the DOJ agrees to drop its
investigation of the alleged FCPA violations.62 While the introduction of such declination
agreements began as a pilot program, in November 2017, the DOJ announced it would add
a revised FCPA Corporate Enforcement Policy to the US Attorney's Manual that would
codify and expand on the pilot program.63 Under this policy, if a company voluntarily self-
discloses misconduct in an FCPA matter, fully cooperates, and remediates in a timely and
appropriate manner, the `presumption' is that the company will receive a declination, unless
aggravating circumstances respecting the nature of the offence or offender come to light.
The policy, updated in November 2019, clarifies what companies need to disclose and when.
Among other changes, the policy now requires that a company disclose "all relevant facts
known to it at the time of the disclosure,"64 recognizing that a company may not know all
relevant facts when it first discloses.

Koehler suggests these declinations make "the chance of judicial scrutiny of FCPA
enforcement theories ... even more remote." Namely, he expresses concern that such
agreements are informal, and "are even more bare-bones and replete with legal conclusions
compared to NPAs and DPAs as the substantive allegations are often just one paragraph."65

Despite these concerns, the DOJ continues to make use of declinations. On September 19,
2019, the DOJ declined to prosecute Quad/Graphics Inc. (Quad) for violations of §§ 78dd-l,
et seq, of the FCPA for bribery committed by employees of Quad's subsidiaries in China and
Peru. From 2011 until January 2016, Quad's Peruvian subsidiary paid or promised over
$1,000,000 to third party intermediaries in order to bribe government officials to secure
printing contracts and minimize penalty payments. From 2010 to 2015, Quad's subsidiary in
China also paid bribes to state-owned entities to obtain printing business. The DOJ declined
to prosecute based on Quad's prompt and voluntary self-disclosure, its thorough
investigation, its cooperation, the nature and seriousness of the offence, Quad's lack of prior
criminal history, its full remediation, including terminating the individuals involved and
enhancing its compliance program, and Quad's termination of its relationship with the
relevant third parties in Latin America and China. Finally, Quad had agreed to disgorge all
gains to the US Securities and Exchange Commission.66

In August 2020, the DOJ declined to prosecute World Acceptance Corporation (World) for
violations of §§ 78dd-l, et seq, of the FCPA related to bribery committed by World's
employees and subsidiaries in Mexico. From 2010 until 2017, World's subsidiary paid over
$4,000,000 to an intermediary to bribe Mexican union and government officials to obtain

directly from the unions, which withheld the amount from paychecks of union members. In
deciding not to prosecute, the DOJ took into account a number of factors: World's prompt
and voluntary self-disclosure, its full and proactive cooperation, the nature and seriousness
of the offence, World's full remediation, including additional training added to its
compliance program, the fact that World discontinued relationships with the Mexican third
parties, and the fact that World had agreed to disgorge to the US Securities and Exchange
Commission the full amount of its gains.67

5. UK SENTENCING

5.1 General Principles

Sentencing in the UK recently went through significant changes aimed at consolidating all
sentencing law into a single piece of legislation, the outcome of which was the Sentencing
Act 2020.68 The Sentencing Act came into force on December 1, 2020 and, with some
exceptions, applies to all defendants convicted after that date. It is made up of 14 Parts and
29 Schedules. Parts 2 to 13 set out the Sentencing Code, a set of procedural and sentencing
principles and disposals. Importantly, the Sentencing Code does not affect statutory
maximum sentences, does not allow a penalty greater than what could have been imposed
at the time the offence was committed, and does not extend minimum sentence provisions.
The Sentencing Council's sentencing guidelines also remain largely unaffected.69

Chapter 1 of Part 4 of the Sentencing Act sets out the purposes of sentencing. Section 57(2)
lists five purposes, which a court must consider, namely, punishment, reduction of crime,
reform and rehabilitation, protection of the public, and reparation. Chapter 3 of Part 4 deals
with the seriousness of an offence. Section 63 provides that in determining an offence's
seriousness, a court must consider both the offender's culpability and the harm or risk of
harm which the offence caused. Chapter 1 of Part 7 deals with the imposition of fines. Section
124 states that, before deciding on the amount of a fine, the court must inquire into the
financial circumstances of the offender. Section 125 further clarifies that a fine must reflect
the seriousness of the offence and take into account the circumstances of the case.

The sentencing structure for corruption-related offences specifically has also been modified
significantly in recent years. The Bribery Act 2010 introduced new penalties for corruption-
related offences. As the Bribery Act 2010 is not applied retrospectively, there are still
numerous cases before the courts that fall under a previous statute. The UK Sentencing

Council also introduced sentencing guidelines for corruption-related offences.70 These
guidelines are applicable to sentences imposed on or after October 1, 2014, regardless of
when the offences occurred. The UK also introduced deferred prosecution agreements
(DPAs) as an alternative disposition in corruption cases.

5.2 Sentencing before the Bribery Act 2010

Nicholls et al. described the sentences imposed in a number of corruption cases before the
enactment of the Bribery Act 2010. First, they summarize the sentences imposed on officials
such as police, prison, and immigration officers as follows:

          In those corruption cases involving public officials such as police or prison
          officers, it has been difficult to discern guidance on sentencing. In R v Donald
          a total sentence of eleven years (the court having imposed consecutive
          sentences) was upheld in the case of a detective constable who pleaded
          guilty late to four counts of corruption for agreeing to accept £50,000 (he
          only received £18,000) from a defendant for disclosing confidential
          information and destroying surveillance logs. In R v McGovern a defendant
          charged with burglary who offered a £200 bribe to a police officer had his
          sentence reduced by the Court of Appeal to nine months. In R v Oxdemir an
          offender who offered a free meal or £50 to a police officer for not reporting
          a driving offence had his sentence reduced to three months' imprisonment.
          In R v Garner the Court of Appeal upheld sentences of eighteen months and
          twelve months respectively imposed on prison officers who pleaded guilty
          to providing luxury items to a prisoner. A sentence of two years'
          imprisonment was imposed in a similar case. In R v Patel an immigration
          administrator was sentenced to two years' imprisonment for accepting a
          £500 bribe to stamp a passport granting leave to remain, and ordered to
          forfeit the bribe.

          In R v Hardy: Attorney General's Reference (No 1 of 2007) the defendant, a
          serving police officer, pleaded guilty to misfeasance in a public office after
          he befriended a known criminal and despite warnings from his superiors
          continued to associate with him and to pass on sensitive information about
          two individuals whom the criminal wanted to speak with over a drugs and
          assault matter. A sentence of eighteen months' custody was initially
          imposed but this was reduced to nine months suspended for two years plus
          community service due to time served on remand, service of unpaid work,
          and other factors. [footnotes omitted]71

Second, Nicholls et al. describe a number of sentences imposed in regard to corruption
involving public procurement:

          In other public official cases similar variations exist. In 1974, when the
          maximum sentence for an offence under the 1889 and 1906 Acts was two
          years, the architect, John Poulson, was sentenced to a total of seven years'
          imprisonment for paying bribes to members of Parliament, police officers,
          and health authorities to obtain building contracts. Dan Smith, the Labour
          leader of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, was sentenced to a total of six years'
          imprisonment and William Pottinger, a senior civil servant in the Scottish
          Office, was sentenced to a total of five years' imprisonment. In R v Foxley a
          71-year-old Ministry of Defence employee, convicted of four counts of
          corruption under the 1906 Act, was sentenced to four years' imprisonment
          for receiving over £2 million in the placing of defence contracts. A
          confiscation order was made for £1,503.901.08. In R v Dearnley and
          Threapleton a council employee and supplier of security services who was
          convicted of misrepresenting a loan to pay off a personal debt, had his
          sentence reduced to twelve months' imprisonment because of strong
          mitigation. In R v Allday, a case under the 1889 Act, council employees
          accepted bribes from waste contractors to tip waste. They were sentenced
          to eight and six months' imprisonment each and the contractors were
          sentenced to three months each. [footnotes omitted]72

5.3 Sentences under the Bribery Act 2010 (Pre-Guidelines)

The Bribery Act 2010 came into force on July 1, 2011. The Act sets out the general offences of
offering a bribe (section 1), being bribed (section 2) and bribery of foreign public officials
(section 6). Commercial organizations may also commit an offence under section 7 of the Act
if they fail to prevent bribery. Section 11 sets out maximum penalties for the offences:

          11 Penalties
                (1) An individual guilty of an offence under section 1, 2 or 6 is
                     liable--
                           (a) on summary conviction, to imprisonment for a term not
                                exceeding 12 months, or to a fine not exceeding the
                                statutory maximum, or to both,
                           (b) on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for a term
                                not exceeding 10 years, or to a fine, or to both.
                (2) Any other person guilty of an offence under section 1, 2 or 6 is
                     liable--
                           (a) on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding the
                                statutory maximum,
                           (b) on conviction on indictment, to a fine.

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

                (3) A person guilty of an offence under section 7 is liable on
                     conviction on indictment to a fine.

                (4) The reference in subsection (1)(a) to 12 months is to be read--
                           (a) in its application to England and Wales in relation to an
                                offence committed before the commencement of
                                paragraph 24(2) of Schedule 22 to the Sentencing Act 2020,
                                and
                           (b) in its application to Northern Ireland,

                     as a reference to 6 months.73

The maximum term of imprisonment for a summary conviction offence is twelve months in
England and Wales, and six months in Northern Ireland. The maximum statutory fine for a
summary conviction offence is £5,000 in England and Wales or Northern Ireland, and
£10,000 in Scotland. The maximum fine for an indictable offence is unlimited.

One of the first cases under the Bribery Act 2010 stemmed from an investigation into
Associated Octel Corporation, which subsequently changed its name to Innospec. As stated
by the Serious Fraud Office (SFO), "Innospec itself pleaded guilty in March 2010 to bribing
state officials in Indonesia and was fined $12.7 million in England with additional penalties
being imposed in the USA."74 Subsequently, in 2014, four individuals were sentenced for
their role in the corruption in both Indonesia and Iraq. Two of the defendants pled guilty
and two were tried and found guilty. The sentencing decision for these four individuals was
released on August 4, 2014, before the sentencing guidelines on bribery came into force on
October 1, 2014. The individuals and sentences were:

      Dennis Kerrison, 69, of Chertsey, Surrey, was sentenced to 4 years in prison.
      Paul Jennings, 57, of Neston, Cheshire, was sentenced to 2 years in prison.
      Miltiades Papachristos, 51 of Thessaloniki, Greece, was sentenced to 18 months in

          prison.
      David Turner, 59, of Newmarket, Suffolk, was sentenced to a 16-month suspended

          sentence with 300 hours unpaid work.75

In a case concerning Sustainable Agroenergy PLC, individuals received prison sentences
ranging from 6-13 years. The company operated a Ponzi scheme. Charges fell under multiple
statutes, including the Bribery Act 2010. The longest sentence was given to Chief Commercial
Officer, Gary West, who was convicted by a jury of bribery under the Bribery Act 2010 as
well as offences under the Criminal Law Act 1977 and the Companies Act 2006. West received

David Lufkin was the Global Head of Sales at Petrofac International Limited (Petrofac),
which provides various services to the oil and gas production and processing industry. In
this role Lufkin made significant bribes to influence contracts awarded between 2012 and
2015. The UK's SFO began investigations in 2017 and eventually charged Lufkin with 11
counts of bribery. The charges included paying $6,200,000 in bribes to secure two contracts
in Iraq worth a combined $729,700,000 and paying $91,000,000 to secure contracts worth
around $3,723,000,000 in Saudi Arabia.77 Lufkin pleaded guilty to these 11 counts, but the
SFO had not concluded its investigation. In January 2021, Lufkin pleaded guilty to three
more counts of bribery relating to corrupt offers and payments made between 2012 and 2018
to obtain contracts in the United Arab Emirates worth around $3,300,000,000. On October 4,
2021, Lufkin was sentenced to a suspended two year jail sentence. Petrofac was charged with
seven bribery-related offences and entered into a plea agreement with the SFO involving a
$64 million fine and a $31 million confiscation order. As of October 22, 2021, the SFO stated
that the case is still under investigation.78

In June 2019, Carole Hodson was sentenced to two years imprisonment, was disqualified as
a director for seven years, had a confiscation order of £4,494,541.46 imposed, and was
ordered to pay £478,351 in costs to the SFO. Hodson operated and was the majority owner
of ALCA Fasteners Ltd. In her capacity as Managing Director, Hodson paid nearly £300,000
in bribes between 2011 and 2016 in respect of a contract worth around £12,000,000.79

Mr. Wylie was the Director for Lakehouse, a housing services firm that installed fire alarms
in Grenfell tower. Wylie was in charge of fire safety contracts and, in that capacity, told
various subcontractors that they needed to pay him bribes to secure work. In total, these
bribes amounted to around £800,000. Wylie was sentenced to six years imprisonment for

bribery while the various contractors who paid him bribes were sentenced to suspended
sentences and ordered to pay costs.80

The majority of convictions under the Bribery Act 2010 have been of individuals, rather than
companies. Sweett Group PLC was the first company convicted under section 7. Media
allegations led to an internal investigation, which discovered that a subsidiary made corrupt
payments to help secure a contract in Abu Dhabi. The company admitted to failing to
prevent bribery and was sentenced to a fine of £1.4 million, a confiscation order of £850,000
and £95,000 in costs.81

More recently, the prosecution of Skansen Interiors Ltd. (Skansen) represents the first
contested prosecution under section 7. Skansen was a small British interior design company.
As part of a tender process, Skansen paid bribes totalling £39,000 to a former project manager
at a real estate company to secure an office refurbishment contract. Skansen defended itself
by referring to the policies and procedures it had before the bribes occurred. These policies,
one was even placed on the wall at the company's premises, made clear that staff should be
open and honest. Thanks to a newly-appointed CEO, Skansen caught the final payment of
£29,000 before it was paid. Skansen promptly fired the individual at fault and then reported
to the police, whose investigation it complied with fully. The jury was not convinced
Skansen had adequate procedures and delivered a guilty verdict. However, Skansen had
been dormant since mid-2014 and had no assets, so the judge was forced to impose an
absolute discharge.82

In February 2020, Kevin Herbert received a suspended sentence of two years imprisonment.
Herbert pleaded guilty to three offences under the Bribery Act 2010 after receiving and
soliciting bribes in a former role as purchasing and supply chain manager at Williams
Hybrid Power Ltd. between 2011 and 2013. Charges were also brought against two other
individuals who offered bribes and Williams Hybrid Power Ltd. itself (the third prosecution
for a section 7 offence). However, charges against the company and the two individuals were
stayed for lack of evidence.83

5.4 Guidelines for Offences by Human Offenders

The Sentencing Council published guidelines for fraud,84 bribery85 and money laundering86
offences (the Guidelines). These guidelines are applicable to sentences imposed on or after
October 1, 2014. For bribery offences, the Guidelines dictate sentences can range from a
discharge to eight years imprisonment.87 Money laundering offences are punishable by up
to 14 years imprisonment.88

Each of the guidelines lays out an eight-step process for determining the sentence for human
offenders:

                1) Step One - Determining the Offence Category
                2) Starting Point and Category Range
                3) Consider any factors which indicate a reduction such as assistance

                     to the prosecution
                4) Reduction for guilty pleas
                5) Totality Principle
                6) Confiscation, compensation and ancillary orders
                7) Reasons
                8) Consideration for time spent on bail.

Note: Guidelines for corporate offenders are set out in Section 5.5.

Each of the guidelines sets out a grid for determining a sentencing range based on a
combination of culpability and harm. Culpability is to be determined "by weighing up all
the factors of the case to determine the offender's role and the extent to which the offending
was planned and the sophistication with which it was carried out." Culpability is measured
in three levels: A (high culpability), B (medium culpability), and C (lesser culpability).

For bribery-related offences, harm is to be "assessed in relation to any impact caused by the
offending (whether to identifiable victims or in a wider context) and the actual or intended
gain to the offender. Harm is measured in four levels, listed as categories 1 (most serious) to
4 (least serious).89

On February 12, 2015, Nicholas and Christopher Smith, a father and son involved in a
printing business, were sentenced for corruption relating to bribery of officials in Kenya.91
The offenders were convicted under the Prevention of Corruption Act 1906, as the offences
pre-dated the Bribery Act 2010. However, since the sentencing post-dated October 1, 2014,
the Sentencing Council's new Guidelines applied. The sentencing decision provides one of
the first applications of the Guidelines.
Nicolas Smith received three years imprisonment, while Christopher Smith received 18
months imprisonment, which was suspended for two years on condition that he commit no
further offences. The suspended sentence was characterized by Higgins J as "an act of
mercy."92 Christopher was also sentenced to 250 hours unpaid work and a three-month
curfew. Both offenders were disqualified from being the director of a company for six years.

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

Later, the company received a fine of £2.2 million. Additionally, Nicholas and Christopher
were ordered to pay a confiscation order of £18,693 and £4,500 and each was ordered to pay
costs of £75,000.

The Smiths' corrupt activities followed a decision to expand their business into Africa.
Between 2006 and 2010, bribes were "routine and common place."93 The bribes included a
payment of £5,000 to a Kenyan government official, which was a large bribe in light of the
official's salary of £40,000. Other bribes included payments of just under £400,000 to receive
contracts worth £2 million. The pricing of the product was not elevated aside from the
bribery uplift. However, as the product included electoral ballot papers, the bribe risked
undermining the integrity of and confidence in the electoral system.

Using the Sentencing Council's Guidelines, Higgins J found that the level of culpability was
high based on four factors:

                1. A leading role was played
                2. There was intended corruption of a public official
                3. The offences were of a sophisticated nature
                4. The motive was for substantial financial gain94

Examining harm, Higgins J considered the fact that governance in Kenya and Mauritania
was undermined and financial gain for the Smiths was substantial, while a loss was incurred
by Kenya and Mauritania due to the inclusion of bribes in the price of products sold to those
countries. Higgins J found that the harm caused placed the offence in category 2, meaning
the offence fell under A(2) in the Guidelines. A(2) has a starting point of five years custody
and a range of three to six years custody (see the above excerpt from the Guidelines).

Based on the aggravating factors, which included negative impacts on good governance, the
cross-border nature of the offence, and the mitigating factors, which included good character
and Christopher Smith's health and age, Higgins J found that the "terms of A(2) should be
reduced."95 Nicholas Smith's sentence of three years imprisonment fell at the bottom end of
the range, while Christopher Smith's sentence fell below that range.

5.6 Deferred Prosecution Agreements

Like the US, the UK has begun utilizing DPAs as a method of disposition in corruption cases.
The first DPA was entered into with Standard Bank PLC, which was indicted for failing to
prevent corruption. Standard Bank agreed to pay $25.2 million to the UK and a further $7
million in compensation to the Government of Tanzania, as well as costs of £330,000.97 The
UK's second corruption-related DPA was entered into by a company that, at the time, could
not be named due to ongoing related prosecutions. This second DPA involved financial
orders of £6.5 million.98 In July 2019, this company was revealed to be Sarclad Ltd., a
technology company based in Rotherham.99 For further discussion of DPAs in the US and
UK, see Chapter 6, Sections 6.1 and 6.2 respectively.

                        CHAPTER 7 SANCTIONS & REMEDIES

6. CANADIAN SENTENCING

6.1 General Principles

The purpose and principles of sentencing are codified in sections 718-718.2 of the Canadian
Criminal Code.

Under section 718, the fundamental purpose of sentencing is to protect society and promote
respect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful, and safe society by imposing just
sanctions. The objectives of such sanctions include:

                (a) denouncing unlawful conduct and the harm done to victims and
                     the community;

                (b) deterring the offender and other persons from committing
                     offences;

                (c) separating offenders from society, where necessary;
                (d) rehabilitating offenders;
                (e) providing reparations for harm done to victims or to the

                     community; and
                (f) promoting a sense of responsibility in offenders, and

                     acknowledgement of the harm done to the victims and to the
                     community. 100

Section 718.1 sets out the fundamental principle of sentencing, namely, proportionality:

          718.1 A sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and
          degree of responsibility of the offender.101

Section 718.2 sets out several other sentencing principles:

                (1) aggravating and mitigating factors - sentences should be
                     increased or decreased to account for aggravating or mitigating
                     factors related to the offence or the offender;

                (2) parity - similar sentences for similar cases;
                (3) totality - where consecutive sentences are imposed, the combined

                     sentence should not be unduly long or harsh;
                (4) restraint - use least restrictive sanction that is reasonable and

                     appropriate in the circumstances.102

The courts have indicated that the objectives of denunciation and deterrence are usually
primary in sentencing bribery and corruption-related offences. The courts have remarked

101 Ibid at s 718.1.
102 Ibid at s 718.2(a)-(d).

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

that "[a]ll Canadians, and our society as a whole, are victims when public officials breach
the trust placed in them."103 In the context of bribery of a foreign official, our courts have
further observed that "bribes, besides being an embarrassment to all Canadians, prejudice
Canada's efforts to foster and promote effective governmental and commercial relations
with other countries."104

While the effectiveness of general deterrence is seriously questioned in the literature on
sentencing, courts nonetheless give considerable weight to deterrence on the basis of the
choice and risk-reward calculations that corruption offences frequently embody.105

6.2 Principles for Corporations and Other Organizations

Section 718.21 of the Criminal Code sets out additional factors to be considered when a court
is sentencing a corporation:

                (a) any advantage realized by the organization as a result of the
                     offence;

                (b) the degree of planning involved in carrying out the offence and
                     the duration and complexity of the offence;

                (c) whether the organization has attempted to conceal its assets, or
                     convert them, in order to show that it is not about to pay a fine or
                     make restitution;

                (d) the impact that the sentence would have on the economic viability
                     of the organization and the continued employment of its
                     employees;

                (e) the cost to the public authorities of the investigation and
                     prosecution of the offence;

                (f) any regulatory penalty imposed on the organization or one of its
                     representatives in respect of conduct that formed the basis of the
                     offence;

                (g) whether the organization was - or any of its representatives who
                     were involved in the commission of the offence were - convicted
                     of a similar offence or sanctioned by a regulatory body for similar
                     conduct;

                (h) any penalty imposed by the organization on a representative for
                     their role in the commission of the offence;

                (i) any restitution that the organization is ordered to make or any
                     amount that the organization has paid to a victim of the offence;
                     and

                (j) any measures that the organization has taken to reduce the
                     likelihood of it committing a subsequent offence.106

Corporations can be fined, placed on probation, or both, following a conviction. Section
732.1(3.1) sets out optional conditions that courts may incorporate into a probation order:

                (a) make restitution to a person for any loss or damage that they
                     suffered as a result of the offence;

                (b) establish policies, standards and procedures to reduce the
                     likelihood of the organization committing a subsequent offence;

                (c) communicate those policies, standards and procedures to its
                     representatives;

                (d) report to the court on the implementation of those policies,
                     standards and procedures;

                (e) identify the senior officer who is responsible for compliance with
                     those policies, standards and procedures;

                (f) provide, in the manner specified by the court, the following
                     information to the public, namely,

                           (i) the offence of which the organization was convicted,

                           (ii) the sentence imposed by the court, and

                           (iii) any measures that the organization is taking -- including
                                any policies, standards and procedures established under
                                paragraph (b) -- to reduce the likelihood of it committing
                                a subsequent offence; and

                (g) comply with any other reasonable conditions that the court
                     considers desirable to prevent the organization from committing
                     subsequent offences or to remedy the harm caused by the offence.

          (3.2) Before making an order under paragraph (3.1)(b), a court shall consider
          whether it would be more appropriate for another regulatory body to
          supervise the development or implementation of the policies, standards
          and procedures referred to in that paragraph.107

The Supreme Court of Canada recently affirmed that the constitutional protection against
cruel and unusual punishment does not apply to corporations.108 In Quebec v 9147-0732
Québec Inc, the accused corporation challenged the constitutionality of the mandatory
minimum fine imposed against it. The corporation argued that the fine contravened the right
"not to be subjected to any cruel and unusual treatment or punishment" guaranteed by
section 12 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

The Supreme Court of Canada unanimously rejected the argument.109 The majority and
concurring opinions all observed that the jurisprudence relates section 12 to "human
dignity"110 and, therefore, human beings. The majority and concurring opinions also held
that the existence of individuals behind the corporate veil is insufficient to allow a
corporation to claim section 12 protection, pointing to the concept of "separate legal
personality"111 in corporate law.

The decision is significant for at least two reasons. It adds some measure of certainty to the
sentencing of corporations, which relies on the imposition of fines as the primary sanction.
Additionally, it preserves the fundamental corporate law principle of separate legal
personality and, in doing so, removes "collateral consequences" as grounds for a
corporation to challenge a sentence.

6.3 Appropriate Range of Sentencing

Unlike the US or the UK, Canada does not have a sentencing commission or sentencing
guidelines. The type of sentence available is constrained only by statutory provisions and
the "appropriate range of sentencing" established through case law. The Criminal Code sets
out the maximum sentence for each offence. For some offences, a mandatory minimum is
prescribed. Common law may also define an "appropriate range of sentencing" for some
offences. These sentencing ranges are only guidelines and do not bind the court.112

For corruption offences, courts usually consider large bribes, bribes occurring over long
periods of time, and previous related convictions as aggravating factors. The courts typically
consider a guilty plea as a mitigating factor. Self-reporting, cooperating with authorities and
remorse are also frequently cited as mitigating factors in corruption cases.

Corruption cases are often settled through a guilty plea. It is common for the Crown
prosecutor and defence counsel to then make a joint submission on sentencing. The Supreme
Court of Canada has held that sentencing judges should not depart from a joint sentencing
submission "unless the proposed sentence would bring the administration of justice into
disrepute or is otherwise contrary to the public interest."113 While this does not completely
constrain judicial discretion, the sentencing judge must give counsel the opportunity to
make further submissions if the judge has concerns about the joint submission.114

6.4 Domestic Corruption and Bribery

As discussed in Chapter 2, the Criminal Code establishes several offences for domestic
corruption and bribery, including bribery of officers, frauds on the government, breach of
trust by a public officer, and accepting secret commissions.

Criminal Code bribery offences are punishable by fines at the discretion of the court and
maximum terms of imprisonment range from five to fourteen years. Bribery of judges,
politicians, and police officers is treated as the most serious type of offence and is punishable
by a maximum term of 14 years' imprisonment.115 The other bribery and corruption offences
are punishable by a maximum of five years' imprisonment.116

The court enjoys considerable discretion on sentencing. As discussed earlier, the court is
constrained only by the statute and the general principles of sentencing. Currently, domestic
bribery and corruption offences do not carry mandatory minimum penalties. There is also
no defined range of sentencing established in the jurisprudence. The sentencing judge may
order, with few exceptions, any sanction permitted under the Criminal Code.117

The sentencing jurisprudence is limited. However, as the cases reviewed below illustrate,
these offences are invariably treated as serious and substantial penalties are imposed.

      6.4.1 Bribery of Public Officers

In sentencing offences for the bribery of public officials, the courts have observed the
significant societal consequences of such wrongdoing. As stated by the Quebec Court of
Appeal, "[a]ny attempt to corrupt a police officer amounts to an attack on the integrity of an
important social institution. Where the purpose of the bribe is to pervert the course of justice,
especially in relation to a serious crime, the offenders must be severely punished."118

Bribery and attempted bribery of an officer is extremely serious, and general deterrence is
paramount in sentencing.119 A sentence of imprisonment often follows.

In R v Kozitsyn, the offender was found guilty of attempting to bribe a police officer. The
accused had twice offered bribes to a police officer in exchange for his forbearance from
issuing tickets to a massage parlour she had planned to purchase. Kozitsyn first offered to
make a charitable donation on the officer's behalf, and later offered the officer a portion of
the business revenues. Justice Bourque sentenced Kozitsyn to five months imprisonment,
followed by a period of 24 months of probation. The judge determined a prison sentence

115 Criminal Code, supra note 100, ss 119-20.
116 Ibid, ss 121-25, 426.
117 The exception is for convictions of bribery of judicial officers and bribery of officers. A conditional
sentencing order (i.e., house arrest) is not available for either of these offences. See Criminal Code,
supra note 100, s 742.1(c).

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

was required because of the nature of the offence and its "extremely significant effects on
our society."120

Conversely, when the accused is the officer who accepts or solicits a bribe, the breach of trust
is considered highly aggravating.121

In R v Morency,122 the accused, a Crown prosecutor, pled guilty to bribery of a judicial officer
and breach of trust by a public official. The accused accepted cash bribes in exchange for
dropping criminal charges. Justice Morand sentenced the accused to concurrent sentences
of three years imprisonment.

Justice Morand distilled the following principles from his review of 62 corruption-related
cases in which the offender was a public official such as a prosecutor, police officer or
politician:

                 Except in rare cases, the objectives of general deterrence and
                     societal condemnation are predominant;

                 In nearly a third of the decisions, the courts imposed conditional
                     sentence orders for periods varying between twelve months and
                     two years less one day, the average being around eighteen months;

                 In a majority of cases, the courts ordered prison sentences ranging
                     between three months and six years; the average was between two
                     and a half and three years, notwithstanding the presence of
                     numerous mitigating circumstances;

                 In most cases involving attorneys practising their profession,
                     judges insisted on the importance of using the prison sentence to
                     clearly express the seriousness of the offence when an officer of the
                     court who owes a duty of candour commits it.123

      6.4.2 Breach of Trust by a Public Officer

The range of sentencing for breach of trust by a public officer is broad. This breadth owes to
the different types of trust positions that an offender may hold and the different forms of
offending conduct.

Police officers are viewed as occupying a special position of trust in the community and the
administration of justice. In the absence of an exceptional mitigating factor, severe sentences
are justified to honour the primary principles of denunciation and general deterrence.124

In R c Applebaum,125 the accused was the interim mayor of Montréal. He accepted payments
from real estate developers and engineering firms in return for political influence and
favours while serving as borough mayor for a Montréal borough. He was sentenced to one
year in jail and two years' probation for accepting a bribe, breach of trust by a public officer,
and conspiring to commit a breach of trust by a public officer. The sentencing judge
remarked that an abuse of trust by a person in authority is reprehensible behaviour which
violates fundamental societal values.126

In R v Granger, the accused was sentenced to three years' imprisonment after pleading guilty
to breach of trust by a public officer, accepting a secret commission, and defrauding the
government.127 The accused was an Audit Team Leader with the Canada Revenue Agency.
The accused abused their position by illegally accessing tax records, generating a false audit,
reporting false information to police, facilitating an improper audit, and receiving over
CDN$1 million in secret commissions. The sentencing judge emphasized the need for
deterrence in the circumstances.128

      6.4.3 Corruptly Defrauding the Government

One form that fraud against the government can take is conferring benefits on government
employees. This was the case in R v Murray.129 Murray was the Director of Financial Services
for the Legislature in Newfoundland and Labrador. Murray falsified expense claims for his
benefit and for the benefit of certain legislators. The sentencing judge considered, as
aggravating factors, that the offender had breached a high level of trust and the offence
continued over a long period of time. While acknowledging "no sentence will fully satisfy
the debate generated by offences of this kind,"130 the judge accepted the joint submission on
sentencing of two years imprisonment, plus a two-year probation order and a restitution
order.

An example of a massive and sophisticated fraud against the government is the well-known
"federal sponsorship scandal," in Canada. In 1996, the Canadian federal government
established the sponsorship program, an initiative to promote federalism in the Province of
Quebec. The program existed until 2004 when widespread corruption was discovered. The
illicit activities included the misuse and misdirection of public funds, which were intended
for government advertising in Quebec. Several individuals were charged and convicted.131

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

On a sentencing appeal for one of the offenders, the Quebec Court of Appeal reversed the
trial judge's decision and substituted a sentence of 18 months' imprisonment.132 The Court
explained the severity of the offence by remarking that the "fallacious argument that
`stealing from the government is not really stealing' cannot be used to downplay the
significance of this crime.... Defrauding the government is equivalent to stealing from one's
fellow citizens."133

6.5 Corruption and Bribery of Foreign Public Officials

The CFPOA prohibits the bribery of foreign officials. As stated in Chapter 2, amendments to
the CFPOA in 2013 increased the maximum penalty for bribery of foreign officials from five
years imprisonment to fourteen years. As a result, conditional sentence orders and
conditional or absolute discharges are no longer available for the offences.134 At present,
fines for organizations convicted under the CFPOA have no upper limit.

To date, three corporations and four individuals have been sentenced for CFPOA offences.
As the case law remains limited, these early decisions could be foundational in shaping later
jurisprudence. Each case is briefly reviewed below.

R v Watts (Hydro Kleen)

The first corporation to be charged and convicted of a crime under the CFPOA was Hydro
Kleen.135 The company pled guilty to bribing a foreign official and was sentenced to pay a
fine of CDN$25,000.136

As part of the bribery scheme, Hydro Kleen hired an American immigration officer as a
"consultant" to facilitate easier passage of their employees into the US. Unbeknownst to the
company, the officer also made it more difficult for employees of its competitors to enter the
US. Under the scheme, Hydro Kleen paid CDN$28,299.98 to the officer.

The fine applied to Hydro Kleen was less than the bribe that the company paid, a point that
has subjected the decision to some criticism. Commentators have criticized the decision for

totalling over CDN$1.5 million and was sentenced to 42 months' imprisonment plus restitution); R v
Guité, 2006 QCCS 3927 (42 months' imprisonment after being convicted after trial by jury); R v Coffin,
2006 QCCA 471 (pled guilty to 15 counts and sentenced to 18 months' imprisonment); and R c
Corriveau, 2017 QCCS 173 (4 years' imprisonment and CDN$1.5 million fine).

failing to advance the objective of general deterrence. These commentators expressed
skepticism that the fine could serve as a general or specific deterrent.137

Hydro Kleen has not received much more favourable treatment by the courts. Only two
other corporations have been convicted under the CFPOA following Hydro Kleen.138 In both
cases, the sentencing court alludes to Hydro Kleen but declines to consider it in any depth.139

R v Niko Resources Ltd.

The first significant CFPOA conviction was in R v Niko Resources Ltd.140 Niko Resources pled
guilty to providing improper benefits to a foreign public official in Bangladesh. Niko
Bangladesh, a wholly owned subsidiary of Niko Resources, paid for and delivered a motor
vehicle worth CDN$190,948 and approximately CDN$5,000 in travel expenses to
Bangladesh's State Minister for Energy and Mineral Resources.

Justice Brooker accepted the joint submission and sentenced Niko Resources to pay a fine
and a victim surcharge141 totalling CDN$9.49 million.142 In addition, Niko Resources was
placed on probation for three years and was to bear the costs of the probation order.143 In
doing so, Justice Brooker expressed the gravity of the offence as follows:

137 OECD, Working Group on Bribery, Phase 3 Report on Implementing the OECD Anti-Bribery
Convention in Canada, (OECD, 2011) at para 58, online (pdf): <https://www.oecd.org/daf/anti-

International, [2013] AJ No 412 (QB) [Griffiths Energy]. For more discussion on Niko Resources, see
Chapters 2, 6, and 9. For further discussion of Griffiths Energy, see Chapter 6.
139 That said, the same judge presided over sentencing in both cases. It remains to be seen whether
the treatment of Hydro Kleen reflects the predilections of that particular sentencing judge or portends
a general trend of dismissing Hydro Kleen as unpersuasive. The latter is more likely, given the
broader critique of the decision.
140 Niko Resources, supra note 138.
141 Note that the victim surcharge contributes to provincial victim services rather than the victims of a
particular offence (which, in cases of foreign corrupt practices, would be citizens of the bribed
official's country).
142 Professor Poonam Puri notes that this sentence, when compared with R v Watts, is evidence of a
"troubling lack of consistency" in enforcement of the CFPOA. Hydro Kleen's fine was roughly equal
to the amount of its bribe, whereas Niko Resources was required to pay a $9.5 million fine for a
$200,000 bribe. See Jennifer Brown, "Are Anti-Corruption Laws Really Tackling the Problem?",
Canadian Lawyer (10 November 2014), online:
<https://www.canadianlawyermag.com/news/general/are-anti-corruption-laws-really-tackling-the-
problem/269591>. On the other hand, the same judge a year later in Griffiths Energy (discussed below)
imposed a fine of approximately $10 million for a $2 million bribe.
143 Niko Resources was required to adhere to compliance requirements in the probation order. Under
s 32.1 of the Criminal Code, courts may order implementation of policies or procedures to prevent
future crimes. Boisvert et al point out that such probation orders are underused and could provide a
valuable tool in foreign bribery cases: Anne-Marie Lynda Boisvert, Peter Dent & Ophelie Brunelle

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

          The bribing of a foreign public official by a Canadian public corporation is
          a very serious crime.... It is an insult to its shareholders and it besmirches
          the reputation of that Canadian corporation. It tarnishes the reputation of
          Alberta and of Canada ... [and] is an embarrassment to all Canadians.... It
          prejudices Canada's efforts to foster and promote effective governmental
          and commercial business relations with other countries.144

R v Griffiths Energy International

The second significant CFPOA conviction is R v Griffiths Energy International.145 Griffiths
Energy pled guilty to paying a bribe of over CDN$2 million to the wife of Chad's
ambassador to Canada. Griffiths Energy was sentenced to pay a CDN$9,000,000 fine plus a
15% victim surcharge for a total penalty of CDN$10,350,000.

Justice Brooker, who sentenced Niko Resources Ltd., was the sentencing judge in Griffiths
Energy. As in Niko Resources, he accepted the joint submission on sentencing and reiterated
the severity of the offence, as well as the primary objectives of denunciation and
deterrence.146

Griffiths Energy is notable for being the first case of self-reporting leading to a conviction,
which was a particularly salient feature in the sentencing decision. While the size of the bribe
was an aggravating factor, Justice Brooker noted "significant" countervailing mitigating
circumstances.147 The company had a new management team and when they discovered the
bribe, they acted quickly and decisively to investigate the matter. They subsequently self-
reported the crime.148

Less salient in the sentencing decision was the American authorities' submission to the
court. Justice Brooker declined to give much weight to this submission despite
acknowledging the lack of Canadian jurisprudence. In his view, the American authorities
were not helpful "given that the sentencing regime in the U.S. is quite different and involves
grids, offence levels, culpability scores and advisory ranges."149 However, Justice Brooker
took from the American authorities that self-reporting and cooperation should result in a
significant reduction in penalty.150 He concluded the proposed fine was appropriate.

R v Karigar

R v Karigar was the first conviction of an individual under the CFPOA and the first conviction
following a trial.151 The accused was sentenced to three years imprisonment for conspiring
to bribe foreign public officials.152

While acting as an agent for a Canadian company, Karigar, the accused conspired to offer
bribes to Air India officials and the Indian Minister of Civil Aviation to secure a multi-
million-dollar contract with Air India. Since Air India was an Indian state-owned
corporation, the targeted officials were "foreign public officials" for the purposes of the
CFPOA.

Justice Hackland recognized the limited jurisprudence under the CFPOA. Based on his
review of the previous CFPOA decisions, he held that bribery of foreign officials must be
viewed as a serious crime and the primary objectives of sentencing must be denunciation
and deterrence.153 He specifically cited Griffiths Energy and Niko Resources as establishing that
a "substantial" penalty must be imposed for the offence.154

To fill the jurisprudential gap, Justice Hackland relied on the text of the OECD Convention.
He referred to Article 3(1) of the OECD Convention to conclude that bribery of foreign public
officials should be subject to similar sanctions as domestic bribery offences.155

Justice Hackland found evidence from the OECD Working Group on Bribery (WGB) and the
US Sentencing Commission's Guidelines to be less helpful. The WGB's concerns about
Canada's enforcement leniency in Hydro Kleen, while helpful background, were not directly
relevant to sentencing.156 Furthermore, "the evidence of U.S. sentencing guidelines based on
tariffs and somewhat similar British guidelines are simply inapplicable in Canada."157

Justice Hackland reiterated the severity of the offence as reflected in its maximum penalty.
At the time, the amendments to the CFPOA increasing the maximum penalty were not in
force. Although the penalty could not be retroactively applied, it illustrated "Parliament's
recognition of the seriousness of this offence and of Canada's obligation to implement
appropriate sanctions."158

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

R v Barra and Govindia

R v Barra and Govindia arose out of the same bribery scheme in Karigar.159 The offenders were
each convicted of agreeing to bribe the Indian Minister of Civil Aviation.160 Justice Smith
sentenced each offender to 30 months' imprisonment.

Justice Smith accepted that the Karigar decision was the "benchmark" for sentencing Barra
and Govindia.161 However, he considered the offenders to have less moral blameworthiness
than Karigar. For instance, while Barra authorized substantial bribes, "he did not conceive
of or orchestrate the bribery and did not act with a complete sense of entitlement like Mr.
Karigar."162 While Govindia was an agent who agreed to pay substantial bribes to the
Minister, "he did not conceive of or orchestrate the bribery scheme like Mr. Karigar."163

In addition to denunciation and deterrence, the principles of parity, proportionality, and
restraint were applicable since the offenders had no criminal records.164 Aggravating factors
included the substantial amount of the bribe, the seriousness of the offence, and the
offenders' motivation of financial gain.165 Mitigating factors included that the offenders
lacked criminal records, cooperated with the Crown, and suffered adverse financial
consequences following the charges.166 In all the circumstances, Justice Smith concluded that
a sentence of 30 months' imprisonment was appropriate for Barra and Govindia.

R c Bebawi

R c Bebawi is the most recent conviction under the CFPOA.167 The accused was found guilty
following trial by jury on five counts relating to fraud, corruption of foreign officials, and
laundering the proceeds of crime in relation to SNC Lavalin Inc.'s activities in Libya. Bebawi
was sentenced to a concurrent sentence of eight years and six months' imprisonment.

Justice Cournoyer explained a severe penalty was required due to the presence of several
aggravating factors--the sophisticated nature of the fraud, the level of premeditation
required to execute it, as well as attempts to cover up sums of money from the RCMP. The
judge also cited a Supreme Court of Canada decision for the proposition that the criminal
law is a "system of values" and a "sentence which expresses denunciation is simply the
means by which these values are communicated."168

159 R v Barra and Govindia, 2019 ONSC 1786 [Barra and Govindia}.
160 The trial judge had acquitted the offenders for the charges relating to bribing the Air India
officials. The trial judge found the offenders lacked the requisite intent or knowledge for the offence.
He was unable to find that the defendants knew that the Air India employees were "foreign public
officials." See R v Barra and Govindia, 2018 ONSC 57.

Conclusion

The limited jurisprudence under the CFPOA makes it difficult to predict how sentencing
will be determined as more convictions are obtained.169 However, there appears to be a trend
of increased enforcement and several principles are emerging.

As substantial penalties become the norm, Hydro Kleen will likely be treated as an outlier.
Notwithstanding that, it was the first conviction under the CFPOA, Hydro Kleen has not been
regarded as persuasive in later cases. There is a manifest distinction between the level of
enforcement in Hydro Kleen and in subsequent decisions. The more recent authorities
illustrate a trend of increased enforcement and substantial sanctions for foreign bribery.

UK and American authorities are not persuasive in Canadian sentencing law. Sentencing
in Canada involves an exercise of greater discretion than in either the US or the UK.
Sentencing in the US and the UK requires an application of sentencing guidelines. For that
reason, authorities from those jurisdictions lack much relevance in the Canadian context.170

The gravity of the offence is the paramount consideration in sentencing and the principles
of denunciation and deterrence are primary. Given the dearth of sentencing authorities
under the CFPOA, Canadian sentencing judges have had to rely chiefly on first principles.
In doing so, the nascent jurisprudence has been guided by the seriousness of the offence and
the primary sentencing objectives of denunciation and general deterrence.

For individual offenders, the severity of the offence militates in favour of imprisonment.
Far from being a "victimless" crime, the courts view the victim of bribery and corruption to
be Canadian society as a whole. The courts recognize bribery offences undermine the
strength and legitimacy of public institutions, which has adverse consequences. On the other
hand, these crimes may not have a specific victim in a material sense. Perhaps the starkest
example of this is R v Barra and Govindia. In that case, the bribery attempt failed, and the
company went bankrupt after the unsuccessful bid. On the facts, Barra suffered the largest
financial loss. That Justice Smith would sentence Barra to 30 months' imprisonment suggests
the gravity of the offence is primary in sentencing this type of offence.

Canadian sentencing judges accept guilty pleas, cooperation, and subsequent measures
to improve CFPOA compliance as significant mitigating factors. This mirrors the
approaches taken in the US and UK. All three jurisdictions have recognized that the
complexity of corruption leads to difficulty in uncovering corruption offences, as well as
difficulties and costs in prosecuting these crimes.

169 As of writing, the RCMP recently announced charges had been laid against Damodar Arapakota
for bribing a public official from Botswana. It is alleged that Arapakota, a former executive from
IMEX Systems Inc., provided financial benefit for a Botswanan public official and his family. See

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

However, as discussed by Wendy Berman and Jonathan Wansbrough, the benefits of self-
reporting potential violations of the CFPOA are unclear due to limited jurisprudence and
the lack of formal guidelines on leniency and immunity for self-reporting companies and
individuals.171 Griffiths Energy self-reported and received a smaller fine in relation to its
bribe than Niko Resources, which cooperated, but did not self-report. However, other
mitigating factors were at play in Griffiths Energy, such as the company's contribution to
investigation costs. In Karigar, the mitigating effect of self-reporting was lessened by other
aggravating factors. This indicates that the benefit of self-reporting depends on the facts of
each case. Because of this uncertainty and lack of assurance, companies may be reluctant to
self-report breaches of the CFPOA. As mentioned in Section 8.6, some critics argue that the
appeal of self-reporting is further reduced by Canada's relatively harsh debarment
regime.172

6.6 Remediation Agreements

In 2018, amendments to the Criminal Code came into force establishing a DPA regime for
corporate wrongdoing in Canada.173 The Canadian legislation refers to DPAs as
"remediation agreements."

To be eligible for a remediation agreement, the accused must be an organization. A
remediation agreement may only be entered into for certain prescribed offences, including
bribery and fraud and CFPOA offences.

Crown prosecutors are responsible for negotiating remediation agreements, but several
preconditions must be met before doing so. As a threshold requirement, the Crown
prosecutor must be satisfied that there is a reasonable prospect of conviction.174 The Crown
prosecutor must be further satisfied that (1) the impugned conduct did not cause serious
bodily harm or death or injury to national defence or national security and was not
committed in association with a criminal organization or terrorist group, and (2) negotiating
a remediation agreement is in the public interest.175 If the Crown prosecutor is so satisfied,

they recommend to the Chief Federal Prosecutor that consent of the Attorney General be
sought. 176

The heart of the remediation agreement regime is consent from the Attorney General.177 The
Director of Public Prosecutions, on behalf of the Attorney General, makes the final decision
on whether to consent to invite an organization to negotiate a remediation agreement. The
decision of whether to enter settlement discussions falls within the ambit of prosecutorial
discretion.178 Where the Attorney General consents, the Director of Public Prosecutions
designates a Crown prosecutor for the purpose of negotiating the remediation agreement.179

Negotiated remediation agreements are subject to court approval.180 The court must approve
the agreement if it is satisfied that the agreement is in the public interest and the terms of
the agreement are fair, reasonable and proportionate to the gravity of the offence.181

Upon receiving court approval, prosecution against the accused organization is stayed,
subject to satisfaction of the terms of the remediation agreement. Approved remediation
agreements, including the statement of facts and admission of responsibility, are publicly
available, subject to a court sealing the record, and may be admissible as evidence in other
matters related to the underlying misconduct.

Most commentators and practitioners saw the introduction of a DPA regime as a welcome
development in Canada. However, to date, no remediation agreements have been
announced.

SNC-Lavalin Group Inc.

In 2019, the remediation agreement regime came under scrutiny when the efforts of SNC-
Lavalin Group Inc. (SNC) to seek a remediation agreement were made public. The Canadian
Director of Public Prosecutions declined to invite SNC to negotiate a remediation agreement
due to its ongoing connection with the foreign bribery and fraud charges. The then-Attorney
General alleged that the Prime Minister's Office attempted to interfere in the exercise of their
prosecutorial discretion by advocating that they reconsider the Director of Public
Prosecution's decision.

SNC-Lavalin and two of its subsidiaries, SNC-Lavalin International Inc. and SNC-Lavalin
Construction Inc. (SLCI), were charged with one count each of a violation of section 3(1)(b)

176 The Chief Federal Prosecutor conducts their own assessment and makes a recommendation to the
Deputy Director of Public Prosecutions. The Deputy Director of Public Prosecutions conducts an
objective assessment of the request to determine whether negotiation of a remediation agreement
will be recommended. In this role, the Deputy Director of Public Prosecutions exercises a challenge
function. See "Public Prosecution Service of Canada Deskbook: 3.21 Remediation Agreements"

of the CFPOA and one count each of fraud contrary to section 380(1)(a) of the Code. The
charges arose out of the company's dealings in Libya from 2001 until 2011 during the
Gaddafi regime.

After being denied a remediation agreement, SNC settled the criminal corruption charges
when its subsidiary, SLCI, pled guilty to a single charge of defrauding Libya contrary to
section 380 of the Code. As part of the settlement, SLCI was required to pay a CDN$280
million fine over five years and to comply with a three-year probation order.

The structure of the SNC plea agreement is noteworthy for several reasons:

     SLCI pled guilty to the charge of defrauding Libya contrary to section 380 of the

          Code. A violation of section 3 of the CFPOA results in a mandatory debarment of at
          least five, and up to ten, years. In contrast, a conviction for fraud contrary to section
          380 will result in debarment only if the fraud is committed against Canada. By
          pleading guilty to defrauding Libya, SLCI was not subject to debarment.

     SLCI, as a subsidiary of SNC, entered into the guilty plea and thus sanctions were

          imposed only on SLCI. In theory, the benefit of a subsidiary entering the guilty plea
          is that the parent avoids sanctions related to debarment, preserving their ability to
          bid on government contracts. However, as noted, the charge for which SLCI pled
          guilty did not result in debarment.

     The term of the probation order requires that SLCI "shall cause" SNC to maintain,

          and as required, further strengthen its compliance program, record keeping, and
          internal control standards and procedures. The legal effect of the words "shall
          cause," and how a subsidiary can cause their parent to maintain and strengthen its
          compliance program, is uncertain.

      Finally, the fine imposed on SLCI is much larger than any fine imposed under the
          CFPOA or any other domestic bribery offence, adding to the trend of increased
          enforcement in Canada.

Several questions arise out of the SNC plea agreement, particularly with respect to what it
portends for future plea deals or the nascent remediation agreement regime. Subsidiaries
entering guilty pleas on behalf of parents could become common. Subsidiaries could also
enter into remediation agreements on behalf of parent companies. Neither the Code nor any
Department of Justice policy suggests that a subsidiary is precluded from entering into a
remediation agreement on behalf of a parent company. As such, one could reasonably expect
that some future remediation agreements will be modelled on the SNC plea arrangement.

Current State of Remediation Agreements

As of writing, no remediation agreements have been concluded in Canada. Kathleen
Roussel, the current Director of Public Prosecutions, nevertheless provided comments in an

interview, suggesting how remediation agreements may be utilized in the future.182 Roussel
remarked that Canada is not likely to grant remediation agreements to repeat offenders,
noting it would be "very unusual" for a company to benefit twice from a remediation
agreement. Instead, she viewed the prosecutorial tool as a "one-time thing,"
notwithstanding that such a limitation is not prescribed in the legislation. The Director of
Public Prosecutions was cognizant that the first remediation agreement would inevitably be
a precedent. Roussel suggested that it was not in the public interest to enter a remediation
agreement with SNC given the severity and breadth of their conduct.

7. CRIMINAL FORFEITURE

Criminal forfeiture is introduced in a general way in Chapter 5, Section 2.4.1. The laws and
procedures for criminal forfeiture under UNCAC and the OECD Convention and in the
US, UK and Canada are discussed in Chapter 5, Sections 3.1, 3.2, 5.1, 5.2, and 5.3
respectively.

8. DEBARMENT AS A COLLATERAL CONSEQUENCE

Debarment is a sanctioning tool by which an individual or corporation convicted of a
corruption offence may face a period of ineligibility from bidding on government
contracts. For companies that rely on public contracts and tenders as a large portion of
their business, the prospect of debarment is a significant deterrent and punishment.183 For
example, after debarment, a company may lose clients, suffer reputational damage, face
insolvency or even go out of business.184 The debarment process can be complex and
multiple variables must be considered, such as the length of the debarment, whether it is
automatic or discretionary, and the jurisdictions and organizations where the
debarment applies.185 Moreover, the impact of debarment can be multiplied by
cross-debarment whereby departments, governments or other institutions or
organizations agree to mutually enforce each other's debarment actions. One such
example is a cross-debarment agreement between the Multilateral Development
Banks (MDBs), consisting of the African Development Bank Group, Asian
Development Bank, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, Inter-
American Development Bank and the World Bank Group. As stated by the MDBs,
"cross debarment creates a formidable additional deterrent to firms and individuals

8.1 UNCAC

Article 34 of UNCAC provides as follows:

          With due regard to the rights of third parties acquired in good faith, each
          State Party shall take measures, in accordance with the fundamental
          principles of its domestic law, to address consequences of corruption. In this
          context, States Parties may consider corruption a relevant factor in legal
          proceedings to annul or rescind a contract, withdraw a concession or other
          similar instrument or take any other remedial action.187

The reference in Article 34 to "any other remedial action" is broad enough to include
debarment of offenders from participation in public procurement.

8.2 OECD Convention

Article 3 of the OECD Convention provides in part:

          Sanctions

          4. Each Party shall consider the imposition of additional civil or
               administrative sanctions upon a person subject to sanctions for the
               bribery of a foreign public official.

The commentary on this section reads:

          24. Among the civil or administrative sanctions, other than non-criminal
          fines, which might be imposed upon legal persons for an act of bribery of a
          foreign public official are: exclusion from entitlement to public benefits or
          aid; temporary or permanent disqualification from participation in public
          procurement or from the practice of other commercial activities; placing
          under judicial supervision; and a judicial winding-up order. [emphasis

8.3 World Bank

The World Bank, a supra-national organization set up by member states, is composed of the
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and the International
Development Association (IDA). The World Bank Group consists of the World Bank and
three other supra-national agencies: the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the
Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), and the International Centre for
Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID).

The World Bank and the World Bank Group provide billions of dollars in loans to
developing countries every year, funding large-scale infrastructure projects throughout the
developing world. To preserve the integrity of these projects, the World Bank has developed
its own sanctions system. Although the World Bank cannot impose criminal sanctions,
debarment from bidding on World Bank-financed projects provides a powerful policy tool
and is the World Bank's "baseline" sanction.189 Such sanctions have been applied with
considerable frequency. For example, between 2007 and 2017, the World Bank debarred or
otherwise sanctioned 489 firms and individuals.190 In the World Bank president's 2011
address, then-president Robert B. Zoellichk emphasized the important role that debarment
and other sanctions play in deterring fraud, collusion and corruption:

          For more than 10 years, our sanctions system has played a crucial role
          within the Bank Group's anticorruption efforts. Sanctions protect Bank
          Group funds and member countries' development projects by excluding
          proven wrongdoers from our operations and financing. Sanctions also deter
          other participants or potential bidders in Bank Group-financed operations
          from engaging in fraud, collusion, or corruption. By holding companies and
          individuals accountable through a fair and robust process, the Bank
          Group's sanctions system promotes integrity and levels the playing field for
          those committed to clean business practices.

          Being in the forefront of antifraud and anticorruption efforts among
          multilateral development institutions, the Bank Group has continually
          explored new structures and strategies to deal most effectively with
          allegations of fraud and corruption. These efforts led, for instance, to the

          establishment of the Sanctions Board in 2007 as a new and independent
          body providing final appellate review. Composed of a majority of external
          members since its establishment, the Sanctions Board has also been led by
          an external Chair since 2009. The Bank Group worked with the regional
          multilateral development banks to reach a groundbreaking agreement on
          cross-debarment in 2010. Those who cheat and steal from one will be
          debarred by all. Most recently, the Bank Group took a major step toward
          greater transparency and accountability by authorizing the publication of
          decisions in new sanctions cases initiated in 2011 and onward.191

The World Bank summarizes its sanctions process as follows:

          One way that the World Bank Group combats corruption is through the use
          of administrative sanctions against firms or individuals who have engaged
          in fraud, corruption, coercion, collusion or obstruction (referred to
          collectively as Sanctionable Practices) in connection with World Bank-
          financed projects. The sanctions regime is designed to protect the funds
          entrusted to the World Bank, while offering the firms and individuals
          involved an opportunity to respond to the allegations against them.

          ...

          Allegations that a firm or individual engaged in a Sanctionable Practice are
          investigated by the World Bank Group's Integrity Vice Presidency
          (INT). If INT believes there is sufficient evidence to substantiate the
          allegations, the case is referred to the Office of Suspension and Debarment
          (OSD)*--the first tier of the Bank's two-tier administrative sanctions
          process.

          The SDO reviews the evidence submitted by INT and determines if the
          evidence is sufficient to support a finding that the alleged Sanctionable
          Practice occurred. If so, the SDO issues a Notice of Sanctions Proceedings to
          the firm or individual alleged to have engaged in the Sanctionable Practice
          (the respondent). The Notice includes the allegations, the evidence as
          submitted by INT, and a recommended sanction. The SDO may also
          recommend the imposition of sanctions on affiliates of the respondent.
          Upon issuance of the Notice, the SDO temporarily suspends the respondent
          from eligibility for new World Bank-financed contracts, pending the final
          outcome of the sanctions process.

          The respondent can choose not to contest the allegations or the
          recommended sanction, in which case the sanction recommended by the
          SDO is imposed. If the firm or individual contests the allegations or the
          recommended sanction, the case is referred to the World Bank Group

          Sanctions Board--the second tier of the Bank's two-tier administrative
          sanctions process.

          The Sanctions Board carries out a full de novo review in each contested case.
          It is not bound by the SDO's/EO's recommendation. An administrative
          hearing may be held by the Sanctions Board either upon a party's request
          or at the discretion of the Sanctions Board Chair. In its deliberations, the
          Sanctions Board considers INT's allegations and evidence as attached to the
          Notice of Sanctions Proceedings; the respondent's arguments and evidence
          submitted in response to INT's allegations and evidence; INT's reply brief;
          the parties' presentations at a hearing, if applicable; and any other materials
          contained in the record.

          After completing its review, the Sanctions Board determines whether it is
          "more likely than not" that the respondent engaged in a sanctionable
          practice. If so, the Sanctions Board imposes one or more ... sanctions, which
          may extend to a respondent's affiliates, successors and assigns. The
          decisions of the Sanctions Board are final and non-appealable.192

The Sanctions Board exercises discretion in determining an appropriate sanction. The
available sanctions are described in the World Bank Sanctioning Guidelines:

          I. Base Sanction: The base sanction for all misconduct is 3 year debarment
          with conditional release.

          II. Range of Sanction

          A. Debarment with Conditional Release: Debarment with conditional
          release is the `baseline' sanction which should normally be applied absent
          the considerations that would justify another sanction as outlined in
          paragraphs B though F below. The purpose of the conditional release is to
          encourage the respondent's rehabilitation, to mitigate further risk to Bank-
          financed activities. Accordingly, the respondent will only be released from
          debarment after (i) the defined debarment period lapses, and (ii) the
          respondent has demonstrated that it has met the conditions set by the EO
          or Sanctions Board and detailed by the Integrity Compliance Officer.

          ...

          Conditions imposed may include:

          i) Implementation or improvement of an integrity compliance program; and

          ii) Remedial measures to address the misconduct for which the respondent
          was sanctioned, including disciplinary action or termination of
          employee(s)/officer(s) responsible for the misconduct.

                                                                                                          671
GLOBAL CORRUPTION

          The Integrity Compliance Officer verifies whether conditions have been
          met. Determinations of compliance by the Compliance Officer are subject to
          appeal to the Sanctions Board in accordance with the Sanctions Procedures.

          B. Debarment: The Bank may apply this sanction if there would be no
          reasonable purpose served by imposing conditions. This would occur, for
          example, in cases where a sanctioned firm has already in place a robust
          corporate compliance program, the Sanctionable Practice involved the
          isolated acts of an employee or employees who have already been
          terminated, and the proposed debarment is for a relative short period of
          time (e.g., one year or less).

          C. Conditional Non-Debarment: Generally, the Bank may apply this
          sanction, consistent with the Bank's fiduciary obligations and the goals of
          specific and general deterrence, to:

          i) sanctioned parties affiliated with the respondent that are not directly
          involved in the Sanctionable Practice in which the respondent has engaged,
          but which bear some responsibility thereof, through, for example, a
          systemic lack of oversight; or

          ii) respondents that have demonstrated that they have taken comprehensive
          corrective measures and that such other mitigating factors apply ... so as to
          justify non-debarment.

          The conditions imposed will likely be similar to those imposed under
          debarment with conditional release. In the event that the sanctioned party
          fails to demonstrate compliance with the conditions within the time periods
          established by the Sanctions Board, a debarment would automatically
          become effective for a period of time established by the EO and/or Sanctions
          Board.

          D. Letter of Reprimand: A Letter of Reprimand should most often be used
          to sanction an affiliate of the Respondent that was only guilty of an isolated
          incident of lack of oversight.

          E. Permanent Debarment: Permanent debarment is generally only
          appropriate in cases where it is believed that there are no reasonable
          grounds for thinking that the respondent can be rehabilitated through
          compliance or other conditionalities. It is anticipated that permanent
          debarment would most commonly be applied to natural persons, closely
          held companies by such persons and shell companies.

          F. Restitution and other Remedies: Restitution, as well as financial and
          other remedies, may be used in exceptional circumstances, including those

          involving fraud in contract execution where there is a quantifiable amount
          to be restored to the client country or project.193

In light of the gravity of the consequences of a World Bank debarment, some lawyers,
particularly defence counsel in the US, are wary of the fact that the World Bank is not
required to follow any country's rules of procedure or to subscribe to American concepts of
due process.194 However, it may fairly be said that the World Bank's procedures do contain
a healthy dose of due process.

8.4 US

Under the US Federal Acquisition Regulations, an individual or corporation can be debarred
from federal contracts for a number of reasons, including bribery or the commission of an
offence indicating a lack of business integrity. Debarment from one government agency
typically results in debarment from other agencies.195 In May 2014, the Government
Accountability Office reported a dramatic increase in suspension and debarment actions,
increasing from 19 in 2009 to 271 in 2013.196 The Interagency Suspension and Debarment
Committee's Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 Report noted that "the total number of suspensions,
proposed debarments, and debarments in FY 2019 represents nearly double the activity level
reported in FY 2009."197

The decision to debar is not made by the DOJ or SEC, but rather designated officials in other
affected agencies. The decision to debar is always discretionary. As the US debarment
regulations state:

          It is the debarring official's responsibility to determine whether debarment
          is in the Government's interest. The debarring official may, in the public
          interest, debar a contractor for any of the causes in 9.406-2, using the
          procedures in 9.406-3. The existence of a cause for debarment, however,
          does not necessarily require that the contractor be debarred; the seriousness

          of the contractor's acts or omissions and any remedial measures or
          mitigating factors should be considered in making any debarment
          decision.198

Causes for debarment include a conviction or civil judgment for commission of fraud or a
criminal offence in conjunction with obtaining, attempting to obtain or performing a public
contract or sub-contract; commission of an offence indicating a lack of business integrity;
and violating federal criminal law involving fraud, conflict of interest or gratuity
violations.199

Factors considered by the debarment official include standards of conduct and internal
controls, self-reporting in a timely manner, internal investigation, cooperation with external
investigation, payment of any fines, disciplinary actions, and remedial measures.200

The regulations state that the period of debarment shall be commensurate with the
seriousness of the cause(s) and generally should not exceed three years. The period can be
extended if necessary to protect government interests. Contractors can request a reduction
based on reasons including a reversal of a conviction or civil judgment, a bona fide change
in ownership or management and elimination of other causes for which debarment was
imposed.201

In addition to public procurement debarment, FCPA violations may lead to ineligibility to
receive export licenses, SEC suspension, and debarment from the securities industry.202

8.5 UK

The UK "exclusion" (i.e., debarment) regime is contained in the Public Contracts Regulations
2015.203 This regime includes both mandatory and discretionary exclusions, as well as "self-
cleaning" provisions designed to encourage companies to take proactive measures to
remedy past wrongdoings and prevent future wrongdoing.

Beginning with mandatory exclusions, Regulation 57(1) provides that contracting
authorities shall exclude an "economic operator" from participation in a procurement
procedure where they have established that the economic operator has been convicted of

excluded when they are in breach of their obligations relating to the payment of taxes or
social security contributions and that breach has been proven by a judicial or administrative
decision. However, Regulation 57(6) provides that a contracting authority may disregard a
mandatory exclusion "for overriding reasons relating to the public interest such as public
health or protection of the environment." This exclusion might be invoked, for example,
where medical supplies are required on an urgent basis, and the economic operator in
question is the only one capable of providing those supplies.

Regulation 57(8) sets out discretionary exclusions, including:

           where the economic operator is bankrupt;

           where the contracting authority considers the economic operator to be
                guilty of "grave professional misconduct" that "renders its integrity
                questionable;"

           where the contracting authority has "sufficiently plausible" indications to
                conclude that the economic operator has entered into agreements with
                others aimed at distorting competition;

           where the economic operator has shown "significant or persistent
                deficiencies in the performance of a substantive requirement under a prior
                public contract" that "led to early termination ... damages or other
                comparable sanctions;"

           where the economic operator has been guilty of serious misrepresentation
                or has withheld information; or

           where the economic operator has undertaken to unduly influence the
                decision-making process of the contracting authority.204

Some of these discretionary exclusions may be criticized as being too subjective or
ambiguous (e.g., the exclusion relating to "grave professional misconduct" that "renders
[the economic operator's] integrity questionable," and the exclusion relating to "sufficiently
plausible" indications that the economic operator has entered into agreements to distort
competition). Moreover, the Regulations do not provide guidance on the factors that should
guide contracting authorities in deciding whether to exercise their discretion, nor do they
require contracting authorities to provide reasons for such a decision. This may result in a
lack of predictability for economic operators and/or a lack of procedural fairness. On the
other hand, these concerns must be balanced against the need for flexibility, which is an
important component of a sound public procurement framework.

Regulation 57(11) provides that the mandatory exclusions generally apply for five years
from the date of conviction. Regulation 57(12) provides that the discretionary exclusions
generally apply for three years from the date of the relevant event. The seemingly rigid
nature of these provisions is moderated by the "self-cleaning" provisions discussed below.

204 Ibid, Reg 57(8).

                                                                                                          675
GLOBAL CORRUPTION

The Regulations contain "self-cleaning" provisions designed to encourage companies to take
proactive measures to remedy past wrongdoing and prevent future wrongdoing. Regulation
57(13) stipulates that an economic operator may provide evidence that it has taken measures
sufficient to demonstrate its reliability despite the existence of a relevant ground for
exclusion. Regulation 57(14) provides that if the contracting authority considers such
evidence to be sufficient, it shall not exclude the economic operator from the procurement
procedure. To meet this threshold, the economic operator must prove, pursuant to
Regulation 57(15), that it has:

          (a) paid or undertaken to pay compensation in respect of any damage caused
          by the criminal offence or misconduct;

          (b) clarified the facts and circumstances in a comprehensive manner by
          actively collaborating with the investigating authorities; and

          (c) taken concrete technical, organisational and personnel measures that are
          appropriate to prevent further criminal offences or misconduct.205

The law firm Norton Rose Fulbright suggests "[e]ffective self-cleaning measures are likely
to require a company to invest a considerable amount of time and money into the process
and may lead contracting public authorities to insist that companies appoint independent
monitors to supervise the process."206 The firm also suggests that the "self-cleaning"
provisions may create a "credible incentive for companies to self-report."207 Indeed, the self-
cleaning provisions are a welcome development that recognizes the importance of
encouraging companies to take appropriate measures to rectify past wrongs, cooperate with
authorities and take proactive measures to prevent future wrongdoing.

As discussed in Chapter 12, Section 6.3, in the wake of the UK's exit from the EU, the UK
government proposed an "overhaul" of the UK's public procurement regime.208
Consequently, the provisions summarized above may be replaced by a new framework.
Scholars have observed that the UK's exit from the EU provides an opportunity for the UK
to develop a stronger exclusion regime.209 For example, Sue Arrowsmith argues that "there
should be centrally-administered mandatory exclusions for integrity breaches, which should
cover wider grounds than current mandatory exclusions and should not be limited to cases
where the supplier has a criminal conviction or other formal judgment against it."210 Given
the UK government's indication that it intends to create a new public procurement

8.6 Canada

Public Services and Procurement Canada (PSPC), formerly Public Works and Government
Services Canada (PWGSC), is responsible for acquiring goods and services on behalf of the
departments and agencies of the Government of Canada. PSPC handles a large number of
contracts and manages an annual budget of over $4 billion.211 It is also responsible for
administering the federal government's debarment policies.

PSPC has developed a robust framework to support accountability and integrity in its
procurement process. This framework includes policies, procedures and governance
measures designed to ensure fairness, openness and transparency. The framework is not,
however, free from criticism, and its history is complicated. Its history reflects a trend of
increasing formality and severity, followed by attempts to introduce greater flexibility in
response to criticism from businesses, NGOs and other organizations, all while maintaining
a strong, predictable approach to debarment.212

In November 2007, PSPC began including a Code of Conduct for Procurement in its solicitation
documents.213 This code included provisions relating to debarment. The intent was to use
debarment to ensure that government contracts are awarded only to "reliable and
dependable" contractors. The primary purpose of debarment was seen as preserving the
integrity of the public procurement process.

In October 2010, PSPC added the following categories of offences that would render
suppliers ineligible to bid on procurement contracts:

          (a) corruption;
          (b) collusion;

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

          (c) bid-rigging; or
          (d) any other anti-competitive activity.214

In July 2012, PSPC established a formal "Integrity Framework" for PSPC procurement. This
framework set out a rules-based system that left no room for the exercise of discretion with
respect to debarment. It provided for automatic disqualification from bidding on public
contracts if the company or any of its affiliates was convicted of any listed Canadian offence.
Initially, conviction under a foreign offence did not result in automatic ineligibility. In
addition to the offences set out in its previous debarment policies, PSPC added the following
new categories of offences:

          (i) fraud;
          (ii) money laundering;
          (iii) participation in activities of criminal organizations;
          (iv) income and excise tax evasion;
          (v) bribing a foreign public official (e.g., contrary to Canada's Corruption of Foreign

                Public Officials Act); and
          (vi) drug-related offences.215

In March 2014, PSPC introduced several fundamental changes to the Integrity Framework.
PSPC added the following new categories of offences:

      extortion;
      bribery of judicial officers;
      bribery of officers;
      secret commissions;
      criminal breach of contract;
      fraudulent manipulation of stock exchange transactions;
      prohibited insider trading;
      forgery and other offences resembling forgery; and
      falsification of books and documents.216

PSPC also amended the Integrity Framework such that convictions under offences in foreign
jurisdictions that are "similar" to the listed Canadian offences would result in ineligibility.

its debarment under the "similar offences" provision of the Integrity Framework.217 Siemens
paid a $1.6 billion fine after pleading guilty to corruption-related offences in 2008 in the US
and Germany.218

PSPC introduced a new automatic ineligibility period: all suppliers convicted of a relevant
offence are automatically debarred for ten years. Once the ten-year debarment period
passed, bidders are required to certify that adequate measures were established to avoid
recurrence. Prime contractors are also required to apply the provisions of the Integrity
Framework to their subcontractors.

The March 2014 expansion proved highly controversial. Businesses, NGOs, and bar
associations argued that Canada's Integrity Framework had become so inflexible, punitive
and far-reaching that it had become counterproductive to its primary objective--namely,
preserving the integrity of the public procurement process. Key criticisms included the
following:

      The strictness of the Integrity Framework could deprive the government, and the
          taxpaying public, of certain specialized expertise and high-quality goods and
          services.

      The policy's harshness and inflexibility discouraged companies from
          acknowledging and remediating wrongdoing. Companies were not offered strong
          incentives to cooperate with authorities or to seek to bring about wide-ranging
          cultural reforms within the corporation.

      The mandatory ten-year ineligibility period failed to provide any scope for
          reduction or leniency in light of the gravity of the offence or the supplier's
          remediation efforts. This rigid stance stood in contrast with the more flexible,
          forgiving position taken in the US, the EU and other jurisdictions whose
          procurement regimes grant credit for mitigating circumstances and remediation
          efforts. Notably, Transparency International Canada criticized the finality and
          rigidity of the ten-year debarment policy, pointing out that the World Bank's
          debarment policy "provides for regular third-party reviews of a company's
          compliance measures which provide an opportunity for the World Bank to
          determine if the company's debarment should be lifted."219

      Debarment based on the commission of "similar" foreign offences, with PSPC
          being the arbiter of what constitutes a "similar" foreign offence, was seen as being
          too subjective. In many cases, it could not be said with any certainty whether a

          particular foreign offence would be sufficiently "similar" to be captured under the
          Integrity Framework. Furthermore, concerns were raised about the unfairness of
          the severe consequences that would follow if a company were to be convicted in a
          foreign jurisdiction under circumstances that, in Canada, would be seen as unfair
          or unjust. Such a conviction would result in the company being debarred in
          Canada without having a meaningful opportunity to contest the unfair conviction.

      The foreign affiliates policy meant that law-abiding Canadian companies could be
          held responsible for a distant affiliate's criminal conduct occurring abroad in
          circumstances where the Canadian company had no participation or involvement.
          This policy came under considerable scrutiny after PSPC announced that it was
          investigating whether Hewlett Packard, the Government of Canada's largest
          computer hardware supplier, might be at risk of debarment due to the actions of
          an overseas affiliate.220 In 2014, a Russian subsidiary of Hewlett Packard entered a
          guilty plea in the US for violating FCPA anti-bribery provisions.221 Executives of
          the Russian subsidiary had bribed Russian government officials to secure
          government contracts. It soon became apparent that, in light of the Integrity
          Framework's provisions regarding "similar foreign offences" and affiliate
          responsibility, Hewlett Packard might be debarred in Canada. Although fears over
          Hewlett Packard's potential debarment were never realized, the notion that an
          important and well-respected government supplier might be debarred for ten
          years, with existing contracts being either terminated or continued under strict
          monitoring, raised eyebrows.

In November 2014, The Globe and Mail reported that the federal government might face a
challenge from the World Trade Organization and NAFTA investor lawsuits due to the
strictness of Canada's debarment rules.222 Further concerns were expressed over the
implications for trade. The severity of Canada's debarment policy gave rise to the possibility
that Canadian companies could face "tit-for-tat retaliation" by countries in which major
companies that had been debarred in Canada are headquartered.223

In response to these and other criticisms, PSPC replaced the "Integrity Framework" with a
new, government-wide "Integrity Regime" on July 3, 2015.224 The Integrity Regime
emphasizes the importance of fostering ethical business practices, ensuring due process for
suppliers, and upholding the public trust in the procurement process. The key elements of
the current Integrity Framework are as follows:

      The Integrity Regime is administered by PSPC on behalf of the Canadian
          government. Other government departments and agencies may apply this regime

          to their solicitations and contracts pursuant to memoranda of understanding with
          PSPC.

      The Integrity Regime applies government-wide to procurement and real property
          transactions over CDN$10,000 (as well as any other contract that incorporates the
          regime by reference), subject to specified exceptions.

      The following circumstances automatically lead to a determination of ineligibility:

                o the supplier has been convicted of an offence that results in a loss of
                     capacity to contract with Her Majesty (ineligibility period: as long as the
                     supplier lacks capacity);

                o the supplier has been convicted of any listed bribery, extortion, forgery,
                     fraud, insider trading, falsification of books and records, money
                     laundering, conspiracy, bid rigging, drug trafficking, lobbying or other
                     listed offence (ineligibility period: ten years, with the possibility of a
                     reduction of up to five years under an administrative agreement);

                o the supplier has entered into a subcontract with a first-tier subcontractor
                     who lacks capacity to receive any benefit under a contract between
                     Canada and any other person or is ineligible for, or suspended from,
                     contract award under the Integrity Regime, subject to certain exceptions
                     (ineligibility period: five years); and

                o the supplier has provided a false or misleading certification or declaration
                     to PSPC (ineligibility period: ten years).225

      The following circumstances may lead to a determination of ineligibility or
          suspension (i.e., they are discretionary grounds):

                o the supplier has been convicted of an offence outside Canada that is
                     "similar to" any Canadian offence for which a conviction would result in
                     automatic ineligibility (ineligibility period: ten years, with the possibility
                     of a reduction of up to five years under an administrative agreement);

                o the supplier's affiliate has been convicted of any Canadian offence for
                     which a conviction would result in automatic ineligibility, or of a "similar
                     offence" outside Canada and the supplier "directed, influenced,
                     authorized, assented to, acquiesced in or participated in the commission of
                     the offence" (ineligibility period: ten years, with the possibility of a
                     reduction of up to five years under an administrative agreement);

                o the supplier has breached any term of condition of an administrative
                     agreement with PSPC (ineligibility period: PSPC may lengthen the original
                     period of ineligibility or re-impose a suspension); and

                o PSPC may suspend a supplier if the supplier has been charged with, or
                     admits guilt of, any Canadian offence for which a conviction would result
                     in automatic ineligibility, or has been charged with, or admits guilt of, a

                     of the suspension period under an administrative agreement).226

      For purposes of determining whether a foreign offence is "similar" to a listed
          Canadian offence, PSPC takes into account the following factors:

                o in the case of a conviction, whether the court acted within its jurisdiction;

                o whether the supplier was afforded the right to appear during the court's
                     proceedings or to submit to the court's jurisdiction;

                o whether the court's decision was obtained by fraud; or

                o whether the supplier was entitled to present to the court every defence
                     that the supplier would have been entitled to present had the proceeding
                     taken place in Canada.227

      PSPC will not make a determination of ineligibility in respect of a listed offence if
          the supplier (or its affiliate, if applicable) has been granted an absolute discharge,
          or has been granted a conditional discharge and those conditions have been
          satisfied.

      Any administrative agreement may include, among other things, terms and
          conditions regarding separation of specific employees, implementation or
          extension of compliance programs, employee training, outside auditing, access by
          PSPC to specific information and/or records, reporting by a third party, or any
          other remedial or compliance measure that PSPC considers to be "in the public
          interest."

      A contracting authority may enter into a contract or real property agreement with
          an ineligible or suspended supplier if the relevant Deputy Head or equivalent
          considers that doing so is "in the public interest." The reasons for invoking this
          public interest exception may include:

                o the need to respond to an emergency where delay would be injurious to
                     the public interest;

                o the supplier is the only person capable of performing the contract or
                     providing the real property agreement;

                o the contract is essential to maintain sufficient emergency stocks in order to
                     safeguard against possible shortages; or

                o not entering into the contract or real property agreement with the supplier
                     would have a significant adverse impact on the health, national security,
                     safety, public security or economic or financial well-being of Canadians or
                     the functioning of any portion of the federal public administration.228

      PSPC may require a supplier to retain a third party in specified circumstances,
          such as where PSPC needs information with respect to foreign charges and
          convictions, or where a third party will monitor the supplier and report to PSPC
          pursuant to an administrative agreement.

      PSPC maintains a list of ineligible and suspended suppliers (which, at the time of
          writing, had only three suppliers listed).229

Some commentators applauded the Integrity Regime for moving away from punishment
and retribution and towards the goal of preserving the integrity of public procurement
processes. However, others observed that the new Integrity Regime is still strict in
comparison to US, UK, and World Bank debarment regimes.

The debarment policies contained in the Integrity Regime are more lenient and flexible than
those contained in the previous Integrity Framework in several ways. For the purposes of
this section, three policy changes are particularly noteworthy.

      First, the new Integrity Regime eliminates automatic debarment of companies for
          an affiliate's conduct. This can be seen as a significant improvement, enhancing
          both the fairness and logic of the regime.

      Second, the ten-year debarment period is no longer set in stone. This period may
          be reduced through an administrative agreement, which would typically require
          the supplier to demonstrate that it has put in place measures to avoid potential
          future wrongdoing. (Note, however, that obtained reduction through an
          administrative agreement is not always available.) The possibility of receiving a
          shortened debarment period gives companies a compelling incentive to remedy
          the misconduct, cooperate with authorities and take proactive measures to prevent
          future wrongdoing. This new policy is more forward-looking in its orientation,
          rather than the retributive nature of the previous Integrity Framework.

      Third, Canadian lawyers Milos Barutciski and Matthew Kronby point out that the
          new regime increases transparency and fairness of the process of determining
          ineligibility through the addition of "due process" provisions.230 Canadian lawyer
          Christopher Burkett summarized these provisions in the following terms:

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

                Suppliers are notified of their ineligibility/suspension and provided
                information of the process(es) available to them. A supplier is able to
                come forward at any time and ask for an advanced determination.
                Upon a determination of ineligibility, the supplier would see their
                ineligibility period begin immediately. This will incent suppliers to
                come forward and proactively disclose wrongdoing. An administrative
                review process of the assessment of affiliates would be available to the
                supplier.

                This process is a step in the right direction, as it provides for proactive
                advance determinations and a review process for the assessment of
                affiliates, which will oversee the factually complex issue of control,
                participation or involvement. The due process provision does not
                appear to cover the decision as to whether the period should be reduced
                from 10 to five years, however.231

However, many commentators continue to criticize Canada's debarment regime for being
too strict. Barutciski and Kronby argue that the new regime still "tilts too heavily toward
punishment and retribution at the expense of promoting a fair and competitive public
procurement market and value for the taxpayer."232 The authors note that a five-year
debarment "can still be a death penalty for some companies" and criticize the lack of
flexibility and relief for companies that cooperate and implement remedial measures.233
Barutciski and Kronby conclude that "[t]he new integrity regime fails to strike the right
balance between punishment and deterrence of misconduct (principally the domain of
criminal law) and protecting the integrity of federal procurement and taxpayer dollars (the
domain of procurement rules)."234

Writing in 2015, John Manley, president and CEO of the Business Council of Canada and
former deputy prime minister, pointed out that corporations in Canada had a strong
disincentive to self-report wrongdoing or cooperate in investigations, since a guilty plea or
conviction triggered the harsh debarment regime, and deferred prosecution agreements
(DPAs) remained unavailable in Canada.235 Manley advocated for the introduction of DPAs
in Canada to incentivize cooperation and provide prosecutors with an additional tool for
fighting corporate crime. On the other hand, Stephen Schneider, professor of sociology and
criminology at Saint Mary's University, argued that DPAs were a means of allowing
corporations that are "too big to fail" to escape criminal liability, which makes corporations

"more apt to behave badly."236 For further discussion of DPAs (which have since been
introduced in Canada in the form of "remediation agreements"), see Chapter 6, Section 6.3.

Some have expressed concerns that the strictness of Canada's debarment policies may
leave the government unable to call upon the specialized expertise and in-depth
knowledge of certain goods and services providers who have no close competitors.237
This in turn, can result in economic losses to the government, as well as harm to
Canadian taxpayers.238 An added concern is the detrimental impact the Integrity Regime's
debarment policy may have on Canadian companies and their employees. Responding
to the severity of Canada's debarment policies, a report commissioned by the
Canadian Council of Chief Executives emphasizes that "[d]ebarment imposes a direct
cost on the debarred firms, but also on innocent parties and society at large."239 The
report suggests that a "typical" major supplier headquartered overseas would lose sales of
over CDN$350 million per year and lay off 400 workers as a result of debarment,
resulting in a net loss to the Canadian economy of over CDN$1 billion over the ten-year
debarment period.240 The report raises concerns over the following potential collateral
effects of Canada's debarment policy:

          (1) a reduction in the number of potential suppliers, which could lead to
                less variety, poorer quality and higher prices;

          (2) supply-chain impacts, such as small- and medium-sized firms losing
                contracts due to suspensions of larger companies;

          (3) a "chilling effect" on foreign investment in Canada by firms concerned
                about the stigma of being debarred in a G7 country; and

          (4) the Canadian government's procurement rules being out of step with,
                and harsher than, those in many other countries.241

A further basis for criticism is that Canada's approach to debarment remains uncodified
through legislation or regulations. The US, by contrast, has legally codified its debarment
provisions under the Federal Acquisition Regulation. Canada's lack of codified debarment
policies may leave contractors with a lack of certainty and predictability. Moreover, an
uncodified debarment framework is not subject to the sort of legislative review and scrutiny
it would otherwise receive if it were codified.

Commentators have argued that the harshness of the Integrity Regime provides a
disincentive for companies to participate in the Canadian Competition Bureau's immunity

and leniency programs.242 Under the Integrity Regime, companies are automatically
debarred if they are convicted of cartel offences (e.g., conspiracies and bid-rigging), and no
exception or allowance is made in this regard for parties who participate in the Competition
Bureau's immunity and leniency program. Since the success of the immunity and leniency
program depends on cartel participants' willingness to come forward and cooperate in
return for either full immunity from prosecution or a reduction in penalties, and since the
Integrity Regime works against such incentives, companies may feel reluctant to cooperate
with either the Competition Bureau or PSPC.

The Integrity Framework now includes a requirement that all bidders provide a complete
list of all foreign criminal charges and convictions pertaining to themselves, their affiliates
and their proposed first-tier subcontractors that, to the best of the entity's knowledge and
belief, may be similar to one of the listed offences.243 In submitting a bid, the bidder must
certify that it has provided a complete list. If, in the opinion of PSPC, a supplier has provided
a false or misleading certification or declaration, the bidder is rendered automatically
ineligible for ten years. Barutciski et al. criticize the new reporting requirement in the
following terms:

          the certification requirement with respect to affiliate charges and
          convictions, in conjunction with the severe penalty for false reporting,
          seems destined to create compliance nightmares for large multinational
          companies. Given the broad range of offences - both in Canada and abroad
          - that might be captured by the new provisions, and the obligation to
          include charges as well as convictions, this requirement will inject yet
          further compliance cost and uncertainty into the process for uncertain
          benefits from the standpoint of preserving integrity in government
          procurement as opposed to punishment.244

Against this backdrop, in September 2017, the Government of Canada launched a public
consultation in relation to a proposal to "[expand] Canada's toolkit to address corporate
wrongdoing."245 A major focus of the consultation was on whether Canada should enhance
its Integrity Regime by making its current suspension and debarment policies more flexible.
The consultation included a discussion paper on possible enhancements to the Integrity

Regime, setting out ten issues or considerations that should be taken into account in deciding
whether and how to alter the current suspension and debarment policies.246 In February
2018, the Canadian government published a report on its consultations.247 The report
indicates that the government received 45 online submissions on the possible adoption of a
DPA scheme with 43% from business, 30% from individuals, 20% from law enforcement and
other justice sectors, and 7% from NGOs.248 Government officials also held 40 meetings with
370 participants to hear their views (some on DPAs, others on suspensions, debarments, and
the Integrity Regime). On the key question related to whether more discretion in fixing
periods of debarment is desirable, the report indicated that this question "garnered the most
comments and strongest views."249 On this issue, the report states:

          Time period

          The majority of participants suggested that the time periods associated with
          ineligibility be reduced from the current 10 years (reducible to five), which
          was seen as too long. The principal view was to favour full discretion in the
          determination of a period of ineligibility, including the ability to reduce the
          period to zero.

          Other views were for:

                 an ineligibility period aligned with those of Canada's major trading
                     partners

                 a maximum period of between three and five years

          Factors to determine time period

          Many provided a list of factors to be taken into account when determining
          an appropriate ineligibility period with some noting that these should be
          published as part of the policy; others suggested that such factors be used
          as guidelines rather than be an exhaustive list. Most proposals for factors
          for consideration included:

                 the severity of the offence committed
                 self-reporting and cooperation with law enforcement
                 taking corrective action
                 establishing compliance programs
                 efforts at restitution
                 repeat offences

          Other factors raised were:

                 the consideration of the impacts on employees, the economy and
                     government

                 the inclusion of exemptions from debarment for participants in pre-
                     existing cooperation programs, such as the Competition Bureau's
                     Leniency program

          There was a recognition that introducing a considerable amount of
          discretion into the Integrity Regime could pose risks of inconsistent decision
          making and reduced predictability in determination processes. Therefore,
          the importance of transparency and due process in the determination
          process was stressed, including:

               an opportunity for suppliers to present their side / facts and

                     submissions

               the publication of guidelines governing the exercise of discretion

               procedures to appeal and to reduce debarment periods

          The need to integrate a safe-harbour provision that would allow companies
          to self-disclose adverse information without being punished was identified.
          The possibility of a reassessment of the debarment decision after a certain
          amount of time was also raised.250

Shortly after the publication of this report, in March 2018, PSPC announced that the Integrity
Regime would be "enhanced" to:

          introduce greater flexibility in debarment decisions (rendering

                companies ineligible from receiving federal contracts or real property
                agreements)

          increase the number of triggers that can lead to debarment

          explore alternative measures to further mitigate the risk of doing

                business with organized crime

          expand the scope of business ethics covered under the regime into key

                areas such as combatting human trafficking and the protection of labour
                rights and the environment[.]251

The announcement also advised that the government had introduced a "made-in-Canada"
version of a DPA regime, to be known as a Remediation Agreement Regime.252

The proposed changes to the Integrity Regime were slated to come into effect on January 1,
2019. However, before that date, the government announced that, as a result of increased
"public discourse regarding corporate wrongdoing and governments' responses to this type
of misconduct" (an indirect reference to the SNC-Lavalin affair discussed below), it would
"take additional time to assess aspects of the Policy and possible next steps regarding the
Integrity Regime."253 To date, the proposed changes have not been implemented.

The government has, however, published a draft revised Ineligibility and Suspension Policy.254
Notably, this policy contemplates the following:

          the creation of a Registrar of Ineligibility and Suspension, an

                independent position responsible for making determinations of
                ineligibility and suspension, setting periods of ineligibility and
                suspension, and entering into administrative agreements;

          greater flexibility in setting periods of ineligibility and suspension, with

                a maximum, rather than mandatory, ten-year period, and discretion to
                set any period under this maximum based on enumerated factors to be
                considered (e.g., the seriousness of the conduct and the steps taken to
                address concerns);

          a wider set of circumstances that may trigger ineligibility or suspension,

                including new categories of covered offences (e.g., certain human
                trafficking, Canada Elections Act, Canada Labour Code, environmental and
                provincial offences), as well as suspension for "professional misconduct
                or acts or omissions of the supplier which adversely reflect on the
                commercial integrity of the supplier"; and

          new procedural fairness provisions and review mechanisms.255

The enhanced discretion and procedural protections contemplated by the draft policy will
no doubt be considered a welcome development by those who consider the current regime
to be unduly harsh and/or arbitrary.256 On the other hand, industry may view the expanded
triggers for ineligibility or suspension less favourably.

A key aspect of the context surrounding the recent developments in relation to the Integrity
Regime and the introduction of DPAs ("remediation agreements") is the SNC-Lavalin

affair.257 In April 2013, SNC-Lavalin, Canada's largest engineering firm, and its affiliates
were debarred for a ten-year period by the World Bank for corruption relating to the Padma
Bridge project (see Chapter 1, Section 1.2).258 After SNC-Lavalin agreed to the ten-year ban,
the RCMP laid corruption and fraud charges against SNC-Lavalin and two subsidiaries over
alleged bribery in Libya. The company argued that the strict Canadian debarment rules
could destroy the company.259 In December 2015, SNC-Lavalin became the first corporation
to sign an administrative agreement under the new Integrity Regime, which confirmed the
company's eligibility as a supplier to the Canadian government while the foreign bribery
charges were pending.260 As discussed in Chapter 12, Section 1.3, in December 2019, a
construction subsidiary of SNC-Lavalin pleaded guilty to one count of fraud over
CDN$5,000 under section 380 of the Criminal Code in connection with its activities in Libya
between 2001 and 2011.261 As part of the settlement, SNC-Lavalin agreed to pay a record fine
of CDN$280 million, payable in equal instalments over five years, and to be subject to a
three-year probation order. By agreeing to this outcome, SNC-Lavalin avoided automatic
ineligibility under the Integrity Regime as a conviction under section 380 of the Criminal Code
results in automatic ineligibility only if the fraud was committed against Her Majesty.262
SNC-Lavalin may, however, be subject to debarment under other debarment regimes,
though the company has indicated that it believes the guilty plea will not result in
debarment. 263

The government's consultation on potential changes to the Integrity Regime, the subsequent
draft policy and political factors all point towards a revised regime that reflects greater
flexibility, stronger procedural protections and a broader scope of application. Whether this

forthcoming revised regime will better achieve the primary objective of ensuring integrity

Finally, Quebec's Act Respecting Contracting by Public Bodies264 contains a debarment policy
unique to the province. While a comprehensive analysis of this legislation is not possible
due to space constraints, it is worth noting that Quebec's legislation provides for automatic
debarment from the public sector bidding process where the corporation has been found
guilty of prescribed offences--including offences under the CFPOA--in the preceding five
years. 265

9. DISQUALIFICATION AS COMPANY DIRECTOR

Convictions for serious criminal offences such as bribery have various collateral
consequences, some mandatory and others discretionary. For example, a conviction for a
serious offence can result in disqualification to hold a public office or ineligibility to travel
to a foreign country. In this section, the possibility of disqualification from being a director
or officer of a company is discussed.

9.1 US

Pursuant to the US Securities Exchange Act,266 the SEC can apply to a federal court for
permanent or temporary injunctive relief.267 A court can prohibit conditionally,
unconditionally, or permanently any person who has violated securities laws and who
demonstrates unfitness from serving as an officer or director.268 The standard for a bar was
substantially broadened with the passing of the Sarbanes Oxley Act,269 which changed the
standard from "substantial unfitness" to "unfitness."270

The SEC itself cannot impose the remedy via an administrative proceeding; it must be done
by a court, although the SEC may negotiate a "voluntary" director disqualification as part
of a settlement agreement or a DPA.271 The courts have broad discretion to impose an
appropriate remedy.272 When determining the previous standard of substantial unfitness,
courts looked at the non-exhaustive "Patel factors": "(1) the `egregiousness' of the

underlying securities law violation; (2) the defendant's `repeat offender' status; (3) the
defendant's `role' or position when he engaged in the fraud; (4) the defendant's degree of
scienter; (5) the defendant's economic stake in the violation; and (6) the likelihood that
misconduct will recur."273 These factors remain relevant under the new lower standard.

Since a permanent bar may result in a "loss of livelihood and stigma,"274 courts require more
than what would be required for a non-permanent bar. In fact, Congress intended the
permanent bar remedy to be used with caution.275 A court should first consider a conditional
bar.276 The following five cases are examples of the courts' approach to these officer or
director bars.

In Posner, the US Second Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a permanent bar imposed by a US
District Court.277 The Court focused on the high degree of scienter in violating the securities
laws, several past violations (including conspiracy, tax evasion and filing false tax returns),
the high likelihood of future violations, and the fact that the defendants had refused to testify
(the Court inferred that the defendants' testimony would have negatively impacted their
case). The Court stated that such a punishment would serve as a "sharp warning" to other
violators.278

In Boey, the US District Court of New Hampshire refused to issue a permanent bar because
the defendant had no prior history of violations and there was no plausible risk that they
would reoffend. Over a decade had passed since their violation. As such, a five-year bar was
held to be sufficient. The Court also refused to issue a permanent injunction because
adequate punishment had already been imposed (e.g., the five-year officer and director bar,
a civil penalty and disgorgement).

In Selden, the US District Court of Massachusetts imposed a two-year officer and director bar
along with other monetary penalties. The Court noted that the offences were particularly
serious because the defendant was a director and CEO who made misleading statements
over several years and acted with a high degree of scienter. Although it was their first and
only violation, there was a strong probability of reoccurrence. The Court also pointed out
that the defendant had a minimal economic stake in the violation and that they cooperated
with the investigation, although their acknowledgement of responsibility was "less than
stellar."279

In Dibella, the US District Court of Connecticut refused both an officer and director bar and
a permanent injunction. The Court focused on the fact that the defendant was not serving

on any boards of publicly traded companies, had never served as an officer, had no prior
history of violations and would be unlikely to commit an offence in the future.

In Penn, the SEC moved for summary judgment against two entities, which Lawrence Penn
controlled and used to commit securities violations. Penn managed a private equity fund,
Capital Acquisitions Secondary Opportunities LP (the "Fund"), from 2007 until 2014. During
this time, Penn ran a scheme diverting over $9,000,000 from the Fund to entities under the
defendant's control. Penn pleaded guilty to grand larceny and falsifying business records
and made a number of admissions when doing so. The Court found that the undisputed
facts as to Penn's conduct, knowledge and relationship with the two entities established their
liability. It then considered, among other remedies, whether it was appropriate to impose a
permanent injunction. The Court reinforced that the question that a court must answer, in
deciding whether to issue a permanent injunction, is whether there is a reasonable likelihood
that the wrong will be repeated. In determining that a permanent injunction was warranted
in this case, the Court highlighted that the acts were egregious, there was a high degree of
scienter, and there was substantial planning. In addition, the incident was not an isolated
one and the defendants had not accepted responsibility.

9.2 UK

Individuals convicted of indictable offences in the management of a company face
disqualification from being a director or officer of a company under the Company Directors
Disqualification Act 1986 (CDDA).280 The disqualifications are mandatory in some
circumstances and discretionary in other circumstances.

Section 6 of the CDDA provides that a court must make a disqualification order against a
director or former director of a company that has become insolvent where "his conduct as a
director of that company (either taken alone or taken together with his conduct as a director
of one or more other companies or overseas companies) makes him unfit to be concerned in
the management of a company."281 A disqualification under section 6 must last for a
minimum of two years and may be in place for a maximum of 15 years.282

More generally, section 2 of the CDDA provides discretion for a court to "make a
disqualification order against a person where he is convicted of an indictable offence
(whether on indictment or summarily) in connection with the promotion, formation,
management liquidation or striking off of a company with the receivership of a company's
property or with his being an administrative receiver of a company." This disqualification,
when made by a court of summary jurisdiction, may last for a maximum period of five years.
In all other cases, the maximum period of disqualification is 15 years.283

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

Disqualification orders provide, in respect of the person subject to the order that for the
period specified in the order:

          a) he shall not be a director of a company, act as receiver of a company's
                property or in any way, whether directly or indirectly, be concerned or
                take part in the promotion, formation or management of a company
                unless (in each case) he has the leave of the court, and

          b) he shall not act as an insolvency practitioner.284

In specified circumstances, set out in sections 5A, 7, 8, 8ZC and 8ZE of the CDDA, the
Secretary of State is also empowered to accept a disqualification undertaking from a person
that, for the period of the undertaking, they will not act in a role which would be prohibited
by a disqualification order.285

Disqualification can also occur by voluntary arrangement. In R v Hibberd and Another, two
company directors defrauded a bank and loan company of over £1.5 million.286 The Court
declined to make a disqualification order because such an order had already been made
under a voluntary arrangement with the Department of Trade and Industry.287

A leading case on disqualification is the 1998 case of R v Edwards. In Edwards the appellant
was charged with a number of counts of conspiracy to defraud. Edwards eventually pleaded
guilty to one count and, as part of the sentence, was disqualified from being a director for
10 years. On appealing the imposition of this disqualification, the Court denied the
appellant's argument that no disqualification should be imposed at all, stating:

          The rationale behind the power to disqualify is the protection of the public
          from the activities of persons who, whether for reasons of dishonesty, or of
          naivety or incompetence in conjunction with the dishonesty of others, may
          use or abuse their role and status as a director of a limited company to the
          detriment of the public. Frauds of the kind in this case archetypally give rise
          to a situation in which the exercise of the court's power is appropriate.288

The Court then drew on guidance from the case of R v Millard, where disqualification was
divided into three brackets:

          (i) the top bracket of disqualification for periods over ten years should be
                reserved for particularly serious cases. These may include cases where
                a director who has already had one period of disqualification imposed
                on him falls to be disqualified yet again.

284 Ibid, s 1(1).                                                              2022

          (ii) The minimum bracket of two to five years' disqualification should be
                applied where, though disqualification is mandatory, the case is
                relatively not very serious.

          (iii) The middle bracket of disqualification from six to ten years should
                apply for serious cases which do not merit the top bracket.289

Ultimately, the appellant in Edwards was unemployed and persuaded to participate in a
fraudulent enterprise as a director, a role for which he was inexperienced and unsuited. The
Court found that a ten-year disqualification order was too harsh and substituted a three-
year order.

In R v Cadman,290 the Court of Appeal Criminal Division reviewed a number of decisions
regarding disqualification orders:

          24. ... Sevenoaks Stationers (Retail) Limited [1991] CH 164, Court of Appeal
               Civil Division, dealt with an accountant who over five years with five
               separate companies which had all become insolvent had accrued total
               indebtedness of approximately £560,000. There were no audited
               accounts and he had traded whilst insolvent in relation to at least one
               company. This amounted to incompetence or negligence in a very
               marked degree falling short of dishonesty. His disqualification period
               was reduced to five years. This case is memorable for the trio of brackets
               it established, later to be adopted with approval in Millard (1994) 15 Cr.
               App. R. (S.) 445. (1) The top bracket, periods over ten years, should be
               reserved for particularly serious cases. These may include cases where
               a doctor who has already one period of disqualification imposed upon
               him falls to be disqualified yet again. (2) The minimum bracket of two
               to five years' disqualification should be applied where, though
               disqualification is mandatory, the case is, relatively, not very serious. (3)
               The middle bracket of disqualification, from six to ten years, should
               apply to serious cases which do not merit the top bracket.

          25. In Millard [1994] 15 Cr App R(S) 445 that approach was not only
                approved but applied so as to substitute for a 15-year disqualification
                one of eight years. An appellant had fraudulently traded using six
                company vehicles, creating a deficiency of £728,000 odd. He had been
                convicted and the fraudulent trading spanned nearly four years. He had
                three previous convictions for dishonesty. Miss Small readily accepts
                that what assistance that case can offer is tempered by its age.

          26. Robertson [2006] EWCA Crim 1289 was an appellant of 49 and of good
                character. He was convicted of fraudulent trading during some six
                months. His business defrauded the DFES in respect of an ILA. The
                department paid his company £1.4 million. His disqualification period,
                which was not challenged in the Court of Appeal, was five years.

          27. Sukhdabe Singh More [2007] EWCA Crim 2832 was an appellant pleading
                guilty to one money laundering offence. Over some two months he had
                allowed his business account to be used to launder £136,000. He had
                two previous convictions for dishonesty. The Court of Appeal reduced
                his disqualification to three years.

          28. Jules Paul Simpson [2007] EWCA Crim 1919 was an appellant who had
                pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud. For the last months of his
                legitimate business he carried on knowing it to be insolvent. The loss to
                creditors was £200,000. He was disqualified for six years.

          29. Nigel Corbin (1984) 6 Cr App R(S) 17 is even older than Robertson but
                Miss Small prays it in aid since it featured an appellant involved with
                three originally legitimate businesses. Over 18 months he admitted nine
                counts of deception. A criminal bankruptcy order was made in the sum
                of £35,000. The Court of Appeal left untouched his disqualification
                period of five years.

          30. In Anthony Edwards [1998] 2 Cr App R(S) 213 the assistance to this court
                lies in a comment:

                "The rationale behind the power to disqualify is the protection of the
                public from ... persons who, whether for reasons of dishonesty, or of
                naivety or incompetence in conjunction with the dishonesty of others,
                may use or abuse their role and status as a director of a limited company
                to the detriment of the public."

          31. In Attorney General's Reference No 88 of 2006 [2006] EWCA Crim 3254 the
                disqualification periods were in excess of six years, more often seen in
                cases involving carousel frauds. Those tended to involve greater sums
                and greater sophistication, making the perpetrators a great risk to the
                public if permitted to act in the management of companies in the future.
                The first three appellants had caused a £20 million loss over 16 months.
                To the clear astonishment of the Court of Appeal no disqualification
                period had been imposed in the court below. On the first three
                appellants the court imposed an eight year disqualification. The final
                appellant secured a benefit of £1.5 million during one month and was
                disqualified for four years.

          32. In Sheikh and Sheikh [2011] 1 Cr App R(S) 12 the court upheld a ten year
                period of disqualification. The case featured illegal production of
                pirated DVDs. The appellants were 29 and 27. They had been convicted
                after a lengthy trial and there was no evidence of remorse. The turnover
                was in excess of £6 million. The offending lasted a number of years and
                was very sophisticated, crossing international boundaries and
                exploiting vulnerable immigrants.

          33. In Brealy [2010] EWCA Crim 1860 disqualification of a director
                convicted of corruption showed that for six years he had allowed a local
                counsellor to live rent free whilst being a director of a property business
                which required a number of building consents. The value of the

                nonpayment of rent was some £34,000. The disqualified appellant was
                of good character, but the court said that his offending struck at the very
                heart of a democratic government. It was an aggravating feature that
                the offending continued for some six years. Five years' disqualification
                was upheld.

The guidance set out in Sevenoaks remains apposite for courts determining the appropriate
length of a director's disqualification. For example, more recently, in Secretary of State for
Business Innovation and Skills v Rahman,291 the Court reviewed the Sevenoaks principles. It
found, with respect to length of disqualification, that "the same approach is appropriate
under s.2 and s.6 and that the Sevenoaks Stationers principles ought to be applied under s.2
as much as under s.6," and further commented that "civil and criminal courts should be
applying the same standards: the purpose of disqualification - to protect the public from the
activities of persons unfit to be concerned in the management of a company - is the same in
both kinds of court. That is the approach that the CACD took in Cadman." It agreed with
commentary that:

          although s.2 and s.6 are different gateways to disqualification, with
          different rules at that stage of the inquiry, once the court, be it criminal or
          civil, is satisfied that the s.2 gateway has been passed through, it should
          apply the same principles to the exercise of its discretion as have been
          developed in the extensive jurisprudence under s.6 on the question of
          unfitness, unless the statute otherwise requires.292

An example of a statute requiring otherwise for example, would be found in the mandatory
minimum two-year disqualification that must be applied under section 6 (and which is not
applicable to section 2).293

9.3 Canada

Some provincial corporate statutes, including those in British Columbia294 and New
Brunswick, have a "director disqualification" rule for persons convicted of certain offences.
For example, a person is not qualified to become or to continue as a director of a British
Columbia company for five years after the completion of a sentence for an offence in
connection with the management of a business or an offence involving fraud.295
Nevertheless, the Canada Business Corporations Act,296 the Ontario Business Corporations Act,297
and most other provincial corporate statutes have no such disqualification provision.

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

However, disqualification can arise under provincial securities legislation. The powers of
disqualification can be quite broad. For example, under section 127(1)(8) of the Ontario
Securities Act, the Securities Commission may "in the public interest" make an order that "a
person is prohibited from becoming or acting as a director or officer of any issuer [i.e., a
company issuing securities under the Ontario Securities Act]."298 The "public interest" is a
very broad term and includes prior acts of fraud and corruption. Other provincial securities
legislation confer similar disqualification powers.299

The "public interest" jurisdiction of the securities commissions confers on them broad
powers. The commissions can make orders pursuant to "public interest" jurisdiction even
where there has been no breach of securities law. The provisions are regulatory and contain
administrative sanctions, meaning the commission's public interest jurisdiction is
preventative and protective rather than punitive.

10. MONITORSHIP ORDERS

10.1 UNCAC and OECD

There is no specific mention in either Convention of imposing an independent monitor on a
corporation that has been convicted of a corruption offence.

10.2 US

According to Robert Tarun and Peter Tomczak, the imposition of an independent monitor
on an offending corporation is a frequent condition of a DOJ or SEC settlement.300 Typically,
the monitorship lasts for three years with the monitor filing two or three reports yearly with
DOJ or SEC. The criteria for appointing monitors and the scope of their duties are set out in
a DOJ policy memorandum known as the Morford Memorandum.301 Tarun notes that "more
than half of the DOJ's 2016 FCPA resolutions provided for a monitorship. The current

prevalence of appointed monitors is consistent with the DOJ's increased emphasis on
companies adopting and maintaining effective compliance programs."302

The Morford Memorandum was recently supplemented by the Benczkowski
Memorandum,303 which "provides new and important insights into the selection of monitors
and the scope of their work"304 and, perhaps suggests a movement away from imposing
monitorships. The Benczkowski Memorandum notes:

          [T]he imposition of a monitor will not be necessary in many corporate
          criminal resolutions, and the scope of any monitorship should be
          appropriately tailored to address the specific issues and concerns that
          created the need for the monitor. The Morford Memorandum explained
          that, "[a] monitor should only be used where appropriate given the facts
          and circumstances of a particular matter[,]" and set forth the two broad
          considerations that should guide prosecutors when assessing the need and
          propriety of a monitor: "(1) the potential benefits that employing a monitor
          may have for the corporation and the public, and (2) the cost of a monitor
          and its impact on the operations of a corporation." The Memorandum also
          made clear that a monitor should never be imposed for punitive
          purposes. 305

Some of the most important clarifications the Benczkowski Memorandum makes include:

     (1) The Benczkowski Memorandum has expanded application. While the Morford
          Memorandum applies only to DPAs and NPAs, the Benczkowski
          Memorandum also applies to plea agreements, as long as a presiding court
          approves.

     (2) The Morford Memorandum sets out two broad considerations guiding
          prosecutors when determining whether a monitor is necessary: (1) the
          potential benefits that employing a monitor may have for the corporation and
          the public and (2) the cost of a monitor and its impact on the operations of a

          corporation. The Benczkowski Memorandum elaborates on the first
          consideration by providing a list of non-exclusive factors to consider and
          elaborates on the second by "noting that Criminal Division attorneys should
          consider not only the projected monetary costs to the business organization,
          but also whether the proposed scope of a monitor's role is appropriately
          tailored to avoid unnecessary burdens on the business's operations."306

     (3) It sets out a clear, step-by-step process for monitor selection.307

10.3 UK

Monitorships are assuming an increasingly important role in the UK, in particular in the
context of DPAs. Judith Seddon, Chris Stott, and Andris Ivanovs note that:

          Before the introduction of deferred prosecution agreements (DPAs) to the
          UK legal system, monitors were appointed under negotiated settlements
          entered into between cooperating corporate entities and enforcement
          authorities, but the statutory foundations for their appointment were less
          solid and appointments were largely the product of prosecutorial
          improvisation. Monitors were perceived squarely as a feature of the US
          corporate crime enforcement landscape and their appointment in the
          United Kingdom drew significant judicial opprobrium.308

That said, Seddon, Stott, and Ivanovs also caution against assuming that monitorships will
become as common or extensive in the UK as they are in the United States. Monitorships in
the UK remain narrower and less routine.309

The Crime and Courts Act (CCA),310 along with relevant guidance, allows for monitorship to
be used to oversee a compliance program imposed by a DPA, but it does not prescribe or
encourage such enforcement.311 Schedule 17 of the CCA provides for entering into DPAs,
while section 5(3)(e) of the Schedule reads:

          (3) The requirements that a DPA may impose on P include, but are not
          limited to, the following requirements--

          ...

                     (e) to implement a compliance programme or make changes to an
                     existing compliance programme relating to P's policies or to the
                     training of P's employees or both;312

The CCA is informed by the Deferred Prosecution Agreements Code of Practice (the DPA Code),313
which must be taken into account when negotiating, applying to the court for DPAs and
overseeing DPAs.314 Sections 7.11-7.22 of the DPA Code deal specifically with monitors.
Section 7.11 states:

          An important consideration for entering into a DPA is whether P [the
          organisation being considered for prosecution] already has a genuinely
          proactive and effective corporate compliance programme. The use of
          monitors should therefore be approached with care. The appointment of a
          monitor will depend upon the factual circumstances of each case and must
          always be fair, reasonable and proportionate.315

Recently, in October 2020, the Serious Fraud Office updated its SFO Operational Handbook
(Operation Handbook) to include a chapter providing more guidance with respect to Deferred
Prosecution Agreements,316 a section of which deals specifically with those considerations
that are ordinarily relevant for monitorship. That Operation Handbook states:

          Less onerous alternatives to a monitorship can also be considered such as
          an external reviewer, to be agreed by the SFO. Careful consideration will
          need to be given to the process of selection, in particular any conflicts of
          interest.317

There are other ways in which corporate behaviour can be monitored to prevent future
criminal conduct. One such way is through a Serious Crime Prevention Order (SCPO). Such
SCPOs are governed by Part 1 of the Serious Crime Act 2007 (SCA).318 When a corporate
defendant is convicted of a `serious offence' (including bribery, fraud or money laundering)
a SCPO can be made against that company if there are "reasonable grounds to believe that
the order would protect the public by preventing, restricting or disrupting involvement by
the person in serious crime."319 It should be noted that SCPOs are not specifically directed
towards corporate crime. They have been used to impose restrictions on individuals
following conviction, but have not been used to resolve white-collar investigations. The
person who is subject to such an order may have to provide documents and information to
a monitor, answer questions, and cover monitor-related costs.320

Another way is through a Civil Recovery Order (CRO), provided for by Part 5 of the Proceeds
of Crime Act 2002 (POCA).321 CROs are civil remedies allowing enforcement authorities to
recover property obtained as a result of unlawful conduct.322 CROs were seen as an attractive
way of concluding investigations through negotiation before DPAs. As Seddon, Stott, and
Ivanovs note, "There is no equivalent to the DPA Code in respect of CROs and no constraints
on the appointment of monitors under them (beyond those required to settle any civil
proceedings, namely acceptable wording for a consent order and associated settlement
documents)."323 This can lead to CROs being negotiated with limited court influence on the
contents and in a manner, which is favourable to the company involved.324

10.4 Canada

The Canada Business Corporations Act (CBCA),325 along with those provincial corporate
statutes modeled after the CBCA, does not contain a power to impose specifically a
monitorship order on a corporation convicted of a serious crime of fraud or corruption.
However, the provincial securities acts generally do have a power somewhat analogous to
monitorship. For example, section 127(1)(4) of the Ontario Securities Act authorizes the
Ontario Securities Commission to make an order in the public interest "that a market
participant submit to a review of his, her or its practices and procedures and institute such
changes as may be ordered by the Securities Commission."326

Under the 2015 Integrity Regime, quoted in Section 8.6, a third-party monitor may be
imposed on a company through an administrative agreement if the company's ten-year
debarment period is reduced, if a public interest exception to debarment is made or if the
company is suspended.

Another route for monitoring a corporation is the use of a probation order. Organizations
convicted of a Criminal Code offence, including fraud, bribery and corruption, can be placed
on probation for a maximum of three years. The judge can impose, as conditions of that
probation order, one or more of the following:

          (a) make restitution to a person for any loss or damage that they suffered
                as a result of the offence;

          (b) establish policies, standards and procedures to reduce the likelihood
                of the organization committing a subsequent offence;

          (c) communicate those policies, standards and procedures to its
                representatives;

          (d) report to the court on the implementation of those policies, standards
                and procedures;

          (e) identify the senior officer who is responsible for compliance with
                those policies, standards and procedures;

          (f) provide, in the manner specified by the court, the following
                information to the public, namely,
                (i) the offence of which the organization was convicted,
                (ii) the sentence imposed by the court, and
                (iii) any measures that the organization is taking - including any
                     policies, standards and procedures established under
                     paragraph (b) - to reduce the likelihood of it committing a
                     subsequent offence; and

          (g) comply with any other reasonable conditions that the court considers
                desirable to prevent the organization from committing subsequent
                offences or to remedy the harm caused by the offence.327

Section 732.1(3.2) of the Criminal Code provides that before imposing the conditions in (b)
above, the court "shall consider whether it would be more appropriate for another
regulatory body to supervise the development or implementation of the policies, standards
and procedures referred to in that paragraph."328

PART B: CIVIL AND ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIONS AND REMEDIES

11. NON-CONVICTION BASED FORFEITURE

Non-conviction based (NCB) forfeiture is introduced in Chapter 5, Section 2.4.2. The law and
procedures for NCB forfeiture under UNCAC, the OECD Convention and US, UK
and Canadian law are discussed in Chapter 5, Sections 3.1, 3.2, 5.1, 5.2, and 5.3
respectively.

12. CIVIL ACTIONS AND REMEDIES

Civil actions provide a means of deterring corruption and compensating victims. Victims
of corruption can bring personal claims against corrupt actors for damages, for example in
tort or contract. Punitive damages may also be awarded. Victims may also make
proprietary claims to assets acquired through corruption, forcing the corrupt actor to
return assets to their true owner. Disgorgement of profits is another tool used to punish
wrongdoers and is frequently employed by the US SEC. Civil actions and remedies
are dealt with more thoroughly in Chapter 5, Sections 2.4.5 to 2.4.7.

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

13. INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT ARBITRATION

Administrative, civil, and criminal actions and remedies against corrupt public officials,
entities, and private individuals are instruments to directly combat corruption. In contrast,
arbitration is a private and consensual dispute resolution mechanism where the disputants
agree to submit their disputes to an independent decision-maker whose judgment (an
arbitral award) will be final and binding on the parties.329 This system of dispute settlement
has a long history, which may be traced back to medieval merchant guilds and even ancient
Greek mythology, and, at least at first sight, does not have much in common with the global
fight against corruption.330

However, increasing involvement of states and state-owned enterprises in the globalized
economy, as well as rising sophistication of regulatory and reporting schemes in various
countries, inevitably leads to complex disputes arising out of international trade and
investment transactions. For instance, the International Chamber of Commerce reported that
in 20% of arbitration cases initiated in 2019, at least one of the parties was a state or parastatal
entity.331 The following sections will demonstrate that in international arbitration, private
investors and sovereign states may make allegations of corruption and use them either as a
"sword" to seek compensation for the losses caused by corrupt public officials, or as a
"shield" to escape liability in cases arising out of contracts or investments tainted by
corruption.332 Therefore, the manner in which allegations of corruption are and should be

dealt with in the international arbitration process, and the remedies arising therefrom, are
important components in the fight against global corruption.

This section starts with a brief overview of the system of international arbitration to provide
students and practitioners of anti-corruption law with a necessary background in this
method of dispute resolution. It then outlines the reasons why parties may agree to arbitrate
their disputes, including neutrality and flexibility of the procedure, enforceability of
arbitration agreements, and the final and binding character of arbitral awards. This section
also discusses cases where allegations of corruption were made by foreign investors and
states, and concludes by formulating several principles on the treatment of corruption and
bribery in international investment arbitration practice.

13.1 International Arbitration Explained

Arbitration, as stated above, is a dispute settlement mechanism where two or more parties
(corporations, individuals or states) agree to refer their existing or future disputes to an
individual, who is called a "single arbitrator," or a group of persons collectively referred to
as an "arbitral tribunal." This subsection explains the differences between institutional and
ad hoc arbitration, as well as between commercial and investment arbitration.

      13.1.1 Institutional and ad hoc Arbitration

International arbitration exists in different forms and shapes. To begin with, arbitration can
be either "institutional" or "ad hoc."333 Institutional arbitrations are overseen by international
organizations that may appoint members of arbitral tribunals, resolve challenges to
arbitrators, designate the place of arbitration, fix the sum of the arbitrators' fees or review
drafts of arbitral awards to ensure their compliance with formal requirements. Arbitral
institutions do not issue judgments on the merits of the parties' dispute--that is the
responsibility of the individuals selected by the parties or appointed by the institution--but
ensure, within the limits of their authority, the smooth, speedy and cost-efficient conduct of
the proceedings. Among the best-known arbitral institutions are the International Court of

Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), the International Centre for
Dispute Resolution (ICDR), which was established by the American Arbitration Association
(AAA), the London Court of International Arbitration (LCIA), the Permanent Court of
Arbitration (PCA) in The Hague, the Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of
Commerce (SCC), the Singapore International Arbitration Center (SIAC), the Hong Kong
International Arbitration Centre (HKIAC), and the Vienna International Arbitration Centre
(VIAC). Where the parties agree to arbitrate their dispute at a particular arbitral institution,
a set of procedural rules promulgated by such an institution applies to the proceedings.

In contrast, ad hoc arbitrations are not conducted under the auspices of a particular
institution. Instead, the parties merely agree to arbitrate their disputes, rather than to litigate
them in state courts, and may choose an appointing authority that will select the arbitrators
if the parties cannot reach an agreement on this issue. The United Nations Commission on
International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) has prepared a set of procedural rules that the parties
may use to organize their arbitration proceedings.334

      13.1.2 Commercial and Investment Arbitration

International arbitration is usually divided into "investment" arbitration, which may be
either contract-based or treaty-based, and "commercial" arbitration. The boundary between
these two categories sometimes gets blurry and largely depends on the definition of what
constitutes an investment. In general, arbitration is deemed commercial if it concerns a
dispute arising out of a purely commercial transaction, such as a contract for the sale of
goods, and where the parties' consent to arbitration is expressed in an arbitration clause
contained in their contract. On the other hand, the subject matter of the dispute in
international investment arbitration is an "expenditure to acquire property or assets to
produce revenue; a capital outlay."335 Consent to arbitrate disputes with foreign investors
may be found in an international treaty concluded between the investor's "home state" and
the "host state" where the investment was made (hence "treaty-based international
investment arbitration"), in the host state's domestic law on foreign investment, or in an
investment contract between the foreign investor and the host state or its instrument, such
as a ministry or a state-owned enterprise (hence "contract-based international investment
arbitration").

The backbone of the international investment treaty-based arbitration system is a web of
over 3,300 international investment agreements (IIAs), including 2,943 bilateral investment
treaties (BITs) and 417 treaties with investment provisions (TIPs), such as the Canada-United
States-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA), which replaced the North American Free Trade
Agreement (NAFTA), or the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT).336 Another important element of
the investment protection regime is the ICSID Convention, which established the

International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), a specialized arbitral
institution that is part of the World Bank Group, together with the International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), the International Development Association (IDA),
the International Finance Corporation (IFC), and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee
Agency (MIGA).337 The US, UK, and Canada are parties to the ICSID Convention, which
entered into force for those countries on October 14, 1966, January 18, 1967, and December
1, 2013, respectively.338 The US is party to 47 BITs and 70 TIPs, the UK is party to 110 BITs
and 29 TIPs, and Canada is party to 45 BITs and 22 TIPs.339

International commercial and contract-based investment arbitration, and international
treaty-based investment arbitration, both have a lot in common when one views how
proceedings are conducted, how the evidence is admitted and how the tribunals issue
procedural orders and awards.340 Furthermore, the same experienced commercial lawyers
may act either as the arbitrators or the parties' counsel in different arbitration cases, and
arbitration proceedings are governed by the same rules promulgated by the UNCITRAL or
various arbitral institutions.

However, while the procedure and the personalities involved may be the same, contract-
based and treaty-based arbitration are different in several significant ways. To begin with,
parties to commercial transactions typically insert a clause into their contract agreeing to
refer to arbitration any dispute arising out of or in connection with the contract. By contrast,
the host state's consent to arbitration in an IIA is usually expressed as an open offer to
arbitrate any future dispute with any investor-national of the counterparty state to the IIA,
and such an offer is deemed to be accepted and becomes a binding arbitration agreement
when the investor commences arbitration against the host state.341 For instance, the 2012 US
Model BIT and the 2004 Canadian Model FIPA provide that a foreign investor may submit
to arbitration a claim that the host state has breached an obligation under the treaty and the
investor has thus incurred loss or damage,342 and the claimant may choose between
submitting the claim for resolution under:

                Proceedings (if both the host state and the investor's home state are
                parties to the ICSID Convention),

          (ii) the ICSID Additional Facility Rules (if either the home state or the host
                state is a party to the ICSID Convention),

          (iii) the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, or

          (iv) any other arbitration rules agreed on between the investor and the host
                state. 343

This distinction has important implications as to the rules of law applicable to the merits of
the dispute. In a purely commercial setting, the arbitral tribunal will resolve the parties'
dispute in accordance with the national law applicable to the contract concluded by the
parties. The parties may either agree on the applicable law themselves or, in the absence of
such agreement, the arbitral tribunal will apply the law determined by the conflict-of-laws
rules that the tribunal considers applicable.344 In contrast, in a treaty-based arbitration, a
tribunal applies the relevant BIT or TIP and the relevant rules and principles of public
international law. A typical BIT requires each state party to accord to investors of the other
state party and their investments treatment no less favorable than the treatment it accords,
in like circumstances, to its own investors and investments ("national treatment"). Similar
treatment is accorded to investors of other state parties and their investments ("most-
favored-nation treatment"), while treating foreign investments fairly and equitably, and
with full protection and security.345 Furthermore, BITs prohibit either state party from
nationalizing or expropriating an investment, either directly or indirectly through measures
equivalent to expropriation or nationalization, unless the expropriation or nationalization is
effected for a public purpose, in accordance with due process of law, in a non-discriminatory
manner and with prompt, adequate and effective compensation.346

13.2 Why Parties Agree to Arbitrate

There are several reasons why arbitration has become the primary means for settling
international commercial and investment disputes.347 In general, this is because arbitration
is often perceived as a "neutral, speedy and expert dispute resolution process, largely subject
to the parties' control, in a single, centralized forum, with internationally-enforceable
dispute resolution agreements and decisions."348 This subsection concentrates on three
distinct characteristics of international arbitration: (i) neutrality and flexibility, (ii)

enforceability of arbitration agreements, and (iii) the final and binding nature of arbitral
awards.

      13.2.1 Neutrality and Flexibility

To begin with, international arbitration is neutral and flexible. Naturally, a party to a
transaction may be hesitant to agree to litigate its disputes in the domestic courts of a state
where the other party resides or has its place of business, as the party will face litigation in
foreign courts, before foreign judges, in a foreign language and with the assistance of foreign
legal counsel. This is particularly true in cases where one of the parties is located in a country
with high corruption risk or is itself a sovereign state or state entity.

In international arbitration, the parties are free to agree on a neutral place and language of
proceedings. For instance, a corporation from Germany and a state-owned enterprise from
Indonesia may agree to arbitrate their disputes pursuant to the ICC Arbitration Rules with
the proceedings held in a major business center (such as Geneva, Hong Kong, London, New
York, Paris or Singapore) in English. Furthermore, the parties are generally given an
opportunity to participate in the selection of the tribunal (usually, both parties jointly choose
a sole arbitrator or if the arbitral tribunal is to consist of three arbitrators, each party may
nominate one and the presiding arbitrator will be either agreed on by the two party-
appointed arbitrators or chosen by the appointing authority). In addition, each arbitrator is
required to remain independent and impartial.

In other words, the parties are free to tailor their arbitration agreement to their wishes and
the specifics of a particular transaction. For instance, if their venture concerns construction,
exploration activities, insurance or the telecommunications business, the parties may
provide for specialized procedures for presenting expert evidence or agree that prospective
arbitrators have to possess certain technical expertise or be members of a particular
professional association.

      13.2.2 Enforceability of Arbitration Agreements

Another important characteristic of international arbitration is the enforceability of
arbitration agreements. Article II(3) of the New York Convention, which is in force in some
168 jurisdictions,349 requires the courts to refer the parties to arbitration if one of them
commences litigation in respect of a matter subject to an arbitration agreement.350 In the
same manner, the US Federal Arbitration Act351 stipulates that court proceedings must be
stayed where the matter in dispute is referable to arbitration. Similarly, the Arbitration Act352
in the UK provides for a stay of proceedings.

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

In Canada, arbitration legislation adopted at federal, provincial and territorial levels is based
on the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration,353 which states that:

          A court before which an action is brought in a matter which is the subject of
          an arbitration agreement shall, if a party so requests not later than when
          submitting his first statement on the substance of the dispute, refer the
          parties to arbitration unless it finds that the agreement is null and void,
          inoperative or incapable of being performed.354

In conclusion, if a claim which is subject to an arbitration agreement is brought before the
court in the US, UK or Canada, the court will stay the proceedings and refer the parties to
arbitration, as long as the arbitration agreement is not null and void, inoperative or incapable
of being performed. Furthermore, it is a well-established principle that an arbitration clause
is deemed to be separate from the contract of which it forms a part and, as such, it survives
the termination or invalidation of that contract.355

In the UK, the principle of the separability of an arbitration agreement is embodied in section
7 of the Arbitration Act 1996:

          Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, an arbitration agreement which
          forms or was intended to form part of another agreement (whether or not
          in writing) shall not be regarded as invalid, non-existent or ineffective
          because that other agreement is invalid, or did not come into existence or
          has become ineffective, and it shall for that purpose be treated as a distinct
          agreement.356

The UNCITRAL Model Law has a similar provision:

          The arbitral tribunal may rule on its own jurisdiction, including any
          objections with respect to the existence or validity of the arbitration
          agreement. For that purpose, an arbitration clause which forms part of a
          contract shall be treated as an agreement independent of the other terms of
          the contract. A decision by the arbitral tribunal that the contract is null and
          void shall not entail ipso jure the invalidity of the arbitration clause.357

The principle of separability prevents parties from frustrating an arbitration agreement by
attempting to terminate or invalidate the contract in which the arbitration clause appears.
For instance, if a high-ranking public official solicits a bribe by threatening to terminate a

procurement contract and the party refuses to comply, the arbitration clause in the contract
remains valid. Independent and impartial arbitrators will settle the dispute rather than
courts in the public official's state. However, if the arbitration agreement itself is procured
by corruption, the state courts would recognize it as null and void and thus refuse to refer
the matter to arbitration.

      13.2.3 Arbitral Awards Are Final and Binding

Not only are arbitration agreements enforceable, but the tribunal's awards are final and
binding on the parties and may be enforced around the globe. In general, there is no
possibility to appeal an arbitral award to a superior tribunal or national court, but a party
may file an application with a competent state court to set the award aside on limited (mostly
procedural) grounds. In addition, under certain circumstances state courts may deny a
request to enforce an arbitral award. This subsection gives an overview of setting aside and
recognition and enforcement proceedings under the New York Convention, ICSID
Convention, and national laws of the US, UK and Canada. It explains that state courts may
set aside (or refuse to enforce) arbitral awards procured by corruption or based on an
investment or commercial agreement tainted by corruption.

          13.2.3.1 New York Convention

The New York Convention requires Contracting States to "recognize arbitral awards as
binding and enforce them in accordance with the rules of procedure of the territory where
the award is relied upon."358 Article V(1) of the New York Convention provides that
recognition and enforcement of the award may be refused at the request of the party against
whom it is invoked if that party furnishes proof that:

          (a) the parties to the arbitration agreement were under some incapacity or the
          arbitration agreement is not valid;
          (b) the party against whom the award is invoked was not given proper notice
          or was otherwise unable to present their case;
          (c) the award contains decisions on matters beyond the scope of the
          submission to arbitration;
          (d) the composition of the arbitral tribunal or the arbitral procedure was not in
          accordance with the agreement of the parties; or
          (e) the award has not yet become binding on the parties or has been set aside
          or suspended by a competent authority.359

Furthermore, recognition and enforcement of an arbitral award may also be refused
pursuant to Article V(2) of the New York Convention, if the competent court in the country
where recognition and enforcement is sought finds that: (a) the subject matter of the dispute

is not capable of settlement by arbitration under the law of that country or (b) the recognition
or enforcement of the award would be contrary to the public policy of that country.

If an award is based on a contract tainted by bribery or corruption, the courts may deny its
enforcement on public policy grounds.360 For instance, the High Court of England and Wales
refused to enforce an arbitral award ordering the respondent to pay commission to a public
official because the Court found that the commission was effectively a bribe to be paid in
exchange for the official procuring a contract between the respondent and a government
entity.361 Similarly, the Paris Court of Appeal denied enforcement of an award where the
defendant used part of the commission fee to bribe Iranian officials.362 The Court noted that
a "contract having as its aim and object a traffic in influence through the payment of bribes
is, consequently, contrary to French international public policy as well as to the ethics of
international commerce as understood by the large majority of States in the international
community." 363

          13.2.3.2 ICSID Convention

The ICSID Convention requires each contracting state to "recognize an award rendered
pursuant to this Convention as binding and enforce the pecuniary obligations imposed by
that award within its territories as if it were a final judgment of a court in that State."364 An
award rendered by an ICSID tribunal will be governed by the laws concerning the execution
of judgments in the state where execution is sought.365

ICSID awards are binding on the parties and may not be subject to any appeal.366 The ICSID
Convention also does not provide for the possibility of arbitral awards to be set aside by
national courts, but instead creates a self-contained annulment mechanism. Within 120 days
after the date on which the award was rendered, a party may submit an application to the
ICSID Secretary-General requesting annulment of the award.367 An ad hoc committee of three
persons will be formed,368 and may annul an award only on the basis of the following
grounds:

     (a) that the tribunal was not properly constituted;
     (b) that the tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers;
     (c) that there was corruption on the part of a member of the tribunal;

     (e) that the award has failed to state the reasons on which it is based.369

          13.2.3.3 US

In the US, the Federal Arbitration Act provides that a court in the district where the award
was made may, upon application of a party to the arbitration, make an order vacating the
award if:

     (1) the award was procured by corruption, fraud, or undue means;
     (2) there was evident partiality or corruption in the arbitrators, or either of them;
     (3) the arbitrators were guilty of misconduct in refusing to postpone the hearing,

          upon sufficient cause shown, or in refusing to hear evidence pertinent and
          material to the controversy; or of any other misbehaviour by which the rights
          of any party have been prejudiced; or
     (4) the arbitrators exceeded their powers, or so imperfectly executed them that a
          mutual, final, and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not
          made. 370

Within three years after an arbitral award under the New York Convention is made, a party
to the arbitration may apply for an order confirming the award as against any other party to
the arbitration.371 Federal district courts have original jurisdiction in proceedings for
recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards.372 The court will confirm the award
unless it finds one of the grounds for refusal of recognition or enforcement specified in
Article V of the New York Convention,373 which has been in force in the US since 29
December 1970.374

      13.2.3.4 UK

In the UK, a party to arbitration proceedings may apply to a court to challenge the award of
an arbitral tribunal as to its substantive jurisdiction, on the grounds of a serious irregularity
affecting the tribunal, the proceedings or the award.375 In this context, "serious irregularity"
means any of the following, if the court considers that such an irregularity has caused or will
cause substantial injustice to the applicant:

     (a) failure by the tribunal to comply with section 33 (general duty of tribunal);
     (b) the tribunal exceeding its powers (otherwise than by exceeding its substantive

          jurisdiction);

     (c) failure by the tribunal to conduct the proceedings in accordance with the
          procedure agreed by the parties;

     (d) failure by the tribunal to deal with all the issues that were put to it;

     (e) any arbitral or other institution or person vested by the parties with powers in
          relation to the proceedings or the award exceeding its powers;

     (f) uncertainty or ambiguity as to the effect of the award;

     (g) the award being obtained by fraud or the award or the way in which it was
          procured being contrary to public policy;

     (h) failure to comply with the requirements as to the form of the award; or

     (i) any irregularity in the conduct of the proceedings or in the award which is
          admitted by the tribunal or by any arbitral or other institution or person
          vested by the parties with powers in relation to the proceedings or the
          award. 376

Also, unlike many other jurisdictions, the Arbitration Act 1996 provides a party to arbitration
proceedings with an opportunity to appeal to the court on a question of law arising out of
an award made in the proceedings.377 An appeal may be brought only (a) with the agreement
of all the other parties to the proceedings or (b) with the leave of the court.378 Leave to appeal
will be given only if the court is satisfied that:

          (a) the determination of the question will substantially affect the rights of one
                or more of the parties,

          (b) the question is one which the tribunal was asked to determine,

          (c) on the basis of the findings of fact in the award

                (i) the decision of the tribunal on the question is obviously wrong
                     or

                (ii) the question is one of general public importance and the
                     decision of the tribunal is at least open to serious doubt, and

          (d) despite the agreement of the parties to resolve the matter by arbitration, it
                is just and proper in all the circumstances for the court to determine the
                question.379

Any application or appeal must be brought within 28 days of the date of the award and may
not be brought unless the applicant or appellant has already exhausted any available arbitral
process of appeal or review.380

The Arbitration Act 1996 provides that a New York Convention award (i.e., an arbitral award
made in the territory of a state which is a party to the New York Convention) is binding on
the persons as between whom it was made and may, by leave of the court, be enforced in
the same manner as a judgment or order of the court to the same effect.381 Recognition or
enforcement of an award may be refused only on the grounds enumerated in Article V of
the New York Convention,382 which has been in force in the UK since December 23, 1975.383

      13.2.3.5 Canada

Under the UNCITRAL Model Law, adopted in Canada at the federal, provincial and
territorial levels, recourse to a court to challenge an arbitral award is only available through
an application for setting aside.384 The grounds for setting aside an arbitral award are
enumerated in Article 34(2) of the UNCITRAL Model Law and mirror the grounds for
refusal of recognition or enforcement of arbitral awards in Article V of the New York
Convention.385 An application for setting aside must be made within three months after the
date on which the party making the application received the award.386

An arbitral award, irrespective of the country in which it was made, must be recognized as
binding and will be enforced upon application in writing to the competent court.387 The
grounds for refusal of recognition or enforcement of arbitral awards, enumerated in Article
35(1) of the UNCITRAL Model Law, mirror those listed in Article V of the New York
Convention, which has been in force in Canada since August 10, 1986.388

13.3 Treatment of Allegations in International Investment Arbitration

This subsection gives an overview of contract- and treaty-based international investment
arbitration cases where parties made allegations of corruption. It shows that corruption has
been invoked by private investors as claimants to seek compensation for the losses caused
by the actions of corrupt public officials, and by states as respondents to escape liability in
cases arising out of investments tainted by corruption.

      13.3.1 Claimant Allegations

Four cases described below show where the question of corruption was raised by the
investors who alleged that public officials in the host state solicited bribes from them (EDF

v Romania389) or were corruptly influenced by the investors' competitors (Methanex v United
States,390 Oostergetel v Slovakia,391 and ECE and PANTA v Czech Republic392).

          13.3.1.1 Methanex v United States

In Methanex v United States, the claimant initiated arbitration proceedings under Chapter 11
of NAFTA seeking compensation from the US for $970 million in losses caused by the State
of California's ban on the sale and use of the gasoline additive MTBE, a key ingredient of
which is methanol.393 Methanex, a Canadian producer of methanol, alleged that the then-
California Governor Grays' decision to issue the ban on MTBE was motivated by corruption,
as the Governor received more than $200,000 in political campaign contributions from ADM,
the principal US producer of ethanol.394

The tribunal ultimately found that it did not have jurisdiction over some of the claimant's
claims and dismissed all other claims on their merits.395 The importance of this case is its
approach to evaluating the evidence of corruption.396 Methanex invited the tribunal to base
the finding of corruption on the totality of factual inferences and interpretations:

          Counsel for Methanex's description of this methodology can be
          summarised, colloquially, as one of inviting the Tribunal to "connect the
          dots," i.e., while individual pieces of evidence when viewed in isolation
          may appear to have no significance, when seen together, they provide the
          most compelling of possible explanations of events, which will support
          Methanex's claims.397

The tribunal agreed with the methodology proposed by the claimant, but the dots did not
connect for Methanex:

          Connecting the dots is hardly a unique methodology; but when it is applied,
          it is critical, first, that all the relevant dots be assembled; and, second, that
          each be examined, in its own context, for its own significance, before a
          possible pattern is essayed. Plainly, a self-serving selection of events and a

          self-serving interpretation of each of those selected, may produce an
          account approximating verisimilitude, but it will not reflect what actually
          happened. Accordingly, the Tribunal will consider the various "dots"
          which Methanex has adduced -- one-by-one and then together with certain
          key events (essentially additional, noteworthy dots) which Methanex does
          not adduce -- in order to reach a conclusion about the factual assertions
          which Methanex has made. Some of Methanex's proposed dots emerge as
          significant; others, as will be seen, do not qualify as such. In the end, the
          Tribunal finds it impossible plausibly to connect these dots in such a way
          as to support the claims set forth by Methanex.398

In particular, the tribunal observed that in the US, political campaigns at the federal and
state level may accept private financial contributions, and "no rule of international law was
suggested as evidence that the US and other nations which allow private financial
contributions in electoral campaigns are thereby in violation of international law."399 The
tribunal also rejected Methanex's suggestion that the fact that ADM hosted a "secret" dinner
for Mr. Davis confirms an intent to favor ethanol and thus injure methanol producers
(including Methanex).400 While the contribution of campaign funds, if made under
circumstances that suggest a deal or a quid pro quo, could be unlawful and amount to a breach
of NAFTA's provisions on national treatment, minimum standard of treatment, and
expropriation, Methanex itself acknowledged that it was unable to prove any quid pro quo or
handshake deal.401

          13.3.1.2 EDF v Romania

In EDF v Romania, a UK company that formed two joint ventures with Romanian state-
owned entities claimed that Romania failed to accord fair and equitable treatment to EDF's
investment. EDF claimed that the revocation of its duty-free store licenses and non-renewal
of its lease agreements resulted from EDF's refusal to pay $2.5 million in bribes allegedly
solicited by the Prime Minister of Romania and other senior public officials.402 The
respondent denied the allegations of corruption and noted that the claimant did not provide
"reliable evidence" that the numerous decision-makers involved in the process of deciding
whether to extend the contract or to approve the act governing duty-free licenses "were even
aware of, let alone influenced by, alleged bribes solicited by the Prime Minister's staff
members."403 The claimant did not report the alleged bribe solicitations when they occurred
in August and October of 2001, but published them in a German newspaper in November
2002, following which an investigation was opened by the Romanian Anti-Corruption
Authority (DNA).404 The DNA has twice investigated the claimant's allegations of bribery
solicitation and twice (in 2003 and 2006) rejected them, and the criminal courts in Romania

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

have twice reviewed and affirmed the DNA's findings that the claimant's allegations are
groundless.405

The tribunal agreed that solicitation of bribes by the host state's officials would amount to a
violation of the BIT, but ruled that the claimant failed to furnish "clear and convincing"
evidence of the respondent's corruption:

          The Tribunal shares the Claimant's view that a request for a bribe by a State
          agency is a violation of the fair and equitable treatment obligation owed to
          the Claimant pursuant to the BIT, as well as a violation of international
          public policy, and that "exercising a State's discretion on the basis of
          corruption is a ... fundamental breach of transparency and legitimate
          expectations".... Respondent flatly denies that such a request for a corrupt
          payment was made. In any case, however, corruption must be proven and
          is notoriously difficult to prove since, typically, there is little or no physical
          evidence. The seriousness of the accusation of corruption in the present
          case, considering that it involves officials at the highest level of the
          Romanian Government at the time, demands clear and convincing
          evidence. There is general consensus among international tribunals and
          commentators regarding the need for a high standard of proof of
          corruption. The evidence before the Tribunal in the instant case concerning
          the alleged solicitation of a bribe is far from being clear and convincing.406

Furthermore, the tribunal seemed to imply that, in order to attribute bribe solicitation by a
public official to the official's state, the investor would need to prove, by clear and
convincing evidence, that such a public official was soliciting the bribe "on behalf and for
the account of the Government."

          The burden of proof lies with the Claimant as the party alleging solicitation
          of a bribe. Clear and convincing evidence should have been produced by
          the Claimant showing not only that a bribe had been requested from Mr.
          Weil [the CEO of EDF], but also that such request had been made not in the
          personal interest of the person soliciting the bribe, but on behalf and for the
          account of the Government authorities in Romania, so as to make the State
          liable in that respect. In the absence of such evidence, the Tribunal is
          compelled to draw the conclusion that Claimant did not sustain its burden
          of proof. 407

          13.3.1.3 Oostergetel v Slovakia

In Oostergetel v Slovakia, the claimants contended that the bankruptcy proceedings of BCT,
their investment vehicle, were conducted in an illegitimate manner.408 They alleged that,
possibly due to corruption, the state officials involved in the bankruptcy proceedings (tax

authorities, ministers, judges, and trustees) supported the so-called "Slovak financial mafia"
in depriving the claimants of their real estate.409

With regard to the claimants' allegation that they were denied justice in the Slovak courts,
the tribunal observed that despite the seriousness of the allegations of corruption and
conspiracy to ruin the claimants' investment, the investors "made no serious attempt to
establish that the adjudication of the bankruptcy of BCT by the Slovak Courts was so bereft
of a basis in law that the judgment was in effect arbitrary or malicious."410 The claimants
appealed the adjudication of bankruptcy only on procedural grounds (and did not contest
the substantive reasons for the bankruptcy), and the claimants' own legal expert largely
supported the correctness of the proceedings.411 Accordingly, the tribunal rejected the
claimants' allegations of a denial of justice:

          296. In light of these statements, it is clear that a claim for denial of justice
          must fail. The Claimants failed to provide sufficient proof of the alleged
          missteps of the bankruptcy proceedings. As regards a claim for a substantial
          denial of justice, mere suggestions of illegitimate conduct, general
          allegations of corruption and shortcomings of a judicial system do not
          constitute evidence of a treaty breach or a violation of international law.
          Neither did the Claimants explain the causal link between the alleged
          conduct by the relevant actors and the alleged damage. The burden of proof
          cannot be simply shifted by attempting to create a general presumption of
          corruption in a given State.

          297. Even accepting that irregularities did occur in the course of the
          proceedings, the record shows that the bankruptcy of BCT was the lawful
          consequence of the Claimants' persistent default on their tax debts, and no
          proof was found that the State organs conspired with the so-called
          "financial" or "bankruptcy mafia" against the investors or their investment
          in the Slovak Republic.412

The tribunal was also not convinced by the claimants' suggestion that bribery was a possible
explanation for the alleged conduct of the relevant public officials. The claimants relied on
general reports about corruption in Slovak courts, local news clippings concerning
irregularities in bankruptcy proceedings handled by the Regional Court of Bratislava, and
reports by the European Union and US, which mentioned that bribery is widespread in
Slovak courts:

          While such general reports are to be taken very seriously as a matter of
          policy, they cannot substitute for evidence of a treaty breach in a specific
          instance. For obvious reasons, it is generally difficult to bring positive proof
          of corruption. Yet, corruption can also be proven by circumstantial

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

          evidence. In the present case, both are entirely lacking. Mere insinuations
          cannot meet the burden of proof which rests on the Claimants.413

          13.3.1.4 ECE and PANTA v Czech Republic

In ECE and PANTA v Czech Republic, the dispute arose out of an unsuccessful real estate
project attempted by two German investors in the Czech Republic.414 The claimants alleged
that the conduct of the Czech authorities with respect to permits required for the
construction of a shopping center resulted in excessive delays and ultimately left the
claimants no choice but to abandon their investment.415 The claimants thus sought
compensation for the alleged breaches of their treaty rights to fair and equitable treatment,
admission of lawful investments, non-discrimination and protection against arbitrary
measures, as well as for expropriation.416 The investors admitted that they had no direct
proof that a competitor bribed officials to halt their permit applications, but presented what
they believed to be "numerous serious indices that leave no other option but to conclude
that a corruption scheme exists."417 The claimants cited several NGO reports on systematic
corruption in the Czech Republic generally and the city in which the proposed project was
located.418 The claimants also relied on the testimony of a Czech lawyer who was involved
in advising ECE on the permit proceedings. She testified that local officials admitted to her
that they had been instructed to obstruct the permit proceedings.419

The tribunal noted that it "cannot turn a blind eye to corruption and cannot decline to
investigate the matter simply because of the difficulties of proof"420 and accepted that it had
to "examine with care the facts alleged to prove corruption."421 However, as in Methanex v
United States, the "dots" did not connect for the claimants who alleged corruption:

          4.876 When considering the Claimants' evidence the Tribunal has borne in
          mind the difficulties of obtaining evidence of corruption. It is well aware
          that acts of corruption are rarely admitted or documented and that tribunals
          have discussed the need to "connect the dots". At the same time, the
          allegations that have been made are very serious indeed. Not only would
          they (if true) involve criminal liability on the part of a number of named
          individuals, they also implicate the reputation, commercial and legal
          interests of various business undertakings which are not party to these
          proceedings and which are not represented before the Tribunal. Corruption
          is a charge which an arbitral tribunal must take seriously. At the same time,
          it is a charge that should not be made lightly, and the Tribunal is bound to
          express its reservations as to whether it is acceptable for charges of that level

          of seriousness to be advanced without either some direct evidence or
          compelling circumstantial evidence. That said, the Tribunal must of course
          decide the case on the basis of the evidence before it. If the burden of proof
          is not discharged, the allegation is not made out. The mere existence of
          suspicions cannot, in the absence of sufficiently firm corroborative
          evidence, be equated with proof. 422
          ...
          4.879 The Tribunal must begin by stating that it finds to be deeply
          unattractive an argument to the effect that `everyone knows that the Czech
          Republic is corrupt; therefore, there was corruption in this case.... The
          Tribunal acknowledges that some effort was made to adduce specific
          evidence of corruption, but it did feel that there was a strain of the `everyone
          knows' argument in the overall case, for example in the reliance on reports
          of NGOs as to the general presence of corruption within the Czech Republic.
          The Tribunal does not close its eyes to the fact that the Czech Republic, like
          other countries, has had, and reportedly still has, problems with corruption.
          But the Tribunal remains vigilant against blanket condemnatory allegations
          which can have the appearance of an attempt to `poison the well' in the
          hopes of making up for a lack of direct proof. Reference to other instances
          of alleged corruption may prove that corruption exists in the State, but it
          does little to advance the argument that corruption existed in the specific
          events giving rise to the claim. or do allegations of this kind, however
          seriously advanced, give rise to a burden on the Respondent to `disprove'
          the existence of corruption. While the present Tribunal is therefore willing
          to "connect the dots", if that is appropriate, the dots have to exist and they
          must be substantiated by relevant and probative evidence relating to the
          specific allegations made in the case before it.423

Therefore, after reviewing the evidence, the tribunal found no substantial evidence of
corruption, be it in respect to individual acts or in respect to an alleged "scheme" of
corruption.424

      13.3.2 Respondent Allegations of Corruption

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

          13.3.2.1 World Duty Free v Kenya

The importance of the tribunal's decision in World Duty Free v Kenya425 lies in the fact that it
was the first contract-based investment arbitration case in which a tribunal made a
determinative finding of corruption.426 In 2000, World Duty Free (WDF) filed a claim at the
ICSID pursuant to the arbitration clause in a 1989 contract (governed by English and Kenyan
law) for construction and operation of duty free complexes at two international airports.427
WDF alleged that Kenya, through its executive, judiciary, and agents, improperly used WDF
in election campaign finance fraud, illegally expropriated the company, wrongfully placed
it in receivership, caused damage through mismanagement in receivership, refused to
protect WDF from crime and unlawfully deported its CEO.428 Subsequently, the owner and
CEO of WDF acknowledged that, in order to be able to engage in business in Kenya, WDF
was required to make a "personal donation" in the amount of $2 million to the then-
President of Kenya in March 1989.429 In response, Kenya submitted an application alleging
that the 1989 contract was unenforceable because the contract was procured by paying a
bribe and requesting dismissal of WDF's claims in their entirety.430

The tribunal held that payments made by WDF's owner and CEO were bribes rather than a
"personal donation for public purposes," because they were made not only in order to obtain
an audience with the President, but "above all to obtain during that audience the agreement
of the President on the contemplated investment."431 The arbitrators noted that "bribery or
influence peddling, as well as both active and passive corruption, are sanctioned by criminal
law in most, if not all, countries,"432 including Kenya. The tribunal reviewed several
international anti-corruption treaties, court decisions and arbitral awards433 and concluded
that even though in some countries or economic sectors bribery is "a common practice
without which the award of a contract is difficult - or even impossible," arbitrators "always
refused to condone such practices,"434 and thus contracts based on corruption may not be
upheld in arbitration:

          In light of domestic laws and international conventions relating to
          corruption, and in light of the decisions taken in this matter by courts and
          arbitral tribunals, this Tribunal is convinced that bribery is contrary to the
          international public policy of most, if not all, States or, to use another
          formula, to transnational public policy. Thus, claims based on contracts of

          corruption or on contracts obtained by corruption cannot be upheld by this
          Arbitral Tribunal.435

The tribunal, therefore, found that Kenya was legally entitled to avoid the contract tainted
by corruption, and WDF was "not legally entitled to maintain any of its pleaded claims in
these proceedings as a matter of ordre public international and public policy under the
contract's applicable laws."436

The tribunal, however, noted that Kenya's failure either to recover the bribe in civil
proceedings or to prosecute the former President, who appears to have solicited the bribe,
was "highly disturbing":

          It remains nonetheless a highly disturbing feature in this case that the
          corrupt recipient of the Claimant's bribe was more than an officer of state
          but its most senior officer, the Kenyan President; and that it is Kenya which
          is here advancing as a complete defence to the Claimant's claims the
          illegalities of its own former President. Moreover, on the evidence before
          this Tribunal, the bribe was apparently solicited by the Kenyan President
          and not wholly initiated by the Claimant. Although the Kenyan President
          has now left office and is no longer immune from suit under the Kenyan
          Constitution, it appears that no attempt has been made by Kenya to
          prosecute him for corruption or to recover the bribe in civil proceedings.437

Nevertheless, the tribunal ruled that "the law protects not the litigating parties but the
public; or in this case, the mass of tax-payers and other citizens making up one of the poorest
countries in the world,"438 and thus refrained from imposing a duty to prosecute upon the
responding state as a precondition to successfully raising the corruption defence.

          13.3.2.2 Metal-Tech v Uzbekistan

Metal-Tech v Uzbekistan439 was the first investment treaty arbitration case where the tribunal
decided that it did not have jurisdiction because the investment was tainted by corruption.440
Metal-Tech, an Israeli company, commenced ICSID proceedings alleging that Uzbekistan
failed to accord fair and equitable treatment and protection and security to the company.
Metal-Tech also alleged that Uzbekistan had expropriated Metal-Tech's investment in
Uzmetal, a joint venture formed with two Uzbek state-owned companies.441

In November 2011, Uzbekistan informed the tribunal that it had recently become aware of
the details of a criminal investigation by the Prosecutor General's Office into questionable
payments to Uzbek public officials and individuals affiliated with Metal-Tech and

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

Uzmetal.442 Uzbekistan alleged that several consulting agreements, which Metal-Tech
entered into between 2000 and 2005, were a sham designed to cover illegal payments to
Uzbek public officials or their close affiliates.443 Metal-Tech's CEO admitted that about $4
million had been paid to consultants who were "primarily engaged in `lobbying'
activities."444 Therefore, the tribunal concluded that it lacked jurisdiction over the investor's
claims because Metal-Tech breached both the Uzbek Criminal Code and the legality
requirement under the Israel-Uzbekistan BIT by making payments to a governmental official
and a close relative of a high-ranked public official for the purpose of influence peddling.445

The arbitrators decided that the investor had lost protection under the BIT, but denied
Uzbekistan's request that costs be assessed against the claimant:

          The Tribunal found that the rights of the investor against the host State,
          including the right of access to arbitration, could not be protected because
          the investment was tainted by illegal activities, specifically corruption. The
          law is clear - and rightly so - that in such a situation the investor is deprived
          of protection and, consequently, the host State avoids any potential liability.
          That does not mean, however, that the State has not participated in creating
          the situation that leads to the dismissal of the claims. Because of this
          participation, which is implicit in the very nature of corruption, it appears
          fair that the Parties share in the costs.446

Although the claimant's insistence that "there is no evidence that [the claimant's consultant]
is being investigated or has been arrested for any crime"447 and that "no official was charged
with unlawful conduct in connection with its project"448 did not preclude the tribunal from
refusing to hear the investor's claims, the arbitrators found it necessary to state:

          While reaching the conclusion that the claims are barred as a result of
          corruption, the Tribunal is sensitive to the ongoing debate that findings on
          corruption often come down heavily on claimants, while possibly
          exonerating defendants that may have themselves been involved in the
          corrupt acts. It is true that the outcome in cases of corruption often appears
          unsatisfactory because, at first sight at least, it seems to give an unfair
          advantage to the defendant party. The idea, however, is not to punish one
          party at the cost of the other, but rather to ensure the promotion of the rule
          of law, which entails that a court or tribunal cannot grant assistance to a
          party that has engaged in a corrupt act.449

          13.3.2.3 Niko Resources v Bangladesh

In a contract-based investment arbitration arising out of the 2003 Joint Venture Agreement
(JVA) and the 2006 Gas Purchase and Sales Agreement (GPSA), Niko Resources and state-
owned companies Bapex and Petrobangla, Niko Resources claimed $35.71 million, alleging
it had not been paid for deliveries of gas.450

During negotiations for the GPSA, the claimant delivered a car to the Bangladeshi State
Minister for Energy and Mineral Resources, while the claimant's Canadian parent company
provided the Minister with an all-expenses-paid trip to an exposition in Calgary.451
Following an investigation in Canada, Niko Canada, on the basis of an agreed statement of
facts, was convicted of bribery in 2011 and ordered to pay about CDN$9.5 million in fines.452
The respondents objected to the tribunal's jurisdiction, arguing that the claimant "has
violated the principles of good faith and international public policy" and the tribunal was
thus "empowered to protect the integrity of the ICSID dispute settlement mechanism by
dismissing a claim which represents a violation of fundamental principles of law."453 The
tribunal noted that the question, therefore, was "whether any instance of bribery and
corruption in which the Claimant has been or may have been involved deprives the
Claimant from having its claims considered and ruled upon by the present Tribunal."454

The arbitrators confirmed that bribery is contrary to international public policy,455 but made
a distinction between contracts of corruption and contracts obtained by corruption:

          There is indeed a fundamental difference between the two types of
          situations. In contracts of corruption, the object of the contract is the
          corruption of a civil servant and this object is intended by both parties to
          the contract. In contracts obtained by corruption, one of the parties normally
          is aware of the corruption and intends to obtain the contract by these means.
          But this is not necessarily the case for the other side. As explained in the
          World Duty Free award, bribes normally are covert. In that case the bribe was
          received not by the Government or another public entity but by an
          individual, the then President of the country. As the World Duty Free
          tribunal held, the receipt of the bribe is "not legally imputed to Kenya itself. If
          it were otherwise, the payment would not be a bribe."456

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

While the tribunal observed that contracts of corruption were found void or unenforceable
and denied effect by international arbitrators,457 in the case of covert bribes, the side innocent
of corruption may have a justifiable interest in preserving the contract.458 In the present case,
the contracts giving rise to the investor's claims had a legitimate object (the development of
a gas field)459 and there was no causal link between the corruption and conclusion of the
agreements (the JVA was concluded before the acts of corruption and the GPSA was
concluded 18 months after the Minister resigned).460 In addition, the respondents did not
seek to avoid the agreements or to declare them void ab initio.461

Instead, the respondents asserted that, because the act of bribery linked to the investment
and for which the investor's parent company was convicted in Canada, ICSID jurisdiction
should be denied to the claimant.462 The respondents invoked three arguments:

          (a) ICSID arbitration applies only to investments made in good faith;

          (b) accepting jurisdiction would jeopardize the integrity of the ICSID dispute
               settlement mechanism; and

          (c) the doctrine of clean hands.463

With respect to the first argument, the tribunal ruled that in a contractual dispute, "alleged
or established lack of good faith in the investment does not justify the denial of jurisdiction
but must be considered as part of the merits of the dispute."464 Secondly, the integrity of the
investment arbitration system is "protected by the resolution of the contentions made
(including allegations of violation of public policy) rather than by avoiding them."465 Finally,
in response to the third objection, the arbitrators stated that Petrobangla and Bapex, with the
approval of the Bangladesh Government, entered into the GPSA even after the corruption
scandal and resignation of the Minister, so that even if the claimant and Niko Canada had
unclean hands, the respondents disregarded this situation and may no longer rely on these
events to deny jurisdiction under an arbitration agreement which they then accepted.466 The
tribunal thus held that Niko Canada's corruption conviction in Canada could not be used as
grounds to refuse jurisdiction over the merits of a dispute which the parties to the JVA and
GPSA had agreed to submit to ICSID arbitration.467

Niko Resources v Bangladesh is thus a rare case where corruption was found to exist but did
not determine the outcome, as the tribunal rejected the respondents' objection to jurisdiction
despite the claimant's admissions of wrongdoing.468 In 2014, the tribunal ordered

Petrobangla to pay Niko $25.5 million for gas delivered from November 2004 to April
2010.469 However, in March 2016, the respondents submitted a new request seeking
declarations that the JVA and the GPSA had been procured through corruption and the
claimant was thus not entitled to use international arbitration to pursue its claims or,
alternatively, that the JVA and the GPSA were void.470 The tribunal affirmed that it was
"conscious of the seriousness of corruption offenses" and, being "[m]indful of [the
tribunal's] responsibility for upholding international public policy,"471 decided it would
examine circumstances surrounding the negotiation and conclusion of the JVA and the
GPSA to determine whether they were procured by corruption.

In a 587-page decision issued in February 2019, the tribunal rejected the respondents'
objections to the tribunal's jurisdiction and concluded that the JVA and the GPSA were not
procured by corruption.472 The evidence presented by the respondents did not contain any
indication of corruption in the proposal and acceptance of the arbitration clauses,473 and the
object of the JVA and the GPSA, that is for Niko to develop the gas fields and sell the gas to
Petrobangla, was lawful; the question whether Niko was lawfully granted governmental
authority to do so was one concerning the merits, not the jurisdiction.474 As to the merits of
the respondents' corruption allegations, the tribunal found it "difficult to identify an
invariable rule on the standard of proof" and did not "find much assistance in terms such as
`preponderance of evidence' and `heightened standard of proof.'"475 Ultimately, the question
was simply "whether the Tribunals are persuaded that the JVA and GPSA were procured
by corruption or not,"476 and the arbitrators rejected the respondents' allegations as
unfounded. 477

an oil company.479 In 2003, following the Croatian government's decision to privatize INA,
MOL acquired a 25%+1 share in INA while the government remained the majority
shareholder. Further negotiations culminated in two agreements which allowed MOL to
increase its stake in INA to 49% (the 2009 Agreements). Whereas Croatia alleges the 2009
Agreements were procured by MOL's CEO through bribery of then-Prime Minister of
Croatia Ivo Sanader, the investor points out that neither MOL nor its CEO has been
convicted of any crime in relation to the 2009 Agreements, and alleges that criminal charges
against MOL's CEO are "baseless" and represent an attempt by Croatia to take control of
INA.480 In addition, the investor asserts that allegations of bribery constitute an "illegal effort
to harass and intimidate MOL."481 Croatia maintains that initiation of the ICSID proceedings
was "just another attempt [made by the investor's CEO] to evade justice."482

In November 2012, Ivo Sanader was convicted in Croatia for accepting 5 million bribe from
MOL in exchange for facilitating the conclusion of the 2009 Agreements. However, in July
2015, Croatia's Constitutional Court annulled the conviction and ordered a retrial, which
began in September of 2015. Croatian law enforcement authorities also issued an indictment
against MOL's CEO and chairman Zsolt Hernádi, but Hungarian authorities declined
Croatia's requests to question him.

On December 2, 2014, the ICSID tribunal declined Croatia's application to dismiss the
investor's claims on a summary basis and decided that consideration of the objections put
forward by the respondent should be postponed to a later stage of the proceedings.483
Meanwhile, Croatia initiated a contract-based arbitration against MOL. However, in its
December 23, 2016 award, the tribunal refused to declare the 2009 Agreements null and void
as it arrived at a "confident conclusion" that Croatia had not proven that MOL bribed Mr.
Sanader to secure the impugned contracts.484 As the ICSID arbitration is still pending, it
remains to be seen how the ICSID tribunal will approach the issue of corruption and what

13.4 International Investment Arbitration and the Global Fight against

        Corruption

International arbitration is, by nature, a private and consensual procedure. Its neutrality and
flexibility, as well as the enforceability of arbitration agreements and final and binding
character of arbitral awards, make international arbitration the primary mechanism for the
settlement of disputes arising out of international commercial and investment transactions.
However, the global nature of modern business, increasing involvement of states and state-
owned enterprises in international investment, and rising sophistication of regulatory and
reporting schemes in various countries inevitably result in a corresponding surge in the
number of investment disputes. In 2020, investors initiated 68 publicly-known treaty-based
international investment arbitrations, and the respondent was a developing country or a
transition economy in around 75% of these cases.485 As of 2021, 124 countries and one
economic grouping have been named as respondents in one or several known treaty-based
investment arbitration disputes.486

Not surprisingly, the issue of corruption has found its way into some investment disputes.
Arbitration cases reviewed in this section demonstrate that both foreign investors and host
states may make allegations of corruption. On the one hand, investors have made attempts
to seek compensation from host states for damages or losses caused by public officials who
allegedly solicited bribes or were corruptly influenced by the investors' competitors.
Tribunals have hinted that corruption on the side of the host state's public officials, if proven,
may engage the host state's liability for the breach of national treatment or fair and equitable
treatment standards, as well as for illegal expropriation. However, while the arbitrators
accepted the possibility that corruption may be proven with circumstantial evidence, by
"connecting the dots," the investors failed to furnish "clear and convincing" evidence of
corruption. On the other hand, where the claimants' investments were tainted by corruption,
the arbitrators exercised their duty to uphold international public policy and thus rejected
the investors' claims.

In summary, international arbitration principles and procedures discourage investors from
getting involved in corrupt activities, as such activities deny recovery to claimants whose
investments are tainted by bribery. At the same time, international arbitration remains a
private and consensual dispute resolution mechanism in which arbitrators have no power
or authority to investigate allegations of corruption on their own. This means that in some
cases (at least theoretically), public officials may get away with soliciting bribes or being
bribed by the investors' competitors.

1. INTRODUCTION

All lawyers owe certain legal, professional, and ethical duties to their clients. This chapter
focuses on four of those duties, which are most relevant when lawyers provide advice to
their business clients for the purpose of assisting their clients in pursuit of the client's
business objectives. Those duties are:

     · Duty to avoid Conflicts of Interest
     · Duty not to Advise or Assist in Violation of Law
     · Duty of Confidentiality and
     · Duty to preserve Lawyer/Client Privilege

This chapter is an important prelude to the next chapter that focuses on the seminal role that
lawyers play in the context of anti-corruption policies, risk assessments, and due diligence
practices in modern multi-national business transactions.

2. LAWYERS AND BUSINESS CLIENTS

2.1 Multiple Roles of Lawyers

In the context of business law, lawyers have an increasingly large role to play in anti-
corruption compliance. Lawyers provide legal, and often business, advice to their clients.
We will address the critical distinction between legal and business advice later in this
chapter.

In providing legal advice, lawyers are "transaction facilitators." They are expected to
construct transactions in a way that complies with relevant laws, including laws prohibiting
the offering or paying of bribes.1 In addition to providing legal advice, lawyers educate their
clients on the law and on how to comply with the law while achieving business objectives.2
Lawyers may act as internal or external investigators if there is an allegation of corruption
against a client.3 They will frequently have to conduct or oversee due diligence
investigations prior to closing certain transactions. Lawyers may act as compliance officers
or ethics officers by creating, enforcing and reviewing their client's compliance program.4
Lawyers may act as assurance practitioners and conduct an assurance engagement on the
effectiveness of the organization's control procedures.5 In an increasingly technology-
enabled practice environment, the use of technology for information storage, retrieval, and
exchange, document preparation, and communication increases, and lawyers are required

to address privacy, confidentiality and privilege protection, and to act as privacy and
technology risk management advisors. Finally, some lawyers may be in the position of a
gatekeeper in the sense that, by advising their client on the illegality or potential illegality of
a proposed transaction and refusing to do the necessary legal work for the transaction, they
may prevent their client from breaching the law. In each of these roles, the lawyer may come
face to face with issues of corruption and have to consider the ethical and professional
obligations that may guide and constrain their conduct and advice.6

2.2 Who is the Client?

Lawyers owe various duties to their clients. To fulfill those duties, the lawyer must of course
know who their client is. In many forms of legal practice, the client is a physical person and
their identity is self-evident. However, in the business world, the client is usually an
organization. Businesses are usually conducted under one of the many forms of business
organizations, which include:

     · Incorporated companies (both for-profit and not-for-profit and including
          special corporate structures such as universities, hospitals, municipalities and
          unions);

     · Unincorporated associations or societies;
     · Sole proprietorships;
     · Partnerships; and
     · Trusts (e.g., pension fund trusts, mutual trusts, and real estate investment

          fund trusts).

In this chapter, we will focus primarily on incorporated companies, both for simplicity and
because incorporated companies are the prevalent business form for most commercial
entities of any significant size.

In common law countries (and some civil law countries), a corporation is a separate legal
entity. While treating the corporation as a person is a legal fiction, it nonetheless means the
corporation can act as a legal entity. For example, it can own property, enter into contracts
for goods and services, hire and fire employees, and sue or be sued by others. Most
importantly, it also means the corporation has limited liability; if the corporation fails
financially, the individual owners and/or shareholders are not personally liable for the debts
of the corporation. The legal authority for the actions of a corporation is vested in the board
of directors. Thus, when a lawyer is hired by a corporation, the lawyer's client is the
corporation whose authority and ultimate directions come from the board of directors.
While a lawyer may operationally receive instructions from and interact with senior
management, including Chief Executive Officers (CEOs), Chief Financial Officers (CFOs)
and Chief Operating Officers (COOs), the lawyer's client is still the corporation (i.e., the
corporate entity that speaks through its board). Thus, the lawyer must always be satisfied
that they are receiving instructions from someone who is authorized to give them. The

lawyer owes their professional duties to the corporation, not to senior management, the
chair of the board, or individual owners or shareholders.7

2.3 In-House and External Counsel

A lawyer may have one of two primary relationships with their business client: in-house
counsel or external counsel. External counsels are not employees of the client; they operate
independently and normally have multiple clients. The employment of lawyers as in-house
counsel has largely developed over the past 75 to 100 years.8 More than forty years ago, Lord
Denning described the position of in-house counsel in the legal profession as follows:

          Many barristers and solicitors are employed as legal advisers, whole time,
          by a single employer. Sometimes the employer is a great commercial
          concern. At other times it is a government department or a local authority....
          In every case these legal advisers do legal work for their employer and for
          no-one else. They are paid, not by fees for each piece of work, but by a fixed
          annual salary. They are, no doubt, servants or agents of the employer....
          They are regarded by the law as in every respect in the same position as
          those who practice on their own account. The only difference is that they act

In discussing the duties to clients and ethical obligations that a lawyer owes to clients in the US
context, this chapter will refer to the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct. In the Canadian
context, it will refer to the FLSC Model Code of Professional Conduct. These are model codes and are not
the specific code that applies in any given jurisdiction in the United States (for the ABA Model Rules
(2020)) or in Canada (for the FLSC Model Code (2019)). Each of these model codes includes a
comprehensive assessment of the general rule by which lawyers in the US or Canada, as the case
may be, are expected to abide. These model codes, while intended to help provide rules that are
consistent in the common law jurisdictions of their respective countries, are not consistently adopted
in their entirety by each jurisdiction. Courts and state bar authorities in the US, and Law Societies in
common law jurisdictions in Canada review provisions of the applicable model code, and consider
whether to incorporate them into their state, provincial or territorial codes. There remain variations
or departures from model code provisions in the codes of conduct of a number of state, provincial
and territorial jurisdictions. It is therefore important to check the rules in the code of every
jurisdiction that is under consideration. (The FLSC publishes and updates an Interactive Model Code
that allows the user to cross check the rules of a provincial Law Society against the comparable rules
and commentary in the model code. FLSC, Interactive Model Code of Professional Conduct (as updated

          for one client only and not for several clients. They must uphold the same
          standards of honour and of etiquette. They are subject to the same duties to
          their client and to the court. They must respect the same confidence. They
          and their clients have the same privileges.9

This description of in-house counsel remains generally accurate. The number of in-house
counsel compared to external counsel continues to grow as the use of "insourcing" is
preferred to the generally more expensive alternative of retaining external counsel.10 In-
house counsel constitute 15 to 20 percent of practicing lawyers. They have two active
professional associations in Canada: the Canadian Corporate Counsel Association11 and the
Association of Corporate Counsel of Canada.12 The former is an organization within the
Canadian Bar Association that focuses on the interests of corporate counsel. It has sections
in most jurisdictions in Canada, and offers specialized training and certification for in-house
counsel, as well as regular programming on issues relevant to corporate and business
practice. The latter represents more than 1,400 members in 500 corporations across Canada.
They have chapters in Alberta, British Columbia, Ontario, and Quebec and hold programs
every month on topics like compliance, ethics, intellectual property, legal risk management,
project management, career development, and more.13

While many corporations have in-house counsel, a corporation will often turn to external
counsel for highly specialized legal areas or for litigation. Some smaller corporations have
no in-house counsel. They refer all their legal work to one or more external law firms. While
the balance of work between in-house and external lawyers is often in flux, Woolley et al.
describe some attractions for retaining in-house counsel:

          Companies have found it valuable to have dedicated legal expertise
          resident within their walls, with professionals who know both the law and
          the organization intimately. Hiring corporate counsel can also be far more
          cost-efficient than hiring outside law firms on a case-by-case basis. For
          many lawyers, in-house practice can offer the combined attractions of
          interesting work, a lifestyle often perceived as more accommodating than
          that offered by private practice, greater job security, and significant
          financial reward through both substantial salaries and the chance to

          participate in the success of the company through compensation plans that
          include stock options.14

While in-house lawyers have the same general duties as external lawyers, their status as an
employee of the corporate client can raise professional issues requiring careful
consideration. In particular, the need to distinguish between legal advice and advice related
to business and business strategy is critical for example, to preserve privilege (discussed
below).

Further, in-house counsel are often dependent on the CEO of the corporation. This makes it
essential for them to do careful due diligence on both the CEO and the company itself to
ensure they are not entering an environment without a "culture of integrity."15 They must
be aware of their role as not only legal counsel, but also revenue-generators for the
corporation.16

Difficult issues around solicitor-client privilege and conflict of interest may arise more
frequently for in-house counsel than external counsel. For example, a member of the upper
management in a company may seek out the advice of in-house counsel on a matter of
corporate business.17 That person may mistakenly believe there is a degree of confidentiality
covering the conversation. However, the in-house counsel may feel duty-bound to
immediately disclose those seemingly confidential conversations to the board of directors.
In addition, the role of in-house counsel may involve advising the board of directors or audit
committee on acts or omissions of the officers and upper managers of the organization with
whom the lawyer works and from whom the lawyer regularly receives directions.18 Legally
and ethically, in-house counsel's client is the corporation, but as a practical matter, in-house
counsel are hired by and receive legal advice requests from officers or upper management.
Reporting on some or all matters to the Board of Directors may greatly strain the relationship
between the lawyer and company officers.19

Another concern for in-house counsel in respect to faithfully fulfilling their professional
legal duties and in particular their duty to act objectively and independently, has been
referred to as the problem of "cognitive dissonance." Woolley et al. explain as follows:

          Finally, in-house lawyers have to be especially aware of the challenges to
          their independence, and the phenomenon described as "cognitive
          dissonance." As many legal ethics experts have noted, in cases of client
          misconduct, lawyers' professional norms of client loyalty often conflict with
          personal norms of honesty and integrity. To reduce the "cognitive
          dissonance," lawyers will often unconsciously dismiss or discount evidence
          of misconduct and its impact on third parties. This becomes even more of a
          problem when lawyers bond socially and professionally with other
          employees, including senior management. The more a lawyer blends into
          insider culture, the greater the pressures to conform to the organization's
          cultural norms. That can in turn lead lawyers to underestimate risk and to
          suppress compromising information in order to preserve internal solidarity.
          In the long run, this dynamic can create problems for everyone: clients lose
          access to disinterested advice; lawyers lose capacity for independent
          judgment and moral autonomy; and the public loses protection from
          organizational misconduct. While this is a problem for all lawyers, the
          challenge is especially strong for corporate counsel. Although the financial
          and other consequences of terminating a relationship with a major client can
          be significant for lawyers in law firms, they pale in comparison to the
          consequences faced by an in-house counsel who is in essence walking away
          from their job and their financial security. The pressures - personal and
          professional - are enormous.20

2.4 Lawyer as a Corporate Gatekeeper

The term gatekeeper in the world of business generally refers to an outside or independent
monitor or watchdog.21 A corporate gatekeeper is someone who "screen[s] out flaws or
defects or who verifies compliance with standards or procedures."22 A corporate gatekeeper
will normally have at least one of two roles: (1) prevention of a corporate client's
wrongdoing by withholding their legal approval from actions that appear illegal and/or
disclosing such actions if the client does not desist from those actions and (2) acting as a
"reputational intermediary" who assures investors of the quality of the message or signal
sent out by the corporation.23 Coffee suggests there are four elements involved in
gatekeepers' responsibilities:

Enron" (2002-2003) 8 Stan JL Bus & Fin 9 at 20 (HeinOnline). This article uses the Enron scandal as an
example of how counsel reviewing its own work could have been viewed as contrary to professional
ethics. However, no action was taken against the firm for breach of ethical duties.

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

     (1) independence from the client;

     (2) professional skepticism of the client's representations;

     (3) a duty to the public investor; and

     (4) a duty to resign when the [gatekeeper's] integrity would otherwise be
          compromised.24

Gatekeeping is "premised on the ability of professionals to monitor and control their client's
conduct."25 Failure to do so can result in gatekeeper liability. Some scholars consider
auditors, lawyers, and securities analysts to be the primary gatekeeping professions.
However, the legal profession generally seeks to distance itself from the view that lawyers
are gatekeepers, promoting instead the view that the lawyer's role is to facilitate
transactions.26 Being a gatekeeper, with the attached obligation of protecting the public from
potential harm caused by clients, runs contrary to the traditional role of the lawyer as a
committed and loyal advocate for the client's interests and a guardian of the confidentiality
between lawyer and client. Business and securities regulators and the legal profession
disagree over whether lawyers should play a gatekeeping role in certain large corporate
affairs. On the one hand, the government has an obligation to regulate the corporate arena
to prevent widespread public harm and, on the other hand, the legal profession has an
interest in upholding the legal duties of confidentiality and loyalty to their clients.

Nonetheless, in some contexts lawyers are considered gatekeepers. The strongest argument
for the lawyer's role as a gatekeeper has arisen in the context of the securities and banking
sectors in the US, in which lawyers facilitated the questionable or illegal behaviour that lead
to major stock market collapses and harm to the economy and public. The US Congress
described lawyers as gatekeepers in the sense of "[p]rivate intermediaries who can prevent
harm to the securities markets by disrupting the misconduct of their client
representatives."27 If corporate lawyers are seen as transaction engineers rather than
advocates for their clients, this strengthens the argument that (some) corporate lawyers may
have a gatekeeping role.28 Litigators are not generally in the same position; they are
approached on an ex post basis, i.e., after trouble has arisen, and are by definition advocates
for their clients. However, corporate lawyers that provide services on an ex ante basis are
described as "wise counselors who gently guide their clients toward law compliance."29 In
that sense, they may be seen as having a role to play in ensuring that all transactions they
assist with and advise on comply with the law.

The key debate centers on the question of whether corporate lawyers have or should have a
duty to report their client or employer to market regulators when that client or employer

refuses to comply with the law. As noted, the primary arguments against assigning lawyers
the role of corporate gatekeeper (i.e., requiring disclosure of client wrongdoing) are that (1)
the role of gatekeeper destroys the duty of confidentiality and loyalty owed by a lawyer to
their client and (2) it will tend to have a chilling effect on full and open solicitor-client
communications.30 These risks exist where gatekeepers must report wrongdoing externally
rather than simply withhold their consent and withdraw from representation. Critics of the
imposition of gatekeeper obligations on lawyers also oppose the idea that lawyers owe a
duty to anyone aside from their clients and the courts, since additional duties may be at odds
with the interests of clients.31 In acting as a gatekeeper, the lawyer is put in a potentially
adversarial position with their client. This diminishes the lawyer's ability to effectively fulfill
their essential role of "promoting the corporation's compliance with law."32 The American
Bar Association Task Force on Corporate Responsibility found that lawyers are not
gatekeepers in the same way that auditors are:

          Accounting firms' responsibilities require them to express a formal public
          opinion, based upon an independent audit, that the corporation's financial
          statements fairly present the corporation's financial condition and results of
          operations in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
          The auditor is subject to standards designed to assure an arm's length
          perspective relative to the firms they audit. In contrast ... corporate lawyers
          are first and foremost counselors to their clients.33

The American Bar Association (ABA) also asserts that lawyers do not have an obligation or
a right to disclose reasonable doubts concerning their clients' disclosures to the Securities
and Exchange Commission (SEC).34

If corporate lawyers are considered gatekeepers, or at least partial gatekeepers, it should be
recognized that the extent of influence they can or will practically exert on a corporation can
vary. The "cognitive dissonance" noted above in the employment relationship between in-
house counsel and their client dampens the lawyer's independence from their client. The
practical ability of in-house counsel to give unwelcome but objective advice may be lessened
by the existence of internal reviews of counsel and pressure from senior managers, as well
as reprisals, if lawyers refuse to provide legal approval for a transaction.35 Since the legality
of certain conduct may be grey, rather than black or white, in-house counsel may tend to
consciously or unconsciously approve grey areas in circumstances where an external
counsel may not.

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

However, external counsel may also feel pressure to approve grey-area transactions due to
the desire to maintain the corporation as a client, especially if that corporation comprises a
significant portion of their billing. Additionally, as the role of in-house counsel expands and
less transactional business goes through external counsel, external counsel may have less
opportunity to discover and put a stop to corrupt or unlawful practices. Although in-house
counsel arguably have less professional independence than external counsel does, they may
be able to exert greater influence over corporate officers and directors because of their
working relationship and the ability of corporations to shop for another law firm if unhappy
with the advice or lack of cooperation of their current external law firm.36

A different aspect of a gatekeeper's role is the use of their reputation to assure the
marketplace that the corporation is abiding by various rules and regulations. External law
firms are arguably better suited to this role than in-house counsel. In-house counsel will
generally have less credibility in acting as a reputational intermediary, since they are seen
as too closely associated with their company to provide an objective and impartial assurance
to the marketplace.37

At present, it seems that corporate lawyers in the US, UK, and Canada are not gatekeepers
in the same way auditors are, since lawyers generally do not have a duty to report a client's
past wrongdoing or a duty to report a client's planned crimes unless death or serious bodily
harm to others is reasonably imminent. (These disclosure exceptions are discussed in more
detail in Section 3.3).

The focus of the discussion of lawyers in a gatekeeper role is the question of the lawyer's
duty, if any, to disclose wrongdoing to external regulators and public stakeholders. They do
have, however, a duty not to be complicit in any wrongdoing and a duty not to assist a
corporation in breaching the law. If asked to engage in illegal transactions, they are under a
duty to withdraw as counsel. This is discussed in detail in Section 3.2.

Even if lawyers are not gatekeepers in the sense that auditors are, counsel often have the
influence and ability to alter an organization's direction and propose a plan of action that
achieves a client's objective without illegality.38 While both in-house and external counsel
must say no to illegal methods of achieving the client's objectives, they are entitled and
expected to attempt to accomplish the client's objectives through alternative legal means.

3. LEGAL AND ETHICAL DUTIES

As already noted, all lawyers owe certain duties to their clients. In the case of a corporate
client, fulfilling those duties may sometimes be challenging. Although the corporate entity
has the legal status of a person, it acts through its officers, employees, directors, agents and
shareholders. A corporate lawyer works with any number of these individuals, but the
lawyer's ultimate duty is to the corporation itself. While this is true for both in-house, and

external counsel, in-house counsel have the added complication of duties as an employee to
their corporate employer but also duties to their corporate client as the client's lawyer.

In the most general sense, a lawyer's duties to a client involve integrity and competence.
Integrity broadly includes honesty, trustworthiness, candor, loyalty, civility, adherence to
rules of confidentiality and avoidance of conflicts of interest while vigorously serving the
client's stated interests within the limits of the law. In this context of integrity, this part of
the chapter briefly discusses four areas of legal and ethical duties that lawyers, whether in-
house or external, owe to their clients and how those duties can come into play in the context
of corporate corruption.

3.1 Duty to Avoid Conflicts of Interest

A conflict of interest results from the existence of a factor(s) that materially and adversely
affects the lawyer's ability to act in the best interests of their client.39 Generally, there are two
main categories of conflicts of interest: client conflict and own interest conflict. Client conflict
occurs when two of the lawyer's clients have interests that are at odds with each other. Client
conflict will normally only arise with external counsel, not in-house counsel. Of course, in-
house counsel may raise the issue if they think that the external lawyer acting for the
company has a client conflict. Own interest conflicts occur when a lawyer's interests are at
odds with that of a client. This latter genre of conflicts of interest requires a lawyer to avoid
placing their own interests before the interests of their clients. In order to avoid the
appearance of a conflict of interest, lawyers must avoid taking or keeping clients whose
interests are adverse, or potentially adverse, to their own.

The rationale for a lawyer's duty not to proceed with a case in the face of a conflict of interest
is often explained by reference to a broader duty--the lawyer's duty of loyalty to a client.
As Proulx and Layton state, "The leitmotif of conflict of interest is the broader duty of
loyalty. Where the lawyer's duty of loyalty is compromised by a competing interest, a
conflict of interest will exist."40 In addition, as Graham notes:

          Lawyers have an overriding duty to be loyal to their clients, and this duty
          of loyalty is undermined where lawyers act in cases that involve
          undisclosed conflicts of interests. As a result, lawyers are generally
          prohibited from acting in cases involving undisclosed conflicts of interest.

          If the basis of the rules regarding conflicts of interest can truly be explained
          by reference to an overriding duty of loyalty, it should be noted that the
          word "loyalty," when used in the context of lawyer's conflicts of interest,
          bears an unusual meaning ... [A] lawyer need not agree with his or her
          client's position, nor even hope that the client succeeds in achieving his or
          her legal objectives.... The lawyer may represent a client whose position the
          lawyer abhors, or a client whose specific legal project the lawyer considers

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

          immoral.... As a result, the lawyer may be unlikely to characterize his or
          her feelings toward the client as feelings of "loyalty."

          Such cases reveal that the lawyer's duty of loyalty does not truly imply
          loyalty to the client, or even loyalty to the client's legal objectives. Instead,
          the lawyer is loyal to his or her position as the client's legal adviser. If the
          lawyer fulfills the role of legal counsel, the lawyer will act as though he or
          she is loyal to the client. In reality, however, the lawyer's loyalty is to the
          job of lawyering. The lawyer's loyalty to his or her profession can be
          explained by reference to the lawyer's interests in (1) promoting access to
          justice by fulfilling a social role that the lawyer believes to be important; (2)
          promoting his or her own professional reputation as a skilled and zealous
          advocate; and (3) receiving legal fees for services rendered.41

The application of conflict of interest principles can be extremely difficult and frustrating for
lawyers. The complexity of business transactions in a corporate context, including the fact
that these may involve multiple parties across many jurisdictions complicates enormously
the analysis of conflict and the duty of loyalty in any particular transaction.42

Conflicts of interest may arise for corporate lawyers in many aspects of their practice
unrelated to concerns of corporate corruption. However, when an allegation or discovery of
corruption in a client's business first arises, there is potential for a conflict of interest. For
example, if a lawyer is working for two corporations, both of whom are alleged to have been
involved in the same corrupt scheme, the two companies' best interests may be in conflict
with one another (e.g., one company may agree to cooperate with the prosecution and testify
against the other company). In such circumstances, the lawyer cannot continue to act for
both client companies.43

The restriction against acting for two or more clients with opposing interests also restricts
lawyers from acting for a corporation while acting personally for the CEO or other senior
official connected to the corporation. A somewhat related ethical duty for corporate counsel
arises when there is an allegation of corruption in respect to a corporate client. The corporate
lawyer's client is the corporation. The corporation's best interests may be in conflict with the
interests of senior officers of the company if those officers are allegedly involved in the
corruption in some active or passive way. Any admissions made by senior officers to
corporate counsel are not privileged nor confidential. It would be unethical for a corporate
lawyer to allow a senior officer to make statements damaging to that officer without first
warning the officer that the lawyer is not, and cannot be, the officer's lawyer and that any
statements to the lawyer are not confidential or privileged and may subsequently be used
against the officer.

Because a corporation can only act through its officers and employees, the conflict between
advising the corporation and acting for senior officers creates difficulties. The corporation

and its counsel are disadvantaged in determining the facts of a case if its corporate actors
(the senior officers) do not cooperate in supplying information. It may be possible to mitigate
this problem through various means. For example, the corporation could agree to indemnify
the officer for his or her independent and separate legal fees in exchange for cooperation.

Other concerns may arise in regard to "own interest conflicts," especially for in-house
counsel due to the very nature of their employment relationship with their corporate client.
As in-house counsel are employees of the organization, they may benefit financially from
any lucrative deals the organization makes.44 Here again, the problem of `cognitive
dissonance' can be a factor. In-house counsel may fear being seen as obstructionist if they
vigorously oppose business activities on legal grounds (especially when those grounds leave
room for differing interpretations). In-house counsel work daily with senior management
and this can affect their ability to be fearlessly objective in delivering legal advice that may
be unwelcome to their client's management. In-house counsel have to be especially aware
of these types of challenges to their professional duty to act objectively and independently.

Many corporate business relationships involve related party transactions, in which the
principals, shareholders, officers, and directors of different public corporate entities that are
involved in a transaction can be some of the same individuals. A Law Society of Upper
Canada Appeal Tribunal considered this in a 2015 decision and described the concerns that
arise:

           When a dominant figure such as an executive, controlling shareholder or
          another company they control stands to profit from a transaction in a
          manner different from public shareholders, there is a "commercial tension"
          between the dominant figure and the public shareholders. This type of
          transaction is considered a "related party transaction" because of the
          differing interest of the dominant figure. Without a mechanism to ensure
          that such transactions are fair to the public company, there is a risk that the
          dominant figure will influence the transaction's terms at the expense of
          public shareholders.45

In those circumstances, the Tribunal determined that the analysis of whether a lawyer
advising on related party transactions was in a conflict of interest and had to be considered
on a transaction-by-transaction basis, and is entirely context driven. It stipulated that:

          The principles relating to conflict of interest under the Rules are the same
          whether the client is an individual, a small corporation or a large public
          corporation. The analysis, however, must be grounded in the context, which
          in this case is work on particular retainers for sophisticated corporate
          clients. None of the allegations in this case falls under the "bright line rule"
          which prohibits acting, without informed consent, for two current clients
          whose immediate legal interests are directly adverse. Whether there was a
          conflict under the Rules in these circumstances must be determined by an
          analysis, in relation to each transaction of (i) the clients for whom they acted

          on a particular transaction; (ii) the nature of the legal work they were
          retained to do and did; and (iii) whether there were conflicting or diverging
          interests in relation to that legal work that posed a serious risk of adversely
          affecting the representation of their client or former client.46

Finally, although not specifically related to corruption and conflicts of interest, it is worth
noting that conflicts of interest can arise when a lawyer or their firm acts for a corporation
and the lawyer serves as a director of the corporation.47 Conflicts may occur in this situation
because the dual roles may (1) affect the lawyer's independent judgment and fiduciary
obligations (2) make it difficult to distinguish between legal and business advice (3) threaten
solicitor-client privilege, and (4) potentially disqualify the lawyer or law firm from acting
for the organization.48

                 US

The American Bar Association's Model Rules of Professional Conduct contain rules regarding
conflicts of interest. Rule 1.7 of the ABA's model rules states:

         (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b), a lawyer shall not represent a client if

                the representation involves a concurrent conflict of interest. A concurrent
                conflict of interest exists if:

                (1) The representation of one client will be directly adverse to
                     another client; or

                (2) There is a significant risk that the representation of one or
                     more clients will be materially limited by the lawyer's
                     responsibilities to another client, a former client or a third
                     person or by a personal interest of the lawyer.

         (b) Notwithstanding the existence of a concurrent conflict of interest under

                paragraph (a), a lawyer may represent a client if:

                (1) The lawyer reasonably believes that the lawyer will be able to
                     provide competent and diligent representation to each
                     affected client;

                (2) The representation is not prohibited by law;

                (3) The representation does not involve the assertion of a claim by
                     one client against another client represented by the lawyer in
                     the same litigation or other proceedings before a tribunal; and

                (4) Each affected client gives informed consent, confirmed in
                     writing.49

                 UK

The UK Solicitors Regulation Authority Code of Conduct (SRA Code) restricts lawyers from
acting when there is "a conflict, or a significant risk of conflict, between you and your
client."50 Further, "if there is a conflict, or significant risk of conflict, between two or more
current clients,"51 lawyers are restricted from acting for all of the clients, subject to a few
exceptions. The SRA Code applies the same rules to firms.52

Conflict of interest also arises in the SRA rules on confidentiality and disclosure. Under those
provisions, solicitors may not act for a client in a matter if that client has an interest adverse
to the interest of another current or former client, for whom the solicitor or the solicitor's
business or employer holds confidential information material to the matter, unless

     effective measures are taken or result in no real risk of disclosure or,
     the current or former client whose information the solicitor or business or

           employer holds has given informed consent, evidenced in writing, including
           consent to the measures taken.53

                 Canada

In Canada, the general rule on conflicts of interests is set out in the Federation of Law
Society's Model Code of Professional Conduct (FLSC Model Code), rule 3.4-1:

          A lawyer must not act or continue to act for a client where there is a conflict
          of interest, except as permitted under this Code.54

Rule 1.1-1 in the FLSC Model Code defines "conflict of interest" as:

          the existence of a substantial risk that a lawyer's loyalty to or representation
          of a client would be materially and adversely affected by the lawyer's own
          interest or the lawyer's duties to another client, a former client, or a third
          person.55

Paragraphs 1 and 2 of commentary to rule 3.4-1 provide guidance to this definition as
follows:

          [1] Lawyers have an ethical duty to avoid conflicts of interest. Some cases
          involving conflicts of interest will fall within the scope of the bright line rule

          as articulated by the Supreme Court of Canada. The bright line rule
          prohibits a lawyer or law firm from representing one client whose legal
          interests are directly adverse to the immediate legal interests of another
          client even if the matters are unrelated unless the clients consent. However,
          the bright line rule cannot be used to support tactical abuses and will not
          apply in the exceptional cases where it is unreasonable for the client to
          expect that the lawyer or law firm will not act against it in unrelated matters.
          See also rule 3.4-2 and commentary [6].

          [2] In cases where the bright line rule is inapplicable, the lawyer or law firm
          will still be prevented from acting if representation of the client would
          create a substantial risk that the lawyer's representation of the client would
          be materially and adversely affected by the lawyer's own interests or by the
          lawyer's duties to another current client, a former client, or a third person.
          The risk must be more than a mere possibility; there must be a genuine,
          serious risk to the duty of loyalty or to client representation arising from the
          retainer.56

The Model Code Rule 3.4-2 permits acting where a conflict of interest exists if the lawyer has
consent from all of their affected clients. Consent must be fully informed and voluntary after
the conflict or potential conflict has been disclosed. The rule provides that it can be inferred
when dealing with governments, publicly traded companies, or entities with in-house
counsel, provided the other conditions set out in the rule are met.57

3.2 Duty to Not Advise or Assist in a Violation of the Law

Lawyers have a duty to not advise or assist in the violation of the law. Professional
obligations generally require lawyers to resign as counsel if they are in a situation where,
after explaining to their client that the proposed course of conduct is illegal and that they
cannot participate in that conduct, the client continues to instruct them to engage in or
facilitate the illegal act.58 Most codes of conduct expressly forbid lawyers from implementing
corporate instructions that would involve the commission of a crime, a fraud, or a breach of
professional ethics.59

Lawyers who advise or assist in the violation of the criminal law are also subject to
prosecution under criminal law for conspiring, aiding, abetting, or counselling a breach of
the law.

Lawyers can advise clients on how to achieve a business objective in compliance with the
law. For example, a business development contract without certain limiting instructions
might lead to a high probability of bribes being paid by company agents; ignoring that risk
can constitute assisting in that bribery and therefore would be a violation of the lawyer's
legal and ethical duties. However, properly documenting the nature of the work to be

performed and the identity of those performing the work, along with prohibiting contact by
the agent with government officials without specific company approval, can mitigate the
potential misuse of the contract in an unlawful scenario.

Another factor that confuses the issue is the definition of "law." Advising on "hard law,"
like the Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act (CFPOA), Criminal Code, or Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act (FCPA), is often (though not always) relatively easy. What can be more difficult
is advising on the stance to be taken toward "soft law," such as unratified treaty obligations
or guidelines from multinational organizations like the United Nations. Strictly speaking,
the law means hard law; however, it is advisable to at least alert clients to potential soft law
concerns, as a client's level of adherence to these soft law obligations may affect public
perceptions and prosecutorial positions.

                 US

The American Bar Association model rules prohibit lawyers from counselling or assisting a
client to engage in conduct that the lawyer knows is criminal or fraudulent. The rules allow
the lawyer to discuss the legal consequences of proposed conduct and to "counsel or assist
a client to make a good faith effort to determine the validity, scope, meaning or application
of the law."60

                 UK

The SRA Code of Conduct provides that as a solicitor,

          You do not mislead or attempt to mislead your clients the court or others,
          either by your own acts or omissions or allowing or being complicit in the
          acts or omissions of others (including your client).61

The Solicitors Regulation Authority provides specific guidance on money laundering. The
introduction to its Solicitors Regulation Authority Topic Guide on Money Laundering sets out the
priority that it attaches to enforcement of its rules in the money laundering context. It
stipulates that:

          Money laundering is a priority risk for us. The credibility of law firms
          makes them an obvious target for criminals. The overwhelming majority of
          solicitors want to do the right thing. Yet that alone is not enough. Weak
          processes or undertrained staff can leave the door open for criminals.62

                or encourages any dishonesty, fraud, crime or illegal conduct by a
                client or others, or

                (c) instruct a client or others on how to violated the law and avoid
                punishment. 63

The commentary to the FLSC Model Code further elaborates on the lawyer's duty not to assist
in fraud or money laundering:

          A lawyer should be alert to and avoid unwittingly becoming involved with
          a client engaged in criminal activities such as mortgage fraud or money
          laundering. Vigilance is required because the means for these, and other
          criminal activities, may be transactions for which lawyers commonly
          provide services such as: establishing, purchasing or selling business
          entities; arranging financing for the purchase or sale or operation of
          business entities; arranging financing for the purchase or sale of business
          assets; and purchasing and selling real estate.

          Before accepting a retainer, or during a retainer, if a lawyer has suspicions
          or doubts about whether he or she might be assisting a client in dishonesty,
          fraud, crime or illegal conduct, the lawyer should make reasonable inquiries
          to obtain information about the client and about the subject matter and
          objectives of the retainer. These should include verifying who are the legal
          or beneficial owners of property and business entities, verifying who has
          the control of business entities, and clarifying the nature and purpose of a
          complex or unusual transaction where the purpose is not clear. The lawyer
          should make a record of the results of these inquiries.64

                 Duty to Report

In most jurisdictions, lawyers, even if not directly involved in wrongdoing, have a duty to
report it if they become aware of wrongdoing on the part of one of the corporations'
directors, officers, employees or agents. This reporting usually requires the lawyer to bring
the matter to a more senior individual in the corporation. This is discussed more fully in
Section 3.3.1.

                 Criminal Sanctions

In addition to the professional obligations listed above, a lawyer can be subject to criminal
penalties for assisting a client in wrongdoing. For example, in Canada the Criminal Code
provisions on conspiracy, aiding, abetting, and counselling criminalize the conduct of
anyone, including a lawyer, who knowingly assists their client in the commission of a crime.

3.3 Duty of Confidentiality and Lawyer/Client Privilege

Both the duty of confidentiality and lawyer/client privilege restrict lawyers from disclosing
information about their client without client permission. These concepts are important to a
corporate lawyer working on corruption and anti-corruption issues. For example, providing
assistance in developing, implementing, reviewing and assessing a client's anti-corruption
compliance programs may reveal corporate information that is "secret" or "private" or may
involve privileged advice about a company's past or future risk areas or wrongdoing. A
fundamental purpose of the duty of confidentiality and solicitor client privilege is to
encourage full disclosure from clients to their lawyer, so the lawyer can best represent their
client's interests. As the information disclosed may be harmful or embarrassing to the
client's interests, providing protection from disclosure ensures that clients feel safe in
making disclosures. A lawyer cannot assist in preventing or addressing corruption if the
client is afraid that if they divulge information, the lawyer will share this information with
others. The protection belongs to the client. The lawyer cannot unilaterally disclose
otherwise privileged or confidential information without the client's permission unless a
legally recognized exception, discussed below, applies.

                 Duty of Confidentiality

The duty of confidentiality requires lawyers to hold "in strict confidence" all information
concerning the affairs of their client acquired throughout the professional relationship. A
breach of this duty, if not otherwise authorized, is a breach of the lawyer's professional and
fiduciary obligations and may result in the lawyer being subject to fines, civil liability, or
disbarment.65 The rationale for the duty is described by Proulx and Layton as:

          [T]he client who is assured of complete secrecy is more likely to reveal to
          his or her counsel all information pertaining to the case. The lawyer who is
          in possession of all relevant information is better able to advise the client
          and hence provide competent service, furthering both the client's legal
          rights and the truth-finding function of the adversarial system. [footnotes
          omitted]66

The duty of confidentiality prevents both the use of confidential information as well as
disclosure of confidential information. This protects the client's confidential business
information and prevents a lawyer from using this information to their advantage or the
client's detriment. This may arise in the corruption context, for example, through disclosure

of due diligence procedures for preventing or finding violations of the company's policies,
which are considered confidential and proprietary information by the company. A lawyer
assisting or assessing a client's corruption compliance program may be restricted from using
any information learned through that process when later assisting a second client on a
similar project.

Duties of confidentiality originate in, and are defined by the ethical rules that apply to
lawyers in their jurisdictions of practice. Each jurisdiction has regulators who enforce these
duties.

          3.3.1.1 US

The duty of confidentiality is set out in the ABA's Model Rules of Professional Conduct at rule
1.6:

         (a) A lawyer shall not reveal information relating to the representation of a

                client unless the client gives informed consent, the disclosure is
                impliedly authorized in order to carry out the representation or the
                disclosure is permitted by paragraph (b).

         (b) A lawyer may reveal information relating to the representation of a

                client to the extent the lawyer reasonably believes necessary:

                (1) To prevent reasonably certain death or substantial bodily harm;

                (2) To prevent the client from committing a crime or fraud that is
                     reasonably certain to result in substantial injury to the financial
                     interests or property of another and in furtherance of which the
                     client has used or is using the lawyer's services;

                (3) To prevent, mitigate or rectify substantial injury to the financial
                     interests or property of another that is reasonably certain to result
                     or has resulted from the client's commission of a crime or fraud in
                     furtherance of which the client has used the lawyer's services;

                (4) To secure legal advice about the lawyer's compliance with these
                     Rules;

                (5) To establish a claim or defense on behalf of the lawyer in a
                     controversy between the lawyer and the client, to establish a
                     defense to a criminal charge or civil claim against the lawyer based
                     upon conduct in which the client was involved, or to respond to
                     allegations in any proceeding concerning the lawyer's
                     representation of the client;

                (6) To comply with other law or court order; [or]

                (7) To detect and resolve conflicts of interest arising from the lawyer's
                     change of employment or from changes in the composition or
                     ownership of a firm, but only if the revealed information would not
                     compromise the attorney-client privilege or otherwise prejudice the
                     client.

         (c) A lawyer shall make reasonable efforts to prevent the inadvertent or

                unauthorized disclosure of, or unauthorized access to, information
                relating to the representation of a client.67

Note that the Model Rules allow, but do not require, disclosure under any of the
circumstances in Rule 1.6(b).

          3.3.1.2 UK

The UK Solicitors Regulation Authority's Code of Conduct (SRA Code of Conduct) requires that
as a solicitor:

          You keep the affairs of current and former clients confidential unless
          disclosure is required or permitted by law or the client consents.68
          Where you are acting for a client on a matter, you make the client aware of
          all information material to the matter to which you have knowledge, except
          when:

                (a) the disclosure of the information is prohibited by legal
                     restrictions imposed in the interests of national security or the
                     prevention of crime;

                (b) your client gives informed consent, given or evidenced in
                     writing, to the information not being disclosed to them.

                (c) you have reason to believe that serious physical or mental
                     injury will be caused to your client or another if the information
                     is disclosed; or

                (d) the information is contained in a privileged document that you
                     have knowledge of only because it has been mistakenly
                     disclosed.69

The SRA Code of Conduct also prohibits a solicitor from acting for a client, if that client has
an interest adverse to the interest of another current or former client, for whom the solicitor
or the solicitor's business or employer holds confidential information material to the matter,
unless steps are taken to prevent disclosure of that information, and the other or former
client consents.70

          3.3.1.3 Canada

The duty of confidentiality is codified in the following rules set out in Rule 3.3 of the FLSC
Model Code:

          A lawyer at all times must hold in strict confidence all information
          concerning the business and affairs of a client acquired in the course of the
          professional relationship and must not divulge any such information
          unless:

                (a) expressly or impliedly authorized by the client;
                (b) required by law or a court to do so;
                (c) required to deliver the information to the Law Society; or
                (d) otherwise permitted by this rule.71

          A lawyer must not use or disclose a client's or former client's confidential
          information to the disadvantage of the client or former client, or for the
          benefit of the lawyer or a third person without the consent of the client or
          former client.72

          A lawyer may disclose confidential information, but must not disclose more
          information than is required, when the lawyer believes on reasonable
          grounds that there is an imminent risk of death or serious bodily harm, and
          disclosure is necessary to prevent the death or harm.73

          If it is alleged that a lawyer or the lawyer's associates or employees:

                (a) have committed a criminal offence involving a client's affairs;

                (b) are civilly liable with respect to a matter involving a client's affairs;

                (c) have committed acts of professional negligence; or

                (d) have engaged in acts of professional misconduct or conduct
                     unbecoming a lawyer,

          the lawyer may disclose confidential information in order to defend against
          the allegations, but must not disclose more information than is required.74

          A lawyer may disclose confidential information in order to establish or
          collect the lawyer's fees, but must not disclose more information than is
          required.75

          A lawyer may disclose confidential information to another lawyer to secure
          legal or ethical advice about the lawyer's proposed conduct.76

          A lawyer may disclose confidential information to the extent reasonably
          necessary to detect and resolve conflicts of interest arising from the lawyer's
          change of employment or from changes in the composition or ownership of
          a law firm, but only if the information disclosed does not compromise the
          solicitor-client privilege or otherwise prejudice the client.77

                 Lawyer/Client Privilege

Legal Professional Privilege; Solicitor/Client Privilege; Attorney/Client Privilege

Although often unfortunately conflated in discussion, the duties of confidentiality and the
law associated with the privilege that attaches to legal advice are distinct, and not identical.
They differ in scope, and origin.

(Though the properties of the privilege that attaches to legal advice are similar from
jurisdiction to jurisdiction in common law countries, the descriptor applied to it varies. In
Canada it is most often called "solicitor/client privilege"; in the US, it is "attorney/client
privilege," and in the UK the reference is most often "legal professional privilege." In this
chapter, we shall use the term lawyer/client privilege to describe the general privilege. When
referring to a text or court decision that uses one of the other terms, we will preserve the
reference to the term from the decision or text.)

The scope of the duty of confidentiality is much broader that the scope of lawyer/client
privilege. The duty of confidentiality encompasses all communications between the lawyer
and client, including the fact that the client has approached and hired the lawyer for
assistance with a legal issue. By contrast, lawyer/client privilege applies only to
communications for the purpose of obtaining or providing legal advice.

The duty of confidentiality is an ethical duty, whereas lawyer/client privilege is a substantive
common law rule of evidence and is in Canada "a principle of fundamental importance to
the administration of justice."78

As Proulx and Layton note:

          [C]rucial distinctions exist between a lawyer's ethical duty of confidentiality
          and solicitor-client privilege. First, the privilege encompasses only matters
          communicated in confidence by the client. The duty of confidentiality is
          broader, covering all information acquired by counsel whatever its source.
          Second, the privilege applies to the communication itself, does not bar the
          adduction of evidence pertaining to the facts communicated if gleaned from
          another source, and is often lost where other parties are present during the
          communication. In contrast, the ethical duty of confidentiality usually

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

          persists even where outside parties know the information in question or
          where the communication was made in the presence of others. Third, the
          application of an exception to solicitor-client privilege does not necessarily
          mean that information is exempt from the ethical duty of confidentiality. A
          comparable or some other exception to the ethical duty must apply before
          the lawyer can reveal the information.79

Lawyer client privilege arises:

          where legal advice of any kind is sought for a professional legal adviser, in
          his capacity as such, the communications relating to that purpose, made in
          confidence by the client, are at this instance permanently protected from
          disclosure by himself or by the legal adviser, except the privilege be
          waived.80

          3.3.2.1 Canada

Legislative bodies from time to time try to limit the scope of lawyer/client privilege and the
duty of confidentiality in cases where there appears to be a compelling public benefit in the
disclosure of otherwise confidential information. These attempts have generally occurred
where the lawyer holds information relevant to the question of whether or not the client has
committed an offence. However, the courts in Canada tend to guard fiercely the duty of
confidentiality and the protection of solicitor client privilege. In 2002, in Lavallée, Rackel and
Heintz v Canada,81 the Supreme Court of Canada struck down the Criminal Code provision (s.
488.1) that allowed police to obtain a warrant to search a lawyer's office and seize documents
that may be privileged. The Court held that solicitor/client privilege is a principle of
fundamental justice and must be held to be as close to absolute as possible to protect its
relevance. In this instance, particularly because solicitor/client privilege could be
compromised without the client's knowledge, it had not been protected, and thus subjected
lawyers and their clients to unreasonable search and seizure, contrary to section 8 of the
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.82

82 According to D Watt & M Fuerst in The 2021 Annotated Tremeear's Criminal Code (Toronto: Carswell,
2016) at 967-968:

     The principal constitutional flaws in the regime created by s. 488.1 have to do with the
     potential breach of the privilege without the client's knowledge, let alone consent, and the
     absence of judicial discretion in the determination of an asserted claim of privilege.
     Reasonableness requires that the courts retain a discretion to decide whether materials
     seized in a lawyer's office should remain inaccessible to the state as privileged if and
     when it is in the interests of justice to do so. No search warrant can be issued for
     documents known to be protected by solicitor-client privilege. All documents must be
     sealed before being examined or removed from a lawyer's office, except where the

                                                  CHAPTER 8 ETHICAL & PROFESSIONAL DUTIES

In 2015, the Supreme Court of Canada struck down parts of a legislative scheme of the
Government of Canada83 that was directed at detecting or preventing money laundering.
The legislation requires financial intermediaries, including lawyers, to collect, record, and
retain material, including information verifying the identity of those on whose behalf they
paid or received money. It permitted the federal compliance authority, the Financial
Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada, to conduct searches of lawyers' offices
without warrant, and to seize material. It imposed fines and penal consequences for non-
compliance.

The Federation of Law Societies of Canada challenged these provisions. The Court in Canada
v Federation of Law Societies of Canada84 held that these provisions, as they applied to lawyers,
are inconsistent with the Constitution of Canada. The majority, applying the Lavallée
decision above, reiterated that solicitor/client privilege must remain as absolute as possible,
and that a lawyer's duty of commitment to their client's cause, of which solicitor/client
privilege is an integral part, was a principle of fundamental justice with which the state
could not interfere without justification.

          3.3.2.2 Business Context

Although the duty of confidentiality extends to all communications between a lawyer and
their client, lawyer/client privilege only exists where the advice is "legal advice." As we have
noted, many corporate lawyers serve as officers or directors for a company and in that "dual
capacity," they may provide business advice alongside legal advice.85 Even if not a director
or officer, as a trusted advisor to businesses, a lawyer is often asked to advise on business
strategy and related issues. This raises issues that require assessment to determine whether
privilege exists; it is sometimes difficult for lawyers or courts to separate legal and business
advice. Each jurisdiction takes a slightly different view in interpreting the difference

            warrant specifically authorizes the immediate examination, copying and seizure of an
            identified document. Every effort must be made to contact the lawyer and the client at
            the time of execution of the warrant. If the lawyer or the client cannot be contacted, a
            representative of the Bar should be allowed to oversee the sealing and seizure of
            documents. All potential privilege holders should be contacted by the police and
            should have a reasonable opportunity to assert a claim of privilege and to have it
            judicially decided. If such notification is not possible, the lawyer who had possession of
            the documents, or another lawyer appointed by the Law Society or the court, should
            examine the documents to determine whether a claim of privilege should be asserted.
            The Attorney General may make submissions on the issue of privilege, but should not
            be permitted to inspect the documents unless it is determined by a judge that the
            documents are not privileged. Documents found to be privileged are to be returned
            immediately to the holder of the privilege, or to a person designated by the court.
            Documents found not to be privileged may be used in the investigation.

between legal and business advice and the application of, and exceptions to, legal advice
privilege.

American courts take two differing approaches to determining whether advice is business
or legal. The first approach is to determine whether the person is acting as a lawyer or a
businessperson and treat all advice provided by that person accordingly.86 A businessperson
will be found to only give business advice and a lawyer will be found to only give legal
advice. Under the second method, the court will determine whether the advice is business
or legal on an ad hoc basis and provide privilege only for legal advice.87 This involves
looking at individual communications to determine the purpose and nature of the
communication.

UK legal advice privilege requires that the advice given is legal in nature, in the sense that
there is a relevant legal context. As Lord Denning stated:

          It does sometimes happen that such a legal adviser does work for his
          employer in another capacity, perhaps an executive capacity. Their
          communications in that capacity would not be the subject of legal
          professional privilege. So the legal adviser must be scrupulous to make the
          distinction.88

As such, the court must make the determination of whether the advice was business or legal.

In Canada, the Supreme Court stated:

          Owing to the nature of the work of in-house counsel, often having both legal
          and non-legal responsibilities, each situation must be assessed on a case-by-
          case basis to determine if the circumstances were such that the privilege
          arose. Whether or not the privilege will attach depends on the nature of the
          relationship, the subject matter of the advice, and the circumstances in
          which it is sought and rendered.89

However, the courts have generally interpreted "legal advice" broadly. The following
excerpts show that the line between business and legal advice is fuzzy:

          [Legal advice privilege] is not confined to telling the client the law and it
          includes advice as to what should be done in the relevant legal context.

          Whether communications are made to the lawyer himself or employees,
          and whether they deal with matters of an administrative nature such as

          financial means or with the actual nature of the legal problem, all
          information which a person must provide in order to obtain legal advice
          and which is given in confidence for that purpose enjoys the privileges
          attached to confidentiality.

          I am satisfied that a communication which does not make specific reference
          to legal advice is nevertheless privileged if it falls within the continuum of
          communication within which the legal advice is sought or offered: see
          Manes and Silver, supra, p. 26. If the rule were otherwise, a disclosure of such
          documents would tend in many cases to permit the opposing side to infer
          the nature and extent of the legal advice from the tenor of the documents
          falling within this continuum. Thus, the intent of the rule would be
          frustrated.90

Although specifically referencing in-house counsel, this would apply to all lawyers who
provide business advice in addition to legal advice.

Despite the willingness of Courts to construe "legal advice" broadly, the prudent lawyer
will want to avoid as much as possible any potential ambiguity on the nature of the advice
or the lawyer's role in providing it. When providing legal as opposed to business advice to
a client, a lawyer should strive to be clear about their role in advising, and as much as
possible indicate explicitly when they are providing legal advice.

The American Bar Association Business Law section provides the following guidance:

          These principles highlight the need for the attorney to be aware of the role
          he or she is playing - the privilege may exist as to one conversation when
          donning the hat of legal advisor and disappear in the next, where business
          advice is sought. To ensure privilege is maintained, the attorney should try
          to keep the roles from overlapping by offering legal advice and business
          advice separately when possible, be clear when legal advice is being
          rendered, and make sure the client understands that simply forwarding
          confidential information to the attorney does not make it privileged. If the
          client needs a contract to be reviewed for business concerns (e.g., financial
          analysis) as well as legal implications, advise the client to send separate e-
          mails to the finance team and the legal team rather than sending a general
          request for review to everyone in a single e-mail. The more explicit the
          request and rendering of legal advice, the easier it will be to assert the
          privilege.91

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

                 Confidentiality, Lawyer Client Privilege, and Reporting Wrongdoing

Lawyers are under a duty to protect the interests of their client. In business contexts, the
client is often a corporate entity. As the following discussion indicates, a lawyer that notices
wrongdoing on the part of one of the corporations' directors, officers, employees or agents
has an obligation to report that wrongdoing within the corporation. This reporting usually
requires the lawyer to bring the matter to a more senior individual in the corporation,
particularly if an individual to whom the lawyer normally reports commits the wrongdoing.
This is often referred to as an "up the ladder" reporting obligation. As lawyers have a duty
of confidentiality, reporting of wrongdoing must be internal, except in rare circumstances.
It is not a violation of solicitor-client privilege because the communication is still with the
client.

Some jurisdictions allow for external reporting when a lawyer believes that a serious crime
is about to be committed.92 Where the client has not waived privilege, this is a violation of
solicitor/client privilege, and as such, any confidential information that is reported should
be the minimum necessary to prevent the crime.

          3.3.3.1 US

Following the Enron scandal, the US implemented the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX). A
primary objective of SOX was to address major corporate and accounting scandals and
promote lagging investor confidence in the stock market. Section 307 of the SOX requires
lawyers to internally report up the ladder (to the CEO or even the board of directors or audit
committee) evidence of material violations of federal and state securities laws and other
fraudulent acts.93

The ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct state that lawyers have a duty to protect the
corporation's interests:

          (a) A lawyer employed or retained by an organization represents the
                organization acting through its duly authorized constituents.

          (b) If a lawyer for an organization knows that an officer, employee or other
                person associated with the organization is engaged in action, intends to
                act or refuses to act in a matter related to the representation that is a
                violation of a legal obligation to the organization, or a violation of law
                that reasonably might be imputed to the organization, and that is likely
                to result in substantial injury to the organization, then the lawyer shall
                proceed as is reasonably necessary in the best interest of the
                organization. Unless the lawyer reasonably believes that it is not
                necessary in the best interest of the organization to do so, the lawyer
                shall refer the matter to higher authority in the organization, including,

92 Both the US and Canada allow lawyers to divulge otherwise privileged information in order to
prevent a serious crime. The UK does not have a similar exception to allow for a breach of solicitor-
client privilege. The US and Canadian rules permitting this are set out and discussed specifically in
Section 3.3.1.

                if warranted by the circumstances to the highest authority that can act
                on behalf of the organization as determined by applicable law.

          (c) Except as provided in paragraph (d), if

                (1) despite the lawyer's efforts in accordance with paragraph (b)
                     the highest authority that can act on behalf of the organization
                     insists upon or fails to address in a timely and appropriate
                     manner an action, or a refusal to act, that is clearly a violation
                     of law, and

                (2) the lawyer reasonably believes that the violation is reasonably
                     certain to result in substantial injury to the organization,

                then the lawyer may reveal information relating to the representation
                whether or not Rule 1.6 permits such disclosure, but only if and to the
                extent the lawyer reasonably believes necessary to prevent substantial
                injury to the organization.

          (d) Paragraph (c) shall not apply with respect to information relating to a
                lawyer's representation of an organization to investigate an alleged
                violation of law, or to defend the organization or an officer, employee
                or other constituent associated with the organization against a claim
                arising out of an alleged violation of law.

          (e) A lawyer who reasonably believes that he or she has been discharged
                because of the lawyer's actions taken pursuant to paragraphs (b) or (c),
                or who withdraws under circumstances that require or permit the
                lawyer to take action under either of those paragraphs, shall proceed as
                the lawyer reasonably believes necessary to assure that the
                organization's highest authority is informed of the lawyer's discharge
                or withdrawal.94

There is no professional duty to report wrongdoing outside of the corporation; rather, a lawyer
may report wrongdoing externally:

          [T]o prevent the client from committing a crime or fraud that is reasonably
          certain to result in substantial injury to the financial interests or property of
          another and in furtherance of which the client has used or is using the
          lawyer's services.95

In the wake of the Enron scandal, the SEC attempted to require lawyers who practice before
it to report knowledge of their client's wrongdoing. The American Bar Association and many
others vehemently opposed this stance, claiming solicitor/client privilege must prevail.96 As
a result, of the resounding opposition to the SEC's proposed requirements for external

reporting, the SEC implemented provisions that allow, but do not require, lawyers to report
material violations of the SEC rules to them.97 The SEC also included a provision that
requires subordinate lawyers to report evidence of a material violation of the SEC rules to
their supervising attorney.98

It is important to note that the SEC Rules apply only to practice before the Securities and
Exchange Commission. The rules are not the same as the American Bar Association Rules,
for example, the SEC's "up the ladder" rule is more stringent than the American Bar
Association's. Under the ABA rule, attorneys have an "out" if they conclude that a referral
would not be in the best interests of the organization. This is not provided for in the SEC
Rules. The ABA rule, moreover, applies only when an attorney "knows" of an actual or
intended violation. The SEC rule does not require knowledge of facts or conclusions of law,
but only "evidence of a material violation."99

          3.3.3.2 UK

While there are no explicit rules that permit or require lawyers to report wrongdoing in the
corporate context, lawyers in the UK may have a common law duty to their client to report
wrongdoing "up the ladder" to a higher ranking official or to the board of directors.100 If the
board of directors are the wrongdoers, the lawyer may be obligated to report to the general
meeting of the shareholders.101 However, although there have been cases about how
directors are liable for failing to prevent co-directors from breach of fiduciary duty or other
wrongdoing, the courts have not specifically addressed the lawyer's obligation to disclose
wrongdoing of executives and directors.102

The UK House of Lords, in Three Rivers Council and others v Governor and Company of the Bank
of England (Three Rivers), explains that if legal professional privilege exists, it is absolute and
cannot be overridden for public policy concerns; the only way around it is if the client (or
individual entitled to it) waives the privilege or it is overridden by statute.103 The court has
found that a balancing act between legal professional privilege and the public interest is not
required because legal professional privilege is the "dominant public interest" and "the

of directors is unable or incapable of acting. In Foster v Foster, the board of directors was unable to act
due to conflict of interest.

European Court of Justice decision in Akzo Nobel Chemicals Limited & anor v European
Commission (Case C-550/07 P), solicitor-client privilege does not extend to in-house counsel and their
client.

balance must always come down in favour of upholding the privilege."104 The court's strict
interpretation of the scope of legal professional privilege does not allow for the disclosure
of otherwise privileged communications in order to prevent a crime from being committed.
Under the rule in Bullivant v Att-Gen of Victoria, legal professional privilege extends to
information given to a client on how to avoid committing a crime.105 Legal professional
privilege also extends to communications informing a client that their actions may result in
prosecution, as per Butler v Board of Trade.106 However, legal professional privilege may not
extend to documents, which form part of the crime itself or to communication that occurs in
order to obtain advice with the intent of committing an offence.107 In order to disclose
otherwise privileged communications, lawyers must show they have prima facie evidence
their client is involving them in a fraud without their consent.108

In 2002, the UK passed the Proceeds of Crime Act (POCA).109 POCA created criminal penalties
for certain regulated sectors, including lawyers, who do not act on their knowledge or
suspicion that their client is engaged in money laundering. It requires lawyers to disclose
their suspicion to the National Crime Agency without indicating to their client that the
disclosure has been made.110 There are similar reporting provisions in the United Kingdom
Terrorism Act.111

The required disclosure under POCA likely prevails over any broad duty of confidentiality
that a lawyer may have. However, they do not prevail over legal professional privilege.
Lawyers are not required to disclose information that would be privileged under legal
professional (legal advice or litigation) privilege, or information acquired in "privileged
circumstances" as defined in the legislation. While the definition of "privileged
circumstances" overlaps considerably with legal professional privilege, they are not
identical, and care should be taken to consider both.

          3.3.3.3 Canada

The Canadian rules vary slightly from province to province. However, the Federation of
Law Societies Model Code contains a version of an "up the ladder rule" in Rule 3.2-8. This
applies to lawyers in jurisdictions that have adopted it in their codes of conduct:

          3.2-8 A lawyer who is employed or retained by an organization to act in a
          matter in which the lawyer knows that the organization has acted, is acting
          or intends to act dishonestly, fraudulently, criminally, or illegally, must do
          the following, in addition to his or her obligations under rule 3.2-7:

                (a) advise the person from whom the lawyer takes instructions and the
                     chief legal officer, or both the chief legal officer and the chief
                     executive officer, that the proposed conduct is, was or would be
                     dishonest, fraudulent, criminal, or illegal and should be stopped;

                (b) if necessary because the person from whom the lawyer takes
                     instructions, the chief legal officer or the chief executive officer
                     refuses to cause the proposed conduct to be stopped, advise
                     progressively the next highest persons or groups, including
                     ultimately, the board of directors, the board of trustees, or the
                     appropriate committee of the board, that the proposed conduct
                     was, is or would be dishonest, fraudulent, criminal, or illegal and
                     should be stopped; and

                (c) if the organization, despite the lawyer's advice, continues with or
                     intends to pursue the proposed wrongful conduct, withdraw from
                     acting in the matter in accordance with the rules in section 3.7.112

The Supreme Court of Canada differs from the UK's traditional and more absolute judicial
approach to applying legal professional privilege. The SCC has allowed for limited
exceptions to its application. Where an exception exists, the scope of the privileged
communication to be disclosed is to be interpreted as narrowly as reasonably possible.
Where a former client alleges misconduct by their former lawyer, the privilege may be set
aside to protect the lawyer's self-interest.113 If a client seeks legal advice for an unlawful
purpose, privilege will not exist.114 Where privilege may be set aside, no requirement has
been placed on the lawyer to disclose the confidential information. Rather, a permissive
"may disclose" allows the lawyer to exercise his or her discretion in the matter.

In Smith v Jones, the Supreme Court of Canada provided guidance on where solicitor/client
privilege may be overridden for public policy concerns.115 The Court advised that an
exception to the privilege be allowed where "public safety is involved and death or serious
bodily harm is imminent."116 The test from Smith v Jones was that (1) the harm had to be
targeted at an identifiable group, (2) the risk was of serious bodily harm or death, and (3)
the harm was imminent.117 In Smith v Jones, solicitor/client privilege was claimed for a

117 Although serious economic harm is not included in this test, law societies will allow lawyers to
disclose aspects of otherwise confidential or privileged information if the lawyer is at risk (i.e., when
the lawyer faces allegations of misconduct or is not getting paid, etc.).

doctor's report that was completed for the purpose of assisting in the preparation of the
defence or with sentencing submissions. The psychiatrist felt that the accused was likely to
commit further crimes based on the assessment, and sought to have the report considered
by the Court in sentencing. As the report was cloaked by solicitor/client privilege, the Court
set out a test for where solicitor/client privilege may be overridden for public policy
concerns.

The Supreme Court of Canada has also allowed solicitor/client privilege to be set aside
where an accused's innocence is at stake.118 Additionally, there are limited exceptions to
solicitor/client privilege where the interests of the lawyer are at stake; this may occur where
the lawyer is collecting fees or is defending against a client's claim of professional
misconduct,119 for example, in the anti-corruption context.120

                 Litigation Privilege

Litigation privilege as it is called in Canada and the United Kingdom has evolved from
lawyer/client privilege. In the United States, a similar evolution occurred in what the US
Supreme Court recognized as the "work product doctrine."121 This privilege or doctrine
protects all records created for the purpose of litigation that is pending or reasonably
anticipated. While the focus of lawyer/client privilege is to protect communications for the
purpose of obtaining or providing legal advice, litigation privilege extends to protect
documents or records, defined broadly. There need be no communication between lawyer
and client. The classic example, a lawyer's litigation brief may never have been seen by the
lawyer's client, or anyone but the lawyer.

Litigation privilege, applies to communications or documents created primarily for the
purpose of current or anticipated litigation. It extends to communications beyond just the
lawyer and client, and encompasses any experts the lawyer may retain to learn about the
issues as well as other third parties who may assist in preparing for litigation. It may arise
for a corporate lawyer where the company has been charged or where litigation is pending
in regards to their own alleged corrupt acts or the corruption of another company (for
example, a civil suit for loss of a contract). A corporate lawyer may have to assist the
litigation team by sending documents or informing them of the company's anti-corruption
compliance program. Although the corporate lawyer would not be the litigator in charge of
the litigation, their communications to the litigation team would be protected under the

litigation privilege. Equally important, the litigation team may need various expert reports.
Those reports will also be protected by the litigation privilege.

The litigation privilege also extends to documents prepared or communicated between the
client and third parties. This sets it apart from the duty of confidentiality, and lawyer/client
privilege, as both of these require a lawyer/client relationship.

In Canada, as the discussion in Section 3.3.2 indicates, lawyer/client privilege has evolved
from a rule of evidence to a substantive rule of law protected in the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms. However, litigation privilege remains a rule of evidence. Thus, while
lawyer/client privilege can only be breached in circumstances that pass Charter scrutiny,
litigation privilege can be subject to change and limitation by rules of discovery in a
particular jurisdiction.122

1. INTRODUCTION

Lawyers play an essential role in facilitating both national and international business
transactions. As noted in Chapter 8, in doing so lawyers must comply with a number of
legal, professional, and ethical responsibilities. This includes ensuring that their business
clients are advised as to how to comply with the laws and regulations to avoid corruption
in their business transactions. A lawyer has a duty to undertake risk assessments to
determine the potential for corrupt behaviours, although it does not always need to be a full
systemic risk assessment, as outlined in Section 4.

Corruption, or a real risk of corruption, may arise in a multitude of circumstances. Lawyers
must be aware of those circumstances and be careful not to assist their client, wittingly or
unwittingly, in the violation of these anti-corruption laws. Although corruption may arise
in virtually any situation or transaction, there are a number of specific areas where the risk
of corruption is greater. Some of these areas are addressed in separate chapters of this book.
For example,

     Public procurement and public-private partnerships (P3s): Chapter 12
     Clients' lobbying of public officials: Chapter 11
     Political and campaign contributions: Chapter 14
     Conflicts of interest: Chapter 10
     Facilitation payments: Chapter 2
     Money laundering in business transactions1 including real estate2 and luxury

           items: Chapter 4.

Other special risk areas for corruption include:

     Transactions in extractive industries, aeronautics and defence industry, public

          infrastructure (e.g., roads, bridges, etc.), pharmaceuticals, foreign aid and
          development assistance, art markets, sports governing bodies, etc.

      In acquisitions and mergers, it is critical to determine whether the target of an
          acquisition has engaged in corrupt practices in the past, as the acquiring
          corporation may be liable for past acts of corruption after a merger.

to launder money, particularly in hot housing markets. Solicitors in particular can play a large role in
interrupting the cycle, through acting as gatekeepers and verifying the identity of the client: "Three

      Transactions that involve gifts, entertainment, travel expenses, vague
          consulting agreements, foreign subsidiaries and joint ventures.

With so many risks of corruption arising in business transactions, it is not surprising that
corporations and other commercial organizations develop: (1) anti-corruption compliance
programs, which are dependent in part on (2) corruption risk assessments, and (3) require
due diligence standards and practices to avoid the risks of corruption. The next three
sections of this chapter will focus on these three essential anti-corruption tools.

2. RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DUE DILIGENCE, COMPLIANCE
      PROGRAMS, AND RISK ASSESSMENTS

Due diligence, anti-corruption compliance programs, and risk assessments are distinct but
interrelated concepts. "Due diligence" can be viewed as a generic legal concept. It means
using reasonable care and taking into account all the surrounding circumstances to avoid
breaking the law or causing harm to others in carrying out one's business. It is relevant in
criminal law, regulatory law, and civil liability. Due diligence by an accused is not a
substantive defence to the commission of a subjective mens rea offence such as bribery, but
it is a relevant mitigating factor that can affect the nature of the charge and the sentence or
sanction.3 For strict liability regulatory offences in Canada4 and the UK5 (including section
7 of the UK Bribery Act, 2010), due diligence provides a defence. However, due diligence is
not a defence to regulatory offences in the US and liability can be found even where
companies have implemented compliance programs to prevent regulatory offences from
occurring.6 Due diligence is also a defence to civil actions based on negligence or
malpractice.

In the context of assisting a client to avoid the commission of corruption offences, careful
creation and implementation of an anti-corruption compliance program that is geared to the
size and nature of the business has quickly become the expected norm of due diligence. Due
diligence or reasonable care must be used in designing an anti-corruption program, and due
diligence must be used in ensuring that the program is implemented, monitored and
evaluated from time to time. In this context, due diligence requires compliance with a
number of steps and safeguards specific to the particular business activity in question.

3 Due diligence acts as a substantive defence in the UK under section 7 of the Bribery Act. In Canada
and the US, due diligence is not a substantive defence to charges of bribery or corruption.

5 Tesco Supermarkets Ltd v Nattrass [1972] AC 153, [1971] 2 All ER 127. Note that in the UK the defence
of due diligence must be included in the statutory scheme to be available to the defendant charged
with a regulatory offence.

           CHAPTER 9 COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS, RISK ASSESSMENTS, & DUE DILIGENCE

An anti-corruption compliance program will set out the steps that are reasonably required
to avoid corruption in the course of one's business. Those reasonable steps will be based on
the actual risk of corruption arising in the client's business transactions. Thus, the first step
in developing an effective anti-corruption compliance program is to conduct a thorough risk
assessment. To achieve the standard of due diligence, the risk assessment must be designed
and carried out with reasonable care based on all the circumstances including the risk of
corruption occurring, the nature and extent of harm if it does occur, and the cost and
effectiveness of procedures to minimize or eliminate that risk.

As enforcement against corrupt conduct becomes more frequent and the penalties sought
increase in amount, the cost of any corrupt act has greatly increased. As such, companies
seek guidance on complying with the law in order to avoid prosecution and fines. Two
differing approaches on the type of guidance or regulations governments exist: rules-based
theory and principles-based theory.7 The rules-based theory suggests that governments and
enforcement agencies should set out the rules that companies need to play by.8 This would
effectively set a minimum standard for organizations to comply with and would provide
certainty for companies. A significant issue with this approach is that such rules tend to be
inflexible and unable to address changing situations as they arise. In addition, this approach
can result in creative interpretations of the rules that ignore the spirit of the rules and allow
individuals to bend them in their favour. The principles-based theory focuses on principles
that governments would like to see corporations uphold.9 This provides more flexibility in
a court's interpretation of whether or not the company was in compliance, but provides less
certainty to the corporation as to whether their compliance program is adequate to avoid
criminal or regulatory liability.10

3. COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS

An increasing global expectation exists for companies to create and enforce an anti-
corruption compliance program within their company. Although such programs are often
not a legislative requirement, they are becoming a standard factor that enforcement bodies
and courts consider when deciding whether to charge a company, or if charges are laid, in
setting the penalty for a convicted organization. Under section 7(2) of the UK Bribery Act
2010, the implementation of "adequate procedures" provides a substantive defence for the
corporation to a charge under section 7(1) (see Chapter 2, Section 2.4.3(i)). The courts and
enforcement agencies consider whether there is a program in place and evaluate its
effectiveness in preventing corrupt acts. These programs are seen as critical to ensuring that

Regulation" (2008) 45 Am Bus LJ 1. These papers do not address corruption directly, but some of the
points addressed provide insight into the debate between rules-based and principles-based
regulation.

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

corporations are complying with anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws. The primary
purpose of these programs is to reduce the risk of corrupt acts taking place in an
organization.

Developing internal controls to address the risk of corruption within a corporation is key.
These controls must involve the board of directors, they must contribute to the development
of a company-wide culture of compliance, and they must include internal policies and
enforcement mechanisms.11 Diversity of membership on the board is also vital, as it can
better respond to the diverse cultural, social, and regulatory factors that operate within
corrupt transactions.12

In light of the legal ramifications of creating and enforcing a sound anti-corruption program,
lawyers advising business clients have an important role to play in informing clients of the
practical utility of having such programs and ensuring that the client's program is up to date
and meets minimum international standards. Enforcement agencies and courts have
repeatedly advised that anti-corruption efforts should be custom-designed for the
organization and should consider the particular risks to that organization. The United
Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) has produced a guide on compliance
programs that states "an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, and for business
organizations, this is achieved through an effective internal programme for preventing and
detecting violations."13 A strong, effective program protects the company and the
shareholders from directors, managers, or employees who are in a position to put the
organization at risk. Although an effective compliance program cannot protect against all
corrupt acts, largely due to respondeat superior (the vicarious liability of companies for the
acts of their employees in the course of business) and the risk of hiring rogue employees, it
can help to effectively manage and minimize risk.14 For more information on the relevance
of compliance programs in sentencing, refer to Chapter 7, Sections 4 to 6.

There are two approaches to corporate responsibility for self-regulation under anti-
corruption law. The first is for the state to place a legal requirement on organizations to
develop a compliance program and then enforce any breaches. An alternative is for the state
to publicize best practices with notice to organizations that they may have to justify any
departures from those practices.15 The US, UK, and Canada have yet to specifically make the
absence of a compliance program a crime or regulatory offence; however, compliance
programs are effectively necessary due to the enforcement of anti-corruption legislation, the

substantive defence of adequate due diligence.

3.1 International Frameworks

      3.1.1 UNCAC

As previously noted, the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC) came
into force on December 14, 2005, and is the broadest and most widely agreed to anti-
corruption measure.16 As of February 6, 2020, UNCAC has been ratified by 187 member
states.17 UNCAC does not specifically require its ratifying parties to provide guidelines on
anti-corruption compliance programs. Instead, Article 12 states that "each party shall take
measures ... to prevent corruption involving the private sector" and lists possible measures,
including:

          Promoting the development of standards and procedures designed to
          safeguard the integrity of relevant private entities, including codes of
          conduct for the correct, honourable and proper performance of the activities
          of business and all relevant professions and the prevention of conflicts of
          interest, and for the promotion of the use of good commercial practices
          among businesses and in the contractual relations of businesses with the
          State. 18

While not specifically requiring State Parties to provide guidance to businesses on what
constitutes an effective anti-corruption compliance program, it does encourage parties to
promote the use of good commercial practices. UNODC published a Resource Guide on State
Measures for Strengthening Corporate Integrity (Integrity Guide), which indicates that
governments should consider providing guidance to the private sector on legal compliance
responsibilities.19 It suggests that the core elements of an effective anti-corruption
compliance program include: executive leadership, anti-corruption policies and procedures,
training and education, advice and reporting channels, effective responses to problems, a
risk-based approach, and continuous improvement via periodic testing and review.20

UNODC has also published a guidance document for parties to utilize in filling out their
self-assessment checklists for the implementation of Chapters II (preventative measures)
and V (asset recovery). The document encourages countries to report on whether they are in

compliance, what anti-corruption measures they have undertaken, what measures have
been effective, how they have been implemented, and much more.21

      3.1.2 OECD Convention

The OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International
Business Transactions (OECD Convention), which came into force on February 15, 1999, has
been ratified by 35 OECD countries and 8 non-member countries (Argentina, Brazil,
Bulgaria, Colombia, Costa Rica, Lithuania, Russia, and South Africa).22 It does not place any
requirements on State Parties to provide guidance on key aspects of effective compliance
programs for the private sector. Furthermore, it does not require states to implement laws
that require organizations to implement effective compliance programs. However, in 2009,
the OECD Recommendations for Further Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials
(OECD Recommendations) were adopted by all 41 states that had ratified the OECD
Convention. Recommendation III requests that its members encourage companies to
develop and implement adequate internal controls and compliance programs, and provides
companies with Good Practice Guidance on Internal Controls, Ethics, and Compliance.23

      3.1.3 Key Elements of Compliance Guidelines

The international community has created various tools to guide companies in the prevention
of corruption within their organizations. These tools recognize the complexity of identifying
and combatting corruption and address the need for a multi-faceted approach with the
involvement of the entire organization. To aid companies in their anti-corruption policies,
the following organizations have published guidelines to assist companies in the
implementation of effective compliance programs:24

lawyers, the Association of Corporate Counsel (ACC) has prepared a How-To Manual on
Creating and Maintaining an Anti-corruption Compliance Program.34

Organizations in the public, private, and voluntary sectors may obtain independent
certification of compliance of their ABMS with the ISO 37001 standard and require their
major contractors, suppliers and consultants to provide evidence of compliance.35 In relation
to the organization's activities, this standard addresses:

           bribery in the public, private and not-for-profit sectors;
           bribery by the organization;
           bribery by the organization's personnel acting on the organization's

                behalf or for its benefit;
           bribery by the organization's business associates acting on the

                organization's behalf or for its benefit;
           bribery of the organization;
           bribery of the organization's personnel in relation to the organization's

                activities;
           bribery of the organization's business associates in relation to the

                organization's activities;
           direct and indirect bribery (for instance, a bribe offered or accepted

                through or by a third party).36

To help prevent, detect and deal with bribery, ISO 37001 requires the organization to:

          1. Implement the anti-bribery policy and supporting anti-bribery
                procedures (ABMS);

          2. Ensure that the organization's top management has overall
                responsibility for the implementation and effectiveness of the anti-

4. Appoint a person(s) with responsibility for overseeing anti-bribery
     compliance by the organization (compliance function);

5. Ensure that controls are in place over the making of decisions in
     relation to more than low bribery risk transactions. The decision
     process and the level of authority of the decision-maker(s) must be
     appropriate to the level of bribery risk and be free of actual or
     potential conflicts of interest;

6. Ensure that resources (personnel, equipment and financial) are made
     available as necessary for the effective implementation of the ABMS;

7. Implement appropriate vetting and controls over the organization's
     personnel designed to ensure that they are competent, and will
     comply with the anti-bribery policy and ABMS, and can be disciplined
     if they do not comply;

8. Provide appropriate anti-bribery training and/or guidance to
     personnel on the anti-bribery policy and ABMS;

9. Produce and retain appropriate documentation in relation to the
     design and implementation of the anti-bribery policy and ABMS;

10. Undertake periodic bribery risk assessments and appropriate due
     diligence on transactions and business associates;

11. Implement appropriate financial controls to reduce bribery risk (e.g.
     two signatures on payments, restricting use of cash, etc.);

12. Implement appropriate procurement, commercial and other non-
     financial controls to reduce bribery risk (e.g. separation of functions,
     two signatures on work approvals, etc.);

13. Ensure that all other organizations over which it has control
     implement anti-bribery measures which are reasonable and
     proportionate to the nature and extent of bribery risks which the
     controlled organization faces;

14. Require, where it is practicable to do so, and would help mitigate the
     bribery risk, any business associate which poses more than a low
     bribery risk to the organization to implement anti-bribery controls
     which manage the relevant bribery risk;

15. Ensure, where practicable, that appropriate anti-bribery commitments
     are obtained from business associates which pose more than a low
     bribery risk to the organization;

16. Implement controls over gifts, hospitality, donations and similar
     benefits to prevent them from being used for bribery purposes;

17. Ensure that the organization does not participate in, or withdraws
     from, any transaction where it cannot appropriately manage the
     bribery risk;

          18. Implement reporting (whistle-blowing) procedures which encourage
                and enable persons to report suspected bribery, or any violation of or
                weakness in the ABMS, to the compliance function or to appropriate
                personnel;

          19. Implement procedures to investigate and deal appropriately with any
                suspected or actual bribery or violation of the ABMS;

          20. Monitor, measure and evaluate the effectiveness of the ABMS
                procedures;

          21. Undertake internal audits at planned intervals which assess whether
                the ABMS conforms to the requirements of ISO 37001 and is being
                effectively implemented;

          22. Undertake periodic reviews of the effectiveness of the ABMS by the
                compliance function and top management;

          23. Rectify any identified problem with the ABMS, and improve the
                ABMS as necessary.37

In general, the keys to success promoted by various anti-corruption compliance guidelines
tend to fall within the following six categories: (1) clear policy from the top (2)
communication and training (3) developing and implementing an anti-corruption program
(4) incentivizing and promoting compliance (5) detecting and reporting violations, and (6)
continual testing and improvement.38 We will briefly comment on each of these categories.

(1) Clear policy from the top

An effective compliance program requires commitment from the top level of the
organization. A strong program may be prone to failure if senior management is not
committed to its implementation. Senior management establish the culture of ethics for the
organization, and without a zero tolerance policy on corruption, it is unlikely that the
program will be effective in combatting corrupt transactions. The policy should be clear and
spoken from one voice, so there is no confusion about the company's expectations and
definition of corruption. Senior management's support and commitment to the program
should be an "ongoing demonstration of the company's norms and values."39 They must
make it clear that the company's zeal for more business and profit does not mean getting
more business by the use of bribery.

37 Global Infrastructure Anti-Corruption Centre, supra note 35.
38 TI Canada suggests that a corporate anti-corruption compliance program may be developed and
implemented in the following six steps: (1) commit to the anti-corruption program from the top (2)
assess the current status and risk environment (3) plan the anti-corruption program (4) act on the
plan (5) monitor controls and progress, and (6) report internally and externally on the program. See
Transparency International Canada, supra note 27, at 5-6.

corruption, see David Hess & Cristie Ford, "Corporate Corruption and Reform Undertakings: A

           CHAPTER 9 COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS, RISK ASSESSMENTS, & DUE DILIGENCE

Commitment from the "top" includes adequate funding and staffing. Adequate resources
not only ensure that the compliance program has teeth, but that management's supportive
words about the compliance program are backed by meaningful action.40 While the
sufficiency of resources will depend on the size, structure, and risk profile of the particular
company, a large organization is generally expected to devote more resources to their
compliance program than smaller ones.41 In assessing adequacy, human resources, financial
resources, and access resources should be considered.42

(2) Communication and training

Communication and training are among the most important and most visible aspects of
compliance. Without proper communication and training, an organization's compliance is
likely only a "paper program."43 Companies are required to communicate and train their
employees on their compliance programs and on anti-corruption laws.

Training must be appropriately tailored to the particular compliance risks a company faces
and easily accessible in order to be effective. Different business units and different employee
circumstances may require different training. Companies should tailor training to the
position of the employee: different aspects of corruption law will apply to employees in
accounting versus employees in sales, which means different controls to prevent and report
corruption will be required for each group.44 Training should also consider the level of the
employee, as higher-level managers, who often set the tone for the office or department, may
require more extensive training and knowledge of anti-corruption initiatives than lower
level employees.

Training should account for linguistic and other barriers, including with respect to access to
technology.45 For example, communication and training must be in the local language of the
employee in order to be effective. Orthofix International was targeted by the DOJ for failing
to adequately communicate compliance programs with its employees. In its enforcement
action against the company, the DOJ stated "Orthofix International, ... failed to engage in
any serious form of corruption-related diligence before it purchased [the subsidiary].
Although Orthofix International promulgated its own anti-corruption policy, that policy

was neither translated into Spanish nor implemented at [the subsidiary]."46 The extent of
live training (as compared to passive training through e-learning or online delivery systems)
may be used as a direct measure to test whether a corporation is serious about its program,
or if it is merely a "paper program."

In addition, training should include references to the various controls and policies to
familiarize employees with these policies and procedures. Training should be required on
an ongoing basis (with periodic repeat training sessions) for all employees, officers,
directors, and, where appropriate, agents and business partners.47

(3) Developing and implementing programs

An effective anti-corruption program should be specifically tailored to the risks the company
faces. Controls should be in place to reduce, to a reasonable level, the chance that corrupt
transactions occur and to ensure that employees are not given unreasonable opportunities
to participate in corrupt acts.48 Characteristics of a well-designed compliance program
include consistency with applicable laws, adaptation to specific requirements, participation
of stakeholders, shared responsibility, accessibility, readability, promotion of a trust-based
internal culture, applicability, continuity, and efficiency.49

TI's Business Principles for Countering Bribery state that the Board of Directors, or equivalent
body, is responsible for implementing and overseeing the compliance program.50 The CEO
is responsible for the implementation and adherence to the program.51 The Board of
Directors and/or CEO should enlist various experts, such as lawyers, accountants and
compliance officers, to design and implement the program. Additionally, managers and
staff, particularly those faced with bribery demands or forms of corruption, may provide
assistance in the development of the program. In medium-sized or large companies, the
Board of Directors, or similar governing body, should create a special internal unit to
develop and implement the compliance program.52

A primary aspect of a company's compliance program is that it implements adequate
financial controls and follows generally accepted accounting standards. The complexity of
these features will depend on the risk level and size of the company. Payments of a certain

type, or over a certain amount, could require multiple authorizations to ensure that they are
in line with company policies. Procedures must prohibit and prevent actions such as the
creation of off-the-book accounts, the making of inadequately identified transactions, the
recording of non-existent expenditures, the use of false documents, the recording of
liabilities with incorrect identification and the intentional and unlawful destruction of
bookkeeping records.53 Accounting controls should not only prevent wrongful transactions
and other forms of wrongdoing, but should also assist in bringing wrongdoing to light
through regular audits.54

Compliance programs should also address gifts and entertainment expenses, particularly
for government officials. Company policy should outline appropriate levels for gift or
entertainment expenses, as well as any exceptions for allowable expenses. These expenses
may require multiple levels of approval and increased disclosure as the size and nature of
the gift reasonably dictates. Suggested best practice requires prior written approval by the
direct supervisor for receipt or offer of gifts, with consideration of the aggregate amount of
gifts or promotional expenses provided to or received from the public official in the recent
past.55 A company should not only accurately record in a transparent manner any gifts or
other benefits provided or received, but also gifts offered but not accepted.56

Charitable and political donations should also be addressed in the compliance program. The
company may wish to set out various approval levels; for example, greater donations might
require approval from a more senior individual within the company. Public disclosure is
suggested for both charitable and political donations (unless secrecy or confidentiality is
legally required under local law).57 Any political donations must be carried out in
accordance with applicable laws, which vary greatly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.
Preliminary checks are suggested for charitable donations to ensure the charity is legitimate
and not affiliated with public officials with whom the company deals.58 Suggested minimum
standards for charitable donations include:

           All contributions must be approved by senior management, with
                evidence provided of the nature and scope of the individual
                contribution.

           The beneficiary must show that it has all relevant certifications and
                has satisfied all requirements for operating in compliance with
                applicable laws.

           An adequate due diligence review on the beneficiary entity must be
                carried out.

           Contributions shall be made only in favor of well-known, reliable
                entities with outstanding reputations for honesty and correct business
                practices, and which have not been recently incorporated.

           There should be no donations to charities "suggested" by a public
                official and no donations to charities controlled by public officials.

           Contributions must be properly and transparently recorded in the
                company's books and records.

           The beneficiary entity shall guarantee that contributions received are
                recorded properly and transparently in its own books and records.59

The compliance program must also address contracts for services and procurement policies.
Contracts should include "express contractual obligations, remedies, and/or penalties in
relation to misconduct."60 Additionally, various approval levels may be needed for contracts
with third parties depending on the size or nature of the contract. Higher risk areas or
contracts for large amounts should normally require more approvals than standard low-
value contracts. Project financing should normally require additional safeguards to ensure
that all applicable laws are complied with.

Conflicts of interest should be addressed by the compliance program:

          The enterprise should establish policies and procedures to identify, monitor
          and manage conflicts of interest which may give rise to a risk of bribery -
          actual, potential or perceived. These policies and procedures should apply
          to directors, officers, employees and contracted parties such as agents,
          lobbyists and other intermediaries.61

Human resource policies and practices, concerning hiring, remuneration, and incentivizing
employees need to be considered as an aspect of the compliance program. It is particularly
important to include a policy that "no employee will suffer demotion, penalty, or other
adverse consequences for refusing to pay bribes even if such refusal may result in the
enterprise losing business."62

(4) Incentivizing and promoting compliance

Compliance with anti-corruption programs should be adequately incentivized and
promoted in order to ensure that employees are more likely than not to avoid corrupt
transactions. Employees carrying out compliance functions with a high degree of diligence
should be recognized, and employees reporting policy breaches should be rewarded.63 As
part of the compliance culture, human resource departments should encourage ethical

780
           CHAPTER 9 COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS, RISK ASSESSMENTS, & DUE DILIGENCE

hiring and promotion techniques and measures.64 This area requires careful implementation
because incentivizing employees often results in adverse effects for anti-corruption (e.g.,
rewards for high sales or punishment for low sales may incentivize employees to reach sales
targets, regardless of the means employed). Companies should ensure that they are
complying with local law in structuring their incentive schemes. They also should test their
program to ensure that it does not promote corrupt behaviour.

Discipline for non-compliance is equally essential to a comprehensive compliance program.
To demonstrate a compliance program has `teeth,' there should be discipline for non-
compliance, which is proportionate with the misconduct, including the possibility of
termination.65 Misconduct at all levels of the company (including officers and directors)
must be met by appropriate measures, and discipline should be enforced consistently across
the organization, and seen to be enforced.66

(5) Detecting, reporting, and investigating violations

A compliance program is more effective if it also works to detect and report violations.
Employees will not be properly incentivized to stop their corrupt behaviour if an
organization is not actively seeking to detect violations. As corrupt individuals will be able
to find a way around any scheme, the compliance program must include active detection
and reporting of violations to deter engagement in corrupt practices.

Compliance advice should be available to employees, and mechanisms should be put in
place to allow employees and business partners to seek preliminary consultation as to
whether certain practices conform with the policies.

An effective compliance program includes measures to encourage employees to report
potential violations of policy, and ensures they feel able to report repercussions without
reprisals. Confidential reporting and independent, effective investigation processes are
essential. Employees must be confident in anonymous reporting mechanisms as well as the
ability of the organization to protect them from retaliation.67 All reported misconduct and
violations of the compliance program should be investigated.68 Investigations of compliance
breaches should be conducted in an independent, timely and objective manner, by personnel
with relevant experience to ensure they are properly scoped and pursued. They must also
be conducted throughout the company, including at management and executive levels, and
consider systemic issues and root causes in its analysis, while making recommendations at
all levels.69

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

(6) Continual testing and improvement

Compliance programs should evolve with companies and their work environments.
Without continually testing the program for effectiveness and improving any weaknesses, a
company's compliance program can quickly become outdated. For example, the use of
technology and the Internet has completely changed what an effective compliance program
should look like. Additionally, the company's area of business may change and require new
mechanisms for preventing, detecting, and reporting corrupt acts.

An anti-corruption compliance program may be evaluated in two ways: (1) the suitability of
the program design and (2) the operational effectiveness of the controls in place.70 External
counsel may have to undertake more due diligence when performing tests of a compliance
system, since they may be less aware of the actual operating practices of the company.
External counsel may also be accused of trying to gold plate compliance systems by making
them more complex than necessary. On the other hand, internal counsel must be aware of
the problem of cognitive dissonance and its tendency to promote assumptions that the status
quo is effective.

      3.1.4 TI's Assurance Framework

In 2012, TI published an Assurance Framework aimed at assisting enterprises in receiving
"independent assurance of their anti-bribery programmes."71 In its guidelines on the Bribery
Act 2010, the UK Ministry of Justice recommends the use of external verification or
independent assurance to achieve the measures necessary to prevent bribery.72 Independent
assurance, defined by the AA1000 Assurance Standard 2008, is

          the methods and processes employed by an assurance practitioner to
          evaluate an organization's public disclosures about its performance as well
          as underlying systems, data and processes against suitable criteria and
          standards in order to increase the results of the assurance process in an
          assurance statement credibility of public disclosure.73

Benefits of conducting independent assurance of anti-corruption compliance programs
include the following:

           Strengthening its programme by identifying areas for improvement;

           Providing confidence to the board and management of the adequacy
                of its anti-bribery programme;

           Increasing the credibility of its public reporting on its anti-bribery
                programme;

           Maintaining and/or enhancing its reputation as an enterprise
                committed to high standards of integrity and transparency;

           Contributing to a case for mitigation of sentencing in the event of a
                bribery incident in jurisdictions where this applies;

           Helping restore market confidence following the discovery of a
                bribery incident; and

           Meeting any future pre-qualification requirements.74

Lawyers may serve as assurance practitioners to oversee the assurance process. In this
capacity, they are able to test and review the effectiveness of the anti-corruption compliance
program and assist the company in identifying any risks that still need addressing.

3.2 US Framework

      3.2.1 FCPA

The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) does not explicitly require companies to have an
anti-corruption compliance program. Even though there is no affirmative defense for having
an active and effective anti-corruption compliance program under the FCPA, enforcement
agencies consider compliance programs to be a necessary mechanism and, as
explained more fully in Chapter 6, Section 6.1.5.2 and Chapter 7, Section 6, will treat
companies that follow a reasonable compliance program far more leniently.

      3.2.2 Guidelines and Interpretation

The DOJ often sets specific requirements for compliance programs in companies that have
agreed to a resolution under the FCPA. These resolutions provide further illustration as to
what the DOJ considers reasonable standards for company compliance. Concerning DPAs
and NPAs,75 the DOJ has stated:

          DPAs and NPAs benefit the public and industries by providing guidance
          on what constitutes improper conduct.... Because the agreements typically
          provide a recitation of the improper conduct at issue, the agreements can
          serve as an educational tool for other companies in a particular industry.76

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

Though these settlement agreements are related to potential FCPA charges against specific
companies, they can, however, be useful in tailoring a compliance program to the specific
needs of other organizations and to keep them abreast of new DOJ requirements.

SEC enforcement orders provide another resource for companies charged under the FCPA.
These orders indicate areas of a business or industry where the SEC has pursued charges in
the past and may continue to do so in the future. For example, in 2014 Avon Products Inc.
(Avon) was charged with violating the FCPA because it failed to implement controls to
prevent and detect bribe payments in the form of gifts at its Chinese subsidiary.77 In addition
to a $135 million fine for SEC violations and criminal charges, Avon was required to have
its compliance program reviewed by an independent compliance monitor for 18 months and
self-report on its compliance efforts for an additional 18 months.78 In September 2016, Och-
Ziff Capital Management Group agreed to a nearly $200 million settlement with the SEC for
paying bribes to secure mining rights and corruptly influencing public officials in Libya,
Chad, Niger, Guinea, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.79 The SEC order found that
Och-Ziff failed, in particular, to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal controls
to prevent corrupt payments to foreign government officials.80 As part of the settlement,
Och-Ziff agreed to implement enhanced internal accounting controls and policies, designate
a Chief Compliance Officer who, for a period of five years, would not simultaneously hold
any other officer position at Och-Ziff, and to retain an independent monitor for a period of
no less than 36 month.81 The SEC's enforcement actions against Avon and Och-Ziff speak to
the importance of implementing an effective compliance program.

      3.2.3 DOJ and SEC Resource Guide

The DOJ and SEC view a corporate compliance program as essential to ensuring compliance
with the FCPA, as the program will assist in detection and prevention of violations. The DOJ
and SEC have recently updated and expanded their A Resource Guide to the US Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act (Resource Guide),82 released in 2012, to assist organizations in their
compliance with the FCPA. The Resource Guide provides information for all sizes and types
of businesses on implementing effective anti-corruption programs within their organization.

           CHAPTER 9 COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS, RISK ASSESSMENTS, & DUE DILIGENCE

New sections added in the updated Resource Guide focus on the development and
implementation of compliance programs, including:

      Confidential Reporting and Internal Investigation
      Continuous Improvement: Periodic Testing and Review, Investigation, Analysis
      Investigation, Analysis, and Remediation of Misconduct
      Evaluation of Corporate Compliance Programs
      Other Guidance on Compliance and International Best Practices.

The Resource Guide also indicates that companies with adequate compliance programs will
fare better even if they, despite their compliance program, somehow violate the FCPA. The
implementation and enforcement of an adequate compliance program is a major factor in
encouraging the DOJ and SEC to resolve charges through a deferred prosecution agreement
(DPA) or a non-prosecution agreement (NPA).83 As noted, having an effective compliance
program will also influence (1) whether a DPA or NPA is made, (2) the terms of the corporate
probation and (3) the amount of the fine.84 The DOJ and SEC look for three basic
requirements when evaluating a compliance program: (1) effective design of the program
(2) good faith application of the program (including with respect to adequate resourcing),
and (3) actual effectiveness in practice.85 At the time of sentencing, a culpability score is
assigned to the company.86 This score is multiplied against the original fine determination
and can reduce the fine to 5% of the original fine or increase it by four times the original fine.
One aspect for determining the culpability score is the organization's compliance program
(see Chapter 7, Sections 4.5 and 4.6).

According to the Resource Guide, "effective compliance programs are tailored to the
company's specific business and to the risks associated with that business. They are dynamic
and evolve as the business and the markets change."87 When implemented throughout the
entire organization, a program that is carefully calculated to address the specific risks faced
by the business will help "prevent, detect, remediate, and report misconduct, including
FCPA violations."88 The Resource Guide stresses the importance of tailoring the compliance
program to fit the needs of the organization:

          One-size-fits-all compliance programs are generally ill-conceived and
          ineffective because resources inevitably are spread too thin, with too much
          focus on low-risk markets and transactions to the detriment of high risk
          areas. Devoting a disproportionate amount of time policing modest
          entertainment and gift-giving instead of focusing on large government bids,
          questionable payments to third-party consultants, or excessive discounts to

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

          resellers and distributors may indicate that a company's compliance
          program is ineffective.89

Implementing an effective compliance program requires an assessment of the types of risks
a company faces and an analysis of the best use of compliance dollars to prevent corruption
in the organization. The Resource Guide stresses the importance of the following aspects in
an effective compliance program:

      Commitment from Senior Management and a Clearly Articulated Policy
          Against Corruption

      Code of Conduct and Compliance Policies and Procedures
      Oversight, Autonomy, and Resources
      Risk Assessment
      Training and Continuing Advice
      Incentives and Disciplinary Measures

      Mergers and Acquisitions: Pre-Acquisition Due Diligence and Post-

          Acquisition Integration
      Investigation, Analysis, and Remediation of Misconduct.90

Additionally, the Resource Guide alerts companies to the international organizations'
guidelines previously discussed.

      3.2.4 DOJ Evaluation of Corporate Compliance Programs

In April 2019, the DOJ released an updated document to assist prosecutors in making
informed decisions as to whether an organization's compliance program was effective at the
time of the offense and/or at the time of a charging decision/resolution. The document will
assist the prosecution in determining the appropriate course of action, which could include
prosecution, monetary penalties, or compliance obligations to be included in a corporate
criminal resolution. The document also details three fundamental questions a prosecutor
must ask when evaluating an organization:

     1) Is the corporation's compliance program well designed?
     2) Is the program being applied earnestly and in good faith? In other words, is

          the program being implemented effectively? and
     3) "Does the corporation's compliance program work" in practice?

           CHAPTER 9 COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS, RISK ASSESSMENTS, & DUE DILIGENCE

The document goes on to list various factors to be considered under each question, including
training, communication, policies and procedures, risk management programs, and more.91

      3.2.5 DOJ Sentencing Guidelines

The US Sentencing Commission's Guidelines Manual (the Guidelines) set out seven minimum
standards for complying with due diligence requirements and promoting an ethical
organizational culture. As these are the DOJ's own guidelines and not legislation or
regulations, they are not binding; however, the DOJ frowns upon deviation from these
guidelines absent a very good reason to do so. The Guidelines specify that the organizations
must:

           establish standards and procedures to prevent and detect criminal
                conduct;

           ensure that the compliance program is coming from the top down
                throughout the organization;

           make reasonable efforts to ensure that personnel with substantial
                authority are not known to have engaged in illegal activities;

           make reasonable efforts to communicate standards and procedures to
                personnel with substantial authority and the governing body;

           take reasonable steps to monitor compliance with the program and
                audit the program for effectiveness;

           promote and enforce the program throughout the organization and
                appropriately incentivize compliance; and

           respond appropriately when criminal conduct is detected, including
                making any necessary modifications to the compliance program.92

The Guidelines are a starting point for organizations to determine what is required for an
adequate compliance program, including: (i) industry practice and government regulation
(ii) an organization's size, and (iii) similar misconduct.93 The Guidelines were created to guide
prosecutors in seeking the appropriate punishment for corporations, and have become an
important benchmark for US corporations in crafting corporate governance standards and
avoiding prosecution. These guidelines constitute a minimum requirement and thus do not
necessarily reflect best practices. More information about these guidelines can be found in
Chapter 7, Section 4.

3.3 UK Framework

      3.3.1 Bribery Act 2010

Section 7(1) of the Bribery Act creates a strict liability offence if an organization fails to
prevent bribery by a person associated with it, while section 7(2) provides a complete
defence to this offence if the organization has "adequate procedures" in place. Section 7
provides:

          (1) A relevant commercial organization (C) is guilty of an offence under
                this section if a person associated (A) with C bribes another person
                intending -

                (a) to obtain or retain business for C, or

                (b) to obtain or retain an advantage in the conduct of business for C.

          (2) But it is a defence for C to prove that C had in place adequate
                procedures designed to prevent persons associated with C from
                undertaking such conduct.94

Under section 7, "businesses who fail to have adequate procedures in place and whose
`associated persons' commit bribery are at risk of being prosecuted."95 The effect of this
provision is that anti-bribery compliance programs are mandatory for all "relevant
commercial organizations" if they want to avoid liability for bribery offences committed by
persons associated with the organization. Section 9 of the Bribery Act requires the Secretary
of State to "publish guidance about procedures that relevant commercial organizations can
put in place to prevent persons associated with them from committing bribery."96 The
guidelines were published in April 2011.

In December 2016, Sweett Group PLC pleaded guilty to failing to prevent an act of bribery
committed by its subsidiary, Cyril Sweett International Limited, in order to secure a contract
with Al Ain Ahlia Insurance Company (AAAI) for the building of the Rotana Hotel in Abu
Dhabi.97 In February 2016, Sweett Group PLC was sentenced and ordered to pay £2.25
million, thus becoming the first company to be fined under section 7 of the Bribery Act.98 The
SFO's successful prosecution of Sweett Group speaks to the importance of implementing an
adequate anti-corruption compliance program.

           CHAPTER 9 COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS, RISK ASSESSMENTS, & DUE DILIGENCE

      3.3.2 Guidelines and Interpretation

UK case law provides insight on the interpretation of the phrase "carries on business" in
section 7. The courts have found that a singular transaction, if essential to the carrying on of
business or carried out in the course of business, can constitute carrying on business under
section 7.99 The courts have also found a business is carried on in the case of a company
engaged only in collecting debts owed and paying off creditors.100

On March 30, 2011, the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) published statutory Guidance, which came
into force on July 1, 2011.101 On the same day, the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) and Crown
Prosecution Service (CPS) published the Bribery Act 2010: Joint Prosecution Guidance of the
Director of the SFO and the DPP (Joint Prosecution Guidance) to ensure consistency in
prosecutions.102

      3.3.3 Bribery Act 2010: Guidance

The MOJ Guidance provides insight into the objectives of the Bribery Act 2010, particularly in
regard to section 7:

          The objective of the Act is not to bring the full force of the criminal law to
          bear upon well run commercial organisations that experience an isolated
          incident of bribery on their behalf. So in order to achieve an appropriate
          balance, section 7 provides a full defence. This is in recognition of the fact
          that no bribery prevention regime will be capable of preventing bribery at
          all times. However, the defence is also included in order to encourage
          commercial organisations to put procedures in place to prevent bribery by
          persons associated with them.103

The MOJ Guidance sets out six principles to inform the evaluation of a company's compliance
program: (1) proportionate procedures (2) top level commitment (3) risk assessment (4) due
diligence (5) communication, and (6) monitoring and review.104 The principles are intended
to focus on the outcome of preventing bribery and corruption and should be applied flexibly,
as commercial organizations encounter a wide variety of circumstances that place them at
risk.105

(1) Proportionate Procedures

This principle requires that the organization's anti-bribery procedures be proportionate to
the bribery risks the organization faces and proportionate to the "nature, scale and
complexity of the commercial organization's activities."106 The use of the term "procedure"

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

encompasses both the organization's policies and the implementing procedures for those
policies. The level of risk the organization faces may be affected by factors such as the size
of the organization, and the type and nature of the persons associated with it.107 In the
commentary to the Guidance, the MOJ suggests topics that will normally be included in anti-
bribery policies, as well as procedures that could be implemented to prevent bribery.

(2) Top Level Commitment

This principle requires commitment by the board of directors or equal top-level
management of the organization to the prevention of bribery by persons within or working
with their organization.108 It also states that top-level management should "foster a culture
within the organization in which bribery is never acceptable."109

(3) Risk Assessment

This principle requires the organization to conduct periodic assessments of the internal and
external risks that the organization faces.110 These assessments should be informed and
documented.111 Risk assessments will be discussed more fully in Section 4.

(4) Due Diligence

This principle requires the organization to apply appropriate due diligence procedures
when its employees and agents are performing services for or on behalf of the
organization.112 Due diligence will be discussed more fully later in Section 5.

(5) Communication (including training)

This principle requires the organization to ensure that its anti-corruption policies and
procedures are known and understood throughout the organization.113 Internal and external
communications and training are required.114 External communications are suggested in
order to assure people outside the organization of the organization's commitment to
compliance with anti-bribery laws, as well as to discourage people intending to engage in
bribery from approaching the organization.115 Training is necessary to inform employees of
what bribery is and should be tailored to the risks involved in the employee's position.116

           CHAPTER 9 COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS, RISK ASSESSMENTS, & DUE DILIGENCE

(6) Monitoring and Review

This principle requires the organization to monitor and review its procedures so that it can
make any necessary changes.117 The MOJ Guidance suggests that organizations may want to
involve external verification or assurance of the effectiveness of their compliance
procedures.118

      3.3.4 Bribery Act 2010: Joint Prosecution Guidance

The SFO and the CPS developed the Joint Prosecution Guidance to ensure consistent
enforcement of the Act across jurisdictions. The Joint Prosecution Guidance sets out factors
that weigh against or in favour of prosecution. For example, prosecution will be favoured if
a company has "clear and appropriate policy setting out procedures an individual should
follow if facilitation payments are requested and these have not been correctly followed."119
Non-prosecution will be favoured if these same procedures and policies have been
followed.120

The Joint Prosecution Guidance addresses defences to section 7 offences. The defendant
organization must show the existence of adequate procedures on a balance of probabilities.
The courts will consider the adequacy of a company's procedures on a case-by-case basis
because adequate procedures are entirely dependent on the risks faced by and the nature
and size of each company. Prosecutors are required to take into account the MOJ Guidance
when assessing whether the organization's anti-corruption procedures are adequate.

      3.3.5 Bribery Act 2010: SFO Operational Handbook

In January 2020, the SFO published new guidance on how it assesses the effectiveness of
compliance programs. There are various stages where the SFO will review a company's
compliance, including at the time of the alleged offending, when a decision is being made
on whether to charge the company, and in the future when introducing and maintaining an
effective compliance program.

When assessing the effectiveness of an organization's compliance program, the SFO will
attempt to answer the following questions:

     1) If the prosecution is in the public interest;
     2) If the organization should be invited into DPA negotiations, and if so, what

          conditions should be included;
     3) If the organization has a defence of "adequate procedures" against a charge

          under section 7 of the Bribery Act; and

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

     4) If the existence and nature of the compliance programme is a relevant factor
          for sentencing considerations.

The guidance goes into detail on the six principles laid out in the former, 2011 guidance,
including the importance of proportionate procedures, top-level commitment, risk
assessment, due diligence, communication and training and monitoring and review.121

3.4 Canadian Framework

      3.4.1 CFPOA

The Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act (CFPOA) does not create a legal requirement for
organizations to implement an anti-corruption compliance program. Nevertheless, many
organizations are looking for guidance from the government on how to comply with the
CFPOA.122 The Canadian government's guidance on the CFPOA is, however, brief and
general, and does not address the creation of adequate compliance programs.123 Unlike the
US and UK, there is no meaningful prosecutorial guidance on either the content or
prosecutorial impact of reasonable anti-corruption compliance programs (see Chapter 6,
Section 6.3). At this time, Canadian companies have to rely on the courts' interpretation of
the legislation in order to determine Canadian standards for implementing effective anti-
corruption programs. However, to date, there is only one case (Niko Resources) where a
Canadian court has indicated what a reasonable compliance program would look like for a
mining company carrying on business in Bangladesh.

Global Compact Network Canada has published a resource guide for Canadian businesses
on designing anti-corruption compliance programs.124 The document sets out a list of
"requirements" for business, developed through a review of relevant government
documents, judicial cases, and other resources, both Canadian and American.125

The requirements include board level oversight and senior-level personnel assigned for
oversight and implementation of anti-corruption programs. To ensure the effectiveness of
these requirements, the relevant compliance officers must be senior members of the
organization, independent, and well resourced.126

           CHAPTER 9 COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS, RISK ASSESSMENTS, & DUE DILIGENCE

      3.4.2 Judicial Guidance

In 2011, Niko Resources Ltd. was charged with bribery under the CFPOA after a six-year
investigation. The company pled guilty, was fined CDN$9.5 million, placed on probation for
three years, and required to undertake independent audits and undergo court supervision.
In its probation order, the Alberta Court of Queen's Bench worked with the US DOJ in
drafting the terms of the probation order, particularly the compliance program
requirements. It provides some guidance on how Canadian courts may view an effective
anti-corruption compliance program. Although it is a trial level decision and therefore has
limited binding effect, courts will examine the decision in the future when deciding what
constitutes an adequate anti-corruption compliance program. Clearly, the Court in Niko
Resources relied to some degree on US standards for compliance programs, as it adopted
terminology found in US DPAs in relation to compliance programs. The Alberta Court of
Queen's Bench required the following from Niko Resources as part of its probation order:

           internal accounting controls for maintaining fair and accurate books
                and records;

           a rigorous anti-corruption compliance code designed to detect and
                deter violations of CFPOA and other anti-corruption laws, which
                includes:

                - a clearly articulated written policy against violations of the
                     CFPOA and other anti-bribery laws;

                - strong, explicit and visible support from senior management;

                - compliance standards and procedures that apply to all

In early 2015, SNC-Lavalin and two of its subsidiaries, SNC-Lavalin International Inc. and
SNC-Lavalin Construction Inc. were each charged with one count of corruption under
section 3(1)(b) of the CFPOA and one count of fraud under section 380(1)(a) of the Criminal
Code. These charges arose out of its 2001-2011 dealings in Libya during the reign of the
Gaddafi regime.

In late 2019, SNC-Lavalin Construction Inc. pled guilty to the section 280(1) Criminal Code
charge. As part of the plea arrangement, the remainder of the charges against it and the other
SNC-Lavalin entries were dropped and a Probation Order including requirements for anti-
corruption compliance measures was imposed. The Probation Order was effective for three
years from the date of its issuance (December 18, 2019),

Although the guilty plea and conviction was in respect of fraud under section 380 of the
Criminal Code rather than an offence under CFPOA, the conditions of the Probation Order
mirror those in Niko Resources, discussed previously. This is an indication that the approach
followed by the Crown in Niko Resources almost a decade ago, in consultation with the US
authorities, remains highly relevant today. The Niko Resources and SNC-Lavalin orders
together provide helpful guidance for companies on the expectations of Canadian

The Probation Order requires, among other things, the following key internal controls and
procedures:

      reviews of the company's existing internal controls, policies and procedures
          on a no less than annual basis, with updates as appropriate;

      a system of internal financial and accounting controls and procedures
          sufficient to keep fair and accurate books, records and accounts to ensure that
          bribery is not concealed;

      a rigorous anti-corruption compliance code, standards and procedures to
          detect and deter violations of anti-corruption laws covering both the
          company's personnel and its business partners (agents, intermediaries,
          consultants, and other representatives) involved in sales, business
          development, marketing or other customer interfaces, or government
          relations, and governing:
                o gifts, hospitality, entertainment and expenses;
                o customer travel;

          third parties, as well as measures to ensure they are aware of the company's
          commitment to anti-corruption compliance, and seeking reciprocal
          commitments;

      standard provisions in agreements with agents and business partners to
          prevent violations of the anti-corruption laws, including anti-corruption
          representations and undertakings, rights to conduct audits of books and

          law or policy; and

      periodic review and testing of anti-corruption compliance code, systems and
          procedures designed to evaluate and improve their effectiveness, taking into
          account relevant developments.128

In addition, the Probation Order requires the appointment of an independent monitor, at
SNC-Lavalin Construction Inc.'s expense, who is required to report on the company's
compliance and remediation progress during the three-year period of the Probation Order.

In other cases involving offences under the CFPOA, Canadian courts have not imposed
corporate compliance programs as part of their sentences. The best guidelines for Canadian
companies in relation to adequate compliance programs are found in Niko and in the SNC
Probation Order. However, it is unclear how compliance programs will impact prosecutorial
decisions and sentence mitigation. For more information about Canadian cases involving
the CFPOA, see Chapter 7, Section 6.

      3.4.3 Remediation Agreement Regime

In 2018, Canada amended the Criminal Code to provide for a process whereby a corporation
may be able to avoid prosecution for certain economic crimes, including bribery and
accounting offences under CFPOA, by entering a remediation agreement (RA), which is
broadly similar to the deferred prosecution agreements available in other jurisdictions.

A prosecutor may enter into negotiations for an RA if:

      there is a reasonable prospect of conviction for the alleged offence;
      the alleged offence is one for which an RA may be negotiated; and

           CHAPTER 9 COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS, RISK ASSESSMENTS, & DUE DILIGENCE

      it is in the public interest and appropriate in the circumstances to issue an
          invitation to negotiate an RA, rather than proceed with a traditional prosecution.129

A full law enforcement investigation must be undertaken in order to assess whether the
threshold of a reasonable prospect of conviction has been met. In particular, internal or
private investigations are not sufficient.130

Certain mandatory clauses are required in an RA, including:

      a statement of facts and undertaking by the organization not to make or condone
          any public statement contradicting those facts;

      the organization's admission of responsibility;
      disclosure obligations in respect of related wrongdoings and persons involved;
      an obligation to cooperate in investigations and prosecutions in Canada, or

          elsewhere if the prosecutor "considers it appropriate";
      a deadline to meet the terms of the agreement;
      sanctions, including a non-tax-deductible penalty, a victim surcharge equivalent to

          30% of the penalty (inapplicable in respect of foreign corruption offences),
          forfeiture of any property, benefit, or advantage obtained directly or indirectly
          from the commission of the offence, and reparations to victims, if applicable;
      an indication of the use that can be made of information obtained as a result of the
          agreement; and
      notice of the prosecutor's right to vary or terminate the agreement with the
          approval of the court.131

In addition, the RA may contain optional clauses requiring the organization to implement
or improve compliance measures, the reimbursement of costs incurred by the prosecutor in
administering the RA, and/or the appointment of an independent monitor to report on the
performance of the RA.132

As Canada has not yet entered into any RAs, the precise implementation of these
requirements and structure of an RA in practice remain unclear.

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

      3.4.4 Critiques of Compliance Programs

As guidelines and frameworks to prevent corruption are becoming more prevalent, there is
criticism that increased enforcement is resulting in wasteful over-compliance. Instead of
investing in efficient compliance programs, companies are implementing programs
intended only to impress prosecutors.133 US Senators Amy Klobuchar and Christopher
Coons argue that over-compliance can negatively impact the economy through decreasing
product development, export production, and expansion of the workforce.134

Another criticism is that the US's over enforcement of the FCPA has caused compliance
fatigue:

          Rules and controls and training programs are essential in any organization
          but at some point, the burdens imposed by intricate matrices of rules,
          complete reporting and approval processes, and seemingly never-ending
          training requirements become a net drag on the business.... A system that is
          overly-controlled, that has passed its optimal point of compliance activities,
          will engender backlash and bewilderment from those who are being
          controlled. Managers and other employees will balk at the sclerotic network
          of rules and processes, and they won't - and in many instances may not be
          able to - comply. Rules and signoffs will be overlooked and training courses
          never taken.135

As governments seek compliance with their laws, attention must be directed to the question
of whether laws and enforcement actions are having their intended effect: are they actually
reducing the prevalence of global corruption? Continual analysis of the most effective ways
to prevent corruption is required to ensure that governments are not using excessive
enforcement orders to serve a political agenda. The United States' zealous enforcement
practices under the FCPA may be achieving the opposite result than was intended; putting
excessive pressure on companies to settle, through non-prosecution or deferred prosecution
agreements, resulting in very little case law. This creates a state of legal uncertainty which,
in turn, pressures companies to settle rather than pursue litigation. Maintaining an
adversarial relationship between government and businesses may be counter-productive, as
both need to work together to combat global corruption.136

A further problem with anti-corruption compliance programs is the issue of program design:
the program designers tend to be "external to the context of deployment and use."137
"Disciplinary externality" occurs when the designer is not the person who will be
implementing the program and has a different work background than those who will be

implementing the program.138 Work background includes factors like the educational
background, departmental culture and "language" spoken by the designer and
implementer.139 "Country externality" occurs when a program designer is from a different
country than those implementing and using the program, and may result in incompatibility
with the political, social, and economic conditions of the country of implementation.140

Finally, the over-emphasis on "transparency" may be ineffective. It is notable that
transparency measures may lead to the diffusion of responsibility, where those disclosing
their bias feel they are free to act on it once it has been disclosed. Further, a phenomenon
called "moral licensing" may cause people to become more likely to act on their biases, as a
director may use one `good' act to justify increased bad behaviour. These two phenomena
highlight the fact that transparency is not an end in itself. More follow-up work will need to
be done following disclosures.141

4. RISK ASSESSMENTS

Risk assessments are premised on the concept that "[p]reventing and fighting corruption
effectively, and proportionately, requires an understanding of the risks an enterprise may
face."142 Risk assessment is a necessary starting point for all anti-corruption compliance
programs, as well as a way to review the success of an existing program and assess where
changes are needed. Risk assessments examine an organization's exposure to internal and
external risks of corruption and bribery.143 An overview of risk areas allows the company to
determine necessary compliance measures and target high-risk business sectors or countries.
Robert Tarun and Peter Tomczak describe how organizations can use risk assessments as a
tool:

          A risk assessment is designed to among other things evaluate the
          compliance roles and activities of the board of directors, the chief executive
          officer, chief financial officer, general counsel, and the internal audit staff
          and the company as a whole; review international operations and contracts,
          anti-corruption training, and due diligence in hiring and mergers and
          acquisitions; and then weigh the multinational company's country risks,

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

          regional and/or in-country management weaknesses, and prior
          enforcement history issues.144

A risk assessment seeks to promote informed decision-making.145 Effective risk assessments
are seen to fulfill four goals:

          (1) Identify areas of business and activities that are at risk of corruption;

          (2) Evaluate and analyze the risks identified and prioritize all relevant
                risks of corruption;

          (3) Carry out a gap analysis of the current internal standard of
                procedures, systems, and controls; and

          (4) Undertake a root cause analysis of internal and external causes.146

Risk assessments not only provide the company with an overview of risks in order to
prevent those risks from materializing, but also demonstrate to law enforcement personnel
that the company is proactively seeking to comply with the law.147 As with an anti-
corruption compliance program, the nature and scope of the risk assessment should be
proportionate to the size, activities, customers and markets of the organization. A risk
assessment will help determine the scope and nature of the company's anti-corruption
compliance program, ensuring that resources are allocated to major risk areas and spent
where they produce the greatest benefit. As enforcement agencies do not look fondly on
"cookie cutter" compliance programs or compliance programs that are only found on paper,
it is important that any investments made in a compliance program produce effective results
while consuming resources that match the benefit gained. Effective anti-corruption
compliance programs require an up-to-date and accurate understanding of the risks the
company encounters. Risk assessments should not be a one-time event; regular reviews
should be made to ensure that resources are properly deployed to deal with evolving risks.148
Not only does a corporation's business evolve, but the external environment evolves as
governments and laws change. The OECD Recommendations provide guidance on the use
of risk assessments for companies:

          Effective internal controls, ethics, and compliance programmes or measures
          for preventing and detecting foreign bribery should be developed on the
          basis of a risk assessment addressing the individual circumstances of a
          company, in particular the foreign bribery risks facing the company (such
          as its geographical and industrial sector of operation). Such circumstances
          and risks should be regularly monitored, re-assessed, and adapted as

          controls, ethics, and compliance programme or measures.149

4.1 What Risk Areas Are Being Assessed?

According to the UK MOJ Guidance, there are ten types of risk that fall into two broad
categories: external risk and internal risk. The external risks that should be assessed during
the risk assessment are: country risk, sectoral risk, transaction risk, business opportunity
risk, and business partnership risk.150 Country risk is affected by such factors as government
structure, the role of the media and whether the country has implemented and enforced
effective anti-corruption legislation.151 Sectoral risk recognizes that different sectors or
industries are at a higher risk of corruption than others are. For example, corruption is more
prevalent in extractive industries. Certain types of transactions also entail higher risks of
corruption. Campaign donations and charitable donations are transactions that have
traditionally been prone to corruption. Business opportunity risk is heightened when
working with a multitude of contractors or intermediaries on projects that do not have clear
objectives. Business partnership risk refers to the increased risk that comes with working
with intermediaries or partners, especially when utilizing the connections they have. This
risk is especially high when their connections are with prominent public officials. These
external risks require risk assessments when companies engage in business in a new country
or acquire another company. Risk assessments may also be appropriate prior to starting a
large-scale project.

The UK MOJ has also identified a number of internal risk factors: (1) deficiencies in
employee training, skills and knowledge (2) a bonus culture that rewards excessive risk
taking (3) lack of clarity in policies on hospitality and promotional expenditures and political
or charitable contributions (4) lack of clear financial controls, and (5) lack of a clear anti-
bribery message from top-level management.152 When conducting a risk assessment, these
risks may be rated by their probability of occurrence and the potential impact if the risk were
to come to fruition (this is called inherent risk). Companies should then assess the controls
required to reduce these risks.

Tarun and Tomczak's Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Handbook outlines 15 key risk factors that
should be considered in a risk assessment prior to the acquisition and merger of another
company. These are:

          (1) A presence in a BRIC country and other countries where corruption
                   risk is high;

          (2) An industry that has been the subject of recent anti-bribery or FCPA
                   investigations;

                   laws, the FCPA, and/or anti-bribery laws.153

The International Chamber of Commerce's guide on anti-corruption third party due
diligence for small and medium-size enterprises considers the following five factors
necessary in risk assessments:

          (1) whether the third party is an entity owned or controlled by the
                government or a public official, or whether the third party will be
                interacting with public officials in order to perform the contract;

          (2) the country the third party is based in and the country where the
                services are being performed;

          (3) the industry the third party operates in;
          (4) the value of the contract; and
          (5) the nature of the work or services to be performed.154

           CHAPTER 9 COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS, RISK ASSESSMENTS, & DUE DILIGENCE

4.2 Conducting an Effective Risk Assessment

At its most basic, a risk assessment involves determining the risks a company is willing to
live with, as elimination of all risks is impossible. It then involves valuing the risks faced by
the company based on probability of occurrence and the consequences of the risk being
realized. This process reveals a company's inherent risk. A risk assessment should then
evaluate what actions can be taken to mitigate those risks, and the costs associated with
doing so. The company will then consider the residual risk (inherent risk less the mitigated
risk), which will likely never reach zero. If the company's residual risk is higher than the
risk the company is willing to tolerate, the company will need to add additional protections
or reconsider the protections it has in place.155

When assessing risks, companies should consult a variety of sources to ensure that risk areas
are not overlooked. UNODC has suggested five ways to determine the risks a company
faces.156 The first is to determine the legal requirements applicable to the company's
operations, remembering that highly bureaucratic processes entail greater risks of
corruption, particularly with regard to bribery and/or facilitation payments.157 Second, the
company should consult with its internal and external stakeholders, such as employees and
business partners.158 These stakeholders are likely able to identify risks of corruption that
may have been initially overlooked, and may provide valuable insight on ways to mitigate
the risk. Third, the company should consider previous corruption cases to see where other
companies failed or had weaknesses.159 Fourthly, a company may wish to hire external
consultants; these consultants can provide a fresh set of eyes and point out risks that have
been overlooked by internal controls and reviews.160 Lastly, companies should review risk
assessment guidelines to incorporate best practices into their assessments.161

When assessing risks involving third parties, Ernst & Young advises that organizations
understand the qualifications and associations of the third party, analyze the business
rationale for including a third party, monitor all relationships with third parties once they
begin, perform continual background investigations of new and existing third parties, and
be alert about companies that have minimal public information.162

Companies may consider engaging external experts and consultants to conduct an effective
risk assessment. For instance, TRACE International, a non-profit business association
founded in 2001 by in-house anti-bribery compliance experts, provides its members with
anti-bribery compliance support, and TRACE Incorporated offers risk-based due diligence,

anti-bribery training and advisory services to both members and non-members.163 In
collaboration with the RAND Corporation, TRACE International developed the TRACE
Matrix, a global business bribery risk index for compliance professionals. The index scores
199 countries in four domains--business interactions with the government, anti-bribery
laws and enforcement, government and civil service transparency, and capacity for civil
society oversight--and may be used by businesses to understand the risks of business
bribery in a particular country.164

4.3 US

The DOJ and SEC see risk assessments as an essential component of an effective anti-
corruption compliance program.165 Both organizations stress the importance of
implementing a risk-based compliance program and risk-based due diligence.

The SEC published its guidance on their examination priorities in 2020. They emphasized
the importance of strong compliance programs and identified potential risk factors,
including products and services offered, compensation and funding arrangements, prior
examination observations and conduct, disciplinary history of associated individuals and
companies, changes in firm leadership or personnel, and access to investor assets.166

4.4 UK

Principle 3 of the UK MOJ's Guidance provides insight into what constitutes an "adequate
process" for risk assessment in order to form a full defence to strict liability under section 7
of the Bribery Act:

          The commercial organization assesses the nature and extent of its exposure
          to potential external and internal risks of bribery on its behalf by persons
          associated with it. The assessment is periodic, informed and documented.167

The Guidance suggests that a common sense approach should be taken to this principle to
ensure that efforts are proportionate.168 In order to comply with the principle, assessments
for multinational firms should be performed, at a minimum, annually. To be informed,
assessments require top-level management oversight and the input of various legal,
compliance, financial, audit, sales, and country managers. Documentation is required to
prove that the risk assessment took place, particularly if the adequacy of the risk assessment

comes into question. The Guidance goes on to say that risk assessment procedures will
generally include the following characteristics:

      oversight of the risk assessment by top-level management;
      appropriate resourcing - this should reflect the scale of the organization's

          business and the need to identify and prioritize all relevant risks;
      identification of the internal and external information sources that will enable

          risk to be assessed and reviewed;
      due diligence inquiries; and
      accurate and appropriate documentation of the risk assessment and its

          conclusions.169

Transparency International UK has published a Global Anti-Bribery Guidance. The section on
risk assessment advises corporations to focus on three key elements: the highest risk areas,
to evaluate bribery risks realistically, and to ensure that risk assessment is a repeated
process. In their view, a best practice risk assessment procedure gives a company a
systematic and objective view of bribery risks. This guidance identifies six stages of risk
assessment:

     1) Ensure top level commitment and oversight;
     2) Plan, scope, and mobilise, including appointing the project lead, defining

          stakeholders, allocating team responsibilities, and identifying information sources;
     3) Gather information on inherent bribery risks that the company could be exposed to;
     4) Identify the activities and risk factors that could increase the company's exposure to

          bribery risk;
     5) Evaluate and prioritize the risks; and
     6) Use the output of risk assessment to review the company's anti-bribery programme

          and the extent to which modifications need to be made.170

The Court in Niko Resources required the company to complete a risk assessment:

          The company will develop these compliance standards and procedures,
          including internal controls, ethics and compliance programs, on the basis of
          a risk assessment addressing the individual circumstances of the company,

          limited to, its geographical organization, interactions with various types

                                                                                                          805

          and levels of government officials, industrial sectors of operation,
          involvement in joint venture agreements, importance of licenses and
          permits in the company's operations, degree of governmental oversight and
          inspection, and volume and importance of goods and personnel clearing
          through customs and immigration.171

Canadian legislation and Canadian courts have not provided any guidelines on
implementing risk assessments as part of a compliance program; however, Niko Resources
shows the Court's inclination to assess the compliance procedures in place on the basis of
the risk assessment the company is expected to complete. Niko Resources demonstrates that
Canadian prosecutors may work with the US DOJ and use standard aspects of American
orders to make recommendations to the courts regarding ways companies can be directed
to comply with CFPOA.172

A guidance document created by Global Compact Network Canada goes into more detail
on what effective compliance programs in Canada can look like. They suggest that Canadian
organizations begin their assessment by conducting a baseline risk assessment, including
the following: the level of risk associated with the country where the organization is located,
the extent of contact with government officials, the company's area of business, the current
state of the business, and the level of control the company has over their operations/assets
(for example, are they involved in joint ventures or do they rely heavily on third parties or
intermediaries?), etc. Next, companies should conduct interviews and document reviews to
determine their greatest areas of risk and do follow up work to implement preventative
measures.173

5. DUE DILIGENCE REQUIREMENTS

As already noted, a risk assessment is one of the first steps to take in fulfilling due diligence
requirements for various transactions. The risk assessment will help focus the due diligence
procedures efficiently and effectively. Risk-based due diligence, the process of assessing the
level of risk posed to determine the level of due diligence requirements,174 should be
conducted at a minimum during mergers and acquisitions and when working with third-
party intermediaries.175

175 This is not to suggest that due diligence should only be conducted in these scenarios. Investments,
contracts with governments and large sales or service contracts also may require due diligence
procedures.

           CHAPTER 9 COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS, RISK ASSESSMENTS, & DUE DILIGENCE

5.1 Third Party Intermediaries

Companies often use third parties to conceal corrupt acts, particularly bribes to foreign
officials.176 Because many countries make companies liable for the acts of their agents, it is
important to conduct adequate due diligence on third party intermediaries, particularly
when working in high risk environments or on high-risk transactions. The essential purpose
of due diligence in relation to third party intermediaries is to increase knowledge of the third
party.177 The DOJ and SEC guidelines indicate three criteria in undergoing due diligence on
third party intermediaries. First, companies need to understand "the qualifications and
associations of its third party partners" and particularly, any relationship with foreign
officials. Second, companies should understand the business rationale for including a third
party intermediary in the transaction and define the role the third party will serve. Third, a
company should conduct ongoing monitoring of its third party relationships. The World
Economic Forum suggests four steps in conducting risk-based due diligence on third parties.
The first is to understand third parties and determine which ones should be subject to due
diligence procedures; the second is to assess the level of risk associated with the third party;
the third is to conduct the due diligence; and lastly, the process should be managed to
identify and mitigate risks.178

The International Chamber of Commerce suggests that, for small and medium sized entities,
anti-corruption third party due diligence may be conducted without the use of external
consultants.179 It lists the following six "pillars" upon which background information should
be sought: (1) beneficial ownership (2) financial background and payment of contract (3)
competency of third party (4) history of corruption and adverse news (from public records
resources) (5) reputation (consulting third party's commercial references), and (6) approach
to ethics and compliance.180 In particular, to establish competency of the third party, a
company should ask whether the third party has

     (1) experience in the industry and the country where the services are to be provided;

     (2) the necessary qualifications and experience to provide the services;

     (3) provided a competitive estimate for the services to be provided;

     (4) a business presence in the country where the services are to be provided;

     (5) been recommended by a public official;

     (6) requested urgent payments or unusually high commissions;

     (7) requested payments to be made in cash, to a third party, or to a different country;

Some benefits to an effective third-party management framework can include the ability to
manage risks, early detection of issues, deterrence, minimizing costs, maintaining
standardization, preserving third party due diligence information, enhancing transparency,
offering flexibility, and driving compliance.182

5.2 Transparency Reporting Requirements in Extractive Industries

      5.2.1 Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative

The Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI)183 is a "global standard to promote
the open and accountable management of oil, gas and mineral resources."184 The standard
requires implementing countries to disclose certain information regarding the governance
of oil, gas, and mining revenues because poor natural resource governance has frequently
led to corruption and conflict.185 The EITI is an international multi-stakeholder initiative
involving representatives from governments, companies, local civil society groups, and
international NGOs.186 The aim of the EITI is to "strengthen government and company
systems, inform public debate and promote understanding."187

In order to be an EITI member, a country must fulfill the seven requirements of EITI, briefly
summarized as follows:188

     1. Oversight by a multi-stakeholder group

     The multi-stakeholder group must involve the country's government and
     companies as well as "the full, independent, active and effective participation of
     civil society." The multi-stakeholder group must agree to and maintain a work plan
     that includes clear objectives for EITI implementation and a timetable that meets the
     deadlines established by the EITI Board.189

           CHAPTER 9 COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS, RISK ASSESSMENTS, & DUE DILIGENCE

     2. Legal and institutional framework, including allocation of contracts and
     licenses

     An implementing country must disclose information about the legal framework and
     fiscal regime relating to its extractive industries. It must also disclose
     information relating to licences, contracts, beneficial ownership of
     companies, and state participation in the extractive industries. Implementing
     countries must maintain a publicly accessible register for licenses awarded to
     companies involved in the extractive industries.190

     An important development in the EITI Standards after the leaking of the Panama
     Papers in 2016 is the disclosure of beneficial ownership. According to the 2019
     Progress Report, "the 52 EITI countries are making progress towards the January 1,
     2020 deadline for publishing beneficial ownership information for oil, gas
     and mining activities."191 Disclosure of beneficial ownership for all
     companies, regardless of what sectors of the economy they operate in, is
     discussed in more detail in Chapter 5, Section 6.1.2.

     3. Exploration and production

     The third EITI requirement stipulates that implementing countries must report on
     the exploration for and production of oil, gas, and mineral resources.192

     4. Revenue collection

     This requirement necessitates the disclosure of government revenue from the
     extractive industries as well as material payments to the government by companies
     involved in the extractive industries. A credible Independent Administrator must
     then reconcile these revenues and payments. Implementing countries must produce
     their first EITI report within 18 months of becoming a Candidate and must produce
     subsequent reports annually.193

     5. Revenue allocations

     Requirement 5 provides for disclosure of the allocation of revenue generated by the
     extractive industries.194

     6. Social and economic spending

     Implementing countries are required to disclose certain relevant information when
     companies involved in the extractive industries must make material social
     expenditures because of legal or contractual obligations. Implementing countries

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

     must also disclose information relating to quasi-fiscal expenditures and the impact
     of the extractive industries on the economy.195

     7. Outcomes and impact

     Requirement 7 seeks to promote public awareness and understanding of the
     extractive industry data. It also encourages public debate about the effective use of
     resource revenues. This section sets out requirements for the form, accessibility, and
     promotion of the information set out in the EITI reports of implementing countries.
     It also mandates a review of the outcome and impact of EITI implementation.196

Compliance and deadlines for implementing countries

This final requirement sets out in detail the timeframes set out by the EITI Board for the
completion of the various actions required by the EITI, such as the publication of EITI
Reports. 197

When a country pledges to adhere to the EITI standard, it will be deemed a "Candidate"
and have 2.5 years in order to meet all seven EITI requirements. The country will then be
evaluated independently. If the country has met all requirements, it will be deemed
"Compliant," and from then on, it will be re-evaluated every three years.198

As of June 2016, fifty-one countries, including the US and UK, had implemented the EITI
Standard. However, only 31 countries were deemed EITI compliant at that time.199 Canada
has not signed on to become an EITI Candidate, but it is an EITI "supporting country."200
Canada's legislation mandating reporting by the extractive industries, described in
Section 5.5, provides a similar level of reporting to the EITI standards.

5.3 US

In the United States, section 1504 of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act added section 13(q) to the 1934
Securities Exchange Act, which now requires "resource extraction issuers" (all US and foreign
companies engaged in the commercial development of oil, natural gas or minerals) to
include in their annual reports to the SEC, information relating to any payment made by
them, their subsidiary or an entity under their control, to the United States federal
government or any foreign government for the purpose of the commercial development of
oil, natural gas or minerals.201 The reports must specify the type and total amount of such
payments made (i) for each project and (ii) to each government.

           CHAPTER 9 COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS, RISK ASSESSMENTS, & DUE DILIGENCE

The SEC first adopted the rules implementing section 13(q) in August 2012, but the US
District Court for the District of Columbia vacated them in July 2013. The SEC adopted the
revised version of the rules on June 27, 2016.202 Under the rules, resource extraction issuers
are required to disclose payments that are:

          (i) made to further the commercial development (exploration, extraction,
                processing, export or acquisition of a license for any such activity) of
                oil, natural gas or minerals;

          (ii) not de minimis (i.e. any payment, whether made as a single payment
                or a series of related payments, which equals or exceeds $100,000
                during the same fiscal year); and

          (iii) within the types of payments specified in the rules, namely:
                (a) taxes;
                (b) royalties;
                (c) fees (including license fees);
                (d) production entitlements;
                (e) bonuses;
                (f) dividends;
                (g) payments for infrastructure improvements; and
                (h) community and social responsibility payments, if required by
                     law or contract.203

Resource extraction issuers are required to comply with the new SEC rules starting with
their fiscal year ending no earlier than September 30, 2018.204

5.4 UK

The United Kingdom's Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative Multi Stakeholder
Group (MSG) is charged with implementing the EITI in the UK. The UK has no legislation
requiring companies to disclose payments, making the UK EITI a voluntary process. Her
Majesty's Revenue and Customs department can only disclose information from extractive
companies who give their consent. A total of 41 oil and gas companies and 17 mining and
quarrying companies participated in compiling the UK EITI's third report, published in

2018.205 The report included detailed information about revenues received by UK
Government Agencies from extractive companies in 2016. An independent administrator
has been able to reconcile all material differences between extractive industry payments to
and repayments by UK Government agencies in 2016.206

5.5 Canada

In Canada, the Extractive Sector Transparency Measures Act (ESTMA), which came into force
on June 1, 2015, requires specified companies involved in the extractive sector to report
payments made to domestic and foreign governments.207 The stated purpose of the ESTMA
is:

          to implement Canada's international commitments to participate in the
          fight against corruption through the implementation of measures
          applicable to the extractive sector, including measures that enhance
          transparency and measures that impose reporting obligations with respect
          to payments made by entities. Those measures are designed to deter and
          detect corruption including any forms of corruption under any of sections
          119 to 121 and 341 of the Criminal Code and sections 3 and 4 of the Corruption
          of Foreign Public Officials Act.208

The ESTMA applies to a corporation, trust, partnership or other unincorporated
organization that is engaged in the commercial development of oil, gas or minerals, either
directly or through a controlled organization. Each corporate entity is also (1) listed on a
stock exchange in Canada or (2) has a place of business in Canada, does business in Canada
or has assets in Canada, and based on its consolidated financial statements, meets at least
two of the following conditions for at least one of its two most recent financial years: (a) it
has at least $20 million in assets, (b) it has generated at least $40 million in revenue, and (c)
it employs an average of at least 250 employees.209 Thus, an entity that has its shares listed
on any stock exchange in Canada will be subject to the ESTMA reporting requirements even
if it does not do business, does not have assets in Canada or does not meet the size-related
criteria.

An entity must report every payment, whether monetary or in kind, that is made to a single
payee in relation to the commercial development of oil, gas or minerals and that totals, as a
single or multiple payments, CDN$100,000 or more within one of the following categories:

          (1) Taxes (other than consumption taxes and personal income taxes);

          (3) Fees (including rental fees, entry fees and regulatory charges, as well

                as fees or other consideration for licences, permits or concessions);
          (4) Production entitlements;
          (5) Bonuses (including signature, discovery and production bonuses);
          (6) Dividends (other than dividends paid to payees as ordinary

                shareholders); and
          (7) Infrastructure improvement payments.210

The term "payee" in the ESTMA includes:

          (a) any government in Canada or in a foreign state;

          (b) a body that is established by two or more governments; or

          (c) any trust, board, commission, corporation or body or authority that is
                established to exercise or perform, or that exercises or performs, a
                power, duty or function of government for a government referred to
                in paragraph (a) or a body referred to in paragraph (b).211

Reports are due within 150 days after the end of the financial year and must include an
attestation made by a director or officer of the entity, or an independent auditor or
accountant, that the information in the report is true, accurate and complete.212 An entity
must keep records of its payments for a seven-year period from the day on which it provides
the report.213

Non-compliance with the ESTMA and its reporting and record-keeping obligations is
punishable on summary conviction by a fine of up to CDN$250,000.214 As each day of non-
compliance forms a new offence, an unreported payment could result in a multimillion-
dollar liability. However, section 26(b) of the ESTMA creates a defence to liability if the
person or entity "establishes that they exercised due diligence" to prevent the commission
of the offence.

In 2018, the Ministry of Natural Resources released a Guidance215 and Technical Reporting

companies to provide reports with respect to the financial year in progress on that day or
any previous financial year, and the companies are expected to submit their first ESTMA
reports no later than 2017.217 The provisions of the ESTMA also do not apply to the payments
made to Aboriginal governments in Canada before June 1, 2017.218

While the ESTMA has a similar purpose to that of the EITI, it is unlikely that some of the
reporting requirements in the ESTMA meet the more stringent requirements of the EITI. As
mentioned earlier, Canada has never, however, pledged to adhere to EITI. Given that
ESTMA's reporting requirements are mandatory at the firm or entity level, and that EITI is
voluntary and implementing countries often lack domestic enabling legislation making its
requirements enforceable at entity level, in certain respects the ESTMA regime may be more
stringent.

The Canadian government has also published a Corporate Social Responsibility Checklist
for Canadian mining companies.219 The document provides comprehensive guidance to
companies on conducting an initial assessment, developing programs on land access, in-
migration, community health, environmental impacts, cultural heritage, social investment,
land procurement, human rights concerns, and more. The document also outlines how
companies can self-evaluate to determine if their programs are working.

Natural Resources Canada also has a Sale Questions Checklist, available online, to assist
companies in identifying suspicious sales transactions.220 Some questions include: if the
customer fits the usual profile, if the transaction is unusually large or small, and if the mode
of payment is consistent with typical practice.

5.6 Mergers and Acquisitions

Due diligence (DD) is widely recognized as an important factor in any merger or acquisition
(M&A) transaction.221 When conducting anti-corruption due diligence, a core aim is to
determine the extent to which operations and revenues of the target business have been

distorted by bribery and to flag any corruption risks the successor may be liable for.222 A
further aim is to mitigate potential risks and to begin a monitoring program for the target to
ensure the acquisition's compliance with anti-corruption laws.223 Transparency
International outlines the following ten good practice principles for anti-bribery due
diligence in mergers, acquisitions and investments:

          1. The purchaser (or investor) has a public anti-bribery policy;

          2. The purchaser ensures it has an adequate anti-bribery program that is
                compatible with the Business Principles for Countering Bribery or an
                equivalent international code or standard;

          3. Anti-bribery due diligence is considered on a proportionate basis for
                all investments;

          4. The level of anti-bribery due diligence for the transaction is
                commensurate with the bribery risks;

          5. Anti-bribery due diligence starts sufficiently early in the due diligence
                process to allow adequate due diligence to be carried out and for the
                findings to influence the outcome of the negotiations or stimulate
                further review if necessary;

          6. The partners or board provide commitment and oversight to the due
                diligence reviews;

          7. Information gained during the anti-bribery due diligence is passed on
                efficiently and effectively to the company's management once the
                investment has been made;

          8. The purchaser starts to conduct due diligence on a proportionate basis
                immediately after purchase to determine if there is any current bribery
                and if so, takes immediate remedial action;

          9. The purchaser ensures that the target has or adopts an adequate anti-
                bribery program equivalent to its own; and

          10. Bribery detected through due diligence is reported to the
                authorities.224

The six stages to the due diligence process are: (1) initiating the process (2) initial screening
(3) detailed analysis (4) decision (5) post-acquisition due diligence, and (6) post-acquisition
integration and monitoring.225 Transparency International's Anti-Bribery Due Diligence for
Transactions: Guidance for Anti-Bribery Due Diligence in Mergers, Acquisitions and Investments,
also provides the following checklist of 59 indicators to be used as an aid in anti-bribery due
diligence at 14-18:

Failure to conduct adequate due diligence when purchasing a company may result in
charges under anti-corruption legislation. In February 2015, the SEC announced charges
against Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company for violations of the FCPA by subsidiaries in
Kenya and Angola. The SEC Order indicates that Goodyear did not conduct adequate due
diligence when it purchased its Kenyan subsidiary and did not implement adequate anti-
corruption controls after the acquisition:

                                                                                                          819
GLOBAL CORRUPTION

          Goodyear did not detect or prevent these improper payments because it
          failed to conduct adequate due diligence when it acquired Treadsetters, and
          failed to implement adequate FCPA compliance training and controls after
          the acquisition.226

Pre-acquisition due diligence is not always possible, particularly in hostile takeovers. The
DOJ has indicated that companies who are unable to perform adequate pre-acquisition due
diligence may still be rewarded for due diligence efforts conducted post-acquisition.227
Investigating for corruption prior to acquisition is not sufficient to be in compliance with the
FCPA. The DOJ and SEC have indicated they will also evaluate the extent the acquiring
company integrated internal controls into the acquired company.228

The UK MOJ Guidance, in Principle 4 on Due Diligence, states:

          The commercial organization applies due diligence procedures, taking a
          proportionate and risk based approach, in respect of persons who perform
          or will perform services for or on behalf of the organization, in order to
          mitigate identified bribery risks.229

The MOJ encourages companies to carefully consider the bribery risks that transactions pose
to the company and assess the requisite due diligence procedures for ensuring that the
company is aware of the risks and has a plan to deal with any risks that materialize.

5.7 Economic Sanctions and Due Diligence

As discussed in Chapter 5, there is a close connection between anti-corruption efforts and
economic sanctions laws. Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, the European
Union and a number of others have adopted sanctions laws that enable them to target those
involved in acts of corruption.

In October of 2017, Canada amended its sanctions laws to significantly broaden the
circumstances in which the government could implement sanctions against other countries,
organizations, and individuals associated with those countries. These new grounds are (i)
gross and systematic human rights violations in a foreign state and (ii) acts of significant
corruption.

Anti-bribery and economic sanctions due diligence frequently go hand-in-hand when
assessing a proposed transaction such as acquiring another company, making a private
equity investment, engaging in debt financing, or entering into a joint venture with a
business partner. In these circumstances, especially when the operations or assets are located

abroad, it is prudent to carefully scrutinize potential exposure under these sanctions
measures.

At the present time, Canada imposes economic sanctions measures of varying degrees on
activities directly or indirectly involving the following countries as well as individuals or
entities based in such countries:

          Belarus, Burma (Myanmar), Central African Republic, China, Democratic
          Republic of the Congo, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Libya, Mali, Nicaragua, North
          Korea, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, Ukraine,
          Tunisia, Venezuela, Yemen, and Zimbabwe.

Canada also imposes sanctions against listed terrorist entities, including Al-Qaida, ISIL
(Da'esh), and the Taliban. Although in most cases, individuals and entities that are listed
under these sanctions and anti-terrorism measures are located outside Canada, in some
instances these can include persons located in Canada, as is the case regarding the recent
listing of the Proud Boys.

Any involvement of these countries or any person that has been listed or designated under
these sanctions measures (or any entity owned or controlled by them), in proposed
transactions or other activities of the Company should raise a red flag for further
investigation to ensure compliance.

Global Affairs Canada administers these sanctions measures and is responsible for
processing applications for permits to allow activities otherwise prohibited under these
economic sanctions programs to proceed. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the
Canada Border Services are responsible for the enforcement of these sanctions programs.
Violations are subject to criminal prosecution and fines and/or imprisonment.

Given their broad extraterritorial reach, US economic sanctions compliance is frequently an
important part of any due diligence review, even if the principal parties are Canadian or
other companies from non-US jurisdictions. The US Treasury Department's Office of Foreign
Assets Control, along with other US agencies such as the US Department of Justice,
administer and enforce US sanctions on both a civil and criminal basis. They have a
significant enforcement record of settlements and prosecutions involving multi-million
dollar penalties.

      5.7.1 Canadian Sanctions Legislation

The prohibitions and obligations under these economic sanctions generally apply to persons
in Canada and Canadians outside Canada and are set out in the following statutes and
regulations issued thereunder:

      United Nations Act - used by Canada to implement into its domestic law
          economic sanctions mandated by the United Nations Security Council (Central
          African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon,
          Libya, Mali, North Korea, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Yemen, Al-Qaida and
          Taliban, Suppression of Terrorism);

                                                                                                          821
GLOBAL CORRUPTION

      Special Economic Measures Act - autonomous economic sanctions imposed by
          Canada (Belarus, Burma (Myanmar), China, Iran, Libya, Nicaragua, North
          Korea, Russia, South Sudan, Syria, Ukraine, Venezuela, and Zimbabwe);

      Freezing Assets of Corrupt Foreign Officials Act - imposes prohibitions on
          dealings with listed former leaders and senior officials, and their associates
          and family members, suspected of misappropriating state funds or obtaining
          property inappropriately (Ukraine, Tunisia);

      Justice for Victims of Corrupt Foreign Officials Act (Sergei Magnitsky Law) -
          prohibits dealings with listed individuals involved in gross violations of
          internationally recognized human rights or acts of significant corruption
          (Russia, Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, Myanmar, South Sudan); and

      Part II.1 of the Criminal Code - prohibits activities associated with terrorism,
          including dealings involving listed terrorist organizations and entities.

Depending upon the sanctioned country, entity or individual involved, the measures can
restrict the import, export, and transfer of goods and technology, as well as the movement
of people and money, the provision or acquisition of financial or other services, and
investment.

      5.7.2 Monitoring and Reporting Obligations

Certain sanctions measures require banks and other financial services companies to
monitor--i.e., "determine on a continuing basis"--whether they are in possession or control
of property that is owned, held or controlled by or on behalf of a listed person. These include
banks, insurance companies, loan and trust companies as well as entities authorized under
provincial legislation to engage in the business of dealing in securities or to provide portfolio
management or investment counselling services. In certain circumstances, these firms are
also required to report sanctions screening results on a monthly basis to their Canadian or
provincial regulators.

Separately, all persons in Canada and Canadians outside Canada must disclose, without
delay to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police or the Director of the Canadian Security
Intelligence Service: (i) the existence of any property in their possession or control that they
have reason to believe is owned, held or controlled by or on behalf of a listed or designated
person, and (ii) any information about a transaction or proposed transaction in respect of
such property.

      5.7.3 Economic Sanctions Due Diligence

Some key questions that should be addressed for economic sanctions due diligence on
transactions with another company or target include the following:

          1. What measures are in place to ensure that the Target (including all entities
                owned or controlled by it) and its employees, officers, directors and agents
                comply with economic sanctions laws? The Target should provide copies

822  2022
           CHAPTER 9 COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS, RISK ASSESSMENTS, & DUE DILIGENCE

                of all relevant codes of conduct, compliance policies, procedures,
                guidelines and internal controls.

          2. Does the Target engage in any activities involving, directly or indirectly,
                parties located in or connected with countries, individuals or entities that
                are listed, designated or otherwise targeted under economic sanctions
                laws?

          3. What process is in place at the Target for screening individuals and
                entities (whether vendors, customers, suppliers, joint venture partners,
                consultants, brokers, agents or other business partners of the Target, and
                entities that own or control them) against the lists of individuals and
                entities designated or listed under economic sanctions laws?

          4. What is the training process for employees, officers, directors and agents
                on compliance with economic sanctions laws and related policies,
                including frequency of training, most recent sessions, certification, etc.?
                The Target should provide copies of training materials used for these
                purposes.

          5. Have any of the Target's employees, officers, directors or agents ever been
                disciplined, including up to termination, for actual or suspected violations
                of economic sanctions laws or the Company's policies or procedures in
                respect of the same? If so, the Target should provide details.

          6. What are the Target's whistleblowing mechanisms that allow employees,
                officers, directors and agents to report suspected violations of economic
                sanctions and related policies on a confidential and non-retaliatory basis.
                The Target should describe and provide any relevant documentation
                pertaining to all such reports that it has received.

          7. What, if any, suits, actions, reviews, investigations, inquiries, litigation,
                enforcement, penalties or proceedings by or before any governmental
                authority, customer, business partner or any arbitrator, or any internal
                investigations, are there involving the Target or any of its directors,
                officers, employees or agents regarding compliance with economic
                sanctions laws and policies, including any, to the knowledge of the Target,
                that are pending or threatened? The Target should provide copies of any
                reports or other written communication issued to or by the Target,
                including any disclosures to governmental authorities, in respect of actual
                or potential violations of economic sanctions laws or policies, and any
                related investigations and proceedings.

5.8 Internal Investigation of Corruption

When senior officials or the board of a company suspect that the company may have been
involved in corruption in one or more of its transactions, they may choose to conduct an
internal investigation. As noted in Chapter 6 (on investigation and prosecution of
corruption), there are various reasons to conduct an internal investigation:

                                                                                                          823
GLOBAL CORRUPTION

      To convince enforcement bodies to use prosecutorial discretion not to bring charges;

      To gather evidence and prepare a defence or negotiation strategy for prosecutions,
          enforcement actions and/or litigation with shareholders;

      To fulfill management's fiduciary duty to the company's shareholders and satisfy
          shareholder concerns;

      To assess the effectiveness of internal accounting procedures.

To the extent that the internal investigation results will be handed over to the relevant
enforcement body as part of a company's attempts to negotiate a favourable resolution with
the prosecutor, it is strongly advisable to hire an experienced and respected external lawyer
to conduct or manage the internal investigation. An external counsel's investigation will be
given far greater credibility by the relevant law enforcement agencies than a similar
investigation conducted by in-house counsel or the company's regular external counsel.

Chapter 6, Section 4.2 sets out five basic steps to follow when counsel is advising the board
on undertaking an internal investigation in cases of alleged corruption.

6. POTENTIAL LIABILITY OF LAWYERS

Lawyers may be liable civilly, criminally or administratively for their acts or omissions
concerning a client's business activities. Criminal provisions on conspiracy, aiding, abetting,
and counselling apply to lawyers assisting their clients in illegal transactions. Accessory
liability is also applicable in private law actions in tort and contract.230 Furthermore, legal
malpractice is a tort available to individuals injured by the acts or omissions of their lawyers.
Civil liability may arise for economic loss due to a lawyer's intentional or negligent
involvement in corrupt transactions. Lastly, regulatory agencies, such as securities
commissions, of other securities regulators have a variety of possible responses for lawyers'
participation in regulatory violations related to corrupt transactions that include: a warning
or caution, an imposition of conditions on the practitioners' continued work in the field, an
order to resign or a fine for violation of an applicable regulatory rule.

6.1 Criminal Liability

As discussed in Chapter 3, the US, UK, and Canada have criminal provisions that could
result in a lawyer being criminally liable for membership or participation in a conspiracy to
commit an offence of corruption for aiding, abetting or counselling a crime committed by a
client. For instance, when the former Nigerian State governor James Ibori pleaded guilty in
the United Kingdom to conspiracy to defraud and money-laundering offences, his London
solicitor Bhadresh Gohil was also convicted of money laundering. To divert funds from the
sale of shares in a state-owned telecommunications company, Ibori's lawyer established

Africa Development Finance consulting company. Since both the consultancy and the
solicitor charged fees for fictitious services, $37 million in proceeds were diverted to them.

The judge, who sentenced Mr. Gohil to 10 years of imprisonment, described him as the
architect of this scheme.231

6.2 Accessory Liability in Civil Actions

Accessory or assistance liability in tort law may result in civil liability for lawyers who assist
clients in committing a tort in relation to a corrupt transaction.232 The client and lawyer are
referred to as joint tortfeasors. This concept originated alongside accessory liability in
criminal proceedings, but the criminal and civil actions have since diverged.233 Accessory
liability is a subset of joint tortfeasor law and is divided into its own subsets.234 This section
provides only a brief overview of the topic.

      6.2.1 US

A leading case in the US on accessory liability is Halberstam v Welch.235 The US Supreme
Court described it as being a "comprehensive opinion on the subject."236 Other leading cases
applying this doctrine tend to be statutory securities cases.237 Generally, accessory liability
in the US requires that the accessory "knows that the other's conduct constitutes a breach of
duty and gives substantial assistance or encouragement to the other."238

      6.2.2 UK

A leading UK case, Sea Shephard UK v Fish & Fish Ltd, sets out the test for finding a defendant
liable as a joint tortfeasor where the defendant:

          (1) Has assisted in the commission of the tort by another person;
          (2) The tort is pursuant to a common design; and

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

          (3) An act is done that is tortious.239

Lord Sumpton noted:

          In both England and the United States, the principles [of joint
          tortfeasorship] have been worked out mainly in the context of allegations of
          accessory liability for the tortious infringement of intellectual property
          rights. 240

Civil law has tended to require procurement as an element to establish accessory liability.241
In CBS Songs v Amstrad Consumer Electronics plc, a UK Court found that procurement was
more than merely "inducement, incitement, or persuasion." Advice alone would not result
in a finding of accessory liability; more active participation would be required.242

      6.2.3 Canada

Canadian courts have adopted and applied the English definition of joint tortfeasors. They
have not defined the minimum "degree of participation" required for the secondary
tortfeasor to be liable for the primary tort.243 However, Canadian courts have said that a
"concerted action to a common end"244 is required. Although this has not been defined by
the courts either, the statement suggests that some act must be committed to put the tort in
motion or to substantially assist in its commission, as it did in England. Additionally, a new
nominate tort based on the failure to exercise human rights due diligence may result in civil
liability for lawyers who assist clients in committing a tort in relation to a corrupt
transaction.245 This would apply if the corrupt transaction involves the violation of human
rights.

6.3 Tort of Legal Malpractice

Legal malpractice actions are an option for dissatisfied clients or third parties seeking private
redress for harm attributable to a lawyer's violation of his or her duties to a client or the legal
profession.246 The tort may occur when a lawyer is professionally negligent, breaches a
contract and/or breaches his or her fiduciary duty to a client. Legal malpractice requires a

harmed party with standing to show that malpractice occurred, and that as a result of that
malpractice, the harmed party suffered damages.247 In doing so, the harmed party must
show that but for the lawyer's malpractice, the harm would not have occurred or would
have been less. As stated in Hummer v Pulley, Watson, King & Lischer, PA, "[i]n a legal
malpractice case, a plaintiff is required to prove that he would not have suffered the harm
alleged absent the negligence of his attorney."248

Professional negligence is a common action in the category of legal malpractice. The UK case
Ross v Cauters states that solicitors owe a duty of care to their clients and to third parties who
could reasonably be expected to suffer loss or damage.249 This has generally been accepted
in the US and Canada. This duty could apply to a lawyer who negligently advises that the
client's conduct does not constitute an offence of corruption when in fact, it does, or that a
client's anti-corruption compliance program and its implementation are adequate, when
they clearly are not. Malpractice actions may also be possible if a lawyer fails to disclose the
actual or planned corrupt conduct of an employee, agent or officer to more senior officers or
the board of directors. In-house counsel in particular may have clauses in their employment
contracts requiring certain actions if they encounter corruption in the organization. Failure
to act in the way outlined in their employment contract on uncovering corruption may result
in a breach of contract claim against the lawyer. The Supreme Court of Canada in Central
Trust Co v Rafuse250 held that the standard of care for solicitors is that of "the reasonably
competent solicitor, ordinarily competent solicitor and the ordinarily prudent solicitor."251
This follows the English authorities, which state that the standard of care is one of
"reasonable competence and diligence."252

shareholders to continue their action against the lawyer defendant.

      6.4.2 UK

In the UK, Zambia's Attorney General launched a private law claim against two UK lawyers
and their firms for their participation in "allegedly giving dishonest assistance in the
misappropriation" of public funds.254 This claim was for "dishonest assistance" and
conspiring in corrupt acts; it was not a claim for professional negligence. The Attorney
General alleged that the lawyers had assisted the former president of Zambia, Frederick
Chiluba, in corrupt acts and the misappropriation of public funds. The Attorney General of
Zambia was successful at the lower court level, but on appeal the action failed because the
court found that the lawyers had not crossed the line from incompetence to dishonesty.255
The test applied is known as the "fool or knave test" and is a difficult test to meet when
trying to prove legal malpractice. Despite the Court of Appeals decision, Chiluba's lawyer,
Mohammed Iqbal Meer, was suspended from the practice of law for three years for failure
to uphold professional standards.256

In contrast, in the Kuwaiti Investment Organization (KIO) case, Spanish attorney Juan Jose
Folchi Bonafonte, was held civilly liable for assisting to divert funds from the KIO's
subsidiary, Grupo Torras (GT). Sheikh Fahad, a member of the Kuwaiti royal family of Al-
Sabah and the chairman of the KIO between 1984 and 1992, made a number of questionable
investments causing a loss of $4 billion to the KIO, of which $1.2 billion were attributable to
fraud, embezzlement, and misappropriation.257 The England and Wales Court of Appeal
commented on Mr. Folchi's involvement in this matter as a lawyer in the following manner:

          The [trial] judge was not prepared to hold that Mr Folchi was a conspirator.
          But his findings of fact about what Mr. Folchi did know, or shut his eyes to,
          take his conclusion out of the sphere of hypothesis. The assistance that Mr.
          Folchi gave in all the transactions was crucial and without it they could not
          have taken place as they did. He was just as much a linchpin in giving
          dishonest assistance as he would have been if he was a conspirator. It was
          the obvious duty of an honest lawyer to make more enquiries as to why
          very large sums of money were being dealt with in highly questionable
          ways, and to stop the transactions if he did not receive satisfactory
          explanations. Mr. Folchi repeatedly failed in his duty and in consequence
          GT suffered losses.258

           CHAPTER 9 COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS, RISK ASSESSMENTS, & DUE DILIGENCE

      6.4.3 Canada

The common law in Canada provides some limited avenues of redress against lawyers for
aggrieved investors. Lawyers may be liable to their corporate clients for misrepresentations
or negligence. As stated by Mark Gillen:

          If the client is found liable for a misrepresentation in the prospectus, the
          client could sue the lawyer for negligent advice or assistance in the
          preparation of the prospectus. The lawyer may also have a duty to the
          public requiring the lawyer to discourage the client from distributing
          securities under a misleading prospectus and possibly requiring the lawyer
          to disclose, or "blow the whistle", where a client persists with the use of a
          misleading prospectus.259

However, often a corporation is unable or unwilling to pursue its lawyers for unlawful or
negligent acts or omissions, particularly if the board of directors is involved in them.
Shareholders who wish to pursue corporate lawyers for the torts committed against the
company have an additional hurdle in seeking to hold the corporate lawyer liable; they must
first establish that a duty of care is owed by the corporate lawyer to the shareholder, rather
than just to the corporate client. After establishing the duty of care, they must show that the
lawyer breached that duty.

This duty of care is difficult to establish because lawyers owe an overriding duty to their
client, and any duty to a third party may come into conflict with their duty to their client.
Policy reasons, such as the fear of liability to an indeterminate class for an indeterminate
amount, may prevent the court from finding a duty to shareholders. Even if the duty is
established, Canadian courts rarely find a breach of the duty of care on the part of lawyers.
Generally, the court finds that the lawyer took reasonable care to fulfill the duty or that the
circumstances did not give rise to reasonable suspicion, which would require increased due
diligence on the part of the lawyer.

In CC&L Dedicated Enterprise Fund v Fisherman, an Ontario court found that "a prima facie
duty of care exists when a lawyer makes representations to the investing public for the
purpose of furthering the investments in their client."260 In Filipovic v Upshall, the Court
found that the lawyer "stood in a sufficient relationship of proximity with the plaintiffs to
engender a duty of care on their part."261 In Filipovic, the shareholders confirmed the
corporate solicitors' appointments to the corporation, knew the solicitors from previous
dealings, and wrote their cheques directly to the solicitors on the instructions of the
promoters of the investment. The court found that the duty of care "flowed through the
company to the shareholders, but did not arise independent of the company itself."262
However, in Filipovic, the court found that the solicitors discharged their duty in a

"reasonably competent and professional manner."263 In coming to this decision, the court
considered the fact that the solicitors had worked with the principals before with no history
of dishonesty and that the solicitors took instructions from the principals of the company,
who would reasonably have the authority claimed. The court also found a lack of
circumstances that would reasonably raise the solicitors' suspicions.

                       A Conflict of Laws Approach for a New Nominate Tort

                                                    by Joannie Fu

                                          JD University of Victoria 2021

 The current state of law and interaction with various private international law factors
 demonstrate the imperative need for a new nominate tort, which would provide better
 consolidation and efficacy for plaintiff-victims bringing forward a claim against a
 Canadian legal entity, including lawyers who assist clients in committing a tort in relation
 to a corrupt transaction.264

 The biggest hurdle to overcome in private international law without the creation of a new
 nominate tort is choice of law. Choice of law considers which jurisdiction's law would be
 applied. In tort cases, the principle lex loci delicti would be applied, or "law of the place of
 the wrong". This may present difficulties for the claimant, especially if the law of the place
 of the wrong may be unfavourable towards them. However, lex loci delicti is not absolute
 in the international realm for tortious cases. There is a narrow door open for lex fori, or
 the "law of the forum", in an international context per Tolofson v Jensen; Lucas (Litigation
 Guardian of) v Gagnon.265 In writing for the majority, Justice La Forest notes that lex loci
 delicti is the governing law within Canada, however in the context of international claims
 this "could give rise to injustice" thus "in certain circumstances [La Forest] is not averse
 to retaining a discretion in the court to apply [Canada's] own law to deal with such
 circumstances".266 Through that narrow door of discretion, the common-law may be
 pushed. Thus, a policy argument would be that because a Canadian company is
 conducting business abroad, there should be a corresponding application of Canadian
 values abroad. It would be a poor reflection of Canada's public image if its corporations
 and the lawyers working for them are not held liable for flagrant violations of human
 rights. Another way to impose responsibility is to advance an argument that the CORE
 and CUSMA imposed a legal duty on Canadian legal entities to act with due diligence
 when conducting activities abroad. Thus, a local defendant, who could potentially be a

263 Ibid at para 67.
264 Recent jurisprudence suggests that there is a move towards holding Canadian entities responsible
for actions committed abroad: see for example, Garcia v Tahoe Resources Inc, 2017 BCCA 39. A lawyer
who was an accessory in assisting in the commitment of a tort abroad could potentially also be held
liable.

266 Ibid.

           CHAPTER 9 COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS, RISK ASSESSMENTS, & DUE DILIGENCE

 corporate lawyer, would become a "concurrent tortfeasor" through the lack of human
 rights due diligence.267 Thus, even without a new nominate tort based on customary
 international law (CIL), there are strong arguments that choice of law should be lex fori.

 If actual evidence can be found that the local defendant conspired, facilitated, or arranged
 the violation abroad, the plaintiff could use lex loci delicti and make an argument that the
 wrong occurred in Canada. In this case, the corporate lawyer would become a "joint
 tortfeasor" in principal violation or vicariously liable.268 The Court may focus on the
 actions of a lawyer based in Canada through an analysis of its actions and whether they
 were sufficiently diligent in avoiding the violation of human rights. For example, using
 Moran v Pyle National,269 a victim could argue that the violation of human rights can occur
 at the place of acting, and the corporate lawyer acted in British Columbia by facilitating
 the violation of human rights abroad. Establishing a standard of care to be imposed on
 Canadian legal entities that operate abroad (and the lawyers that help facilitate
 operations) creates a causative link. Subsequently, it would support the approach of lex
 loci delicti, as the wrong can be placed in British Columbia. Additionally, if the plaintiffs
 can establish a duty of due diligence that establishes a legal standard of care, they would
 have a stronger argument to apply Canadian law, as the tort occurred in a failure to
 exercise the due diligence required by Canadian law.270

 Jurisdiction simpliciter considers whether the laws of a particular jurisdiction allow the
 jurisdiction to hear the case. As an example, in British Columbia, sections 3 and 10 of the
 Court Jurisdiction Proceedings and Transfer Act (CJPTA) address the territorial competence
 of a court to hear a case, relying on a real and substantial connection between the facts
 and British Columbia. The factor of jurisdiction simpliciter would be simple to fulfill, as the
 tort addresses actions of Canadian entities and the laws of Canada would allow the case
 to be heard as there is a real and substantial connection.

 Forum non conveniens considers whether a more convenient forum exists elsewhere. This
 is a matter of discretion and requires courts to consider and conclude whether a more
 appropriate jurisdiction exists elsewhere. This may be a more difficult area for plaintiffs
 to overcome, as there may be another equally competent jurisdiction with an equally
 strong real and substantial connection. For example, in Bil'in (Village Council) v Green Park

267 The case of Rutter v Allen, 2012 BCSC 135, might be considered by way of analogy. In this case, a
vehicular chain collision involving multiple defendants happened resulting in the injury of the
plaintiff. Applying the law to the facts of a corporation who was negligent, it may be argued that the
lack of due diligence (arguably a duty imposed by the CORE) caused the injuries abroad, thus, the
Canadian legal entity should be included as a concurrent tortfeasor. A causal link must also be
established.
268 A plaintiff may argue that the Canadian legal entity was either vicariously liable (if their employees
caused the harm as the facts illustrate in Garcia v Tahoe Resources Inc, 2017 BCCA 39) or that the
Canadian legal entity was acting in concert with another joint tortfeasor to harm the plaintiff.
269 Moran v Pyle National (Canada) Ltd., [1975] 1 SCR 393.
270 Note that an issue the plaintiff may run into is The Queen v Saskatchewan Wheat Pool, [1983] 1 SCR
205, which rejected the tort of breach of statutory duty. Thus, this signals the imperative need for a
new nominate tort to be created and outlined by the Courts.

                                                                                                          831
GLOBAL CORRUPTION

 International Ltd.,271 the village of Bil'in filed a civil action in Canada against the Canadian
 companies and their director for building new neighbourhoods on Bil'in's land. However,
 the Quebec Superior Court dismissed the case on the grounds of forum non conveniens.
 Nevertheless, the case was significant in that, for the first time in Canada, a court found
 that a war crime can constitute a civil wrong in Canadian domestic law.272 However, as
 the recent case Garcia suggests, forum non conveniens can be overcome by plaintiffs if they
 can demonstrate that there is a real risk that the alternate forum cannot provide justice.

 Another consideration is whether the case would fall under provincial or federal
 jurisdiction. The case would likely fall under provincial jurisdiction per section 92(13) of
 the Constitution.273 While the creation of the CORE suggests that there is a federal system
 of regulation in relation to certain circumstances, the tort would likely fall under
 provincial powers because the nature of the claims would fall under property and civil
 rights. Nevertheless, the division of powers may be tricky to navigate especially with the
 overlap of issues. If Bill S-211274 were passed as legislation, although it falls under federal
 jurisdiction, it would still be relevant for the purposes of claims as it can be used to
 establish a legal duty of due diligence.

 Finally, another consideration would be whether there is a real and substantial connection
 with the forum. In BC, one would have to turn to the CJPTA, which states that a real and
 substantial connection is presumed if it concerns a tort committed in BC or if it concerns
 a business carried on in BC or if the ordinary residence of the business is in BC.275 There
 would be a strong argument that because the business was carried on BC and because
 they were subject to CIL, there was a real and substantial connection. A lawyer who
 commits a tort extraterritorially may be held responsible if it can be established that based
 on CIL there was a legal duty of due diligence in ensuring there are no violations of
 human rights, establishing a standard of care and thus creating a causative link between
 the lawyer's action (or lack thereof) within the province of BC.

6.6 Lawyers' Civil Liability Under Securities Acts

Lawyers' liability under securities legislation is important in the corruption context because
corporate lawyers often work with publicly traded corporations. In addition, the SEC is a
major enforcer of the FCPA. Violations of anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws may result
in additional violations of securities regulations, as the corporation may fail to disclose
accurately their financial position and potential liabilities to the financial market. An
investor who purchases a share shortly before a company is investigated, for or charged
with corruption offences, could see the value of their investment fall drastically in a short
period due to negative public perception of the company or because of the massive fines

corruption and bribery may have a significant impact on the value of a company's shares,
securities law is applicable in the anti-corruption context.276

1. INTRODUCTION

How members of the public perceive the ethical conduct of elected officials, members of the
executive, and members of the public service plays an important role in whether they trust
their government. High levels of trust lead to greater civic engagement, which tends to give
rise to better social and economic outcomes within a society.1 This is, of course, all desirable.
Corruption, on the other hand, has the opposite effect. When public sector actors engage in
corrupt behaviour it gives rise to greater cynicism, which leads to less trust and less civic
engagement.2 It is for these simple reasons that we have seen countries all over the world
adopt standards and rules to help guide the ethical conduct of their public officials. This
chapter offers an overview of those standards and rules. In order to maintain a manageable
scope, focus will be placed almost exclusively on elected officials and the regimes that have
developed in relation thereto at the national levels in the United States, United Kingdom,
and Canada.

The chapter is divided into four parts. The first part offers an introduction to the important
role that public sector ethics fulfill in the broader global discourse around corruption. This
includes a look at how public sector ethics has been addressed at the international level as
part of ongoing efforts to curtail conduct that is damaging to economic development and
prosperity. The second part begins by offering a comparative introduction to the different
approaches to standard setting that these regimes have taken, focusing attention on the
institutional frameworks in place at the national levels in the US, UK, and Canada. The third
part offers a comprehensive introduction to the various principles and rules of ethical
conduct, including their rationale and how they operate. The final part looks at
accountability, oversight and enforcement of these rules, including an overview of the
importance of transparency and public reporting, as well as the role that the criminal law
plays in public sector anti-corruption frameworks. Although the US, UK, and Canada each
also have sub-national public sector ethics laws and rules, those regimes are not discussed
in this chapter.

1.1 Conceptualizing Political Corruption

Before addressing political corruption within our broader dialogue about global corruption,
it is important to first acknowledge the diversity of governance approaches that exist across
nations. From dictatorships to monarchies to representative democracies, these approaches
vary in significant ways that make it impossible to treat political corruption as a conceptual
monolith. To say something coherent about the topic then, a decision about how we think
we can recognize if public sector officials are engaging in corrupt practices ought to be made
at the outset.

                                   CHAPTER 10 PUBLIC OFFICIALS & CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

Public sector officials spend a great deal of time and energy determining how to balance
competing interests. Interests must of course be balanced when making policy decisions, but
also when doing the everyday work of simply managing different relationships. It is in the
tangled web of relationships and interests that the opportunity for corruption finds its home.
It is also in this web that a public official can get caught up in helping others and lose sight
of their professional duty to serve the broader public interest. Despite the complexity of
public service, a useful conceptualization of political corruption must be able to establish a
bright line between acting in the public interest and acting in a manner that improperly
furthers private interests to the detriment of the public interest.

To help maintain clarity throughout this chapter, I will rely on a conceptual framework for
public sector corruption that is inspired by Mark Philp's work and consists of meeting the
following criteria:

          1) A public official,

          2) in violation of the trust placed in them by the public,

          3) and in a manner that harms the public interest,

          4) engages in conduct that exploits the office (including access and
                opportunities that they are afforded by virtue of holding that office) for clear
                personal or private gain in a way that runs contrary to the accepted rules
                and standards for the conduct of public officials within that political culture,

          5) so as to benefit themselves or a third party by providing them with access
                to a good, service or opportunity (i.e., a benefit) they would not otherwise
                have access to.3

While the above framework is broad enough to capture any number of public sector actors,
from elected officials to political appointees to public servants, this chapter is limited to
elected officials. There are many similarities in the kinds of behaviours that are prohibited
by the anti-corruption regimes in the US, UK, and Canada, but their different political
cultures have also given rise to marked differences in their regulatory approaches.
Understanding these differences will, in part, require a deeper analysis of what is meant by
both "public interest" and the concepts of personal and/or private gain.

      1.1.1 The Important Role of Political Culture

Anti-corruption regimes do not exist in a vacuum. The political culture within a given state
will have a profound effect on when and why a regime emerges, how it develops, and
whether it is adhered to. Research suggests that anti-corruption measures are more effective
where political actors share a common political culture.4 To identify or describe a political

                                                                                                          837

culture then, we look for shared political attitudes, values, standards and behaviours. We
see these elements emerge from traditions, conventions, and customs that have developed
over time and have been more or less adhered to, but also from decisions that are made
about the design and structure of anti-corruption institutions. A political culture of `ethics
as compliance' might emerge, for example, if an anti-corruption regime requires ongoing
and robust compliance aggressively enforced by independent oversight and auditing.

Another important factor in shaping political culture is the socio-economic reality of who
holds elected office. As will be explored throughout this chapter, it can be difficult to design
anti-corruption rules that are capable of effectively dissuading corruption from all public
officials equally, including those who had previously accumulated immense personal
wealth prior to serving in public office. Although it would be nice if every person who runs
for elected office does so because they have a genuine desire to represent and serve others,
it is impossible to separate holding elected office from holding a seat of political power.
Sometimes wealth and power can intersect in a manner that challenges established political
cultures and anti-corruption measures. As will become evident, the experience of the United
States' former President Donald Trump is instructive in this regard.

Finally, it is important to say something about the role that public perception and
engagement play in shaping political culture. Recall that the concept of public interest is
integral to the conceptual framework for identifying public sector corruption that was
presented above. It is because of how public interest and expectations have evolved that the
demand for broader and more varied anti-corruption regimes has emerged. This evolution
in understanding and expectation has inspired an evolution in language as well. The public
has come to expect that elected officials will do more than merely avoid corrupt practices,
but that they will act ethically and honourably. It is for this reason that the more inclusive
language of "government ethics," "public sector ethics" and "conflicts of interest" have
come to be used in place of the language of "anti-corruption" in the political realm. This is
not to say that language of corruption is not used, but that it is more commonplace in the
context of criminal anti-corruption laws than in the broader public sector regimes that deal
with ethics and conflicts of interest. Each of the above expressions will be used throughout
this chapter.

      1.1.2 Role of Public Perception and Engagement

The avoidance of conflicts of interest has become the cornerstone of the modern anti-
corruption regimes that will be considered in this chapter. When framed broadly, the
concept of a conflict of interest can not only encompass the most egregious of self-dealing,
but also the subtlest and even accidental mismanagement of public perception and
expectation. Whereas the mere perception of a conflict of interest might once have been
considered something worth considering for decision-makers, it is now treated almost by
default as though it is a complete perversion of judgment for a public official to even allow
themselves inadvertently to be in a position where they are perceived to have a conflict of
interest. If the public merely perceives that an elected official is in a conflict of interest,
whether or not they actually are, their ability to act in the public interest is called into
question. The difference between perceived, apparent and real conflicts of interest will be
explored in greater depth below.

1.2 International Standards

The international community has come to accept that ethical public sector governance is an
important contributor to global economic development and prosperity. Various
international bodies have taken steps to study, monitor, and provide guidance on the impact
that public sector corruption can have, and to provide general advice on how to effectively
manage conflicts of interest. The two most widely recognized international bodies to have
taken up this work are the United Nations (UN) and the Organization for Economic Co-
operation and Development (OECD). Both the UN and OECD have produced robust
guidance documents that serve as resources for governments looking to implement or
improve public sector anti-corruption measures. The World Bank Institute (WBI) and
Transparency International (TI), the latter being a non-governmental organization that
monitors and evaluates the effectiveness of anti-corruption regimes, have also recognized
the important role public sector leadership plays in fostering the public trust needed for
economic prosperity. The work of these four organizations will be discussed briefly.

      1.2.1 UNCAC

The adoption of the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC)5 in October
2003, and its subsequent emphasis on providing guidance and oversight placed the UN at
the forefront of anti-corruption initiatives. As explained in-depth in Chapters 2 and 3, Article
15 outlines criminalization requirements and law enforcement requirements that apply to
the bribery of foreign officials.

Articles 7 and 8 also relate to public officials, but do not require member states to pass
criminal laws. Instead, they require that each State Party commit to taking various other
actions "in accordance with the fundamental principles of its legal system."6 Article 7
stipulates that states shall apply principles of equity and merit when hiring in the public
sector. They will also support the adequate training of employees who are in positions that
are vulnerable to corruption;7 promote adequate remuneration and pay scales;8 enhance
transparency in the funding of candidates for public office;9 adopt systems that prevent
conflicts of interests;10 promote education to enhance public sector awareness about the risks
of corruption;11 and so forth.

Article 8 stipulates that each signatory state shall promote ethical standards and endeavour
to adopt codes of conduct that enhance "integrity, honesty and responsibility among its
public officials,"12 including by facilitating the reporting of corruption to an appropriate

authority. State Parties should also, where appropriate, require public officials to declare
their outside employment and other activities, investments they hold, and any assets or gifts
they receive--particularly those from which a conflict of interest pertaining to their role as
a public official may result--to an appropriate authority.13

UNCAC is complemented by a Legislative Guide (the Guide) to assist states that are seeking
to pass laws to help implement the Convention.14 The Guide provides helpful tips, including
that states are more likely to receive better buy-in from public officials if they develop rules
"through a process of consultation rather than a top-to-bottom approach."15 States might
consider attaching these rules to employment contracts and they are also encouraged to
engage in regular initiatives to raise awareness about what the rules are and how they
apply. 16

In addition to the above, the Guide directly addresses the various declarations to appropriate
authorities that UNCAC recommends under Article 8, and makes the important point that
they should be considered minimum disclosure requirements.17 The clear inference is that
states are encouraged to go above and beyond the minimum recommendations that are put
forth in UNCAC.

      1.2.2 OECD

The United Nations General Assembly has granted what is called "observer status" to a
number of international organizations, entities, and non-member states. Having this status
allows those entities to participate in some limited way in the work of the General Assembly.
The OECD is one such international organization that has been granted official observer
status and accordingly, has been able to contribute to the work of the UN. The OECD is a
policy-focused organization and works alongside other entities to help establish evidence-
based standards and solutions to a variety of social, economic, and environmental issues.
The OECD has been particularly active over the past two decades with its work on public
sector trust and integrity.

The OECD's major work in this area began to gain public attention in 1998 with the issuing
of its Recommendation on Improving Ethical Conduct in the Public Service (1998
Recommendation).18 This 1998 Recommendation includes twelve principles related to
managing ethics in the public service that could be used by all governments to support them
in their review of their own ethics management systems. Included in those twelve principles

is that: ethical standards should be clear and reflected in a country's legal framework(s);
guidance should be available to public servants and they should know their rights and
obligations when exposing wrongdoing; the political class should demonstrate its
commitment to ethical conduct in order to help reinforce the ethical conduct of public
servants; and management must be committed to and supported by adequate accountability
mechanisms. Each principle was developed and agreed upon by OECD Member countries,
who were themselves encouraged to commit to a regular review of the policies, procedures,
practices, and institutions they had in place to "encourage high standards of conduct and
prevent misconduct as well as counter corruption."19

The 1998 Recommendation was followed by an implementation report in 2000, called Trust
in Government: Ethics Measures in OECD Countries20 (Trust in Government). Trust in
Government is based on a survey of 29 OECD countries and described, in part, how they had
implemented the 1998 Recommendation. Further goals of the Trust in Government report
were to:

           Provide a comprehensive database from all Member countries for analysis;

           Identify promising practices - what works and how, in respective national
                environments; and

           Provide a framework for assessment.21

The robust report provides a broad comparative analysis that helped identify and uncover
similarities and differences in principles and practices across jurisdictions. From this
information, summaries of best practices were established, including: how to state and
communicate core values; how to establish and implement measures focused on prevention;
ways to punish or even criminalize misconduct; what sort of information ought to be
publicly disclosed by whom and how often; how to establish reporting mechanisms; and
how to ensure consistency in policy and application.22

Another comprehensive report in 2003, called Managing Conflict of Interest in the Public
Service: OECD Guidelines and Country Experiences23 (Managing Conflict of Interest), followed
Trust in Government. Recall here that UNCAC was adopted in 2003. Managing Conflict of
Interest offers a comparative survey of OECD member countries and again demonstrates a
wide variety of approaches taken to prevent conflicts of interest, including proactive
education; regulation and sanctions (criminal, administrative and/or monetary penalties);
and emphasizing values and personal responsibility. Furthermore, there are a wide variety
of systems of government. In turn, this means that different approaches were adopted,
rather than a sole approach which might not map well across all settings.

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

Managing Conflict of Interest highlighted that while some countries are tackling the problem
of public sector corruption in the midst of economies that are also in transition, others may
be more stable with decentralized governments, and some may even be able to advance
coherent federal frameworks or leverage the use of regulations and sanctions that can be
updated regularly in their anti-corruption efforts. By drawing out these different
categorizations, the report provides more useful information for individual readers (i.e.,
countries) who find themselves in one of those categories. It is easier to see similarities and
to recognize learning opportunities with this greater contextualization of the survey results
that had been gathered.

In order to continue the move towards developing more practical reports and resources to
assist countries with actually enhancing their public sector ethics infrastructure, the OECD
published Managing Conflicts of Interest in the Public Service: A Toolkit (Toolkit)24 in 2005. This
toolkit provides "a set of practical solutions for developing and implementing ways to
manage conflicts of interest in accordance with the OECD Guidelines for Managing Conflict
of Interest in the Public Service."25 Among these practical solutions were definitions,
diagrams, and checklists for identifying at-risk areas. The Toolkit also provides draft ethics
codes that include, among other things, definitions of a conflict of interest, and sample rules
and procedures related to the acceptance of gifts and gratuities, the registration of personal
assets, and the implementation of public disclosure protocols. Finally, there is a section that
emphasizes the importance of having policies and procedures in place to protect
whistleblowers.

The publication of the Toolkit was later complemented by a collaborative effort between the
OECD and the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The two organizations published a
summary report of the proceedings of the 5th Regional Seminar on Making International
Anti-Corruption Standards Operational, entitled Managing Conflict of Interest: Frameworks,
Tools, and Instruments for Preventing, Detecting, and Managing Conflict of Interest.26 One goal of
the Seminar report is to emphasize that the OECD also supports the efforts of Asian and
Pacific countries to fight corruption27--an aspect that received little attention in the OECD's
earlier work. Building off of the earlier Toolkit's theme, the Seminar report provides
summaries and analysis of how conflicts of interest are managed in specific countries.28

The survey work done by the OECD and the Toolkit and reports it produced are very likely
the most important international documents in relation to establishing the role that public
sector ethics and accountability play in creating strong and healthy economies. This work

drove international engagement on public sector ethics until the OECD adopted a new
recommendation on public integrity in 2017.29 The OECD Recommendation of the Council on
Public Integrity (2017 Recommendation) is framed broadly as a "strategy against
corruption"30 and accordingly leverages robust data about corruption while using
infographics to help explain why public integrity continues to be important in the context of
corruption. The new 2017 Recommendation focuses increased attention on how vulnerable
public procurement, public infrastructure projects, and policy-making can be to corruption
and corrupt practices. It argues that actions to prevent public corruption must look beyond
government and include measures aimed at educating individuals and dissuading
corruption in the private sector as well.

One of the most important areas of emphasis in the 2017 Recommendation is the
conceptualization of corruption as more than bribery. Corruption is known to include
influence peddling, embezzlement of public property, use of confidential information, and
abuse of power. Moving beyond a narrow understanding of corruption and trying to gain a
broader sense of the full complexity of where and how corruption can emerge is imperative.
To do this, transparency may not be enough; greater scrutiny and accountability
mechanisms may also be needed. Public integrity requires a coherent and comprehensive
integrity system, a culture of public integrity, and effective accountability mechanisms.31 To
that end, the OECD offers thirteen individual principles or recommendations. Among other
areas, the recommendations focus on investing in and encouraging political and managerial
commitments to integrity; establishing high standards of conduct for public officials;
establishing clear institutional responsibilities; promoting a "whole-of-society" culture of
public integrity; promoting a merit-based, professional public sector; and ensuring that
enforcement mechanisms are appropriate and effective.

With the new recommendations published, the OECD has become relentless in promoting
and encouraging their uptake by states. Their 2020 Public Integrity Handbook (Handbook)32
acknowledges a need for greater clarity about how implementation of the thirteen principles
might actually manifest. The Handbook explains the thirteen principles in greater depth and
provides cross-sectoral "guidance to public officials and integrity practitioners, as well as to
companies, civil society organizations and individuals."33 Renewed emphasis is placed on
the importance of merit-based employment in the public service (as opposed to patronage
hiring), the government's role in providing guidance to the private sector in relation to
corruption, the importance of civil society groups, and the role of citizens in helping to
uphold public integrity values.34 The Handbook's guidance is highly practical, even
discussing risk management processes and further emphasizing the value of enforcement

systems "to ensure real accountability for integrity violations."35 Given the questionable
state of public sector ethics in one of the world's most developed economies (i.e., the US) at
the time this Handbook was published, the emphasis on enforcement could have been
expected in light of the controversies concerning integrity of the Trump administration.

In an increasingly digital-first world and at a time where the COVID-19 pandemic limited
the ability to gather physically, the OECD has recently focused its efforts on creating new,
digital tools to complement the Handbook and encourage its uptake. The OECD's Council on
Public Integrity released a new recommendation, Improving Ethical Conduct in the Public
Service Including Principles for Managing Ethics in the Public Service, in recognition of the
possibility that the pandemic might expose how vulnerable policy-making public
procurement and public infrastructure spending are to corruption.36 This new document,
released in 2021, contains twelve principles for managing ethics in the public service,
alongside the thirteen principles from 2017, as well as two new and separate OECD legal
instruments. OECD legal instruments are different than recommendations because although
they are not legally binding by default, they become legally binding on all Members other
than those that abstain at the time of adoption. This move to create legal instruments signals
that the OECD is confident in the quality of these principles and is willing to put added
pressure on its Members to adopt them as binding commitments.

In order to support Members who are now expected to take more robust action to improve
their public integrity and anti-corruption policies and infrastructure, the OECD has created
an interactive multi-lingual website filled with background information and useful tools.
This digital toolkit includes the OECD Public Integrity Maturity Model tool, for example,
which allows governments or public sector organisations to "assess the elements of their
integrity systems, and identify where they are situated in relation to good practice across
four categories: nascent, emerging, established and leading."37 The OECD's ongoing
creation and modernization of resources supports better public sector ethics and
accountability, and sets them apart as the international leader among NGOs in this space.

      1.2.3 World Bank

The World Bank participates as an observer in more than 30 OECD bodies and provides
support to OECD's Global forums and regional events.38 The World Bank signalled its
interest in public sector ethics when it commissioned a 2004 report entitled Legislative Ethics
and Codes of Conduct.39 In July 2020, together with the United Nations and the OECD as part

of the G20 Anti-corruption Working Group, the World Bank was instrumental in publishing
the Preventing and Managing Conflicts of Interest in the Public Sector: Good Practices Guide (the
Good Practices Guide).40 Although duplicative in some ways to previous efforts by the OECD,
the Good Practices Guide is more narrowly focused and goes into greater depth with respect
to conflicts of interest. It serves as an important multi-stakeholder contribution to the
modern literature on public sector conflicts of interest.

      1.2.4 Transparency International

The OECD's 2020 Public Integrity Handbook emphasized the importance of civil society
groups for good reason. Among the more high-profile and influential of these kinds of
international non-governmental (NGO) and not-for-profit organizations is Transparency
International (TI). TI works in over 100 countries conducting research about and advocating
for improved anti-corruption practices and greater transparency to help uncover corruption
that already exists in both the public and the private sectors. Every year TI holds conferences,
publishes various reports and releases its famous Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI). The
CPI is a list that "ranks 180 countries and territories by their perceived levels of public sector
corruption, drawing on 13 expert assessments and surveys of business executives. It uses a
scale of zero (highly corrupt) to 100 (very clean)."41

2. COMPARING APPROACHES

It is now well-established within the international community that public sector ethics
regimes play an important role in helping governments to dissuade and combat corruption.
The UN and OECD's work have drawn attention to the different ways these regimes have
been established in countries that have varied systems of government. The political anti-
corruption regimes of the US, UK, and Canada can be illustrative in this regard.

Within each of these countries there is a mix of hard and soft law that governs the behaviours
of elected officials. Hard law, which can also simply be referred to as `law,' refers to legal
obligations that are binding and can be enforced by the courts. Examples of hard law are
statutes/legislation, judge-made law (i.e., caselaw) and even contracts. Soft law, despite what
its moniker may imply, serves an almost equally important role. Soft laws are those policies,
procedures, and protocols that cannot be enforced by the court, but are nevertheless
influential and, in some cases, enforceable through other mechanisms (we might call them
rules for simplicity). An example of a soft law that is enforceable could be a code of ethical
conduct that applies to members of the executive but over which the Prime Minister or
President has sole enforcement authority. Even if the public disagrees with a decision to not
enforce the code, no recourse to the courts would be available. Regardless, such a code of

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

conduct can still play an important role in influencing the ethical decision-making of the
public officials to whom it applies.

The US, the UK and Canada all have laws that govern the ethical conduct of their elected
officials. Those laws are passed by the relevant legislative bodies and can, for the most part,
be enforced by the courts. What complicates matters however, is that because of the nature
of their systems of government (i.e., parliamentary democracy in Canada and the UK and
constitutional republic in the United States) even those laws are not always capable of being
enforced by the courts. Canada's Conflict of Interest Code for Members of the House of
Commons,42 for example, is administered by the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner
(CIEC), who is an agent of Parliament.43 As an agent of Parliament who has also been given
a high level of discretion under the Code, the CIEC's findings about whether an elected
official has violated the Code are not reviewable by the court for their reasonableness. This
means that it is effectively impossible to have a court enforce the Code if there is reason to
disagree with the reasonableness of the Commissioner's decision-making. These types of
challenges with the enforceability of ethics laws will be addressed in greater detail below.

2.1 Principles-based

Whether we are talking about soft law or hard law, public sector ethics laws are sometimes
assigned to advisers or commissioners for their administration because the standards public
officials are expected to meet can evolve over time. There are some behaviours that it seems
obvious we should want to prohibit (e.g., selling favours from public office or
misappropriating public funds), but new ways of misbehaving sometimes come to light.
Many laws or rules are drafted using principle-first language that allows for greater
malleability in interpretation and application. A principles-based law can be applied to new
scenarios even where those scenarios were not previously contemplated, and a precedent
does not exist. In Ontario, Canada, for example, the Members Integrity Act44 includes a
concept called the "Ontario parliamentary convention"45 (OPC) that is not defined in the
Act. OPC has historically been used quite flexibly by Ontario's Integrity Commissioner as a
standard against which the behaviours of elected officials can be judged. Principles-based
laws encourage discretionary decision-making and, arguably, signal that the rule-makers
are interested in promoting a culture of ethics (as opposed to a culture of compliance which
more readily flows from a rules-based approach).

2.2 Rules-based

By contrast, rules-based laws are more rigid and less flexible in their application. A rules-
based approach relies on the prior identification of specific conduct that the rule-makers
have determined to be undesirable and, ideally, establishes deterrents for those behaviours.
A simple example might be a rule that states: `spending public funds for personal gain is not
allowed. If a public official is found to have broken this law, then they will be removed from
their public office.' These laws might be otherwise characterized as if-then statements: `if
action A is proven to have taken place, then result B must follow.'

      2.2.1 Values

There is an important yet subtle distinction that must be made between values and
principles. Many statutes (and even non-statutory rules regimes) begin with a preamble that
serves as a statement of the overarching values toward which the rules are aimed. While
these value statements are not enforceable, they set the tone for what the rule-makers expect
from those who are subject to the formal rules. Why include these statements of value? Even
when rules and principles are used together, it can be incredibly difficult to design a regime
that will account for and protect against all instances of conduct that we might believe to be
unethical. A statement of values can signal to those who are subject to a set of rules that even
when they are uncertain about what those rules require, they should still be trying to hold
themselves to the high standards that are set out in those underlying values. Behaviours that
are rooted in these values may emerge and, if they are repeated over time, come to form
what we call behavioural conventions. Generally speaking, these conventions are unwritten,
politically enforceable norms of conduct.

      2.2.2 Procedures

A final basic building block or element of every public sector ethics regime is procedure. If
the goal of a regime is to do more than simply raise awareness, that is, if the goal is to detect,
root out and possibly punish bad behaviour, then those who are subject to allegations of
impropriety will expect some level of fairness in the processes that are engaged. The
importance of procedure is typically addressed using one or both of the following
approaches:

     1) by requiring the individual or body that administers the regime to set out
          procedures they will follow, and ideally to make those procedures available to
          the public or, at least, available to anyone who may become subject to the
          regime; or

     2) by establishing specific, detailed procedures as rules that must be followed as
          part of the regime's administration.

Procedures help to establish stakeholder expectations and can, in some circumstances, also
fill gaps in rules where a regime is not intended to (and generally, cannot possibly) be a
comprehensive code covering all possible ethical scenarios. Procedural predictability is
useful, for example, where principle-based rules apply, and a decision-maker has been
permitted a measure of discretion.

                                                                                                          847
GLOBAL CORRUPTION

2.3 Comparing the Structure of Different Regimes

When observing governments through a comparative lens, the US, the UK, and Canada can
reasonably be viewed as being among the world's most advanced democracies. These
nations each have deep commitments to the concept of the rule of law, observable through
long-standing legal traditions, comparably high human rights standards, robust political
institutions, and strong citizen engagement. Among those political institutions are
government ethics regimes that are the focus of this chapter. Depending on the country in
question, these regimes are overseen by advisers; administered by commissioners, agents of
parliament or registrars; or maybe even overseen by the courts.

Given the political histories of these three nations, what exists today are complex and
sometimes confusing tapestries of public sector ethics regimes that can, at times, appear
more symbolic than functional. As one might imagine, there is an inherent conflict of interest
that exists when legislators are ultimately the ones responsible for passing laws that set
limits on their own conduct. What will become apparent as we explore how the regimes in
these three countries operate is that there are significant limitations with respect to
administrative independence and the effectiveness of oversight and enforcement
mechanisms. When ethics violations are found, the outcomes (i.e., whether an individual is
disciplined or not) often appear to be a simple reflection of who holds political power in that
moment and what they deem to be politically expedient.

      2.3.1 US

The US conflict of interest regime is divided into three components: the House of
Representatives, the Executive, and the Senate. Elected members of the lower house or
House of Representatives are subject to non-legislative Rules of the House of
Representatives (the Rules).46 The Rules are a lengthy document with standards of ethical
conduct found primarily in Chapters XXIII (Code of Official Conduct) and XXVI (Financial
Disclosure). The House Committee on Ethics is formally charged with overseeing the Code
of Official Conduct (COC),47 but the House recognized this was a large responsibility for the
committee and adopted a resolution in 2008 to create the Office of Congressional Ethics
(OCE).

The OCE is a non-partisan entity responsible for reviewing allegations of breaches of the
COC and other alleged violations of any laws, rules, regulations or standards of conduct that
would fall under the jurisdiction of the Committee on Ethics. The OCE Board conducts

46 These rules are adopted anew by each successive Congress and can be found on the website of the
House Committee on Rules: "Rules of the House of Representatives" (last visited 2 September 2021),

investigations and then decides whether to refer that matter to the Committee on Ethics for
further investigation and potential enforcement. To assist with this work and to help educate
those who are subject to the Rules, the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct
publishes a very lengthy (400+ pages) House Ethics Manual (the Manual).48 The Manual
provides greater detail about the Rules and outlines relevant precedents.

The OCE and the Committee on Ethics can compel witnesses and obtain evidence in order
to conduct their investigations. The Committee recommends administrative actions in
response to violations of the Rules,49 which the House then votes on. The Committee must
produce reports even when it dismisses an allegation. This requirement can help to educate
stakeholders while also potentially deterring questionable ethical behaviour.

Members of Cabinet in the US are not also members of the House of Representatives and are
accordingly not subject to concurrent conflict of interest rules. That said, these and other
members of the executive branch are subject to the non-legislative Standards of Ethical
Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch (the Standards)50 and the legislative rules
found in the Ethics in Government Act (EGA).51 They are also subject to criminal conflict of
interest and public corruption laws,52 and various other statutory rules53 and executive
orders54 that relate to ethical conduct and financial disclosure. Although the tapestry of rules
that makes up the executive branch ethics program can be confusing, an Office of
Government Ethics (OGE) has also been created to provide consistency and support to
further its effective operation.

The OGE leads and oversees the executive branch ethics program55 that applies to all
government agencies and helps to prevent conflicts of interest, including improper personal
financial gain. Oversight in this context does not, however, mean enforcement. Headed by

a director, the OGE's role is purely preventative, educational, and supportive. It assists with
interpreting rules and advises on how to best ensure compliance. The OGE works alongside
the Designated Agency Ethics Official (DAEO) within each federal agency. The DAEOs are
given various powers under the EGA, including the ability to provide advice to employees
within their agencies or to provide disclosure waivers for employees who work part-time.56
Inspector Generals (IG) for particular agencies investigate complaints with respect to
compliance with the EGA.57 IGs play a role in prevention and enforcement of ethics
violations and work under the umbrella of an independent body called the Council of
Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency.58 Given the large number and the unique
nature of many federal agencies, a decentralized approach to ethics oversight is likely the
only practical approach.

The executive branch ethics program is complemented by several other statutes that are
administered by the Office of the Special Counsel (OSC). Most important for our purposes
is The Hatch Act (HA),59 which was passed in 1939 and places limits on the political activities
that most federal employees can engage in, with the President and Vice President being the
most notable exceptions. In order to help ensure that federal programs are administered in
a nonpartisan manner, the HA "prohibits Federal employees from conducting political
activities while on Government premises, using Government resources, or during duty
hours. Furthermore, The Hatch Act bars Federal employees from running for partisan
political office or from fundraising for a candidate or political party."60 Interestingly, the
OSC is responsible for enforcing the HA, but the Special Counsel who heads the OSC is in
fact appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. In situations where the
President and Senate are aligned politically, there is a risk that appointments like that of the
Special Counsel could become politicized.

Finally, the Senate is subject to the Senate Code of Official Conduct, which is found within the
Standing Rules of the Senate61 and administered by the Select Committee on Ethics. Just as
there is for the House, the Select Committee on Ethics has also published a 500+ page Ethics
Manual62 with information about the Rules and examples of precedents.

      2.3.2 UK

Britain's approach to public sector ethics is coloured by its parliamentary system. Its
approach is complicated by the multiplicity of players involved. For example, members of
the House of Commons are subject to the non-legislative Code of Conduct for Members of

Parliament,63 which is not part of the Standing Orders. The Standing Orders merely specify
that there shall be an Officer of the House called a Parliamentary Commissioner for
Standards whose responsibility includes, "advis[ing] the Committee on Standards, its sub-
committees and individual Members on the interpretation of any code of conduct to which
the House has agreed."64

The Committee on Standards is also created under the Standing Orders and it is responsible
for considering:

          any matter relating to the conduct of Members, including specific
          complaints in relation to alleged breaches in any code of conduct to which
          the House has agreed and which have been drawn to the committee's
          attention by the Commissioner; and to recommend any modifications to
          such code of conduct as may from time to time appear to be necessary.65

The Code of Conduct is simply approved by a resolution of the House and published in
conjunction with The Guide to the Rules relating to the Conduct of Members.66

Despite the somewhat confusing language, the Committee on Standards cannot receive
complaints directly about members. Any complaints alleging a violation of the Code of
Conduct must be submitted to the Commissioner, whose reports will then be submitted to
the Committee for its consideration and a determination regarding possible sanction(s). In
some circumstances, where the Commissioner believes a breach to be minor, they can work
with the member to rectify the issue. This might involve acknowledging a mistake, issuing
an apology, or repaying some monies. The Commissioner is also responsible for maintaining
a register of members' financial interests and reports to the Committee, and so rectification
could also mean simply adding a financial interest to a member's report.67 Reports about
investigations are published on the Commissioner's website.68

Further to the Select Committee on Standards, there is also an independent Committee on
Standards in Public Life (CSPL) that answers to the Prime Minister and cabinet. Members of
the CSPL are public appointees and thus the CSPL is considered to be independent. The
CSPL's very broad mandate is to "advise the Prime Minister on arrangements for upholding

ethical standards of conduct across public life in England."69 Another way to frame this
mandate is to say that the CSPL's purpose is to advise the Prime Minister on how to
strengthen and uphold the seven principles of public life (i.e., ethical standards) that those
working in the public sector are expected to adhere to: selflessness, honesty, integrity,
objectivity, openness, leadership, and accountability.70 The UK's Civil Service Code71 is also
based on these seven principles and is incorporated into each individual employee's
employment contract. This Code is also not legislative and is overseen by the Civil Service
Commission (CSC).

Yet another non-legislative code applies to the Prime Minister's executive council. This
Ministerial Code72 is simply a set of rules issued by the Prime Minister. Some sections of the
Code also apply to special advisers and parliamentary private secretaries. The Code is not
enforced by any external or independent body, but is instead left to the discretion of the
Prime Minister. When an allegation is made, the Prime Minister may choose to appoint an
advisor to conduct an investigation. Given that the Code is specific to each Prime Minister, it
is generally updated when a new Prime Minister takes office.

Britain's upper chamber is called the House of Lords. The House of Lords' Code of Conduct
is overseen by the Sub-Committee on Lords' Conduct and administered by the House of
Lords Commissioners for Standards. The Commissioners educate the Lords, administer the
rules, investigate alleged breaches and maintain a register of Lords' interests.73

      2.3.3 Canada

Canada's federal conflict of interest regime can be divided into three components, all of
which are supplemented by the criminal law. Elected members of the lower house are
subject to a non-legislative Conflict of Interest Code for Members of Parliament,74 which, unlike
the UK, is found within the Standing Orders of the House of Commons. This Code can be

updated by a vote of the members themselves and does not need to pass through the formal
legislative process. This is important because it means that, at least in theory, the Code should
be much easier to update than legislation would be, particularly by a majority government.
But the fact that the Code is not legislative also means that it is an internal policy of the House
and its application is subject to parliamentary privilege. Being subject to parliamentary
privilege prevents the courts from interfering in the administration of the Code.75

In contrast to the US, members of the House who have been appointed to the executive
council are also subject to the rules set out in the Conflict of Interest Act.76 The Act applies to
what it calls "reporting public office holders" including, but not limited to, ministers of the
Crown, parliamentary secretaries, certain members of ministerial staff, and certain Governor
in Council appointees. Both the Code and the Act are administered by the Conflict of Interest
and Ethics Commissioner, who is appointed by the Governor in Council after consultation
with the leaders of each recognized party in the House of Commons. Both the Code and Act
are primarily rules-based but are written in language that allows for some degree of
flexibility in interpretation. More detail about various rules will be provided below.

Finally, the upper chamber in Canada is called the Senate. The Senate consists of members
who are appointed, not elected. Although the government that passed the Act did attempt
to make senators subject to legislation that would be administered by the Conflict of Interest
and Ethics Commissioner, senators voted against that idea.77 Instead, senators insisted on
establishing and appointing their own Senate Ethics Officer (SEO) who now administers,
interprets and applies the Ethics and Conflict of Interest Code for Senators.78 This is similar to
the UK, where the House of Lords maintains a separate regime for the governance of its
ethical conduct. Ultimately, the SEO makes recommendations back to the Senate and has no
authority to discipline. Again, this Code is not legislative and can only be updated by the
Senate and administered by the SEO. The courts have absolutely no role in overseeing these
rules, even if a senator applies to the court to have a decision reviewed.79 Instead,
parliamentary privilege applies and protects the Senate's right to discipline its own
members.

      2.3.4 Codes of Ethics for Political Parties

Canada's 1991 Royal Commission on Electoral Reform and Party Financing80 recommended
that political parties develop their own internal codes of ethics. This recommendation had
not been taken up by the major parties in 2014 when Elections Canada commissioned a
report by Paul Thomas entitled A Code of Ethics or Code of Conduct for Political Parties as a

Potential Tool to Strengthen Electoral Democracy in Canada.81 One of Thomas' conclusions was
that adoption of a code would cause political parties and their followers to be "more aware
of, sensitive to and capable of reasoning about ethically challenging situations in ways that
they otherwise might not have in the past."82 These codes could be particularly instrumental
in creating standards of conduct surrounding campaign tactics and constituency work
(including supporting charitable organizations), mobilizing voter turnout or even
something as simple as fostering a culture of truth-telling. Most importantly, these codes
could fill gaps that arise when the political will is simply not there for updating legislative
or other codes.

In contrast, the Conservative Party,83 the Scottish National Party,84 and the Liberal
Democrats85 in the UK have implemented codes of conduct. Despite what seem to be strong
arguments in favour of implementing party-specific codes, few political parties at the federal
level in Canada have adopted a code of ethics. The federal Liberal Party has a Campaign Code
of Conduct86 and the Green Party of Canada has a Members' Code of Conduct.87 Some sub-
national political parties in Canada have released codes, including the Quebec Liberal
Party,88 the United Conservative Party of Alberta89 and the Ontario Liberal Party.90 Some of
these codes include enforcement mechanisms. Both the mere allegation of a violation and its
enforcement being accused of can have political consequences. However, the codes are non-
legislative and unless they are integrated into employment contracts it is unlikely that the
courts will play any role in enforcing them. Regardless, there is potential in this space for
more regulation of the ethical conduct of public officials and those with whom they work in
and outside of office.

      2.3.5 Importance of Independent Oversight

As should be apparent from the above overview of how the political ethics regimes in these
three countries are structured, it is easy to take for granted that self-regulation in this space
is acceptable. The complex accountability tapestries in each of these countries place varying
levels of emphasis on undertaking active public engagement and consultation. There is
perhaps good reason for this when we consider that one of the fundamental tenets of
representative democracies is that those who govern should be elected and not appointed to
their positions. It accordingly makes sense that elected officials would not want to subject
themselves to accountability regimes where they, as a unified body, give up control over
disciplinary outcomes. As we will see, it is very rare for an appointed or delegated ethics
official to be granted authority to make a finding with disciplinary implications that do not
also have to be approved by the legislative body to which they are accountable.

There is an important difference, however, between involving the public in the creation of
the rules and in granting true independence to the individual or body responsible for their
administration. On the understanding that ethics rules ought to be revisited periodically,
Canada included mandatory periodic review clauses in both its Act and Code. Included in
the Code is a requirement that the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs
undertake a comprehensive review of the rules every five years and report back to the
House.91 The Act requires only one such review, which must begin within five years of the
Act coming into force and be conducted by whichever committee or committees the House
and Senate assign the task.92

The UK Parliament's Committee on Standards launched a review of the Code of Conduct for
Members of Parliament in late 2020, with assistance from the Parliamentary Commissioner
for Standards. The review invited input from anyone wanting to contribute, including
members of the general public.93 These mandatory periodic reviews of parliamentary ethics
laws are incredibly important so that Parliament has an opportunity to keep its standards
current with public expectations, and to have effective systems of administration in place
that can help to foster public trust in government and in politicians.94

Even if the rules are co-designed with public input, legislative bodies most commonly retain
control over any disciplinary decisions that must ultimately be made. However, a level of
independence from the government in decision-making about disciplinary measures is
generally desirable. Not having independence can prove problematic when seeking to
maximize public trust and minimize public cynicism, particularly if a disciplinary action is

recommended by the ethics body and then the relevant legislative body or actor (particularly
when the President or Prime Minister is involved) subsequently chooses not to take action.

There are three notable exceptions to the general approach that legislative bodies or actors
will retain control over disciplinary decisions. These are: 1) situations where the ethics body
is permitted to mete out small monetary penalties for an official failing to meet what are
usually administrative obligations 2) situations where the ethics body is permitted to
determine whether a matter is minor and can be easily remedied by working with the
official, and 3) situations involving criminal law. Further, the age of the internet has created
an environment where ethics bodies are often required or permitted to publish their work
online. This transparency seems to mitigate some concerns about independence. Even if a
legislative body or actor refuses to adopt a disciplinary recommendation, the fact that the
recommendation was made public allows the electorate to have information that can
influence how people vote in the next election.

3. CENTERING CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

Central to every public sector ethics regime is the concept of conflict of interest. It is generally
accepted that there are three types of conflicts that should be addressed through these
regimes: real conflicts of interest, apparent conflicts, and potential conflicts. Unsurprisingly,
the types of conflict guarded against in individual regimes vary greatly. This variance is
typically a function of the political will of those who create the regime, but can also be a
function of whether a regime has been modernized and whether public input has been
incorporated. Further, there is tremendous variation in the language used to describe each
conflict. For example, to whom each type of conflict applies and what counts as a `improper'
or a `private interest' may be expressed differently among regimes. Modernized regimes are
more likely to include broader conceptions of what counts as a private interest, as well as
prohibitions against apparent conflicts of interest and improperly benefitting individuals
beyond oneself. Accounting for these distinctions may help illuminate how particular rules
operate, including what gets captured by the rules and what is overlooked.

A real or actual conflict of interest arises when a public official's private interests stand in
conflict with their public duties. In other words, when a public official cannot fulfil their
public duties without also benefitting themselves personally. An example might be a
Minister of Finance who must make decisions about the banking industry that could impact
profit levels, but who also holds large amounts of stock in individual banks. Another
example might be a Minister of Mining and Forestry who owns stock in a mining company
in a remote area, but must also make a decision about whether to use public funds to build
a road that would help create jobs by providing that mining company and its employees
with better access to the mine site.

A potential conflict of interest can arise before an actual or real one develops. Public officials
must always be cognizant of ways in which their own private interests could come into
conflict with their public duties. Accordingly, a potential conflict exists whenever there is a
mere possibility that a private interest could clash with a future public duty. Returning to
the Minister of Finance example, that individual should know upon being assigned the

856                                 2022
                                   CHAPTER 10 PUBLIC OFFICIALS & CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

ministerial portfolio that the fact they own stock in those companies has the potential to put
them in a conflict of interest if and when they ever need to make an official decision that
could affect the profitability of those companies. A potential conflict is not a real conflict. In
fact, a best practice in this space is to identify potential conflicts in advance so that steps can
be taken to mitigate or outright protect against those potential conflicts becoming actual or
real conflicts.

An apparent conflict of interest is much more complicated and less commonly addressed in
public sector ethics regimes than the aforementioned conflicts, but is arguably equally as
important. An apparent conflict of interest arises when it merely appears as though a public
official is in a position where their ability to fulfil their public duties stands in conflict with
their private interests.95 These types of conflicts are much more common in the digital age
of micro-blogging and social media, where citizens are much more actively engaged in
understanding (or at the very least, exposed to) public policy decisions and can easily share
information with one another without much worry about intermediaries or gatekeeping.
Imagine our Minister of Finance has recognized upon accepting their appointment as
minister that they are in a potential conflict of interest. The new minister immediately sells
all bank stocks before being sworn in. The public believes that the minister continues to own
that bank stock because a public registry of private interests was posted when the minister
took office as a member. This registry is now out-dated, but the applicable rules specify that
it does not need to be updated until six months after the minister is sworn in to the new
position. In the interim, there appears to the public to be a potential conflict of interest.
Imagine now that the minister makes a very public decision that has a positive impact on
the profitability of the banking sector. To those who are unaware that the minister sold all
their stock, this decision appears to place the minister in a conflict of interest.

Apparent conflicts of interests arise all the time. Sometimes they are a precursor to a real
conflict of interest, but other times the appearance is simply the result of observers having
imperfect or incomplete information about a situation. Appearances can of course be
deceiving, but unless those appearances are acknowledged and tended to, they can also lead
to distrust and public cynicism. Even though it may seem undesirable and maybe even
impossible to prohibit apparent conflicts of interest, it is becoming increasingly more
important to try to actively minimize or avoid apparent conflicts of interest and to address
them if and when they do arise.

3.1 Defining Private Interests

To further complicate the concept of conflict of interest, the definition of a "private interest"
is sometimes extended to include family members and/or dependents and can also be
extended beyond mere financial interests. The inclusion of family members means that
public officials must be aware of those family members' relevant interests. This requires
those who design the rules to consider whether the family members captured must also be
obligated to make either private or public disclosures about their interests. Extending

95 See Valerie Jepson, "Apparent Conflicts of Interest, Elected Officials and Codes of Conduct" (2018)
61:2 Can Pub Admin 36 at 40, for a discussion of the reasonable apprehension of bias in the context of
conflicts of interest.

                                                                                                          857
GLOBAL CORRUPTION

conflicts of interest and reporting requirements to include family members in this way has
been criticized as an invasion of privacy and public officials sometimes simply refuse to
comply with any such filing requirements.

      3.1.1 Improperly Benefitting Self and Others

A conflict of interest can arise when a public official not only uses their public office and
powers in order to benefit themselves personally, but also when those actions "improperly
benefit others."96 Of course, official decisions always benefit someone (why make them
otherwise?), but public sector ethics rules generally contemplate that it can be improper for
a public official to benefit others with their decisions, even if those others are not their family
members or dependents. This is often interpreted in a way that captures friends or close
business acquaintances. This flexible language empowers ethics bodies to investigate official
decisions that appear to favour someone who is known to the decision-maker or, more
generally, decisions that appear not to be impartial.

The interpretation of the word "improper" is also central to conflict rules and their
operationalization. What it means for something to be improper is very much open to
interpretation. For example, the CIEC in Canada has recently interpreted this word in a way
that seems to broaden the scope of the rule. In the 2019 Trudeau II Report97 under the Conflict
of Interest Act and in the 2021 Ratansi Report98 under the Conflict of Interest Code for Members
for the House of Commons, the CIEC provides that it may be improper (for the purpose of the
ethics rules) to break some other rule external to the ethics rules in order to benefit another
person.

      3.1.2 Outside Activities

Conflict of interest laws also tend to restrict or prohibit elected officials from participating
in certain outside activities. Not only is being a member of the executive now considered to
be a full-time job, but having outside interests also opens more opportunities for public
officials to encounter conflicts of interest. Ethics rules often prohibit members of the
executive from having other business interests99 and from accepting government
contracts.100 Elected officials who do not serve in the executive are not generally prohibited
from owning a company or having other business interests, but might be prohibited from
accepting government contracts.101 Exceptions to these rules may exist where the ethics body
has provided approval.

Many public officials also have prior affiliations with organizations outside of government.
For example, they may have sat on the board of directors for a company or volunteered with
a charitable organization. Members of the executive are often required to recuse themselves
from these positions,102 whereas other elected officials may simply need to seek approval
from the applicable ethics body. The goal, again, is to minimize the possibility of a conflict
of interest arising.

      3.1.3 Matters of General Application

Importantly, decisions that are about matters of general application are not usually
considered to be conflicts of interest. If a legislator is voting on something that impacts a
whole industry, for example, this rule allows them to not have to recuse themselves from
that vote simply because their spouse or child is employed in that same industry. The
general consensus is that even though it is important to avoid conflicts of interest, the rules
must still be reasonable about allowing legislators to represent their constituents. Consider,
for example, that an elected member of parliament lives in a rural area and their spouse
works on a local farm. One of the reasons that person may have been voted into office is
because they promised the local farming community that they would advocate for the rights
and interests of local farmers. This would be a reasonable, and arguably desirable, political
platform. It would be completely unfair and undemocratic to prohibit that individual from
voting on matters that are of general application to the farming industry simply because
their spouse happens to work on one of the local farms.

      3.1.4 Member of a Broad Class

Similar to the general application exception above, ethics rules also sometimes carve out
exceptions in order to allow legislators to vote on matters that affect their own or another
person's private interests as long as it only affects them "as one of a broad class of
persons."103 This exception might allow our Minister of Finance, above, to make decisions
about the banking industry without having to first sell their stocks. Whether a matter is
broad enough to be considered "a broad class" is typically left to the ethics body or ethics
advisor to interpret. These ethics bodies often publish annual reports, sample inquiries or
guides that assist public officials by offering examples of precedent advice and/or decisions.
These important resources are explored in greater depth below.

3.2 Improper Influence

In addition to restricting the right of elected officials to make decisions, public sector ethics
laws generally prohibit officials from using their position to influence a decision made by
another person in order to further their own private interest(s) or another person's or entity's
private interest(s).104 Prohibitions like this contemplate situations where an elected official
feels tempted to assist their constituent(s) through seeking the circumvention of established
policies and procedures that apply generally to everyone. A more egregious example exists

102 See e.g., Ministerial Code, supra note 72, s 7.8; COI Act, supra note 76 s 21.
103 See e.g., COI Act, supra note 76, s 2(1); Canada Code, supra note 42, s 3(3)(b); MIA, supra note 44, s 1.
104 See e.g., Canada Code, supra note 42, s 9; MIA, supra note 44, s 4; COI Act, supra note 76, s 9.

                                                                                                          859
GLOBAL CORRUPTION

when an elected official believes a colleague should award a contract to a certain individual
(perhaps someone they know or otherwise have some personal connection to). In order to
compel their colleague to award that contract to the favored party, the elected official may
promise to vote a certain way on a matter of importance to that colleague that comes up in
the legislative house or in the cabinet office. These kinds of behaviours are generally
understood to be improper because they manipulate the playing field in a way that unfairly
benefits some people or groups over others.

      3.2.1 Campaign Contributions

Although they tend to vary a great deal between countries, rules about campaign
contribution limits can function in essence to constrain one of the ways that outsiders are
able to have influence over politicians. If you limit the amount of money that any one person,
entity or group can donate to an individual or political party's campaign fund, then it is less
likely that politician (or aspiring politician) will feel obligated to return the favour to that
donor. The unfortunate reality is that political campaigns can be incredibly expensive, so
candidates must work very hard to raise enough money to be able to participate at a
competitive level. Placing limits on either contributions or spending, or both, can help to
curb the influential role that money plays in politics. Enforcing these limits can also help
reduce the pressure to improperly prioritize the needs of their donors that politicians might
feel after they take office.

Political spending in the US has been treated much differently than in Canada and the UK,
due in part to the US Supreme Court's 2010 decision in Citizens United.105 The Court struck
down a federal law that prohibited corporations and unions from spending money in
connection with federal elections. This did not mean that corporations and unions could
make unlimited campaign contributions to a candidate or party, but that free speech gave
them the right to spend their own money independently of candidates on matters that were
political in nature. This has led to the creation of political action committees (also known as
Super PACs) that allow wealthy donors to contribute money to non-profit organizations
whose purpose is to independently spend money on political issues. Of course, the issues
chosen often align with a party's or candidate's political interests, even though the candidate
cannot endorse that PAC. Due to the US laws applicable to non-profits, the names of donors
to these PACs are not required to be disclosed--although they sometimes are. This has been
referred to as "dark money."106 These PACs can have significant social and political
influence that politicians must vigilantly guard against, especially given the already high
cost of running for public office.

3.3 Insider Information

Public officials are generally prohibited from using knowledge that they acquire by virtue
of their position and that is not available to the public to further (or seek to further) their
private interests. Again, this prohibition sometimes extends to the interest(s) of their friends

105 Citizens United v Federal Election Commission, 558 US 310 (2010).

Shadow Parties" (2013) 97:4 Marq L Rev 903.

                                   CHAPTER 10 PUBLIC OFFICIALS & CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

and families.107 They are likewise generally prohibited from improperly attempting to
further any other person's private interests.108 A rule like this may seem somewhat intuitive
given the centering of conflicts of interest; however, comprehensive public sector ethics
regimes are nevertheless explicit about prohibitions on benefitting from knowledge derived
from public positions in the same manner that they prohibit benefitting from decisions made
in an official capacity.

Determining what counts as a decision or as an action in the context of conflict of interest
laws can be difficult. Similar difficulties arise in evaluating what counts as a private interest.
These are not monolithic concepts; they have been interpreted differently by different ethics
bodies in different jurisdictions. While a private interest may be equated with a pecuniary
interest (that is, benefitting oneself financially), it may also extend to include future favours
or support with respect to future political ambitions, depending on the jurisdiction. Because
these rules are often drafted using rather flexible language, restrictions on benefitting from
the use of insider information are carved out and separated from rules about conflicts of
interest in decision-making.

3.4 Contrasting Legislative and Executive Roles

The duty to avoid conflicts of interest can look very different for legislators who also serve
as members of the executive. Assuming an elected official has private interests that they
must be attentive to (e.g., a stock portfolio, investment properties, ownership interest in a
company, etc.), being a member of the executive might require them to make more daily
decisions that could potentially lead to conflicts than faced by a general legislator.
Consequently, members of the executive need to be especially diligent in avoiding conflicts
of interest. If mere apparent conflicts of interest continue to capture the public's attention
and to provoke greater public cynicism and distrust in government, increased interest in the
idea of having specialized ethics advisors who are employed by and become an integral part
of the executive may be generated.

Finally, it is important to acknowledge that the inclusion of people with diverse perspectives
and background experiences in public office is desirable. An inevitable corollary to the
inclusion of diverse and highly qualified persons serving in public office is the reality that
conflicts of interest will arise. The goal of these regimes must be to help recognize and
minimize those conflicts so that they do not cause damage. Being in a potential or even real
conflict is not the same as improperly benefitting from that conflict. The goal must be to
recognize risk and then to take steps to minimize or eliminate harm. Different ways to work
towards this goal are discussed below.

3.5 Recusal and Restraint on Participation

One of the most widely accepted ways to avoid being in a real conflict of interest once a
potential conflict has been identified is to recuse oneself from that situation. Legislators are

107 See e.g., Canada Code, supra note 42, s 10; MIA, supra note 44, s 3.
108 COI Act, supra note 76, s 8.

                                                                                                          861
GLOBAL CORRUPTION

generally expected to recognize when participating in a vote or debate might put them in a
conflict of interest and to recuse themselves in advance. Some jurisdictions require
legislators to register their recusals with an ethics body and that registry may even be made
public.109 Members of the executive may also avail themselves of the recusal mechanism in
order to avoid conflicts of interest in their bureaucratic roles. This could happen on a case-
by-case basis or, if the potential for a conflict has been identified in advance, a blanket
prohibition or screen could be established. Some ethics bodies have authority to establish
conflict of interest screens that are shared within a department in order to ensure that
protocols are in place to determine who should handle files about particular matters that
could, if handled by the executive member, give rise to a real or apparent conflict of
interest.110

These conflict of interest screens are rather unique, and at times, controversial.111 After all,
elected officials should not be subject to the whims of unelected bureaucrats when it comes
to deciding how to represent their constituents. To minimize controversy, ethics bodies
might be given express authority from legislators to outright prohibit or restrain an elected
official's participation in certain types of matters.112 This is effectively a forced recusal, as
opposed to a voluntary one effected through a screen. Unlike a recusal, a restraint operates
automatically, ensuring that an official is not put in a position where it is possible to forget
to recuse themselves. These mechanisms may be used not only where a financial interest is
implicated, but also when benefits have the potential to accrue to some other personal or
family interest.

3.6 Disclosure of Interests

The proposition that elected officials should be required to prepare and file disclosure
statements with an ethics body when they take office is widely accepted. In many regimes,
these filings must be updated on a yearly basis or whenever there is a "material change" in
that official's interests.113 One of the reasons for this disclosure requirement is so ethics
bodies have an opportunity to review an official's ongoing interests and then provide them
with personalized advice that takes their specific regime's requirements into account. This
advice should hopefully help the official recognize and avoid any ethics transgressions.

A statement of private interests will always need to be filed for the elected official but may
also be required for their family members and other dependents.114 While the specific
information required to be disclosed will vary by regime, the following details are generally
included:

109 See e.g., COI Act, supra note 76, s 25(1); Lords Conduct, supra note 73, s 16.
110 See e.g., COI Act, supra note 76, s 29.
111 See e.g., Democracy Watch v Canada (Attorney General), 2018 FCA 194, wherein Democracy Watch
argued that allowing conflict of interest screens effectively circumvents the Act, which requires
public office holders to report any conflicts of interest.
112 See e.g., MIA, supra note 44, s 10; Canada Code, supra note 42, s 8.

                                   CHAPTER 10 PUBLIC OFFICIALS & CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

      Sources and amounts of any income (e.g., employment or investment);
      Sources and amounts of any liabilities. The definition of a liability will vary, but

          typically includes loans and other debts. This has also been interpreted as
          including "contingent liabilities" under some regimes;115
      A list of assets, including stocks, investment properties, high value personal
          property, and so forth;
      Professional memberships and associations; and,
      Volunteer engagements and commitments.

Some ethics bodies will audit these filings, which means the official could be required to
include official statements to confirm their assets, liabilities, and other interests. Failure to
disclose fully, accurately, and on time can sometimes result in fines or what have been called
"administrative monetary penalties"116 (AMPs).

      3.6.1 Private Disclosure

The disclosure process happens in two stages: first, private disclosure, and then review and
publication. The first is the private disclosure statement. Elected officials file their statement
in confidence to the ethics body. This distinction between private and public is important
because some of that disclosed information will then be made public. Private disclosure
statements are typically filed yearly, but some jurisdictions merely require a yearly
acknowledgement or confirmation rather than a de novo filing. This can ease some of the
administrative burden and time required to comply, while providing the ethics body with
the required information. Officials are also generally expected to file any updates on an
ongoing basis. These are sometimes called a "statement of material change"117 and time
limits for compliance are typically imposed, after which a file or AMP may be issued.

      3.6.2 Public Disclosure / Registry

After private disclosure statements are received, ethics bodies are then tasked with
reviewing, possibly auditing, and summarizing their contents. Regimes that require
disclosure of this nature will also include specific instructions about what information must
then be made public.118 The purpose of a public disclosure statement or registry is to be
transparent about what private interests elected officials might have. In theory, this allows
the public to keep a watchful eye on their elected leaders in order to ensure that they are not
placing themselves in conflicts of interest or behaving in a manner that might improperly
benefit someone. These public disclosures are made available online, and because this public
disclosure is generally acknowledged to be an invasion of privacy,119 only limited
information is included.

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

Public statements generally contain:

      A list of the names of companies in which shares are held;

      The names and private companies in which an ownership interest is held and
          the nature of that company's operations;

      Information about investment properties (e.g. the number of properties and/or
          their general location);

      Information about companies and investments from which income is
          generated/received;

      The nature of any liabilities (this usually excludes mortgages on primary
          residences);

      A list and a description of the nature of any volunteer engagement; and

      A list and description of any professional memberships and affiliations.120

Despite the above lists, ethics bodies are also often given broad discretion to include or
exclude any item from the public disclosure based upon what they reasonably believe is in
the public's best interest.121 This discretion is typically granted using principle-first
language, providing for greater flexibility, and the ability to avoid establishing rigid
precedents.

With respect to the statements of material change, some jurisdictions conduct reviews on an
ongoing basis in order to add new information to their public registry. Others only update
their public registry once per year, which permits new information to stay hidden from the
public for a period of time. In most circumstances, real-time updates are certainly consistent
with a regime that values transparency. However, again the reality is that ethics rules are
generally agreed upon by the people who are subject to them. Public officials make
deliberate decisions about ongoing disclosure obligations; accordingly, delayed disclosure
is typically by design, unless the ethics body is empowered to exercise its discretion in this
regard.

      3.6.3 Blind Trusts and Divestiture

Occasionally an official will disclose assets or interests strictly prohibited by the rules. In
Canada, for example, Ministers of the Crown are not allowed to "be a party to a contract
with a public sector entity under which he or she receives a benefit."122 Rules of this nature
(that is, pre-determined conflicts) are effectively a consensus about what the rule-makers all
agree is never going to be acceptable. Like other conflicts of interest, these rules might be
implemented in several different ways. First, some public sector ethics regimes allow the
person who holds the prohibited asset or interest to simply disclose it and then to proceed
as they normally would. They may have to recuse themselves from certain discussions or
certain votes, or they may set up a conflict of interest screen at their own discretion. Second,

                                   CHAPTER 10 PUBLIC OFFICIALS & CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

some regimes require that prohibited assets be divested or sold, eliminating any potential
for conflict. Finally, a blind trust may be executed. This mechanism is the most complicated
response to the disclosure of prohibited assets or interests.

A blind trust requires that a public official's assets (usually shares in a private or publicly-
traded company) be placed in a trust prior to their appointment to the cabinet position. A
trust is a fiduciary relationship where one party (the trustor) gives the other party (the
trustee) legal title to some asset that they then hold for the benefit of some third party (the
beneficiary). In the blind trusts contemplated by public sector ethics laws, the trustor and
the beneficiary are the same person (i.e., the public official). The trustee must be a third party
who is arm's length to the trustor/beneficiary. The trust is "blind" because the beneficiary
has no right to receive ongoing information about the trust or to direct the trustee's
management decisions. Specific requirements for instruments of this nature are typically set
out in the applicable ethics rules or left to the discretion of the relevant decision-maker in
the ethics body.123

          3.6.3.1 Executive Branch Nominees

The executive branch in the US functions differently than it does in Canada and the UK, as
elected officials in the US are not appointed to executive positions in the same manner.
Instead, anybody can be nominated to the executive branch by the President. The nominees
must be vetted by a Senate committee which is required to approve or confirm their
appointment. When nominations are made, the Office of Government Ethics (OGE) is tasked
with reviewing that person's private disclosure statement(s) and ensuring that they are free
from conflicts of interest.124 These individuals are expected to sign an ethics pledge and their
public financial disclosure reports can then be requested from the OGE.125

      3.6.4 Ethics Waivers (US)

Another unique feature of the US system of government is that the President can grant ethics
waivers to members of the executive. The President establishes this power to grant ethics
waivers simply by signing an executive order that brings the power into existence.126
Different Presidents may require that the waivers be made public, but that level of disclosure
is not in fact required.127 The President can then create waivers that allow individual
members of the executive to avoid having to comply with specific ethics rules. These waivers

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

are typically used when a person comes into the executive from an industry with which they
will be required to continue to interact. Ethics rules generally prohibit executive officials
from working closely with former colleagues who might now benefit from their connection
to the executive branch of government. This prohibition serves to minimize the risk of
unintentional or inadvertent preferential treatment being given. Although there is no formal
requirement to do so, ethics waivers are typically made available to the public on the OGE
website. Because the OGE has no investigative authority however, the Office is limited in
what it can do if the President does not share those waivers or release them publicly. This
can be problematic in the context of wanting transparency about an official's ethical
obligations.

      3.6.5 Gifts, Benefits, and Travel

Public sector ethics regimes generally include rules about what types of gifts, benefits, and
travel a public official may permissibly accept.128 Public officials commonly receive gifts of
gratitude in exchange for speaking at or attending an event. Gratitude can also take the form
of a benefit, including a free dinner or an upgraded seat. Sometimes public officials must
even travel to remote locations in order to meet with constituents or tour a remote facility
(e.g., mining operations). A public official may not be able to make such visits unless they
accept travel and accommodations. These are the kinds of exchanges that are addressed.

Rules about gifts are often divided into four considerations:

     (1) What types of gifts are acceptable?

          Gifts are generally acceptable when they are received as part of a custom,
          protocol or social obligation that normally accompanies the responsibilities
          of holding public office.129 Given that the custom of gift-giving in exchange
          for a dignitary's presence at an event is rather well-established, ethics
          bodies and advisors are generally quite flexible with allowing public
          officials to accept such gifts before seeking advice about its appropriateness.
          Given the social consequences of turning down a gift (i.e., being seen as
          rude), in some circumstances, ethics regimes provide for the possibility that
          it may be better to err on the side of politeness.

     (2) What value of a gift is acceptable?

          If a gift is acceptable under the rules about custom, protocol and social
          obligation, then the next question is often about its value and whether that
          value and or another aspect of the gift's nature warrants disclosure.

     (3) When does a gift need to be publicly reported?

          Each public sector ethics regime that includes rules about gifts and benefits
          will also determine when an item must be reported to the ethics body and/or
          made public. In Canada, for example, elected officials must report gifts that
          they or their family members receive from any one source that total

128 These rules do not speak to what it is acceptable to give, as that could be covered by the regular
conflict of interest rules relating to acceptable conduct.
129 See e.g., MIA, supra note 44, s 6; Canada Code, supra note 42, s 14(2).

866                                                                                                     2022
                                   CHAPTER 10 PUBLIC OFFICIALS & CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

          CDN$200 or more within a 12-month period. That report must be filed
          within 30 days of receipt or within 30 days from the date on which the value
          of the accumulated gifts from that single source totalled CDN$200.130 The
          individual gifts must all be reported publicly as well.

     (4) When, if ever, can a gift be retained by the recipient or must it be
          relinquished to the government (or some related entity)?

          Finally, it is sometimes the case that a gift is worth much more than those
          within a particular jurisdiction believe it is acceptable for an elected official
          to receive and keep. When a public office holder in Canada (or a member of
          their family) accepts a gift or other advantage that has a value of CDN$1,000
          or more, it must be forfeited to the Crown, unless the Conflict of Interest
          and Ethics Commissioner determines otherwise.131

The above rules apply to both gifts and benefits, but there may also be rules that apply
specifically to travel. Some governments have rules requiring that the fair market value of
any necessary travel must be reimbursed, while others allow elected officials to accept travel
as a gift or benefit under limited circumstances. Designated public office holders in Canada
(which include members of cabinet and other senior officials) are encouraged to pay for their
travel from the consolidated revenue fund, or by using parliamentary or political party
funds. If they cannot do so and the travel costs exceed CDN$200, they must file a statement
with the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner disclosing the name of the person or
organization that paid, the names of anyone who accompanied the official on the trip, and
the nature and value of the trip and any other gifts or benefits received, including
accommodations. Interestingly, the Conflict of Interest Act does not require that the
information is made public. Instead, the Commissioner is merely expected to prepare a list
once a year of such disclosures and to file that list with the Speaker of the House of
Commons.132

3.7 Seeking Advice

Most public sector ethics bodies are given mandates that include the provision of education
and awareness. This work can take many forms, but four are worth special attention: advice
giving, regular meetings, specialized training sessions, and the use of digital media.
Typically, stakeholders that are subject to the rules administered by an ethics body are
entitled to contact that body to ask specific questions about how to meet their obligations.
These questions could be about administrative obligations, as well as how to comply with
the ethics rules (such as those related to conflicts of interest and insider information). An
official can also sometimes request a formal opinion from the ethics body. How ethics rules
operate should not be a guessing game for those who are subject to them. It is accordingly

131 COI Act, supra note 76, s 11(3); See also Ministerial Code, supra note 72, s 7.22 (note that in the UK,
gifts exceeding £140 that are "given to Ministers in their Ministerial capacity become the property of
the Government and do not need to be declared").

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

important to encourage stakeholders to reach out and proactively seek clarity whenever they
have questions or concerns.

      3.7.1 Advice as Absolution

One way to incentivize seeking advice is to structure the ethics regime so that the formal
advice the ethics body provides can, if followed, be used as a defence to allegations of
misconduct. For this to work effectively, however, the advice-seeker must fully disclose all
relevant facts and the advice must be received before the unethical action occurs. If a
complaint is subsequently made against that official, and if that official has done exactly
what the ethics body has advised, then any subsequent investigation would be required to
acknowledge that the official followed the advice.133 Officials who follow the advice of ethics
bodies, even if that advice is poor, can accordingly be confident that they will not be
punished in any way for their compliance.

Practically speaking, regimes that allow prior advice to be used as a defence to an allegation
of misconduct need to take the advice-giving function seriously. In Canada, for example, the
CIEC provides advice. Giving bad advice, or even advice based on incomplete information,
would reflect poorly on the Commissioner. It should be very rare for an official who received
advice to have to rely on it for absolution after it was followed. These absolution provisions
are rarely invoked by advice-seekers but do an important job of incentivizing public officials
to seek advice from their ethics bodies before they act.

      3.7.2 Regular Meetings with Advisor

Many of these regimes also require (or allow) newly elected officials to meet with their ethics
advisor or ethics registrar. These meetings might be further required on a yearly basis, or
whenever an official is appointed to a new position (e.g., a cabinet or executive position). As
explained, elected officials may be required to file disclosure documents with ethics bodies
that outline their private interests, including assets and liabilities. One of the ways that ethics
bodies add value for officials is to provide them with disclosure-specific advice that will
help them to better recognize and avoid apparent, potential, and actual conflicts of interest.
By requiring these meetings on an annual basis, some regimes effectively force personalized
education sessions on officials. While this can be an effective approach given the busy
schedules of officials, it can also be seen as unnecessary and paternalistic. This latter
perception has resulted in most regimes opting to forgo such requirements.

      3.7.3 Regular Training

Further to the annual meetings, many ethics bodies offer regular or tailored training for their
stakeholders. This can be especially useful for educating those who are subject to the rules
as well as for their inner circle of advisors, and particularly those who may be responsible
for guarding against problematic or unethical situations. Regular and focused training is
integral to raising awareness and to building and sustaining a culture of excellence in ethical
decision-making.

      3.7.4 Digital Media

Ethics bodies are beginning to leverage digital media to engage with stakeholders and the
general public. Websites now do more than tell visitors how to phone or fax the office; they
host information that can be searched, downloaded, and distributed. Social media channels
are also being leveraged to engage and educate stakeholders.134 The move into the digital
age has created an opportunity for ethics bodies to expand their reach in a way that maybe
was not contemplated when they were created. The new digital environment offers new and
significant tools for ethics bodies. For example, some ethics bodies may have been given no
explicit public education mandate, but may be permitted or required to make reports public.
It costs less to use digital media than to have a physical mailing list, and a broader range of
people can potentially access and take an interest in this work if it is posted online. In the
wake of Donald Trump's presidency, where questions about the ethical conduct of the
President and his advisors were in the headlines on an almost-daily basis, placing greater
emphasis on outreach and education about how these regimes operate is crucial, and digital
tools provide an efficient and effective means of doing so.

3.8 Post-Employment / Cooling Off

The Hatch Act restricts the political activity of federal employees in the US. Rules that restrict
people working in the public service (not in ministers' offices) from also being politically
engaged are very common. A public servant is generally expected to be politically neutral
and loyal to the acting government. Neutrality and loyalty are valued so that public servants
do not need to be replaced whenever the political party in power changes. This provides for
the continuity and consistency necessary for bureaucracies to proceed on a (relatively)
seamless basis. These kinds of political activity restrictions do not, however, apply to
everyone.

Elected officials and their inner circles of advisors and staffers will always be politically-
minded. Although it is not generally accepted that they should be allowed to campaign
using public sector resources or while at their public sector jobs, their political nature is
accepted. As such, these individuals are often subject to post-employment restrictions when
they leave their roles in the public sector. Post-employment rules are important because
political life can be cyclical in nature. If a person is committed to one political party over
another, then they typically stick with that party and volunteer their time to assist with
fundraising, strategizing, campaigning, and polling. This is very common for political
operatives who work alongside ministers and party leaders. Because these people are
known to go back and forth between government and industry, ethics rules are typically put
in place specifically to prevent them from using their knowledge and/or connections in a
way that would improperly benefit them in their private sector roles.

Interest Act 2020-21, (Ottawa: Parliament of Canada, 2021) (Commissioner: Mario Dion), online:

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

Common post-employment rules provide that former public office holders:

      Must not seek preferential treatment from those they have worked with in the
          public sector;

      Must not disclose or benefit from the use of confidential information that they
          acquired while working in the public sector;

      Must not lobby their former employer or anyone they had close contact with in
          their former public sector role;

      Cannot take a position at a company or organization that has ongoing business
          with the government that they were privy to and that they have confidential
          information about; and,

      Cannot switch sides on an ongoing transaction.

Rules of this nature apply mostly to senior unelected officials and rarely to elected officials,
unless they are also members of the executive.

4. PUBLIC REPORTING

Not only do public sector ethics bodies generally have an obligation to educate their
stakeholders, they must also publicly report their own activities. Specific rules are often
provided about what must be reported on, to whom, and when.135 Public reporting typically
takes the form of annual and complaint-specific reports. Annual reports can contain a range
of information, including:

      The ethics body's composition and budget;
      A summary of the number of requests for advice received and what topics

          those requests covered;
      A summary of the number of requests for investigation received and who

          those requests related to;
      Summaries of outreach and education activities undertaken, including

          appearance before official committees; and,
      Samples of actual advice given (usually anonymized).

Ethics bodies that oversee the conduct of legislators typically report directly to that
legislative body or to a selected committee. Annual and other reports are generally made
public and the ethics body can be called upon to answer questions at the discretion of the
legislative body or committee. Making these reports and proceedings public also means that
they can indirectly contribute to the public awareness and education work that the ethics
body undertakes.

4.1 Complaints, Investigations, and Enforcement

There is little point in having so many ethics rules if they cannot be enforced. Unfortunately,
public sector ethics regimes can be more effective at setting standards for elected officials
than enforcing those standards. The regimes that apply to unelected public servants tend to
be more easily enforced because they are either legislative in nature or can be incorporated
into employment contracts. This means they can either be enforced by the courts or a
negative finding can lead to disciplinary action in the employment context.

There are several key elements that these complaint regimes tend to have in common. The
first is the mechanism by which a complaint can be made and by whom it can be filed. Some
ethics bodies are permitted to accept complaints from elected officials, from the legislative
body as a whole (through a motion that is passed in the House, for example), and/or from
members of the public. While it may seem counterintuitive to limit who can make a
complaint, ethics regimes that provide for absolutely anyone to file a complaint are
exceedingly rare. Some regimes have gotten around the need to be granular about who
should have standing to file a complaint by allowing the ethics body or its head to exercise
their own initiative in determining what to investigate. Providing these initiative rights is
arguably ideal because it places an expectation on ethics bodies to stay proactive while also
allowing them to accept complaints from the public without being obligated to investigate.

The next significant component of these regimes is the requirements regarding the quality
of evidence needed from a complainant in order to support a request for investigation.
Complaints processes can sometimes be used improperly and as political battlegrounds,
with an elected official from one party filing a complaint against an official from a different
party in order to engage the poor optics that would inevitably result from being subject to
an ethics investigation. Complaints are also sometimes made that appear to be nothing more
than fishing expeditions. This happens when the complainant submits low quality evidence,
like newspaper articles or speculative postings they have copied from social media, and
makes no specific arguments as to which rule(s) has been broken. It may be an inefficient
use of resources to require or to even allow an ethics body to investigate when the complaint
itself does not meet some basic evidentiary standards.

This leads to the next element: should it be mandatory for an ethics body to conduct an
investigation into any complaint it receives or should the body be empowered to exercise its
discretion? Regardless of which option is chosen, should the ethics body also have a duty to
acknowledge every complaint? Should it be required to file a public report about every
complaint, even if a complaint was deemed to be unfounded or vexatious? Each regime is
different, but these are important questions that are generally addressed in their design.

Finally, some regimes are very detailed when it comes to establishing procedures.
Procedural clarity is a mark of fairness in the legal system and allows stakeholders to know
what they can expect. That said, most ethics bodies are not subject to the requirements of
administrative law and procedural clarity is rarely mandated. It is accordingly nothing more
than good practice standards that dictate whether complaint and investigation processes
will be published in order for stakeholders to know what to expect and to provide for
investigatory efficiency.

                                                                                                          871
GLOBAL CORRUPTION

      4.1.1 Discipline and Sanctions

Assuming an investigation into an alleged violation of an ethics rule results in a negative
finding, what are the possible outcomes and next steps? How, if at all, can an ethics body
correct and/or shape the behaviour of public officials through its work? As noted, public
sector ethics regimes that apply to elected officials are generally not autonomous and fully
independent. These regimes are tasked with conducting investigations and reporting their
results back to the relevant legislative bodies. Those legislative bodies must then consider
whether they agree with the findings and what, if anything, they would like to do about
them. Disciplinary measures of any real consequence against a person who was
democratically elected to office are then agreed to and meted out by their peers who were
also democratically elected to office. Despite this apparent conflict, investigation reports
nevertheless do have influence and can have a significant impact on ongoing behaviour and
ethical compliance more generally. Ethics bodies have a variety of disciplinary tools at their
disposal, including:

      (1) Name and Shame

In a line of work where a person's reputation is perhaps as central to their role as their official
duties, being featured in a report where the investigator concludes that there has been an
ethics violation can be particularly damaging. The public wants desperately to trust that
their politicians are serving in public office for the right reasons and that they are not taking
improper advantage of their power or influence over the public purse. An investigation
report may conclude that a public official has violated the ethics rules, but that the violation
was inadvertent or did not rise to a level of such significance that disciplinary measures
ought to be taken. A report could also recommend that a public official apologize publicly
for a minor lapse of judgement, which is typically what happens when the official has been
cooperative and has acknowledged or corrected their mistake. Regardless of whether a
report recommends a significant penalty, the mere act of publishing a report explaining that
an elected official has done wrong can have a profound and lasting impact on that person's
reputation and career. This has been coined "naming and shaming."

      (2) Salary Reduction or Suspension

An investigation report might recommend that a public official's salary be withheld for a
period of time (e.g., until a debt has been repaid) or that they be suspended from the position
either temporarily or permanently, with or without pay. These are significant penalties,
however, and ethics bodies are unlikely to be given the authority needed to impose them.
Suggesting such a penalty in response to a violation adds to the public shaming of that
official and adds higher stakes to the subsequent discussion by the legislative body who is
ultimately responsible for providing reprimand. They may choose to proceed with the
recommended action, or they may choose something different, but the mere
recommendation can do damage regardless.

      (3) Monetary Penalties or Fines

An increasingly popular disciplinary tool is the administrative monetary penalty (AMP).
The right to issue AMPs must be explicitly provided to the ethics body and the limits of that

872                2022
                                   CHAPTER 10 PUBLIC OFFICIALS & CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

power must be made very clear. In Canada, for example, the CIEC has the power to issue
AMPs to certain designated public office holders (including members of cabinet) if they fail
to fulfil certain administrative responsibilities under the Act. This includes, for example,
filing annual private disclosure statements and statements of material change. Whether an
AMP would be enforceable by a court of law if an elected official refused to pay is unclear,
but it is perhaps reasonable to expect that the legislative body would exercise its right to
discipline its own members and issue that same penalty if an elected member did refuse to
pay.

      (4) Impeachment

The US Constitution contains "emoluments clauses." The foreign emoluments clause
prohibits the US President from "profiting, gaining from or receiving any other advantage
from a foreign or domestic government."136 This clause was added to the Constitution
because many believed the Articles of Confederation were written in such a way that they
might help give rise to a very weak central government. The Framers of the Constitution
were accordingly concerned that an influential foreign state might be able to "sway the
President's decision-making to its own benefit."137 There is also a domestic emoluments
clause which prohibits the President receiving any sort of advantage from any state
government.138 The remedy for violating one of these clauses has always been
impeachment.139

Impeachment is both a political and legal process. Articles of impeachment are drafted and
laid before the House of Representatives and then, if passed, before the Senate. The articles
set out the allegations against the President and legislators vote on whether they agree to
impeach based on that information. A vote to impeach is only one part of the process, which
typically involves a number of hearings as well. Assuming a President is impeached by both
Houses, they must then decide upon a remedy. Beyond the shame invoked by the
impeachment itself, the Houses must also decide if the violation is worth removal from office
and/or disqualification from holding public office in the future. Impeachment has also been
used in the UK, but the procedure has been considered obsolete since 1806.140

      (5) Removal

In the most egregious cases of misconduct, an elected official can be removed from office by
their peers. This happens very rarely, but there are certainly examples from the UK,141 the

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

US,142 and Canada.143 This may occur when an ethics investigation leads to a criminal
investigation where it is subsequently determined that an elected official has committed a
crime. Removal could also result from serious breaches of the public trust that do not quite
rise to the level of criminality or where criminality cannot be proven to the requisite standard
for criminal guilt.

      4.1.2 Contesting Outcomes

One of the reasons that establishing and communicating clear processes and procedures is
crucial is because people who are the subject of negative findings will often want a way to
appeal those findings and reports. Appeal mechanisms provide a means to ensure that ethics
bodies are held accountable for their work. Of course, the ability to appeal is a function of
how the ethics regime is structured. If the ethics body is only allowed to report back to the
legislative body, and not to make final decisions about discipline, then it is less likely that
an appeal mechanism will be available with respect to the ethics body's findings.
Parliaments also have an inherent right (i.e., parliamentary privilege) to discipline their own
members, so it is also highly unlikely that an official will be able to appeal a disciplinary
action taken by a parliamentary body. Judicial review may be possible in the context of
regimes that apply to public officials who are not elected, but these are the types of concerns
generally addressed within the instruments that establish each individual regime.

4.2 Criminal Law

Criminal laws exist in every country to prohibit public officials from breaching the public
trust or otherwise taking improper advantage of the benefits afforded by holding public
office. The specific language of the criminal prohibitions will vary slightly by jurisdiction,
but they are most often similar in substance. The Canadian Criminal Code, for example,
includes laws against bribing judicial officers or other government actors,144 committing
frauds on government,145 influencing or negotiating appointments or dealings in offices,146
and committing breaches of trust.147 Ethics bodies are typically required to suspend any
inquiries or investigations into a matter if a related criminal charge is filed. Civil actions can
also be brought against government officials for behaviours that amount to misfeasance in

5. CONCLUSION

The concept of conflict of interest underpins public sector ethics laws, but by no means
defines them. A wide variety of principles, rules, accountability mechanisms, and
educational activities are required to establish and maintain high standards of ethical
conduct. Public sector actors must balance competing interests on a day-to-day basis,
particularly when it comes to policy- and other decision-making. It is in the consistently
tangled web of relationships, interests, and responsibilities that the risk of corruption
surfaces and the need to stay vigilant arises. A principle challenge of public sector ethics
regimes is their legislative nature: the rules are established by those same individuals who
are subject to them. Indeed, this inherent tension sometimes means that they are slow to be
updated and improved. Regimes that become outdated can unfortunately also be quick to
lose their influence over public officials.
While this chapter has offered an overview of the rules and responsibilities in place within
the US, the UK and Canadian regimes, it is important to remember the difference between
ethics and compliance. International organizations like the UN, the OECD and Transparency
International continue to press for higher anti-corruption standards around the world in
order to help foster a culture of public sector ethics. Proactive engagement with and
education about the value of public sector ethics can help inspire countries to establish a
conceptual space within their political cultures, where standards and rules for the conduct
of public officials can emerge, and greater buy-in with underlying principles can be
achieved.

1. INTRODUCTION

Lobbying is an aspect of the public policy-making process in all democratic countries and is
not an inherently corrupt practice.1 Broadly defined, lobbying occurs when special interest
groups engage public officials in an effort to influence decision-making. Lobbyists may
promote corporate interests or advocate for issues of broader public concern. Access to
public officials has become a commodity in most developed nations and influence in the
industry commands significant resources. When undertaken ethically and under the
administration of a robust, transparent regulatory regime, lobbying can promote political
rights and improve government decision-making. Legitimate lobbying practices facilitate
democratic engagement and provide government officials with specialized knowledge.

Involving private interests in the legislative process risks fostering relationships that
perpetuate undue influence, as well as creating routes of preferential access to public
officials. The OECD warns that undue influence in policy-making constitutes a "persistent
risk" in member countries due to the "unbalanced representation of interests in government
advisory groups" and the "revolving door"2 between government and the lobbying
industry. Where access to decision-makers no longer fulfills the public interest, the
legitimacy of lobbying erodes and corruption can follow. A recent Gallup World Poll,
reported on by the OECD, found that only 41.8% of citizens in OECD countries trusted their
government.3 In an era when trust levels in national governments are declining, lobbying
must be perceived by the public as legitimate to be effective. The legitimacy challenge is
exacerbated by the fact that lobbying is generally understood as a practice that advances
special interests.4 Transparency in legislative decision-making is closely related to levels of
public trust in politicians5 and addressing concerns about lobbying is therefore a key lever
for restoring confidence in government.6 As a result, governments must develop lobbying
policy that promotes transparency, integrity, and impartiality in the legislative process.

Policy should reflect modern growth in the lobbying industry globally;7 the number of
lobbyists and lobbying activities have both increased significantly in recent years.8 This
growth has catalyzed social engagement and public concern for greater transparency and
oversight. An opaque lobbying process can enable disproportionate access to decision-
makers and provide unfair advantages for well-funded interests. This inequality suppresses
minority interests and stifles public consultation in policy development.9 The existence of
powerful interests--be they corporate, private or government--and the participatory
character of democracy ensure that lobbying will remain an entrenched practice. As efforts
to engage public officials and influence decision-making continue, concomitant regulation
must be maintained.

This chapter surveys lobbying in the context of corruption and anti-corruption policy
development. The majority of the discussion focuses on relationships between individuals
and government, and opportunities for corruption that are created when private interests
engage government. While public officials are often bound by legislation and ethical codes
of conduct, this chapter addresses primarily the regulation of lobbyists. Section 2 provides
a brief introduction to terminology used throughout this chapter and a summary discussion
of the challenges related to adopting objective definitions for global phenomena such as
corruption and lobbying. Section 3 addresses the relationship between lobbying and
democratic governance, and suggests that while lobbying is an integral component of
democracy, democracy alone does not prevent corruption. Section 4 situates lobbying policy
within broader regulatory frameworks, and recommends five basic principles to guide
public officials in the development of lobbying policy. Sections 5, 6, and 7 contain a
substantive review of lobbying regulatory regimes in the US, the UK, and Canada. Finally,
Section 8 introduces the regulatory environment in the European Union, contrasting
approaches and identifying areas for improvement.

2. TERMINOLOGY

2.1 Defining Lobbying

Although definitions of lobbying abound in academic literature, nongovernmental
publications, and government directives, there is no global consensus on what constitutes
"lobbying" or a "lobbying activity." However, defining these terms is a prerequisite to
developing meaningful policy and identifying the scope of acceptable lobbying conduct. The

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

OECD advises that statutory definitions of lobbying must be "robust, comprehensive, and
sufficiently explicit to prevent loopholes and misinterpretation."10

It has been suggested that "the word `lobbying' has seldom been used the same way twice
by those studying the topic."11 A report published by the OECD in 2021 demonstrates that
the definition of lobbying varies across member countries.12 The Public Relations Institute of
Ireland (PRII) suggests a typical and generally useful definition of lobbying:

          the specific efforts to influence public decision making either by pressing
          for change in policy or seeking to prevent such change. It consists of
          representations to any public officeholder on any aspect of policy or any
          measure implementing that policy, or any matter being considered, or
          which is likely to be considered by a public body.13

The European Commission provides another general definition, describing lobbying as "any
solicited communication, oral or written, with a public official [intended] to influence
legislation, policy or administrative decisions."14 According to Transparency International,
lobbying is "any direct or indirect communication with public officials, political decision-
makers or representatives for the purposes of influencing public decision-making carried
out by or on behalf of any organized group,"15 and includes all activities intended to
influence policy and decision-making of governmental, bureaucratic or similar institutions.
As with corruption, statutory definitions of lobbying must reflect domestic environments.

The broad spectrum of language used to describe lobbying reflects the complexities of the
influence industry. Dialogue between citizens and government can manifest directly
between interest groups and legislators or through indirect, grassroots modes of influence
intended to affect legislative processes by shifting public opinion.16 Lobbyists may work on
behalf of corporate interests, citizens groups or other organizations advocating for the public
interest. A formal distinction can be made between promoters of the general, public interest

and lobbying for the corporate, private interest.17 Individual citizen and collective group
access to legislators is a fundamental democratic political right; this right extends to any
kind of special interest group, including corporate lobbies. Pharmaceutical, electronics
manufacturing and equipment, real estate, and energy sectors are among the most
commonly represented commercial interests.18 Public interest groups advocate for trade
unions, environmental concerns, industry transparency and regulation, among other civil
society interests. Inclusive definitions of "lobbyist" recognize the following as members of
the influence industry: lobbying consultancy firms, in-house lobbyists employed by
corporations, lawyers working in public affairs departments for law firms and corporations,
think-tanks, and expert groups created by government for the purpose of policy
development.

Identifying lobbyists and what constitutes lobbying is essential for effective regulation;
distinguishing between research, advisory, and lobbying efforts ensures that policy is
neither under-inclusive nor overbroad.19 Generally, broad definitions are preferable because
under-inclusive legislation can encourage private interests to exploit unregulated
alternatives to engage public officials.20

2.2 Terminology in a Comparative Context

Transnational economic, social, and political interdependencies have increased dramatically
in recent years. Lobbying strategies and practices are evolving lockstep with the global
socio-political landscape.21 General constructions of corruption and lobbying are helpful to
identify the boundaries of academic and legal inquiry, but do not easily accommodate
comparative analysis. This is due in part to discourse variability across social, political, and
economic lines. Unique legal approaches to corruption and lobbying regulation reflect
broader social and institutional differences across jurisdictions. Divergent domestic
lobbying practices have resulted in different rules for the same actors in different
jurisdictions and inconsistent compliance at the international level.22 It is therefore
important that policy-makers develop specific anti-corruption policies. Further, the
literature must acknowledge that legal (and extra-judicial) practices are the result of, and
operate within, broader social structures.

19 Categorizing lobbyists and demarcating regulatory boundaries is a challenging task for policy-
makers. For example, the meta-category of think-tanks includes state-funded policy research
organizations, politically affiliated bodies and largely independent academic associations and
institutions.
20 For example, think-tanks and law firms have rejected calls to join the lobbyist registries in the EU.
These organizations provide alternatives for individuals who want to engage politicians outside of
the regulatory regime.

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

While regional variation persists, globalization has somewhat standardized expectations of
conduct and corruption discourse, largely through the proliferation of global corporations.
In addition, as discussed in Chapter 1, the wide application of international instruments,
such as UNCAC, suggests that there is an agreed "core of corruption" generally understood
as undesirable and inconsistent with principles of good governance and global economic
relations. Still, there is no universal definition of corruption, and the terminology common
to global economic discourse and comparative study may advance ideological and regional
preferences. For example, conceptions of corruption in the context of development rhetoric
have been criticized as a "disguise [for] political agendas, or ... the interests of the
powerful."23 To this extent, corruption is a normative concept, influenced by regional moral,
ethical, and institutional traditions and practices. Lawmakers must recognize corruption
discourse as being used and developed "by particular actors [representing] particular sets
of practices,"24 and that anti-corruption policies should be harmonious with both domestic
needs and global expectations.

Historically, corruption and lobbying research has focused on single-country case studies.
As discussed in Chapter 1, comparative literature on corruption is scarce due to the secrecy
of corruption, the lack of a universal definition, and cultural differences across countries.
While cultural differences may challenge comparative study and the development of
objective definitions, domestic policy must reflect the unique "diversity, capacities and
resources of lobbying entities."25

3. LOBBYING AND DEMOCRACY

Lobbying is a centuries-old component of governmental decision-making.26 As will be
argued in Section 3.1, lobbying is generally considered an acceptable and necessary practice
in modern democracy, and lobbying regulation is widely recognized as a legitimate act of
political participation.27 When undertaken appropriately, lobbying can "strengthen
accountability in government and the participation of citizens in policymaking"28 by
providing a valuable source of dialogue between citizens and public officials.29 Lobbyists
operate as guides, intermediaries, and interlocutors, providing services to interest groups
by navigating the complexities of modern democratic decision-making. Not only do
lobbyists provide an important conduit for citizens to communicate with government, they

also promulgate valuable and often specialized information that advances informed
decision-making and sound policy development.

Legitimate lobbying activities therefore improve the quality of public decision-making and
promote the democratic right to petition government.30 Unfettered access to public officials,
however, presents opportunities for private interests to exercise undue influence. Influence
peddling perpetuates corruption and is a major threat to democratic governance founded
on equality and popular representation.31 When the procurement of government favour
becomes the province of vested and well-funded interests, lobbying can significantly
damage public trust in the integrity of democratic institutions. Without effective regulation,
the influence industry can become an "exclusive and elite pursuit."32 Without adequate
oversight and enforcement, regulation is ineffective.

3.1 Democracy as an Indicator of Transparency

Corruption, in the sense of the misuse of public office for private gain, is inherently
inconsistent with basic principles of democracy: openness and equality.33 Democratic
processes empower citizens to detect and punish corruption.34 For lobbying to maintain
legitimacy and align with democratic principles, it must operate subject to disclosure and
transparency requirements. Legitimate lobbying practices democratize the flow of
information between voters and public officials, and mobilize citizen engagement in the
legislative process. Dialogue is an essential component of effective democratic governance,
and lobbying is an "important element of the democratic discussion and decision-making
process."35

While theoretically consistent, the relationship between ethical lobbying practices and
democracy is imperfect. As expected, according to Transparency International's Corruption
Perceptions Index (CPI), the least corrupt nations are, almost without exception,
democratic.36 However, corruption persists despite democratization, economic
liberalization, and the adoption of transnational laws and domestic enforcement designed
to eliminate it.37 Corruption levels in democratic states are moderated by the state's degree

of poverty, national culture, and perceptions towards corruption,38 and strength of key social
institutions.39

Various studies indicate an association between economic underdevelopment and
corruption regardless of whether a state is democratic or non-democratic; however, the
types of corruption may vary depending on governance types. Countries with more
economic opportunities than political ones, such as China, experience different types of
corruption than countries with more political opportunities than economic ones, like India.
These disparities engender different relationships between citizens and government.
Economic problems encourage patronage. Patronage in turn encourages personal
relationships with individual decision-makers, rather than broad affiliations with political
parties.40 Where there is restricted individual economic freedom, economic success depends
less on market forces and more on the ability to influence decision-makers.41 In contrast,
systems that feature limited political access tend to centralize transactions among small
groups of local government actors. These officials are typically appointed bureaucrats who
do not rely on personal followings.

Strong social ties between corporations and government increase the likelihood of
corruption.42 Robust disclosure and transparency rules are often resisted by political leaders
out of self-interest.43 Further, enforcement faces significant challenges because these
political-private relations often operate behind closed doors. Increased transparency
through disclosure would subject these interactions to scrutiny and reduce opportunities for
corruption.

Transparency International has documented a number of immediate measures that can be
adopted to reduce the risk of interest groups exerting undue influence on public policy
development:

      regulations on lobbying;

      regulations on the movement of individuals between the administration and
          the private sector (revolving door);

      regulations on conflict of interest;

      regulations on political finance;

      regulation on private sector competition;

      rules on transparent decision-making and access to information; and

4. REGULATORY SCHEMES

4.1 Lobbying and the Broader Regulatory Framework

Most regulatory regimes distinguish unscrupulous lobbying activity from criminal conduct.
Distinct statutory instruments address lobbying as opposed to criminal conduct, such as
bribery, government fraud, and extortion. In addition to criminal law, other areas of law and
practice work alongside lobbying rules to create a broad regulatory regime aimed at
promoting government integrity. These include election campaign and party funding rules
(see Chapter 14), government procurement rules (see Chapter 12), conflict of interest rules
(see Chapter 10), whistleblower protection (see Chapter 13), and access to government
information infrastructure.

4.2 Principles

Public authorities have the primary responsibility to establish standards of conduct for
public officials who may be targeted by lobbying and to enact legislation that regulates the
lobbying industry.45 Authorities must not only ensure that they act in accordance with these
obligations, but also that the lobbyists they engage with operate ethically and legally and
adhere to relevant principles, rules, and procedures. This dual responsibility reflects the role
of public officials in promoting impartiality, integrity, and transparency in government.

Robust regulation and ethical standards are necessary to maintain integrity in the decision-
making process and, consequently, public confidence in government institutions. If lobbyist
registration and disclosure are not mandatory, transparency is compromised and lobbying
activities risk undermining public trust in government. As discussed, undisclosed
relationships with and disproportionate access to public officials can lead to corruption.46
Lobbying commands the mobilization of significant private resources; the application of
these resources may enable unfettered access to public officials that can lead to powerful
private interests gaining influence at the expense of the public interest.47

Corporate lobbies have significantly greater resources at their disposal compared to public
interest groups. Without effective regulation, financial disparity provides well-funded lobby
groups privileged access to decision-makers. Deep pockets and preferential access allow
corporate lobbies to engage in comprehensive and prolonged lobbying efforts that are

difficult for public interest groups to match.48 These inequalities undermine democratic
decision-making because those with greater resources become more capable of influencing
policy.49 In the interest of generating confidence in government, lobbying rules, policies and
practices should level the playing field by promoting integrity, fairness in public policy-
making, openness and inclusiveness, reliability, and responsiveness.50 Effective regulation
will leverage citizen engagement,51 access to information and principles of open
government. 52

States face a number of choices when developing standards and procedures for lobbying,
such as:

      Definition of lobbyist;
      Definition of lobbying;
      Regulatory scheme (voluntary/mandatory/self-regulated); and
      Enforcement mechanisms.

There is no single appropriate approach to regulation. A review of experiences in North
America and Europe suggests that effective regulation results from an incremental process
of political learning and reflects domestic cultural, political, and constitutional norms.53
Policies from one jurisdiction cannot be uncritically transplanted to another. Nevertheless,
while approaches to regulation may vary, effective policies contain many common elements.

In 2010, the OECD released the Recommendation of the Council on Principles for Transparency
and Integrity in Lobbying.54 These principles are intended to guide executive and legislative
decision-makers in the development of regulatory and policy options that meet public
expectations for transparency and integrity in lobbying. However, in 2021, the OECD found
these principles to be relevant, yet inadequate, due to their focus on lobbying registries,

rather than the diverse practices and mitigation strategies available.55 The OECD has
ordered a review of these principles and recommendations, which will be completed in
2023.56

The OECD also provides five elements that lobbying legislation or regulation should
address to enhance good governance, transparency, and accountability:

1. Standards and rules that adequately address public concerns and conform to
     the socio-political, legal and administrative context;

2. Scope of legislation or regulation that suitably defines the actors and activities
     covered;

3. Standards and procedures for disclosing information on key aspects of
     lobbying such as its intent, beneficiaries and targets;

4. Enforceable standards of conduct for fostering a culture of integrity in
     lobbying; and

5. Enhancing effective regulation by putting in place a coherent spectrum of
     strategies and practices for securing compliance.57

These elements do not suggest a "one size fits all" approach to regulation. Instead, they
provide the fundamental building blocks from which legislators can develop meaningful
policy tailored to political, legal, and cultural circumstances. The following section
elaborates on these elements.

4.2.1  Standards Consistent with Socio-Political, Legal, and Administrative
       Context

Legislation and policy must consider constitutional traditions and rights, including the
expectations of civil society regarding access to government and participation in the
decision-making process. Across many countries, social expectations and codified rights
vary widely, affecting how citizens petition government, seek interest representation, and
develop social relationships with government.58 Effective standards reflect a country's
democratic and constitutional traditions and interact with wider legal and administrative
frameworks (including codes of conduct for public officials, rules on election campaign
financing, provisions providing protection for whistleblowers, access to information laws,
and conflict of interest rules).59 The regulatory framework and its constituent parts should
foster integrity, transparency, accountability, and accessibility in government.60

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

Public concern surrounding integrity in the lobbying industry may arise for various reasons.
Understanding public concern allows legislators to appropriately define the parameters of
policy development and respond meaningfully to the impetus for regulation. The OECD has
identified three primary social concerns: (1) accessibility to decision-makers (2) integrity of
government decision-making, and (3) conduct in lobbying.61 Each of these concerns
demands unique policy solutions. Considering the root causes of public concern will help
identify the most appropriate regulatory response and measures for achieving compliance.

      4.2.2 Scope of Policy on Lobbying

The efficacy of lobbying regulation depends largely on how lobbying is defined and who is
considered a lobbyist. Policy should consider the different types of entities and individuals
that may engage public officials and the theatres where lobbying activities may occur.
Regulation should reflect the complexities of modern legislative decision-making and the
need to promote equity among all stakeholders. Regulations should primarily target
individuals or organizations who receive remuneration for lobbying activities.62 However,
varying levels of public concern may demand a more encapsulating definition. According
to the OECD, "where transparency and integrity are the principle goals of legislation,
effectiveness is best achieved if definitions are broad and inclusive"63 and capture formal
and informal lobbying in traditional and modern theatres of lobby activity. Inclusive policies
promote equal access to decision-makers and address public concern over integrity in the
lobbying industry.

Policy should balance the public's interest in transparency and integrity with the
government's interest in soliciting outside expertise. Broad definitions and rigorous
disclosure requirements risk deterring informed members of the public from approaching
government.64 Regulations overburdened by excessive disclosure and reporting
requirements will encourage non-compliance and consequently fail to meet their
objectives.65 Lobbyists may be hesitant to meet registration requirements out of a concern
that disclosure will provide competitors with proprietary intelligence and indications of
their work.66 As a result, lobbyists may be encouraged to obscure disclosures or avoid
compliance altogether. Lawmakers must balance the risks of mandating specific information
disclosures with the challenges of accepting only summary descriptions of lobbyists'
objectives.

Legislation that provides broad definitions of lobbyists and lobbying may include
exclusionary provisions that exempt specific actors or activities from disclosure

requirements.67 For example, legislation may exempt representatives of other governments
acting in their official capacity or communications that are undertaken within the public
realm. Compliance nonetheless relies on definitions and exclusions that are unambiguous
and clearly understood by lobbyists and public officials.

      4.2.3 Standards and Procedures for Information Collection and Disclosure

Standards for transparency, accountability, and integrity in lobbying are the foundation for
the appropriate conduct of public officials and lobbyists. Transparency "enable[s] the public
to know who is lobbying for what, in order to allow it to take suitable precautions to protect
its interest."68 Enhancing transparency is the primary objective of lobbying regulation and
effective disclosure is the surest method to promote accountability. Regulations and
practices that mandate disclosure of information related to communications between public
officials and lobbyists empower citizens to exercise their right of public scrutiny.69 Because
transparency enhances the perceived and actual integrity of government, policy must not
only target lobbyists, but also public officials who make decisions and may be susceptible to
bribery and other forms of corruption.70

Disclosure rules determine the type of information that must be shared, the nature of
registration and reporting, and the manner in which information is communicated to the
public. Sparse information will render regulations meaningless, while excessive data may
bury meaningful information and encourage non-compliance.71 At a minimum, lobbyists
should identify their clients, beneficiaries, and objectives. Requirements must be
harmonized with existing norms and laws related to confidential and privileged
information; legitimate expectations of openness must be balanced against privacy rights
and economic interests in protecting proprietary information. Regulations that avoid
excessive demands and address privacy interests will facilitate disclosure of pertinent but
parsimonious information.72 Disclosure requirements should solicit lobbyists to identify the
intent of their lobbying activity, their employer and beneficiaries, and the individuals,
offices, and institutions targeted by their lobbying.73 It is important that disclosure is timely
and that updates are made periodically. Information should be readily available and
technology should be utilized to encourage compliance and facilitate public access.

      4.2.4 Standards of Conduct Fostering a Culture of Integrity

Lobbying requires the participation of both government and interest groups. As "it takes
two to lobby" lobbyists and public officials share the responsibility of maintaining the
integrity of regulatory schemes. Self-regulation through professional codes may be sufficient
to inculcate a culture of professional ethics in the lobbying industry; however, the OECD
notes that while voluntary codes may be capable of providing clear guidance, their
application is "not stringent enough to change the behaviour of those who abuse legitimate
means of influence."74 Codes of conduct are intended to promote principles of behaviour
harmonious with those of good governance--honesty, transparency, and professionalism.
Without sufficient measures and resources to enforce rules and apply sanctions, self-
regulation may fall short of meeting its objectives. Social concern surrounding the conduct
of lobbyists may require government intervention through the codification and enforcement
of professional standards.

There are three types of codes of conduct that may affect lobbyist operations: professional
codes or self-regulation; employment and post-employment codes for current and former
public office holders; and statutory or institutional codes. Together, these instruments help
provide the social license and public support necessary for lobbyists to operate.

Professional codes are usually created by lobbyists themselves. They promote ethical
standards from within, and are often developed and implemented on an ad hoc basis.
Because enforcement is limited, the OECD concluded in 2012 that professional codes are
largely ineffective.75 Employment and post-employment codes prescribe the conduct of
public officials in their interactions with lobbyists. They often apply during and following
an official's term in public office.

These rules and procedures reflect broader democratic principles and promote public
confidence in government decision-making. Public officials should ensure their engagement
with lobbyists avoids preferential treatment, conforms to legal requirements of information
disclosure, enhances transparency, and avoids conflicts of interest. Meeting these
obligations may require "revolving door" provisions for public officials leaving office.
Former public officials equipped with knowledge and access to current decision-makers are
a valuable commodity for lobbyists. They may maintain favour with former staff and
therefore retain the capacity to informally influence decision-making. Revolving door
provisions mandate "cooling-off" periods during which former public officials must not
lobby their former organizations. "Reverse revolving door" provisions prevent former
lobbyists from influencing policy reform from the inside. Together, these restrictions
minimize the transfer of confidential information, ensure lobbyists and government operate
at arm's length and maintain public trust in government.

      4.2.5 Mechanisms Encouraging Compliance

It is widely recognized that compliance is greatest where regulators utilize a gamut of
enforcement strategies.76 Soft measures and incentive-based tools, including communication
outreach, education programs, and access to government buildings, should be used with
more coercive sanctions to promote compliance. Communication strategies can be used to
raise awareness of expected standards and mobilize conformity among key actors.
Education programs, primarily targeting lobbyists and public officials, increase
comprehension of rules and policies. Periodic courses complement existing professional
curriculums, such as ethics training. These undertakings support formal reporting
requirements and encourage compliance. Incentives can be used strategically to encourage
compliance. For example, registered lobbyists may be granted access to automatic alert
systems for consultation and release of government documents. Traditional sanctions
include administrative fines and the removal of lobbyists from registries. Regulators may
also develop innovative strategies based on individual experiences and compliance
histories, such as public reporting of improprieties by lobbyists.

To maximize their effect, sanctions must be proportionate and timely. Regulatory authorities
must operate with sufficient independence and resources to ensure meaningful, objective
enforcement. This requires that regulators be insulated from political pressure and
delegated sufficient discretion to initiate investigations and to allocate the nature and extent
of the resources dedicated to each investigation.

5. COMPARATIVE SUMMARY

For more than a century, the US was the only jurisdiction to formally regulate lobbyists.77
Before the early 2000s, only three other countries had implemented lobbying regulation:
Australia, Canada, and Germany.78 Globalization has since led to the adoption of lobbying
policy across cultures and continents. For example, regulatory regimes now exist in the
follow OECD countries: Poland, Hungary, Israel, France, Mexico, Slovenia, Austria, Italy,
the Netherlands, Chile, the UK, and the EU.79 Addressing the relationship between civil
society and government is "increasingly regarded as a desirable and necessary development
in the interests of good government."80

Global economic and political relationships have transferred methods of lobbying between
countries and regions; indeed, many lobbying firms and public interest groups are
themselves multinational organizations.81 However, lobbying standards and rules cannot be

borrowed from one jurisdiction and adopted in another without careful consideration.
Effective policy must reflect the domestic socio-political, legal, and administrative
environment. States possess varying degrees of regulatory competency and experience,
making "political-learning"82 an essential requirement for the development of effective
regulation.83 While globalization has normalized lobbying techniques, culturally specific
lobbying strategies continue to reflect longstanding, localized social relationships between
citizens and government.

Domestic approaches to lobbying regulation reflect regional value systems, political
structures, and legislative objectives. For example, constitutional documents prescribe some
limits to lobby regulation in Canada and the US. In order to maintain confidence in
government, lawmakers must preserve traditional modes of representation and access to
public officials.84 This is increasingly difficult when international trade and governance
structures demand globally normalized standards. Nonetheless, effective regulation will be
tailored to accommodate the political culture, governmental system, social partnerships, and
norms of the society in which it operates.85

Unlike the experience of the European Union, corporate lobbies in the US, the UK, and
Canada rarely participate directly in policy-making and remain on the periphery of the
legislative process. In the EU, lobbyists commonly hold positions on internal working
groups and legislative consultative bodies.86 It is not uncommon for industry to participate
in expert groups directly involved in policy development.87

The political and economic systems in the US, and to a lesser extent, Canada and the UK,
facilitate easy entry into the lobbying industry; motivated and well-resourced individuals
should find few barriers. Since it is reasonable for individuals to pay third parties to promote
their interests, lobbying undertakings often involve an element of compensation. The

corporations, some of which generate annual revenues that dwarf the GDP of entire countries. Trade
policy is developed with the economic best interests of the home country in mind. In the EU,
corporate lobbies were integral in the development and implementation of the Global Europe trade
strategy. This trade agenda intends to create open markets in developing countries and has the
potential to significantly alter the economies of non-EU nations. Subsequent trade deals with South
Africa have resulted in a nearly 50 percent increase in European imports, undercutting local
producers, triggering unemployment and exacerbating South Africa's trade deficit. When the balance
of power hangs heavily in favour of corporate lobbies, policy development may succumb to business
interests at the expense of domestic and global public interests. For more information, see: European
Commission, Communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the European
Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions -- Global Europe: Competing in the
World--A Contribution to the EU's Growth and Jobs Strategy, COM(2006) 567 (2006).
82 In this context, political learning refers to the process whereby lawmakers draft legislation in
response to acute incidents, such as corruption scandals. For more information, see Section 4, where
it is suggested that lobbying policy should be forward-thinking rather than reactionary.

flexible and capitalist-driven North American systems necessitate regulation and
transparency. The American legislative process endows individual lawmakers with
significant influence over legislation. This creates an environment in which lobbyists often
target individual public officials, rather than political parties or levels of government. This
is particularly the case where the executive branch is the primary source of legislative
change, as it is in Canada, the UK and the EU.88 On the other hand, in many European
countries, corporatist systems have historically played a significant role in policy
development. Lobbying evolved alongside pre-existing relationships between industry and
government, and corporate interests therefore continue to enjoy a high level of integration
within European policy-making processes.89 As such, the impetus for lobbyist registration is
less clear for corporate groups, because corporate participation is historically a common and
accepted practice.90

6. REGULATORY FRAMEWORK AND CONTEXT

In Canada and the US, lobbying regulation also exists in varying degrees at the provincial
or state and municipal levels.91 In the UK, rules and requirements for lobbyists and public
officials vary between the House of Commons, House of Lords and devolved Assemblies
and Parliaments in Wales, Northern Ireland, and Scotland. It should be noted that while
lobbying schemes below the federal government level are an important source of regulation
for the industry, they are outside the scope of this chapter.

6.1 US

      6.1.1 Governance Structure

The US has a republican system of government. At the national level, individual state
governments send representatives to the legislative branch (Congress) composed of the
House of Representatives and Senate. The President leads the executive branch of the federal
government. Power is broadly diffused in the US, and there are many decision-making
intervals that present the opportunity for lobbyists to engage public officials.

      6.1.2 Regulatory Framework

Lobbying in the US is protected by the first amendment to the Constitution, which states:
"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free
exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people

91 At the provincial level, Alberta, British Columbia, Saskatchewan, New Brunswick, Newfoundland
and Labrador, Nova Scotia, Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec have lobbying registration regimes. At
the municipal level, Ottawa and Toronto have implemented lobbying registries.

peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances."92 The
Lobbying Disclosure Act (LDA) took effect in 1996 and constitutes the legal framework
governing federal lobbying registration and reporting. In 2007, the Honest Leadership and
Open Government Act (HLOGA)93 was enacted and amended the LDA. The HLOGA modified
the thresholds and definitions of lobbying activities, changed the frequency of reporting for
registered lobbyists and lobbying firms, and added additional disclosure requirements.94 In
2009, a Presidential Executive Order further enhanced lobbying regulation.95 Filings are
made jointly to the Secretary of the Senate and Clerk of the House of Representatives. These
officials have the authority to provide guidance and assistance on the registration and
reporting requirements of the LDA, and, where necessary, verify and inquire to ensure the
accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of registrations and reports.96

      6.1.3 Summary

In 2019, a record $3.51 billion was spent on federal lobbying in the US. In 2020, that record
was surpassed by an annual turnover of over $3.53 billion.97 At that time, there were over
11,500 registered lobbyists in Washington, DC, representing the highest density of lobbyists
in the world.98 The US scored 67 on the 2020 Transparency International CPI and was ranked
25th out of 180 countries surveyed in regard to perceived corruption.99 It seems likely that
the perceptions of higher levels of lobbying will result in higher perceptions of corruption.

6.2 UK

      6.2.1 Governance Structure

The political system in the UK is known as the "Westminster model." The UK Parliament is
comprised of a lower chamber, the House of Commons, and an upper chamber, the House
of Lords. The House of Commons is made up of 650 elected Members of Parliament (MPs).
The party with the most MPs forms the Government and its leader becomes the Prime
Minister. The House of Lords is made up of unelected representatives, who can be

hereditary peers, bishops, experts or those appointed by the Queen. Cabinet Ministers are
appointed from the members of both chambers to head various departments. Bills can be
introduced in either chamber by Ministers or MPs and must be approved by both chambers,
except financial bills, which need only the approval of the House of Commons. In addition

to the House of Lords and House of Commons, in 1997-98, the UK devolved powers to three

nations, creating Legislative Assemblies in Wales and Northern Ireland, and a Parliament in
Scotland.

      6.2.2 Regulatory Framework

The regulatory framework in the UK has undergone many changes. Prior to 2014, the UK
depended solely on self-regulation by lobbying professionals. After 2014, three professional
associations emerged: the Chartered Institute of Public Relations (CIPR), the Public
Relations Consultants Association (PRCA), and the Association of Professional Political
Consultants (APPC). However, in 2018, the APPC merged with PRCA. Members of the CIPR
are individuals, while members of PRCA are organizations. Both associations require
members to adhere to a code of conduct and run registers for UK lobbyists.100

In a 2009 inquiry, the Public Administration Select Committee deemed the self-regulatory
regime inadequate.101 In 2010, the government began proactively publishing information on
Ministers' meetings with lobbyists, but these disclosures do not include whom lobbyists
represent. In order to fill this gap and supplement the self-regulatory regime, the
Transparency of Lobbying, Non-Party Campaigning and Trade Union Administration Act 2014
(TLA) was enacted in January 2014.102 The TLA requires consultant lobbyists to disclose the
names of clients through the Register of Consultant Lobbyists, which was launched in March
2015.103 There were 143 lobbyist registrations under the TLA in March 2020, compared to 140
the previous year.104 The Registrar is independent of government and the lobbying industry.
The goal of the TLA is to balance openness with the freedom of lobbyists to represent others
and the encouragement of public engagement with policy-making.105

In 2016, the Lobbying (Transparency) Bill, a private members' bill, was introduced in the
House of Lords.106 Although it was never passed into law, the proposed legislation would
have repealed and replaced the current lobbyist regime under the TLA.107 The bill proposed
to broaden the scope of the register to include more in-house lobbyists and expand

disclosure requirements for lobbyists.108 The bill also proposed that the Registrar issue a
mandatory code of conduct to replace the voluntary codes of conduct that exist in the UK.109

The UK also regulates the lobbying activities of Members of Parliament. Although a
tradition of representation of special interests by MPs exists in the UK and many MPs hold
paid consultancies related to their roles as parliamentarians, scandals involving lobbying
led to debates over consultancies and eventually to regulation.110 The Resolution of July 15,
1947, as amended in 1995 and 2002, provides that:

          No Member of the House shall, in consideration of any remuneration, fee,
          payment, reward or benefit in kind, direct or indirect, which the Member or
          any member of his or her family has received, is receiving, or expects to
          receive--

                (i) advocate or initiate any cause or matter on behalf or any
                     outside body or individual, or

                (ii) urge any other Member of either House of Parliament,
                     including Ministers, to do so,

          by means of any speech, Question, Motion, introduction of a Bill or
          amendment to a Motion or Bill, or any approach, whether oral or in writing,
          to Ministers or servants of the Crown.

The code of conduct for MPs also prohibits paid advocacy in any House proceedings and
lays out principles to follow including integrity, honesty, and openness.111 The House of
Lords has a register for "peers consultancies and similar financial interests in lobbying for
clients"112 and peers are not allowed to vote or speak on behalf of consultancy clients if
clients have a direct interest in lobbying. Staff of MPs and journalists are also subject to
controls due to their access to Westminster and resultant ability to exert influence.113

108 UK, HL Deb (9 September 2016), vol 774, cols 1257-1258 (Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe). In the
debate, Lord Brooke pointed out problems with the current register: "The current register has been in
operation for 18 months, and it has failed abysmally. Three-quarters of the industry working in-
house are exempt; of the consultant lobbyists covered, just 136 firms are signed up, a long way from
the 700-plus registrants that the Government anticipated when pushing the Bill through. In the last
quarter, one-third of the UK's registrants are effectively blank submissions, with no clients having
met the very high bar that triggers registration. There is no requirement in current law to provide
details of whom they have met in government, nor whom they are seeking to influence. It is little
wonder that in the past six months the register has been viewed by the public a total of 363 times,
which is an average of just two people visiting the website a day."

      6.2.3 Summary

The lobbying industry in the UK employs approximately 4,000 lobbyists and is worth £2
billion, making it the third largest lobbying industry in the world.114 However, caution
should be used when quantifying the lobbying industry in the UK. As Transparency
International UK notes, "[d]ue to lack of reporting and data, there is no comprehensive
information on the scale or nature of lobbying activity in the UK."115

Lobbying can occur anytime throughout the legislative process, as well as during drafting
of a bill and after enactment when secondary regulation is created. Aside from Ministers,
both MPs and peers are targeted by lobbyists, since both can influence policy by asking
Ministers questions and tabling, scrutinizing and voting on bills. Parliamentary staff, who
mainly draft positions on policies and bills, may also be targeted, along with the personal
staff of Cabinet Ministers. Members of the civil service may also be subject to lobbying due
to their role in drafting bills and secondary regulation.116

The UK scored 77 on the 2020 Transparency International CPI and was ranked tied for 11th
out of 180 countries surveyed in regard to perceived corruption.117

6.3 Canada

      6.3.1 Governance Structure

Canada is a federal country with ten provinces and three territories. The Parliament of
Canada has two lawmaking bodies: elected members of Parliament in the lower chamber or
the House of Commons, and appointed Senators in the upper chamber or the Senate. The
leader of the party with the majority of seats in the House of Commons appoints a core
executive of (usually elected) public officials called the Cabinet. The Cabinet has the greatest
lawmaking power subject to the ultimate approval of Parliament. The legislative process is
highly centralized and lobbying activities therefore focus on a relatively small number of
key actors.

      6.3.2 Regulatory Framework

The Canadian Constitution embraces the rule of law, democracy, and respect for democratic
institutions.118 Lobbying regulation must promote these principles, and lobbying

that lobbying can also be informal and take place outside of formal government meetings, such as
during political party conferences. Lobbying may also target civil servants who are not required to
disclose lobbying activity and meetings.

undertakings must not compromise the democratic process.119 In 2006, the Federal
Accountability Act (FAA) received Royal Assent and amended the Lobbyists Registration Act
(LRA). Following the enactment of the FAA, the Lobbying Act (LA) was enacted in 2008 to
provide comprehensive lobbying regulation at the federal level in Canada.120 The LA
mandates basic registration requirements for individuals paid to communicate with federal
public office holders and is supplemented by the Lobbyists' Code of Conduct (LCC). Following
extensive consultation, the current version of the LCC came into force on December 1,
2015.121 The purpose of the LCC is to promote transparency and integrity in government
decision-making by adopting mandatory ethical standards for lobbyists.122 The
Commissioner of Lobbying is an independent Officer of Parliament under the LA and has a
mandate to develop and ensure compliance with the LCC and maintain the Registry of
Lobbyists.123

      6.3.3 Summary

In 2020-2021, the Lobbyist Registrar reported a record high number of lobbyists registered
at 8,005, with a monthly average of over 6,200.124 Most registrants are consultant lobbyists,
followed by in-house lobbyists for organizations and in-house lobbyists for corporations.125
Consultant lobbyists must file one return per client and it is therefore not uncommon for
consultants to have multiple active registrations. The House of Commons is the most
common target of lobbying undertakings, followed by Innovation, Science and Eco
nomic Development Canada, the Prime Minister's Office, Finance Canada and the Senate.
The Prime Minister's Office was the third most contacted government institution in 2013-
2014. The first budget for the Office of the Commissioner of Lobbying was CDN$467,000 in

7. ELEMENTS OF LOBBYING REGULATION

Each country's laws and policies must define the activities that constitute lobbying and the
actors involved in lobbying undertakings. Theatres of lobbying may be limited to formal
engagements, such as consultative committees, or extend to include informal discussions
and meetings. Generally, two classes of actors are targeted by regulation: public officials and
lobbyists. Government officials captured by legislation are usually identified expressly in
the statute that governs their conduct. Lobbyists are usually defined according to their
conduct or engagement with government officials.

7.1 Definition of Government Officials

      7.1.1 US

The LDA defines Public Officials (POs), Executive Branch Officials (EBOs) and Legislative
Branch Officials (LBOs). POs are any elected or appointed officials, or employees of a federal,
state, or local unit of government.129 EBOs include: the President; the Vice-President; officers
and employees of the Executive Office of the President; any official serving in an Executive
Level I-V position; any members of the uniformed services serving at grade 0-7 or above;
and Schedule C employees.130 LBOs include: members of Congress; elected officers of either
the House or the Senate; employees or any other individual functioning in the capacity of
an employee who works for a Member, committee, leadership staff of either the Senate or
House; a joint committee of Congress; a working group or caucus organized to provide
services to Members; and any other Legislative Branch employee serving in a position
described under section 10(1) of the Ethics in Government Act (EGA), 1978.131

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

      7.1.2 UK

The TLA disclosure requirements only apply when lobbyists communicate on behalf of a
client with "a Minister of the Crown or permanent secretaries,"132 or an equivalent listed in
the TLA. The communication must be made while the official holds the post in order to
trigger the legislation. A Minister of the Crown is defined in section 2(6) as a "holder of an
office in the government, and includes the Treasury." Equivalents to permanent secretaries
include, for example, the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Chief Executive of Her
Majesty's Revenue and Customs. Transparency International UK criticizes this narrow
definition, which excludes communications with parliamentarians, Assembly members, and
less senior civil servants.133

      7.1.3 Canada

The LA has broad application and distinguishes between public office holders (POHs) and
designated public office holders (DPOHs). POHs refer to virtually all persons occupying an
elected or appointed position in the federal government, including members of the House
of Commons, the Senate, and their staff.134 DPOHs include key decision-makers within
government, senior public officials, senators, and certain staff of the Leader of the Official
Opposition.135 DPOHs are subject to post-employment, or revolving door, limitations and
lobbyists have particular disclosure requirements for undertakings with DPOHs.

7.2 Definition of Lobbyist

Lobbying is no longer restricted to firm or consultancy lobbyists. Lobbyist ranks now
include employees of corporations engaged in government relations, employees of public
interest organizations, lawyers, think-tanks, and governments from other jurisdictions.

      7.2.1 US

The LDA defines a "lobbyist" as:

          any individual who is employed or retained by a client for financial or other
          compensation for services that include more than one lobbying contact,
          other than an individual whose lobbying activities constitute less than 20
          percent of the time engaged in the services provided by such individual to
          that client or a six month period.136

      7.2.2 UK

The TLA only applies to "consultant lobbyists," which are defined as individuals who make
communications with senior decision-makers about the workings of government in
exchange for payment.137 Only lobbyists registered under the Value Added Tax Act 1994 are
within the scope of the definition, which excludes smaller businesses. Further exclusions are
discussed below.

      7.2.3 Canada

The LA identifies three types of lobbyists:

           Consultant lobbyists are individuals who lobby on behalf of clients
                and must register.

           In-house lobbyists (corporate) are senior office holders of corporations
                who carry on commercial activities for financial gain and must register
                when one or more employees lobby and lobby undertakings constitute
                20% or more of their duties.

           In-house lobbyists (organizations) are senior officers of organizations
                that pursue non-profit objectives and must register when one or more
                employees lobby and lobby undertakings constitute 20% or more of
                their duties.138

7.3 Definition of Lobbying Activity

      7.3.1 US

Under the LDA, "lobbying activities" include:

          lobbying contacts and efforts in support of such contacts, including
          preparation and planning activities, research and other background work
          that is intended, at the time it is performed, for use in contacts and co-
          ordination with the lobbying activities of others.139

"Lobbying contacts" are "oral or written communications" with executive or legislative
branch officials.140 Unlike in Canada,141 grass-roots activities that do not directly target
public officials do not require registration.142

      7.3.2 UK

"Consultant lobbying" in the TLA is defined as follows in the Registrar's guidance:

          Organisations and individuals are considered to be carrying out the
          business of consultant lobbying if they fulfil the following criteria:

          They have made direct oral, written or electronic communications
          personally to:

          a Minister of the Crown, Permanent Secretary (or equivalents) currently in
          post, referred to as "Government Representatives"

          relating to:

               - The development, adoption or modification of any proposal of the
                    Government to make or amend primary or subordinate legislation

               - The development, adoption or modification of any other policy of
                    the government

               - The taking of any steps by the Government in relation to any
                    contract, grant, financial assistance, licence or authorisation; or

               - The exercise of any other function of government.

          This communication is made in the course of a business and in return for
          payment on behalf of a client, or payment is received with the expectation
          that the communication will be made at a later date.143

          They are registered under the Value Added Tax Act (1994).144

Transparency International UK has criticized the ambiguity surrounding "direct contact"
with a Minister or Permanent Secretary.145 The Registrar's guidance states that "[m]aking
communications personally means communicating directly with a Government
Representative by name or by title, using oral, written or electronic communication. An

142 There is one exception. The LDA, § 15, permits organizations that are required to file under §
6033(b)(8) of the Internal Revenue Code to use tax law definitions of lobbying in lieu of LDA
definitions. Tax law definitions include grass-roots lobbying.

example would be writing an email to a Minister of the Crown in which the email is
addressed to the Minister specifically."146 Communications with a government department,
special adviser, administrator, or a private secretary are not covered by the Act. It is
irrelevant whether the government official or lobbyist initiates communication.147

The CIPR's voluntary and universal UK Lobbying Register defines "lobbying services" as:

          activities which are carried out in the course of a business for the purpose
          of:

                a) influencing government, or
                b) advising others how to influence government.148

      7.3.3 Canada

The LA designates certain activities as lobbying only when carried out for compensation.149
Activities that must be reported include communicating with a POH in respect of:

           the development of any legislative proposal by the Government of
                Canada or by a member of the Senate or House of Commons;

           the introduction of any Bill or resolution in either House of Parliament
                of the passage, defeat or amendment of any Bill or resolution that is
                before either House of Parliament;

           the making or amendment of any regulation as defined in subsection
                2(1) of the Statutory Instruments Act;

           the development or amendment of any policy or program of the
                Government of Canada;

           the awarding of any grant, contribution or other financial benefit by or
                on behalf of Her Majesty in right of Canada; and

           the awarding of any contract by or on behalf of Her Majesty in right of
                Canada. 150

Individuals must also file a return if they undertake to arrange a meeting between a POH
and any other person.151

The Canadian experience demonstrates the importance of precise vocabulary in achieving
regulatory compliance. Legislation preceding the LA defined lobbyist activity as
communication with public office holders "in an attempt to influence." Enforcement was

stymied by the evidentiary burdens of establishing that an "attempt to influence" had
occurred. As a result, the LA instead describes lobbying activities as communications "in
respect of" legislation and policies.152

7.4 Exclusions from the Definitions

Exclusions provide greater certainty in the application of laws and must therefore be clearly
defined and unambiguous. Exclusionary provisions identify either classes of actors or
specific activities that are exempt from registration and disclosure requirements. Activities
commonly excluded comprise those that involve a pre-existing element of public disclosure,
such as appearances before legislative committees or commissions, and other activities of an
inherently public nature.

      7.4.1 US

The LDA's definition of "lobbying contact" excludes communications that are:

      made by a public official acting in his or her capacity as a public official;
      made by a media representative, if the purpose of the communication is to

          gather and disseminate news and information to the public;
      made in materials that are available to the public through a medium of mass

          communication;
      made on behalf of a foreign government, country or political party and

          disclosed under the Foreign Agents Registration Act;
      administrative requests for meetings, etc., that do not attempt to influence a

          covered official;
      made during participation in an advisory committee subject to the Federal

          Advisory Committee Act;
      testimony given before a committee, subcommittee, or task force of Congress;
      information provided in writing in response to a request for specific

          information from a covered official;
      communications that are compelled by statute, such as those required by

          subpoena;
      impossible to report without disclosing information that is not permitted to be

          disclosed by law;
      made to an official in an agency regarding a) criminal or civil inquiries,

          investigations or proceedings or b) filings that the government is required to
          keep confidential, if the agency is responsible for the proceedings or filings;
      made on the record in a public proceeding;

      petitions to agencies that are intended to be on the public record;
      made on behalf of an individual that only relates to that individual's personal

          matters, unless the communication is made to a covered executive branch
          official, or a legislative branch official in the case of communications regarding
          legislation for the relief of the individual;

      disclosures protected under the Whistle Blower Protection Act, the Inspector
          General Act or other statutes;

      made by churches and religious orders that are exempt from filing federal
          income tax returns;

      made by officials of self-regulatory organizations registered with the Securities
          Exchange Commission or the Commodities Future Trading Commission; or

      made by the SEC or Commodities Future Trading Commission in relation to
          their regulatory responsibilities under statute.153

If an individual's communications fall into the above exceptions, they will not be considered
a lobbyist under the LDA and will not be required to register. The definition of "lobbyist"
also excludes individuals whose lobbying activities constitute less than 20% of the time spent
working for a particular client over a six-month period, although that individual may still
fit the description of a lobbyist in relation to other clients. Finally, even if an individual meets
the definition of "lobbyist," they are not required to register if the total income from their
lobbying activities on behalf of a particular client does not exceed $5,000, or if their total
expenses for lobbying activities do not exceed $20,000 within six months.

      7.4.2 UK

The TLA lists a number of exclusions from its definition of consultant lobbyists. The
Registrar's guidance summarizes these exclusions as follows:

           Individuals and organisations not registered under the Value Added
                Tax Act 1994;

           Individuals making communications in the course of their employer's
                business (only the employer is required to be registered);

           Officials or employees of governments of countries other than the
                United Kingdom;

           International organisations as defined by section 1 of the International
                Organisations Act 1968 such as the United Nations;

           `In-house' lobbyists defined as those who are lobbying on behalf of
                their own organisation;

           Organisations that carry on a business which is mainly non-lobbying
                and communicate with Ministers in a way that is incidental to the
                main course of their business; and

           Organisations that represent a particular class or body of people and
                whose income is derived wholly from those people, and where the
                lobbying is incidental to their general activity.154

The last exemption listed would apply, for example, to a workers' group lobbying on behalf
of its own members. Charities are also excluded unless they receive payment from another
person for lobbying on that person's behalf.155 The definition of "consultancy lobbying" has
been heavily criticized for its narrow scope by groups such as Transparency International
UK. Particularly contentious are the exclusions of in-house lobbyists and those whose
business is not primarily comprised of lobbying. Transparency International UK argues that
the TLA's inadequate scope "will prevent it from regulating the majority of lobbying that
occurs."156 The APPC, one of the UK's former self-regulating professional associations,
estimated that the TLA would capture only 1% of all lobbying activity in the UK.157 The
Registrar of Consultant Lobbyists commented that the law was "very narrowly drafted."158
Agreeing that the definitions were too narrow, the CIPR launched a universal voluntary
register called the UK Lobbying Register in July 2015, open to all lobbyists and binding them
to a code of conduct.159 In contrast to these perspectives, some commentators have
characterized the TLA's minimal scope as "proportionate" to the problem and important for
promoting healthy lobbying.160

      7.4.3 Canada

Canada's exclusions reflect its constitutional and social environment. Exclusions for
representatives of provincial governments161 reflect Canadian federalism, and exclusions for
Aboriginal councils and governments162 reflect Canada's colonial history and constitutional
protection of Aboriginal rights. The following communications are also exempt from the
LA's application:

      submissions to Parliamentary committees that are a matter of public record;

      communications on behalf of an individual or group to a POH about the
          enforcement, interpretation or application of a statute by that POH in relation
          to that individual or group; and

      requests for information submitted to a POH.163

7.5 Disclosure Requirements

Disclosure must satisfy the transparency objectives of regulation. Policy should require
lobbyists to provide information that facilitates public scrutiny of their activity and provides
public officials with sufficient knowledge to balance the competing interests of lobbyists and
the public at large. As discussed, meaningful disclosure must be concise. Satisfying the
public interest in transparency may necessitate disclosure of the beneficiaries of lobbyists'
efforts. The OECD has provided guidance for minimum requirements of disclosure rules:
information must be relevant to legislative goals of transparency, integrity and efficacy;
demands must result in information that is pertinent, yet parsimonious; and technology
must be utilized to create accessible information infrastructure.164 Identifying the direct
beneficiaries of lobbying is much simpler for corporate interest lobbyists compared to public
interest lobbyists. Nonetheless, policy should favour transparency from all lobbyists165 and
require disclosure of clients, lobbying objectives, and how the undertaking is funded.166
Ultimately, the usefulness of disclosure requirements depends on the manner in which
information is to be used and collected.167 Under the relevant statutory instruments in
Canada, the US, and the UK, disclosure is mandatory.168

      7.5.1 Content of Disclosure

Lobbyists must be required to disclose all relevant information in a manner conducive to
public reporting. Legislation that intends to uncover who is behind lobbying often provides
financial thresholds for reporting.169 Expenditures may provide a useful metric by which the
public can comprehend the stakes involved and public officials can identify disparities in
access between public interests and well-funded lobby groups.170 The LDA applies earnings
thresholds that trigger registration requirements and estimates of income and expenditures.
The prevailing view in Canada is that the complexities of analyzing and monitoring financial
disclosure outweigh the public benefit achieved through transparency.171 There have been
calls in Europe to strengthen disclosure requirements surrounding financial information.172
Financial disclosure is viewed as necessary for overall lobbying transparency, the
identification of lobbyists and beneficiaries, and the prevention of misleading and unethical

lobbying.173 However, financial regulations are difficult to assess174 and exhaustive
regulations may frustrate compliance and overburden regulators.175

Requiring registrants to disclose the targets of lobbying efforts advances the public interest
in transparency. In order to define "lobbying activities" with sufficient precision and
delineate the theatres of lobbying captured under regulation, policy should identify the
decision-making points where lobbyists commonly attempt to exert influence.

          7.5.1.1 US

In the US, lobbyists must report any oral or written communication to a "covered executive
branch official or a covered legislative branch official"176 made on behalf of a client.
Lobbyists must also identify the Houses of Congress and federal agencies contacted on
behalf of clients.177

Lobbying firms must file separate registrations for each client if total income from that client
for lobbying activities is equal to or greater than $2,500 during a quarterly period.178
Organizations employing in-house lobbyists must file a single registration if total expenses
for lobbying activities are equal to or greater than $10,000 during a quarterly period.179
Registrants must disclose:

      the name, address, business telephone number, and principal place of business
          of the registrant and a general description of its business or activities;

      the name, address and principal place of business of the registrant's client and
          a general description of its business or activities;

      the name, address and principal place of business of any organization, other
          than the client, that contributes more than $10,000 toward the lobbying
          activities of the registrant in a semi-annual period and in whole or in major
          part plans, supervises, or controls such lobbying activities;

      a statement on the general issue areas the registrant expects to engage in
          lobbying activities on behalf of the client;

      the names of the registrant's employees who have acted or who will act as a
          lobbyist on behalf of the client and whether those employees have been a
          covered executive or legislative branch official in the past twenty years;

      whether the client is a State or local government or a department, agency,
          special purpose district, or other instrumentality controlled by one or more
          State or local governments; and

          principal place of business, amount of contribution exceeding $5000 to
          lobbying activities, and approximate percentage of ownership in the client of
          any foreign entity.180

The HLOGA amended the LDA to require semi-annual disclosure of campaign and
presidential library contributions. These reports are due within 30 days of the end of the
semi-annual reporting period.181 The LDA is unique in its financial disclosure requirements;
Canada's LA does not adequately address transparency concerns related to campaign
financing.

          7.5.1.2 UK

The disclosure requirements under the TLA are minimal. As noted above, registration
requirements under the TLA are only triggered when a lobbyist or lobbying firm fits the
narrow definition of "consultant lobbyist." Registrants submit quarterly returns disclosing
clients for whom they have made communications amounting to consultant lobbying in the
previous three months. Individual communications and the number of communications on
behalf of particular clients are not disclosed.182 Upon registration, lobbyists and lobbying
firms must also disclose contact information, the name of any parent company, alternative
trading names, and the names of directors or partners. Finally, consultant lobbyists must
declare whether they follow a code of conduct and where to find that code of conduct.
Lobbyists are not required to disclose who they are lobbying or the subject matter of their
advocacy.

Until the two organizations merged in 2018, the APPC and PRCA maintained their own
publicly available disclosure registries with client identities. The PRCA required disclosure
of the identities of lobbying entities, lobbyists, and staff. The newly created Public Affairs
Board, operated under PRCA, now oversees registration.183 The CIPR also launched the UK
Lobbying Register (UKLR) in July 2015. Any lobbyists, including in-house lobbyists and
non-CIPR members, may register and the register is accessible to the public for free online.184

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

Outside of legislative requirements, UK government departments proactively disclose
quarterly data on lobbyist meetings of government ministers and permanent secretaries and
have done so since 2010. Data is available online.185 The Cabinet Office monitors compliance
with disclosure requirements and makes reports to Parliament on each department every
six months, producing some pressure to comply.186 However, Transparency International
UK argues that "data quality and depth of information is very poor" because disclosure of
data is often delayed, only formal meetings are disclosed and information on the subject
matter of meetings is scarce.187 Parliamentarians, Assembly members, less senior civil
servants, local government officials and public agencies are not required to publish any
information on meetings.188 These gaps have led Transparency International UK to conclude
that "[t]he level of transparency over lobbying meetings with legislators and the civil service
is negligible to non-existent."189

In terms of lobbying by UK legislators, the Resolution of November 6, 1947, as amended in
1995 and 2002, requires MPs to disclose any consultancies or undertakings which might
involve remuneration for the provision of advice on lobbying. MPs are not prohibited from
entering into agreements to provide services in their parliamentary capacity, but must
register these agreements. The House of Lords also has a register for peers' consultancies or
other financial interests in lobbying for clients.190 MPs' support staff must register any
gainful occupation that might be advantaged due to their access to Parliament, and
journalists must report any other paid employment relevant to their privileged access to
Parliament.191

Finally, All-Party Parliamentary Groups in the UK, which meet to discuss certain issue areas,
must register the names of officers of the group, benefits received by the group, and the
source of those benefits.192 These disclosure requirements respond to the ability of lobby
groups to gain access to all-party groups and improperly influence the MPs involved
through financing and provision of hospitality.193

          7.5.1.3 Canada

Canada's reporting requirements are expansive, requiring lobbyists to identify
communication or intent to communicate with "any department or other governmental
institution."194

Under our paraphrasing of the LA, all three categories of lobbyists must disclose extensive
information, including:

      the name and business address of the individual and, if applicable, the name
          and business address of the firm where the individual is engaged in business;

      the name and business address of the client and the name and business
          address of any person or organization that, to the knowledge of the individual,
          controls or directs the activities of the client and has a direct interest in the
          outcome of the individuals activities on behalf of the client;

      where the client is a corporation, the name and business address of each
          subsidiary of the corporation that, to the knowledge of the individual, has a
          direct interest in the outcome of the individual's activities on behalf of the
          client;

      where the client is a corporation that is a subsidiary of any other corporation,
          the name and business address of that other corporation;

      where the client is a coalition, the name and business address of each
          corporation or organization that is a member of the coalition;

      where the client is funded in whole or in part by a government or government
          agency, the name of the government or agency and the amount of funding
          received;

      particulars to identify the subject-matter in respect of which the individual
          undertakes to communicate with a public office holder or to arrange a
          meeting, and any other information respecting the subject-matter that is
          prescribed;

      particulars to identify any relevant legislative proposal, bill, resolution,
          regulation, policy, program, grant, contribution, financial benefit or contract;

      if the individual is a former public office holder, a description of the offices
          held, which of those offices, if any, qualified the individual as a designated
          public office holder and the date on which the individual last ceased to hold
          such a designated public office;

      the name of any department or other governmental institution in which any
          public office holder with whom the individual communicates in respect of a
          matter regulated by the LA or expects to communicate or with whom a
          meeting is, or is to be, arranged, is employed or serves; and

      if the individual undertakes to communicate with a public office holder in
          respect of any matter regulated by the LA, particulars to identify any
          communication technique that the individual uses or expects to use in
          connection with the communication with the public office holder, including
          any appeals to members of the public through the mass media or by direct
          communication that seek to persuade those members of the public to
          communicate directly with a public office holder in an attempt to place

                                                                                                          911

          pressure on the public office holder to endorse a particular opinion (grass-
          roots communication).195

The Lobbyists Registration Regulations provide the form and manner in which lobbyists must
file returns under the LA.196

      7.5.2 Timing

Unambiguous and strict reporting deadlines are as important as the content of reporting. In
order to provide the public with meaningful information and the opportunity to mobilize
counter-lobby initiatives, disclosure must be made and updated in a timely fashion.

          7.5.2.1 US

The LDA requires registration within 20 days of either: (1) the date that the
employee/lobbyist was retained to make more than one lobbying contact (and meets the 20%
of time threshold) or, (2) the date the employee/lobbyist makes a second lobbying contact
(and meets the 20% of time threshold). Communications with executive branch officials and
Congressional support staff "serving in the position of a confidential, policy-determining,
policy-making or policy-advocating character"197 qualify as lobbying contacts. Following
initial disclosure, reports must be updated semi-annually thereafter.198

          7.5.2.2 UK

Under the TLA, any organization that intends to engage in consultancy lobbying must apply
to join the Register before doing so.199 Registrants must submit a return listing clients for the
pre-registration quarter.200 Lists of client names are updated quarterly and registrants must
submit returns within two weeks of the end of each quarter.

          7.5.2.3 Canada

In Canada, initial reporting is required within ten days of entering into a lobbying
undertaking,201 and communications with senior public officer holders must be updated
monthly thereafter.202 These communications include telephone calls, in-person meetings,
and video conferences.203 Oral communication with a designated public office holder that is
initiated by someone other than the public office holder and arranged in advance must be

generally require reporting.204

      7.5.3 Procedures for Collection and Disclosure

As mentioned, lobbying regulation has proliferated incrementally around the world. A
consequence of this sporadic development is the creation and adoption of specific
requirements and separate registries for certain industries and different levels of
government. Responding to modern demands for transparency, reporting and disclosure
mechanisms must maximize efficiency while encouraging compliance and facilitating access
to information.

One way to promote compliance and improve accessibility is to utilize electronic filing and
reporting. There are many benefits to electronic filing: lobbyists can submit information
remotely; forms can solicit quantifiable information amenable to data analysis; data store
costs are reduced and archival and retrieval simplified; and, electronic filing facilitates the
use of the internet to decentralize information and improve public access.205 Policies
regarding electronic filing should respect established rules and norms regarding the
publication of private and privileged information, mitigate the risks of information overload
and balance incentives for compliance with risks of disclosing proprietary corporate
intelligence.

          7.5.3.1 US

All documents required by the LDA must be filed electronically.206 The Secretary of the
Senate and Clerk of the House of Representatives are required to maintain all registrations
and reports filed under the LDA and make them accessible to the public over the internet,
free of charge and in "a searchable, sortable and downloadable manner."207

          7.5.3.2 UK

Applications to join the UK Register can be completed online or on paper. The Register is
available online and searchable by lobbyist and client name. Client lists from previous
quarters are available.

          7.5.3.3 Canada

In Canada, the Registry of Lobbyists is the LA's core instrument of transparency.208 Lobbyists
are required to file their returns electronically and the application process is provided in
both official Canadian languages (English and French).209 Information collected under the
LA is a matter of public record accessible over the internet. Anyone may search the database

7.6 Codes of Conduct

Lobbying involves two principal parties: government and interest groups. Because "it takes
two to lobby," lobbyists share responsibility with public officials for maintaining the
integrity of lobby regulatory schemes. As noted in Section 4.2.4, there are three types of
codes. The Canadian system provides an example of a statutory code. The UK and the US
systems provide examples of professional codes or self-regulation. Meaningful lobbying
policy requires oversight of the conduct of public officials that is commensurate with
regulation of lobbyists' behaviour. Many jurisdictions, including Canada, the US, and the
EU, have developed codes of conduct that apply to public officials in their interactions with
lobbyists. 211

      7.6.1 US

Various professional associations for lobbyists in the US require their members to abide by
codes of ethics. Members of the Public Relations Society of America must pledge to abide by
the Society's Code of Ethics (the Code), which lists professional values, such as honesty,
independence, fairness, and provisions of conduct.212 For example, the Code requires
members to reveal causes and sponsors for interests represented, disclose financial interests
in a client's organization and disclose potential conflicts of interest. The Code also includes
examples of improper conduct. The Code is supplemented by Ethical Standards Advisories,
which provide guidance on specific timely issues (e.g., "The Ethical Use of Interns"). The
National Institute for Lobbying and Ethics (NILE) also requires members to abide by its code

of ethics.213 The code endorsed by the NILE is more general and emphasizes principles like
honesty, integrity, and avoiding conflicts of interest.

      7.6.2 UK

The UK relies on professional associations to provide codes of conduct for lobbyists. Each of
the three associations for UK lobbyists has its own code to which members must adhere. The
CIPR's code is fairly general and consists of best practices, not prohibitions.214 Principles
such as integrity, honesty, and competency are emphasized. The CIPR's code does not
prohibit the exchange of gifts or compensation between lobbyists and public officials or the
employment of public officials, and also does not provide for client identity disclosure.215
The APPC's code of conduct was more potent and prohibited lobbyists from providing
financial inducements and employment to public officials.216 It also required registration of
clients and lobbying staff on its own registry. The PRCA's code was aimed specifically at
lobbyists and required public disclosure of clients' names.217 Like the APPC, the PRCA code
prohibited members from hiring MPs, peers, or Assembly members.218 The APPC and PCRA
merger led to a joint Public Affairs Code that replaced the APPC Code of Conduct and the PRCA
Public Affairs and Lobbying Code of Conduct.219 Given that the CIPR runs the UKLR, lobbyists,
who register with the UKLR and are not already subject to a code of conduct, must agree to
abide by the CIPR Code.220

      7.6.3 Canada

The first LCC came into force in 1997. The most recent iteration of the LCC was published in
the Canada Gazette and came into force on December 1, 2015.221 The update ensured that the
LCC was consistent with the LA. As with the LA, the objective of the LCC is to ensure
transparency of communications between lobbyists and government. It is for this reason that
the LCC does not contain provisions that regulate the interactions between lobbyists and

their clients. The LCC also mandates respect for Canada's democratic institutions and
enhanced rules regarding conflict of interest, preferential access, political activities, and the
provision of gifts. Under the LA, the Commissioner of Lobbying is required to develop a
lobbyists' code of conduct222 and has authority to "conduct an investigation if he or she has
reason to believe ... that an investigation is necessary to ensure compliance with the Act or
Code."223 Canada is the only jurisdiction to legislate a mandatory code of conduct for
lobbyists and the LCC is a statutory component of the lobbyist regulation regime.224 The
purpose of the LCC is to "assure the Canadian public that lobbyists are required to adhere
to high ethical standards, with a view to conserving and enhancing public confidence and
trust in the integrity, objectivity and impartiality of government decision-making."225
Breaches of the LCC are subject to the Commissioner's investigative reports submitted to
Parliament, but the Commissioner does not have the authority to impose charges or
sanctions under the LA.226 The Commissioner's investigative authority extends beyond
registered lobbyists and applies to all individuals who are engaged in lobbying activity that
is subject to registration.227

The Canadian LCC is structured around three guiding principles: respect for democratic
institutions; openness, integrity, and honesty; and professionalism. These principles animate
a series of related rules:

          Transparency

          Identity and purpose

                1. Lobbyists shall, when making a representation to a public office
                     holder, disclose the identity of the person or organization on whose
                     behalf the representation is made, as well as the reasons for the
                     approach.

          Accurate information

                2. Lobbyists shall provide information that is accurate and factual to
                     public office holders. Moreover, lobbyists shall not knowingly
                     mislead anyone and shall use proper care to avoid doing so
                     inadvertently.

          Duty to Disclose

                3. Lobbyists shall inform each client of their obligations as a lobbyist
                     under the Lobbying Act and the Lobbyists' Code of Conduct.

                4. The responsible officer (the most senior paid employee) of an
                     organization or corporation shall ensure that employees who lobby
                     on the organization's or corporation's behalf are informed of their

                     obligations under the Lobbying Act and the Lobbyists' Code of
                     Conduct.
          Use of Information
                5. A lobbyist shall use and disclose information received from a public
                     office holder only in the manner consistent with the purpose for
                     which it was shared. If a lobbyist obtains a government document
                     they should not have, they shall neither use nor disclose it.
          Conflict of Interest
                6. A lobbyist shall not propose or undertake any action that would
                     place a public office holder in a real or apparent conflict of interest.
          In particular:
          Preferential access
                7. A lobbyist shall not arrange for another person a meeting with a
                     public office holder when the lobbyist and public office holder
                     share a relationship that could reasonably be seen to create a sense
                     of obligation.
                8. A lobbyist shall not lobby a public office holder with whom they
                     share a relationship that could reasonably be seen to create a sense
                     of obligation.
          Political activities
                9. When a lobbyist undertakes political activities on behalf of a person
                     which could reasonably be seen to create a sense of obligation, they
                     may not lobby that person for a specified period if that person is or
                     becomes a public office holder. If that person is an elected official,
                     the lobbyist shall also not lobby staff in their office(s).
          Gifts
                10. To avoid the creation of a sense of obligation, a lobbyist shall not
                     provide or promise a gift, favour, or other benefit to a public office
                     holder, whom they are lobbying or will lobby, which the public
                     officer holder is not allowed to accept.228

7.7 Compliance and Enforcement

Sanctions are an essential component of lobbying regulation but are rarely severe enough to
constitute a true deterrent.229 Enforcement must be impartial, predictable and timely in order
to be effective. Regulatory authorities must operate at arm's length from government, be
sufficiently resourced and endowed with powers to investigate infractions and enforce

228 Office of the Commissioner of Lobbying, The Lobbyists' Code of Conduct, supra note 121 at 5-6.
229 OECD 2014, supra note 1.

                                                                                                          917
GLOBAL CORRUPTION

policy. Lax enforcement of regulation can lead to a "culture of entitlement"230 in government
decision-making. Where illicit lobbying practices and corruption have become normalized
or are viewed as a cost of doing business, sanctions must be paired with educational
initiatives to facilitate the slow development of a culture of integrity. Different systems of
government will generate fewer or greater opportunities for lobbying; opportunities for
corruption will be correspondingly few or abundant. For example, the openness of the
American legislative process fosters not only a competitive advocacy environment, but also
increased opportunities for illegitimate lobbying practices. It is important that legislators
routinely look for evidence that those who lobby are authorized to do so.231

In order for regulations to effectively limit corrupt practices, regulators must have the
authority to investigate contraventions and apply sanctions. Sanctions may take the form of
fines, imprisonment or the removal of privileges, such as access to public officials. The
separation between regulatory and criminal law regimes will often require regulatory
authorities to hand off investigations when criminal activity is uncovered. The implications
of this relationship are two-fold. Disclosure requirements must provide regulatory bodies
with adequate information to assist law enforcement agencies in their investigations. In turn,
law enforcement agencies must follow through with investigations and ensure that
corruption offences are not overtaken by more urgent priorities.

      7.7.1 Sanctions

          7.7.1.1 US

The HLOGA instituted a prohibition of gifts or travel by registered lobbyists to members of
Congress and Congressional employees.232 The Secretary of the Senate and Clerk of the
House of Representatives are responsible for verifying the accuracy, completeness, and
timeliness of registration and reports.233 They must notify any lobbyist in writing that may
be in non-compliance.234 If the lobbyist or lobbying firm fails to provide an appropriate
response, the United States Attorney for the District of Columbia must be alerted within 60
days of the original notice.235 The aggregate number of registrants cited for non-compliance
is publically available online.236 Any individual who fails to remedy a defective filing within
60 days of notice, or otherwise fails to comply with the LDA, may be subject to a fine not
exceeding $200,000.237 Any individual who knowingly and corruptly violates the LDA may
be subject to a period of incarceration not exceeding five years.238

The Public Relations Society of America and the National Institute for Lobbying and Ethics
have no enforcement mechanisms for their codes of ethics. Both will revoke membership if
an individual is convicted of an offense involving lobbying activities. The Society justifies
its lack of internal enforcement and punishment by pointing out the expense and difficulty
of enforcement in the past. Instead, the Society now focuses on promoting and inspiring
ethical values through its Code of Ethics and professional development programs.

          7.7.1.2 UK

Under the TLA, lobbyists commit an offence if they engage in consultancy lobbying without
joining the registry or while their entry in the register is incomplete or inaccurate.239 Failing
to submit complete, accurate quarterly returns on time is also an offence.240 If convicted of
an offence under the Act, offenders are liable for a fine. The Registrar may also impose civil
penalties for conduct amounting to an offence, in which case no due diligence defence is
available.241 Civil penalties may not exceed £7,500.242 Transparency International UK has
criticized this sanction as lacking in deterrent power.243

Both professional associations for lobbyists in the UK can investigate complaints and impose
sanctions for member violations of their codes of conduct. Approximately four formal
complaints and 20-30 informal complaints are received each year by the CIPR, most resolved
through confidential conciliation agreements.244 If conciliation is unsuccessful, a Complaints
Committee or a Disciplinary Committee for particularly egregious conduct takes over.
Committee members are drawn from outside the public relations industry and committees
can request information and call witnesses. From 2007-2012, the CIPR's Complaints
Committee dealt with only one lobbying-related hearing, and the Disciplinary Committee
conducted only two hearings between 2002 and 2012.245 Potential sanctions include
reprimands, an order to repay fees for work involved in the complaint, an order to pay the
CIPR's costs for the complaint process, or expulsion from the CIPR.246 Since APPC and PRCA
merged, the Public Affairs Board investigates complaints against its members. Complaints
are first assessed by independent adjudicators. Prima facie breaches of the Public Affairs Code
are referred to a Professional Practice Panel for hearing. Disciplinary powers of the
Professional Practice Panel include suspension and expulsion.247 The 2009 Public
Administration Select Committee inquiry found that a scarcity of complaints and toothless

nature of the available sanctions contributed to the finding that self-regulation in the UK
was inadequate.248

          7.7.1.3 Canada

The LA contains various penalties and sanctions. It is an offence to fail to file a required
return or knowingly make a false or misleading statement in a return.249 Authorities may
proceed summarily or by indictment. On summary convictions, contraventions may be
subject to a fine not exceeding CDN$50,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding six
months.250 On proceedings by way of indictment, contraventions may be subject to a fine not
exceeding CDN$200,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years.251 Individuals
convicted of an offence under the LA may be prohibited from lobbying for up to two years.252
Although the first conviction under the LA was in 2013--2014,253 the Commissioner of
Lobbying continues to include the number of cases referred to police in every Annual Report.
During the period covered by the 2020-21 Annual Report, for example, the Commissioner
referred three new files to police for investigation.254 As discussed, the LCC allows broad
discretion for the Commissioner to investigate unscrupulous activity. This investigative
authority extends beyond individuals who have registered and applies to all parties who
undertake lobbying activity. Violations are subsequently reported to Parliament,
encouraging compliance through the specter of "naming and shaming" unscrupulous
lobbyists.

      7.7.2 Education Programs

Education programs are less expensive than monitoring, investigating, and prosecuting
misconduct, and the OECD suggests that they may also be more effective.255 These initiatives
promote the legitimate role of lobbying in government decision-making and alert public
officials and lobbyists to registration requirements and codes of conduct. Professional and
industry associations may mandate ethics training as a condition of membership.

          7.7.2.1 US

As in the UK, professional associations like the Public Relations Society of America provide
ethical training to lobbyist members. At the state level, lobbyists in Louisiana, for example,
are required under statute to complete yearly training on the Louisiana Code of Governmental
Ethics.256

          7.7.2.2 UK

In the UK, there is no mandatory ethics or integrity training for lobbyists or public officials.
Resistance to such training exists among public officials, partly due to potential exposure to
ridicule for spending public money on the development of ethical behaviour.257 However,
Transparency International UK recommends the institution of mandatory training.258 The
UK's two professional associations provide training and education for lobbyists. The CIPR
holds voluntary education events and classes and also runs industry-recognized certificate
and diploma programs that incorporate ethical training. The PRCA offers regular, voluntary
training sessions covering a wide range of topics, including ethics and regulation.259

          7.7.2.3 Canada

In Canada, the Office of the Commissioner of Lobbying provides training sessions to help
lobbyists understand the requirements and functioning of the reporting system. Each
registrant in Canada is also assigned a Registration Advisor who provides guidance and
individual support to lobbyists. As a matter of policy, the Office contacts every new
registrant to introduce them to their Registration Advisor and inform them of their
obligations. The Office also meets regularly with federal public officials and management
teams in federal departments and agencies.

      7.7.3 Revolving Door

The "revolving door" between the political world and the lobbying world threatens the
integrity of lobbyists and public confidence in government.260 Revolving door provisions are
intended to limit pre- and post-employment conflicts of interest.261 The OECD defines
conflict of interest as "a conflict between the public duty and private interests of a public
official, in which the public official has private interests which could improperly influence
the performance of their official duties and responsibilities."262 If former lobbyists are free to
assume public sector roles, there is a risk of regulatory and institutional capture. If former
public officials are free to assume positions as lobbyists, they may gain preferential access to
current decision-makers. To prevent potential conflicts of interest, revolving door provisions

on public officials who have worked in the private sector, worked for suppliers to government,
lobbied government, or negotiated public contracts on behalf of private companies prior to public
employment. By contrast, 22 OECD countries impose rules or procedures for post-public
employment.

must prescribe adequate "cooling-off" periods. These periods prohibit public officials from
negotiating future lobbying jobs while in office or undertaking roles in the influence
industry and lobbyists from assuming public sector roles until the proscribed duration has
expired.

          7.7.3.1 US

The LDA contains limited revolving door provisions. Under the LDA, individuals who have
aided a foreign entity in any trade negotiation or dispute with the US are ineligible for
appointment as United States Trade Representative or Deputy United States Trade
Representative.263 As amended by the HLOGA, the United States Code (USC) provides
extensive post-employment restrictions for past public officials. Generally, the USC
prohibits any person who is a former officer or employee of the executive branch of the US
from communicating or appearing before a current public official, with intent to influence
that public official on matters in which the former public official participated substantially
and personally, for a period of two years.264 Notably, the USC, as amended by the HLOGA,
allows former lawmakers to assume lobbying activities provided they do not personally
contact current legislators. The USC prohibitions were reinforced by Obama's 2009 and now
Biden's 2021 Presidential Executive Orders that require all executive agency appointees to
sign an ethics pledge.265 This pledge contains four revolving door prohibitions:

           All Appointees Entering Government. I will not for a period of 2 years
                from the date of my appointment participate in any particular matter
                involving specific parties that is directly and substantially related to my
                former employer or former clients, including regulations and contracts.

                implementing regulations, I agree that I will abide by those restrictions
                for a period of 2 years following the end of my appointment. I will abide
                by these same restrictions with respect to communicating with senior
                White House staff.

           Appointees Leaving Government to Lobby. In addition to abiding by
                the limitations of paragraph 4, I also agree, upon leaving Government
                service, not to lobby any covered executive branch official or non-career
                Senior Executive Service appointee, or engage in any activity on behalf
                of any foreign government or foreign political party which, were it
                undertaken on January 20, 2021, would require that I register under
                FARA, for the remainder of the Administration or 2 years following the
                end of my appointment, whichever is last.266

Executive Orders of this kind are remarkable for two reasons. First, former public officials are
prohibited from lobbying not only their former department or agencies, but the entire
Executive Branch of government. Second, "reverse" revolving door provisions restrict, for
the first time, the ability of lobbyists entering the public service from helping former clients.
Legislation in neither Canada nor the EU contains similar `reverse' revolving door
provisions.

          7.7.3.2 UK

In the UK, revolving door regulation applies to all Crown servants for two years after the
last day of paid service. Senior officials are subject to an automatic cooling-off period of three
months for all outside employment, which can be extended to two years or waived in certain
situations. Senior officials are also prohibited from lobbying the government for two years
after they leave their posts. In some situations, more junior officials will also require
authorization to take new appointments in the two-year period after leaving their posts,
including when potential employment involves lobbying the government. The Advisory
Committee on Business Appointments implements the rules and provides advice.267
Transparency International UK argues that this regime is inadequate, stating:

          Senior civil servants and ministers are required to consult the Advisory
          Committee on Business Appointments (ACoBA) before taking up
          appointments. ACoBA can impose waiting periods on individuals, so that
          they cannot take up appointments until a certain period after leaving office,

          and can advise that appointments should only be taken on condition that
          the individual will not engage in lobbying former colleagues. However, the
          Committee is only an advisory body. There is nothing to stop individuals
          from ignoring its advice.

          A series of high-profile scandals suggest that the ACoBA regime is not
          working. In March 2010, Channel 4's Dispatches documentary showed
          secret recordings of several MPs and former Ministers offering their
          influence and contacts to journalists posing as representatives of a potential
          corporate employer, interested in hiring them for lobbying work. One
          former Cabinet Minister, Stephen Byers, said "I'm a bit like a sort of cab for
          hire" and offered examples of how he had used his influence and contacts
          in the past. [footnotes omitted]268

          7.7.3.3 Canada

In Canada, DPOHs are subject to the LA's five-year prohibition on lobbying after they leave
office.269 This period begins when the DPOH ceases to carry out the functions of their
employment. Anyone who violates the five-year cooling-off period commits an offence and
is liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding CDN$50,000.

8. COMPARING REGULATIONS IN THE EUROPEAN UNION

Brussels boasts the second-highest density of lobbyists in the world, after Washington,
DC.270 Lobbying regulation for European Union (EU) institutions is distinct from that of the
US, the UK, and Canada. The Transparency Register (TR) for lobbyist disclosures is a joint
initiative of the European Parliament (EP) and European Commission (EC). It was launched
in 2011 under Article 27 of the Interinstitutional Agreement on the Transparency Register (IIA).271
Registrants must comply with the Code of Conduct for Interest Representatives (CCIR), which is
codified in Annex III of the IIA. The European Council is not a party to the IIA and the TR
does not extend to lobbying undertakings with the Council.

Unlike the registers in the US, UK, and Canada, registration with the TR is voluntary but
incentivized. The TR is an example of an institutional register, meaning it provides

registrants with access to government institutions.272 Registrants gain access to EC and EP
premises, as well as other advantages such as opportunities to participate as speakers in
committee hearings.273 In order to be eligible to register, individuals and entities must meet
the activity-based definition of lobbying in the IIA, which includes any "activities ... carried
out with the objective of directly or indirectly influencing the formulation or implementation
of policy and the decision-making processes of the EU institutions."274 This definition of
lobbying includes communications with a broader range of government officials than the
US, UK, and Canada. The IIA provides specific examples of lobbying activities, such as
organizing events to which Members, officials or staff of EU institutions are invited.
However, like the UK's TLA, the TR has been criticized for under-inclusiveness, as
registration can be avoided by conducting meetings away from EU premises and
strategically not including lobbyists in expert groups.275 Also, just as formal meetings are
emphasized in the TLA, the EU's TR focuses on formal engagement with EU institutions,
such as appearances before parliamentary and administrative committees, rather than
informal communications.

After registration, registrants will be considered lobbyists and will be bound by the CCIR.
Registrants are also required to self-identify as a certain type of lobbyist or entity, such as
in-house lobbyists, think-tanks, or NGOs.

Registration imports mandatory annual disclosure requirements. Along with general
contact and company information, lobbyists must disclose information on their lobbying
activities and costs, including their lobbying objectives, fields of interest and targeted
policies, and legislative proposals. The Register also provides information on specific
activities in which the registrant engages, such as the registrant's EU initiatives or
participation in EU structures and platforms like expert groups. Unlike the registers in the
US, UK, and Canada, the clients of lobbying firms are not disclosed. The Register is available
online in a searchable database.276

Violations are punished by removal from the Register and resultant loss of incentives.
Serious violations and noncompliance with the CCIR can be punished by removal for up to
two years. Unlike the regimes in the US, the UK, and Canada, since registration is voluntary,
failure to comply is not an offence and is not punishable by fines or incarceration.

9. CONCLUSION

Lobbying regulation is often enacted in the wake of political scandal. Public decision-making
and confidence in government stand to benefit from policy that is forward-looking and

proactive, rather than reactionary.277 The American approach sets a high standard for
disclosure, and the Canadian regime is commendable. More stringent financial disclosure
requirements would enhance the integrity of the Canadian regime. The UK's lobbying
legislation would benefit from a broader definition of lobbying activity and more
demanding and detailed disclosure requirements. Transparency in the EU would be greatly
improved with the adoption of a mandatory registry; mandatory disclosure is the single
most effective way to ensure standards of behaviour in lobbying, reduce corruption and
promote confidence in public office. If a mandatory registry is adopted, the European
Council should be a signatory.

The effectiveness of a lobbying regulatory regime demands that stakeholders are aware of
responsibilities and obligations, and that enforcement mechanisms are objective and robust.
American pluralism has produced a unique community of civil society watchdog groups
that monitor lobby activity generally and in specific policy fields. These groups promote
competency and understanding of lobbying regulations. Similar groups exist in Canada and
the EU; however, in these jurisdictions the government has a greater responsibility to
undertake education and awareness initiatives.

Lobbying remains an important component of democracy and will surely continue to
operate as a mechanism for citizens to communicate with public officials and governments
to acquire information from special interest groups. As jurisdictions such as Canada, the US,
the UK, and the EU continue to improve upon their regulatory regimes, globalization will
cause expectations to develop amongst diplomatic and economic partners. While nations
with fledgling lobbying policy can benefit from lessons learned in other regions, lawmakers
must be mindful of domestic requirements and traditional relationships between
government, commercial interests, and the public at large. Nonetheless, in order for
lobbying to maintain public legitimacy and promote principles of good governance,
regulation must have clearly defined application and standards for information collection
and disclosure that encourage compliance, and should integrate harmoniously within the
broader regulatory and legal regime.

1. INTRODUCTION

Transparency International (TI) defines public procurement as "the acquisition by a
government department or any government-owned institution of goods or services."1
Although large-scale items and projects, such as armaments or infrastructure buildings, are
the most obvious examples of public procurement, the term also refers to the acquisition of
supplies and services including school supplies (such as textbooks), hospital supplies (such
as bed sheets), and financial or legal services.2

This chapter introduces the vast topic of corruption in public procurement.3 After setting
out the context, including the negative effects and prevalence of corruption in public
procurement, the chapter will explore how public procurement works and which industries
suffer from the highest levels of procurement corruption, along with the key elements of
effective procurement systems. It will conclude with a discussion of international legal
instruments and standards for regulating procurement, as well as private and public law
governing the public procurement process in the US, UK, and Canada.

For convenience, many examples of corruption and methods for reducing corruption tend
to be drawn from the most prevalent area of public procurement corruption: the
construction industry. This should not be taken as an indication that procurement
corruption and its prevention are identical in all public procurement sectors. For example,
military defence procurement is typically governed by a process separate from the general
government procurement regime.4 The absence of a full discussion of other sectors and
procurement regimes is primarily a product of the limited space that can be dedicated to the
subject of procurement corruption in this book.

1.1 Adverse Consequences of Corruption in Public Procurement

The World Bank distinguishes between two broad categories of corruption:

     (1) state capture, which refers to actions by individuals, groups, or organizations
          to influence public policy formation by illegally transferring private benefits to
          public officials (i.e., efforts by private actors to shape the institutional
          environment in which they operate); and

    (2) administrative corruption, which refers to the use of the same type of

          corruption and bribes by the same actors to interfere with the proper
          implementation of laws, rules, and regulations.5

Examples of public procurement corruption (i.e., corruption in the context of government
acquisition of goods or services) can be found in either category. Corruption in the nature of
"state capture," for example, may involve attempts by private firms to influence the broader
project appraisal, design, and budgeting process by making illicit campaign contributions.
"Administrative corruption" could include, for example, a bidder's attempt to bribe an
administrative decision-maker in order to secure a lucrative public procurement contract. A
further example would be the giving of a bribe by a contractor to a government engineer or
inspector to "ease up" on their inspection of substandard goods or services provided by the
contractor. Although such actions may be seen by the parties involved as relatively
harmless, the reality is that the effects of corruption in public procurement, no matter how
"small" the act, can be devastating.

Corruption in public procurement can have many detrimental effects. For instance,
corruption often increases the cost and lowers the quality of goods or services acquired while
reducing the likelihood that the goods or services purchased will meet the public's needs.6
As the OECD describes, "Those paying the bribes seek to recover their money by inflating
prices, billing for work not performed, failing to meet contract standards, reducing quality
of work or using inferior materials, in case of public procurement of works. This results in
exaggerated costs and a decrease in quality."7 The OECD estimates that corruption drains
off anywhere between 10-25% of national procurement budgets.8 Furthermore, corruption
in public procurement may distort a country's economy as corrupt officials allocate budgets

based on the bribes they can solicit rather than the needs of the country.9 This encourages
approval of large-scale infrastructure projects because they provide greater opportunities
for corruption ("it is easier to hide bribes and inflated claims in large projects than in small
projects"10). When public infrastructure projects are tainted by corruption, nearly everyone
suffers, and that includes project owners, funders, employees, construction firms and
suppliers, government officials, and the general public.11

Corruption in public procurement can also be detrimental to the environment. To illustrate,
in the Philippines, a contract for a $2 billion nuclear power plant (the Bataan Nuclear Power
Plant) was controversially awarded to Westinghouse, who later admitted to having paid $17
million in commissions to a friend of Ferdinand Marcos, the Filipino dictator.12 The contract
was initially denied, but Marcos reversed the decision. Westinghouse claimed these
commissions were not a bribe. The nuclear reactor sits on a fault line, and if an earthquake
occurs while the nuclear reactor is operational, there is a major risk of nuclear contamination.
The power plant has not been operational or produced any electricity since its completion
in the 1980s. This project was a massive misuse of public funds and would be a health and
environmental nightmare if operational.

Corruption in public procurement can also lead to deaths and serious injuries. For example,
the damage caused by natural disasters such as earthquakes may be magnified where
buildings have not been built or maintained properly as a result of bribery.13 In southern
Italy, a maternity wing of a six-story hospital collapsed and almost no occupants survived.14
Investigation into the incident found that although the planning for the hospital was
designed to code and included adequate materials to prevent the collapse, the building had
not been built to code.15 This failing is suspected to have been linked to Mafia involvement
in Italy's construction sector.16 The builders' disregard for building regulations and the
inspectors' failure to properly control and inspect the building resulted in a preventable
catastrophe and many preventable deaths.

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

The effects of corruption in health sector procurement were felt acutely during the global
COVID-19 pandemic, where corruption led to problems such as "[s]ubstandard ventilators,
grossly overpriced equipment, [and] lucrative contracts awarded to companies with little or
no expertise," as well as "[p]rice rigging and gouging of essential items."17 As Jillian Kohler
and Tom Wright explain, the risk of corruption is heightened during times of emergency,
including public health crises, as vast resources are deployed to "rapidly resolve a critical
and complex problem, often through acquiring limited resources under large amounts of
pressure."18 The authors point to various instances of corruption across the globe during the
COVID-19 crisis:

          Examples of alleged corruption during the pandemic are already bountiful
          in many countries. In an effort to procure N95 face masks, the United States
          Federal Government gave a direct award of US$ 55 million to a company
          that had no experience in supplying medical supplies and no recorded
          employees. In the UK, the government directly procured 3.5 million testing
          kits, which later turned out to be unusable, while a senior procurement
          official for the National Health Service (NHS) in London was reported to
          have traded PPE for private gain. In Brazil, it was reported that the Federal
          Government purchased masks from a supplier with ties to President Jair
          Bolsonaro that were 67 percent more expensive than the other supplier bids
          in the same procurement competition.19

Corruption in public procurement can also have less tangible impacts. For example, it can
lead to an erosion of public confidence in government institutions. As former managing
director of TI Cobus de Swardt writes:

          When the products that citizens ultimately pay for are dangerous,
          inappropriate or costly there will be an inevitable loss of public confidence
          and trust in governments. Corrupted bidding processes also make a
          mockery of the level playing field for businesses, especially for younger,
          innovative companies eager to compete in a fair manner who may not have
          the backdoor contacts to buy contracts.20

Thus, public procurement corruption results not only in immediate, tangible losses to the
public, but also in a deeper erosion of public trust in the government. The effect may be to
drive away good companies who are unwilling to buy their way into procurement contracts,
leaving behind a pool of unscrupulous and inexperienced contractors to carry out the
projects.

The broader implications of a loss of confidence in the state and its institutions are severe.
Professor Larry Diamond observes:

          In the absence of trust, citizens become cynical about their political system
          and disaffected with the existing order. Distrust may produce alienation
          and withdrawal from the political process, leaving behind a shallow, fragile
          state that cannot mobilize national resources or shape a collective vision for
          national development. If it festers for very long, widespread and intense
          distrust may eventually generate a backlash against the political order and
          a search for more radical, anti-system alternatives. Failed states,
          revolutions, civil wars, and other related traumatic failures of governance
          all share in common the absence or collapse of trust.21

1.2 How Much Money is Spent on Public Procurement?

Annually, governments worldwide spend approximately $9.5 trillion on public
procurement projects, which represents 10 to 20% of GDP and up to 50% or more of total
government spending.22 The OECD estimates that corruption costs account for around $2
trillion of this annual procurement budget.23 Broadly speaking, this distorts competition,
compromises the quality of public projects and purchases, wastes taxpayer dollars, and
contributes to endemic corruption, thus eroding trust in government.24 Some procurement
projects--such as the construction of facilities for major sporting events like the Olympics
or the construction of airports--are so large in relation to local economies that cost overruns

extremely difficult to quantify. Even where corrupt activities are identified, it can be very difficult to
trace and calculate the chain of losses that flow from incidences of corruption. It is often practically
impossible to calculate the quantum of loss. See e.g. "Section 1: Understanding the Cost of
Corruption in Relation to Infrastructure Projects" (last updated 10 April 2020), online: Global
Infrastructure Anti-Corruption Centre <www.giaccentre.org/cost_of_corruption.php>.

may distort an entire country or region's economy.25 To the extent that such cost overruns
are due to corruption, corruption contributes to the destabilization of local economies.

1.3 Public Procurement Corruption within Developed Countries

Corruption in public procurement is not only a concern for the developing world. It also
exists in developed countries. Therefore, adequate controls are needed in all countries. The
US spends over $550 billion a year on procurement,26 and although it has extensive laws and
regulations in place, its system is far from free of corruption.27 For example, in 2013, a former
manager of the US Army Corps of Engineers was found guilty of accepting bribes from
construction contractors for certifying bogus and inflated invoices.28 Italy provides another
example:

          Italian economists found that the cost of several major public construction
          projects fell dramatically after the anti-corruption investigations in the early
          nineties. The construction cost of the Milan subway fell from $227 million
          per kilometre in 1991 to $97 million in 1995. The cost of a rail link fell from
          $54 million per kilometre to $26 million, and a new airport terminal is
          estimated to cost $1.3 billion instead of $3.2 billion.29

A further example of public procurement corruption within developed countries is provided
by the findings of the Charbonneau Commission. The Charbonneau Commission, known
officially as the Commission of Inquiry on the Awarding and Management of Public
Contracts in the Construction Industry, was a major public inquiry into corruption in public
contracting in Quebec.30 Justice France Charbonneau chaired the commission, which was
launched on October 19, 2011 by then-Premier Jean Charest. The Commission had a three-
fold mandate:

     1) Examine the existence of schemes and, where appropriate, paint a portrait of
          activities involving collusion and corruption in the provision and management
          of public contracts in the construction industry (including private
          organizations, government enterprises, and municipalities) and include any
          links with the financing of political parties.

     2) Investigate possible infiltration of organized crime in the construction industry.

     3) Consider possible solutions and make recommendations establishing measures
          to identify, reduce, and prevent collusion and corruption in awarding and
          managing public contracts in the construction industry.31

In her final report, Justice Charbonneau concluded that corruption and collusion in the
awarding of government contracts in Quebec were far more widespread than originally
believed.32 Influence peddling was found to be a serious issue in Quebec's construction
sector and organized crime had infiltrated the industry. As Justice Charbonneau writes in
the preamble to the full report, "[t]his inquiry confirmed that there is a real problem in
Quebec, one that was more extensive and ingrained than we could have thought."33

While Quebec has faced significant corruption issues, including ongoing corruption
scandals involving Montreal-based construction company SNC-Lavalin, journalist Barrie
McKenna argues that Quebec's corruption problem extends beyond provincial borders and
affects Canada as a whole.34 He provides three reasons for this assertion: (1) federal tax
money is wasted, (2) the negative reputation of a Canadian company engaging in
international business affects all Canadian companies, and (3) corruption spreads and is not
necessarily stopped by provincial borders.35 He claims that "[i]t defies logic that corruption
would be a way of life in one province and virtually absent in the rest of the country."36

The issue of corruption in Quebec's construction sector was thrust into the spotlight again
in 2018-19 when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was found to have attempted to influence a
decision of the Attorney General and Minister of Justice Jody Wilson-Raybould relating to a

criminal prosecution against SNC-Lavalin on corruption and fraud charges. As outlined in
an August 2019 report published by the Canadian Conflict of Interest and Ethics
Commissioner (Ethics Commissioner),37 SNC-Lavalin was charged in February 2015 with
criminal corruption and fraud offences that allegedly took place between 2001 and 2011. At
the time, Canada did not have a regime to allow remediation agreements, also known as
deferred prosecution agreements (DPAs). In early 2016, SNC-Lavalin began lobbying
government officials to adopt such a regime. Following public consultations, amendments
to the Criminal Code allowing for such a regime were adopted as part of the 2018 federal
budget. On September 4, 2018, the Director of Public Prosecutions informed the Office of the
Minister of Justice and Attorney General that she would not invite SNC-Lavalin to negotiate
a possible remediation agreement. The Prime Minister's Office and the Minister of Finance's
office were then informed of this decision by Ms. WilsonRaybould's office. The Prime
Minister then directed his staff to find a solution that would safeguard SNC-Lavalin's
business interests in Canada and avoid potential adverse economic consequences. Having
reviewed several possible means of intervening in the matter, Ms. WilsonRaybould made
it known that she would not intervene in the Director of Public Prosecutions' decision. The
Ethics Commissioner found that, after doing so, "senior officials under the direction of Prime
Minister Trudeau continued to engage both with SNCLavalin's legal counsel and,
separately, with Ms. Wilson-Raybould and her ministerial staff to influence her decision,
even after SNC-Lavalin had filed an application for a judicial review of the Director of Public
Prosecutions' decision."38 The commissioner found that the Prime Minister attempted "to
circumvent, undermine and ultimately ... to discredit"39 Ms. WilsonRaybould's decision.
The Ethics Commissioner found that the Prime Minister's conduct breached s. 9 of the
Conflict of Interest Act, which prohibits public office holders from using their position to seek
to influence a decision of another person so as to further their own private interests or those
of their relatives or friends, or to improperly further another person's private interests.40

Not long after the Commissioner's report was published in December 2019, a construction
subsidiary of SNC-Lavalin pleaded guilty to one count of fraud over $5,000 under s. 380 of
the Criminal Code in connection with its activities in Libya between 2001 and 2011.41 The
agreed statement of facts submitted in conjunction with this plea noted that SNC-Lavalin
paid $127 million to two shell companies between 2001 and 2011, and about $47 million of
that money was used to reward Saadi Gadhafi, son of the late dictator Muammar Gadhafi,
for helping SNC-Lavalin to secure lucrative construction projects. SNC-Lavalin also paid for

Saadi Gadhafi's personal expenses, including decorating his Toronto condo. As part of the
settlement, SNC-Lavalin agreed to pay a record fine of $280 million, payable in equal
instalments over five years, and to be subject to a three-year probation order. Weeks later,
in January 2020, former SNC-Lavalin executive Sami Bebawi was sentenced to eight years
and six months in prison for fraud, corruption, and proceeds of crime offences in connection
with the same scheme.42

These examples demonstrate that all countries, whether developed or developing, need
effective procedures and laws in place to reduce the opportunity for corruption in public
procurement.

1.4 Importance of Maintaining a Low-Risk Environment

Anti-corruption scholars and practitioners agree that increased opportunities for corruption
have a positive relationship with actual incidences of corruption. It is therefore crucial to
maintain a low-risk environment. The lack of accountability enabled by a loose regulatory
framework produces opportunities for corruption. The World Bank explains the connection
between accountability and decreased corruption risk as follows:

          Accountability ... is the degree to which local governments have to explain
          or justify what they have done or failed to do.... Accountability can be seen
          as the validation of participation, in that the test of whether attempts to
          increase participation prove successful is the extent to which [the public]
          can use participation to hold a local government responsible for its
          actions.... In theory, ... more transparency in local governance should mean
          less scope for corruption, in that dishonest behavior would become more
          easily detectable, punished and discouraged in the future.43

industry most vulnerable to bribery.44 The list below ranks the industries and business
sectors from highest prevalence of foreign bribery to lowest prevalence of foreign bribery:

     1. Public works contracts and construction
     2. Utilities
     3. Real estate, property, legal and business services
     4. Oil and gas
     5. Mining

     15. Banking and finance
     16. Information technology
     17. Civilian aerospace
     18. Light manufacturing
     19. Agriculture

The OECD has reported that almost two-thirds of foreign bribery cases between 1999 and
2014 occurred in four industries: extractive (19%); construction (15%); transportation and
storage (15%); and information and communication (10%).45

TI suggests that the construction industry is particularly vulnerable to bribery because of
the large size and fragmented nature of construction projects, which often involve multiple
contractors and subcontractors.46 The large and complex nature of many construction
projects makes it difficult to monitor payments and implement effective policies and
standards. Since major public infrastructure projects are often "special purpose, one-of-a-
kind deals" that are massive in scale, produce high levels of economic rents, present
difficulties in establishing benchmarks for cost and quality, and can be challenging to

monitor, corruption risks abound.47 Construction projects also involve many "touch points"
at which private actors require government approval, resulting in increased opportunities
for the offering or demanding of bribes.

2.2 Stages and Opportunities for Procurement Corruption

Corruption in public procurement can take many forms and can occur at any time
throughout the procurement process. Most corruption experts agree that the following
factors magnify opportunities for corruption: (1) monopoly of power, (2) wide discretion, (3)
weak accountability, and (4) lack of transparency.48 Government agencies in developing
countries have a greater tendency to display these characteristics, creating more
opportunities for procurement corruption in those countries. Procurement in developing
countries can account for over 20% of the country's GDP, and the high proportion of the
economy occupied by public procurement makes it difficult for companies to find contracts
outside the public sphere.49 This motivates companies to resort to corruption when
competing for contracts in developing countries,50 while public officials in those countries
are often motivated to resort to corruption in order to supplement their low wages.51
Meanwhile, the broad discretion afforded to officials in making procurement decisions and
the lack of capacity to monitor and punish corruption exacerbate opportunities for
corruption.

In "Corruption in the Construction of Public Infrastructure: Critical Issues in Project
Preparation," Jill Wells explores how corruption opportunities arise, especially in the project
selection and project preparation stages of the procurement process for public infrastructure
projects.52 Since public infrastructure projects carry the highest risk for procurement
corruption and consume "roughly one half of all fixed capital investment by
governments,"53 the public infrastructure sector is a worthy area for more detailed analysis.
According to Wells, estimates of bribery payments in public infrastructure construction

"vary globally from 5% to 20% [of construction costs] or even higher."54 However, focusing
solely on bribe payments distorts the overall size and impact of corruption. Wells cites the
work of Charles Kenny, who engages in a broader impact analysis and suggests that the
most harmful forms of corruption for development outcomes are:

          (1) corruption that influences the project appraisal, design, and budgeting
          process by diverting investment towards projects with low returns and
          towards new construction at the expense of maintenance and (2) corruption
          during project implementation that results in substandard construction that
          shortens the life of projects and hence drastically reduces the economic rate
          of return (ERR).55

Wells provides an overview of corruption risks at various stages of the public procurement
process for infrastructure projects:

Procurement scholars and practitioners agree that sound public investment in infrastructure
projects requires an effective public investment management system (PIM system).57 Wells
notes that such management systems should include an analysis of whether the proposed
project is a strategic priority, whether there are alternatives, whether the proposed project is
likely to be economically feasible, and whether the project is likely to survive environmental
and social impact assessments. Before an infrastructure project is chosen, it should be subject
to an independent, professional appraisal to ensure that improper, irrelevant, or corrupt
influences were not driving the project proposal. Once a project is selected, a detailed design
and budget must be prepared in a manner that ensures against, or at least minimizes the risk
of, corruption influencing the design and budget phases.

Public procurement projects face the potential problem of inaccurate estimations of costs
and benefits. First, public officials may promote and support "low-ball" estimates of projects
in order to gain public support for the project. Subsequently, as the project evolves, those
initial estimates may prove to be wildly low. Studies showcase the role that "delusion,

deception, and corruption" play in explaining underperformance with regard to cost
estimates and benefit delivery of major infrastructure projects.58 Research by Flyvbjerg and
Molloy suggests that an important step in curbing corruption is focusing on accurate cost
and benefits estimates at the planning and approval stage. They suggest that "planning
fallacy," a psychological phenomenon that influences planners and project promoters to
"make decisions based on delusional optimism rather than on rational weighing of gains,
losses, and probabilities,"59 contributes to the tendency of projects to run significantly over
budget. Planning fallacy, or "optimism bias," may result in the incorrect tender being
chosen, as it rewards individuals for exaggerating the benefits of their design and
underestimating the cost of the project.60 Optimism bias can also be dangerous because when
contracts are awarded for below their reasonable cost, contractors may cut corners by using
inferior materials and compromising on quality in order to stay within the budget.61

Planners need to be aware of optimism bias in order to take steps to prevent it. Flyvbjerg
and Molloy suggest that strategically implementing procedures to monitor and review
forecasts can assist in reducing the prevalence of corruption and deception in public
procurement.62 Their suggestions include developing financial, professional, or criminal
penalties for "consistent and unjustifiable biases in claims and estimates of costs, benefits,
and risks."63 The Treasury of the UK addressed this issue by denying access to funding for
infrastructure project proposals that do not show that they have accounted for optimism
bias in their planning.64

Corruption that occurs in the planning and project development stages is of particular
concern. Corrupt politicians may choose projects that do not provide significant, or any,
benefit to the public because they know that certain projects allow them to extract more
bribes from contractors or because they owe a contractor a favour. This kind of deliberate
manipulation during project planning is likely to facilitate corrupt acts throughout the
project lifecycle.65 As construction projects provide significant opportunity for corruption,
countries may be infrastructure-heavy and yet have insufficient capacity to maintain and
use the infrastructure. For example, a country may build hospitals that it cannot afford to
staff or supply. As noted by the consulting firm Mott Macdonald, once a public need is found
and officials determine that public funds will be allocated to meet this need, care must be
taken in setting the parameters and budget for the project:

          During the project preparation period, significant opportunities arise for the
          diversion of public resources to favour political or private interests. This

          stage of the project cycle is when some of the worst forms of grand
          corruption and state capture occur. But this is not all. Failures in project
          preparation (whether due to corruption, negligence, or capacity constraints)
          can also open up opportunities for corruption at later stages of the project
          cycle. For example, inadequate project preparation may lead to subsequent
          implementation delays that may require changes that can be manipulated
          to benefit individuals or companies. The preparation stage is especially
          likely to facilitate corrupt acts at a later stage when failures at this stage are
          deliberate.66

It is important to screen out projects with high costs and grossly negative rates of return as
early as possible, as this is the most serious consequence of inadequate project screening.67
Governments spend a significant amount of money on consulting during appraisal and
planning of the project, and thus should ensure projects are feasible and valuable to the
public prior to expending public funds for consulting.68

Wells refers to an index developed by Era Dabla-Norris et al. to measure the efficiency
(effectiveness) of public management of public investments in various countries.69 Wells
summarizes the index and the results of its application:

          The index records the quality and efficiency of the investment process
          across four stages: (1) ex ante project appraisal, (2) project selection and
          budgeting, (3) project implementation, and (4) ex-post evaluation and
          audit.... A total of 71 low and middle income countries were scored on each
          of the four stages. The scoring involved making qualitative assessments on
          17 individual components in each stage, with each component scored on a
          scale of 0 to 4 (with a higher score reflecting better performance). The
          various components were then combined to form a composite PIM index.

          Unsurprisingly, Dabla-Norris et al. (2011) found that low income countries
          and oil exporting countries had the lowest overall scores. The overall
          median score was 1.68, but scores ranged from a low of 0.27 (Belize) to a
          high of 3.50 (South Africa). The highest scores were among middle income
          countries (South Africa, Brazil, Colombia, Tunisia, and Thailand). Across
          regions, Eastern Europe and central Asian countries had relatively more
          developed PIM processes, followed by Latin America, East Asia, and the
          Pacific. The Middle East, North Africa, and sub-Saharan Africa regions
          trailed furthest behind.

          More interesting than variations across countries and regions was the
          considerable variation in individual scores for each of the four stages.
          Generally, the first and last stages (ex-ante appraisal and ex post evaluation)

          were the weakest. The median score for project appraisal was only 1.33,
          with country scores ranging from 4 for South Africa and Colombia down to
          0 for a number of low income countries. These included several in sub-
          Saharan Africa (Guinea, Chad, Sierra Leone, the Republic of Congo, and Sao
          Tome and Principe), as well as Trinidad and Tobago, Belize, the West Bank
          and Gaza, and the Solomon Islands.

          The conclusion emerging from this exercise is that, while a number of
          countries have improved their project implementation (mainly through the
          introduction of procurement reforms), only a handful of developing
          countries have been able to improve the processes of project appraisal,
          design, and selection - hence moving towards better construction project
          management. 70

Public officials and others may abuse infrastructure procurement projects for improper
personal gain (e.g., through bribes, kickbacks, etc.) or for overt or clandestine political
purposes. Wells refers to a study in Uganda in which David Booth and Frederick Golooba-
Mutebi71 found that the price of road construction per kilometer in Uganda was twice as
high as similar road construction in Zambia:

          Booth and Golooba-Mutebi (2009, 5) concluded, "All of the evidence
          indicates that, under the pre-2008 arrangements, the roads divisions of the
          Ministry of Works operated as a well-oiled machine for generating corrupt
          earnings from kickbacks." They went on to show how this operated as a
          complex system of political patronage. In addition to ensuring the personal
          enrichment of the minister, chief engineer, and many senior civil servants,
          the arrangement also provided a reliable means of accumulating funds to
          be made available to state house and other top government offices for
          "political" uses (such as patronage and campaign finance). Public officials
          raised money through a variety of means including accepting bribes for
          awarding contracts and signing completion certificates. The relative
          difficulty of skimming resources from donor-funded projects led to a
          situation where only a fraction of project funds made available by donors
          was being utilised.72

The evidence before the Charbonneau Commission, discussed in Section 1.3, in relation to
corruption in public infrastructure projects in Quebec and the connection between those
corrupt funds and illegal campaign financing demonstrate that these types of corrupt public

infrastructure practices can also exist in countries, such as Canada, that are perceived to have
low levels of corruption.73

Effective project screening will align proposed investment with actual development needs.
Wells notes that inadequate independent pre-screening of infrastructure projects can lead to
the proverbial "white elephant" phenomenon. She refers to a 2013 World Bank study that
describes three types of white elephant projects:

                · [Projects involving e]xcess capacity infrastructure, such as a
                     road or airport with little or no traffic demand;

                · Projects for which there is no operational budget to provide
                     services that will be needed for success (such as hospitals or
                     schools); and

                · Capital investment in projects that are never completed
                     (sometimes not even started) but are used to secure access to
                     the contract value.74

          An example of the first type can be found in Angola, where close
          examination of the list of projects in 2011 revealed a bridge to be built in a
          remote area of the country's southeast region for which there were no
          connecting roads--quite literally, this was a "bridge to nowhere." This
          project could not have been approved with even a cursory evaluation
          (Wells, 2011).
          The second type (also in Angola) is illustrated by the expansion of power
          generation capacity that was not matched by investment in transmission
          and distribution, so that the power could get to the users (Pushak and
          Foster, 2011).
          The third type has been well-illustrated by the award of a contract for major
          road projects in Uganda. Part of the contract value was siphoned off and
          used for patronage payments, and many of the projects were never
          completed (Booth and Golooba-Mutebi, 2009) [footnotes omitted].75

2.3 Procurement Offences

Corruption in public procurement occurs most frequently through bribes, extortion, bid-
rigging, and other forms of fraud. These types of corruption are discussed in more detail
below.

73 For example, it has been reported that Quebec pays 30% more for building stretches of road than
elsewhere in Canada. See Patriquin, supra note 34.

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

                 Bribery

Bribery refers to the improper offering, giving, soliciting, or receiving of anything of value
in order to influence a public official's exercise of a public duty. The OECD estimates that
bribery in government procurement in OECD countries increases contract costs by 10 to 20%,
suggesting that at least $400 billion is lost to bribery every year.76 The following are a few
examples of how bribery of public officials can manifest in public procurement:

      a contractor may bribe a government official to provide planning permission
          for a project or to approve a design that does not meet standards;

      a bidder may offer bribes to a government official in order to receive improper
          favourable treatment throughout the bidding process or to induce the official
          to manipulate the tender evaluation; or

      a bidder may make a donation to a political party in exchange for preferential
          treatment. 77

                 Extortion

Extortion refers to the attempt to secure a benefit or advantage by making a demand backed
by force or threat. The following are some examples of how extortion can manifest in public
procurement:

      a bidder may threaten to harm a government official or the official's family
          unless the official gives unwarranted favourable treatment to the bidder;

      a government official may demand something in return for assisting a
          company to win a bid or for fair treatment in the bidding process; and

      bribery can include an element of extortion.

                 False Invoicing, Bid-Rigging, and Other Forms of Fraud

Fraud refers to any intentionally deceptive act or omission designed to secure a benefit or
advantage. Public procurement attracts fraudulent behaviour in part because it can involve
the exchange of massive amounts of money and resources.78 The following are a few
examples of how fraud can manifest in public procurement:

      a bidder may deliberately submit false invoices or other false documentation
          (with or without collusion of public officials);

      bidders may form a cartel and secretly pre-select the winners for certain
          projects (a form of bid-rigging);

      a contractor may submit false information in order to receive more money or
          more time to complete a project; or

      bidders and public officials may illegally divert funds through money
          laundering or embezzlement.

These are just a few of the ways corruption manifests in public procurement. Given the great
potential for many types of corrupt practices to arise in public procurement, regulation of
public procurement procedures should be a priority at all levels of government.

3. TYPES OF PUBLIC PROCUREMENT

This section will describe the three main ways procurement occurs: public-private
partnerships (P3s), sole sourcing, and competitive bidding.

3.1 Public-Private Partnerships

Procurement of large-scale, complex projects such as public infrastructure can involve
public-private partnerships (P3s). Broadly speaking, a P3 is a cooperative venture between
public and private actors in which the private sector assumes a defined level of responsibility
for the financing, provision, and/or operation of public infrastructure or services.79

Although P3s in the public infrastructure context can take many forms and can include a
variety of attributes, at least three features tend to be present: (1) bundling of construction
and operation, (2) private but temporary ownership of assets, and (3) risk sharing over time
between the public and private sector.80 One distinguishing feature found in most major
infrastructure P3s is that the private sector bears considerable (if not complete) responsibility
for project financing (i.e., providing the funds necessary to realize the project). This follows
from a core conceptual underpinning of the P3 model: project risks should be transferred to
the party best able to manage those risks.81 The transfer of financing responsibilities to the
private sector is said to alleviate strains on public budgets and harness the efficiency and
depth of private finance markets. Through a P3 arrangement, the costs of a project can be
paid off over the project lifecycle, which poses less risk to both governments and taxpayers

which the private party bears significant risk and management responsibility, and remuneration is
linked to performance").

as compared to front-loaded arrangements.82 In addition, many P3 arrangements take some
form of a "concession" model, whereby a private sector concessionaire undertakes
investment and operation of the project for a fixed period of time, after which ownership of
the assets reverts to the public sector.

Each P3 arrangement sits along a continuum between "purely public" and "purely
private."83 A project sitting closer to the "private" end of the spectrum might include an
agreement whereby private sector participants build, own, and operate the infrastructure.
This is commonly referred to as a "BOO" (build-own-operate) arrangement.84 By contrast, a
project sitting closer to the "public" end of the spectrum might involve an agreement
whereby private sector participants merely operate and maintain the infrastructure. This is
referred to as an "OM" (operate and maintain) arrangement.85

Despite substantial private sector involvement in many P3 arrangements, governments
continue to maintain a substantial role in ensuring that P3 projects operate effectively. The
government must provide a favourable investment environment, establish adequate
regulatory frameworks and chains of authority, select a suitable procurement process, and
maintain active involvement throughout the project lifecycle.86 These responsibilities
highlight the need to ensure that government officials are acting with honesty and integrity.

To distinguish between P3s and the other two models discussed below, we can look to the
list of five essential differences between so-called "conventional procurement" and P3s, as
outlined by the World Bank:

          1) Conventional public procurement contracts for major public
                infrastructure typically last, at most, for only a few years (generally
                expiring within five years). P3s, by contrast, are generally long-term
                contracts that can exceed 30 years in duration. This creates an ongoing
                partnership relationship of interdependency and, as a result, the
                selection requirements, expectations, and procedures are very different.

          2) Conventional public procurement contracts typically have as their
                object the construction of facilities, and the final product--which is
                often designed and planned by the public authority--can be tested and
                accepted at the end of the construction. P3s often focus instead on the
                provision of a service with private sector participation in the delivery
                of that service. As such, conventional procurement tends to be more
                input oriented, whereas P3s are more output oriented.

Some suggest that based on the nature of the public-private relationship inherent in P3s,
governments set policy while the private sector implements policy, invoking the metaphor of
"governments steering and the private sector rowing": Joan Price Boase, "Beyond Government? The

          3) In most P3s, the project proponent (i.e., the lead firm carrying out the
                project) creates a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) to develop, build,
                maintain, and operate the asset(s) for the life of the contract. The SPV
                constitutes a consortium that includes the building contractor, bank
                lender(s), and other private sector participants. The SPV is the entity
                that signs the contract with the government, and the SPV subcontracts
                out its various obligations. This unique way of structuring the contract
                and the various obligations is not typically found in conventional
                procurement.

          4) Conventional procurement is typically financed by the public sector. It
                relies ultimately on taxpayer dollars. By contrast, P3s are often financed
                through user fees, tariffs, direct payments from the public authority,
                loans, guarantees from lenders, equity contributions from P3 partners,
                or some combination thereof.

          5) P3s, some argue, can reduce costs by allocating risks such as project
                failure or delays to parties best able to manage them, and private sector
                participants have stronger incentives to reduce costs in P3s as compared
                to conventional procurement.87

PPP Canada, a now-defunct Crown corporation created to promote adoption of the P3
model across Canada, suggested that the P3 model may be preferred over alternative models
such as competitive bidding where the following conditions are present:

      You have a major project, requiring effective risk management throughout the
          lifecycle;

      There is an opportunity to leverage private sector expertise;

      The structure of the project could allow the public sector to define its
          performance needs as outputs/outcomes that can be contracted for in a way
          that ensures the delivery of the infrastructure in the long term;

      The risk allocation between the public and private sectors can be clearly
          identified and contractually assigned;

      The value of the project is sufficiently large to ensure that procurement costs
          are not disproportionate;

      The technology and other aspects of the project are proven and not susceptible
          to short-term obsolescence; and

      The planning horizons are long-term, with assets used over long periods and
          are capable of being financed on a lifecycle basis.88

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

The likelihood that the P3 model will be selected over alternative models, such as
competitive bidding, increases where there is significant scope for innovation and a long
project lifecycle (e.g., the design, construction, and operation of state-of-the-art hospitals).
By contrast, where the project is comparatively simple and has a short project lifecycle (e.g.,
the installation of a simple transmission line), the likelihood that some other form of
procurement will be selected increases.

Professors Engel, Fischer, and Galetovic suggest that P3s are the superior choice where there
is a need to provide strong incentives to reduce or control project lifecycle costs.89 This is
because in the P3 arrangement, the private sector participant involved in the operation of
the project has an incentive to minimize costs while still meeting project standards, since the
firm shares in the economic savings derived from any cost-cutting measures that enhance
the project. This can, however, present problems to the extent that such measures reduce the
quality of service.90 Engel, Fischer, and Galetovic also suggest that P3s may be the superior
choice where demand risk is largely exogenous and there is a large upfront investment.91
The authors add, however, that any form of public procurement--such as P3s or competitive
bidding--should be pursued only where full privatization is not possible.92 This will
generally be the case where competition is not feasible.93

Despite the foregoing observations, P3s can--and often do--contain elements of the
competitive bidding model. For example, private sector partners are often selected based on
a competitive bidding process, as described in Section 3.3.

P3s have gained ascendency on the world stage as a preferred model of delivering large-
scale infrastructure goods and services to the public. Between 1985 and 2004, 2,096 P3
infrastructure projects were undertaken worldwide, with a combined capital value of nearly
$887 billion.94 The World Bank estimates that the private sector financed approximately 20%
of infrastructure investments in developing countries in the 1990s, totalling about $850
billion.95

However, views on P3s are mixed. As with any method of public procurement, the P3 model
has advantages and disadvantages.96 Detractors argue that P3s--rather than being efficient,

revolutionary models of delivering public goods and services--"cost more and deliver
less."97 Some scholars, such as Martha Minow, Dominique Custos, and John Reitz, have
criticized P3s for failing to sufficiently protect public values and interests.98 Scholars who
espouse this view argue, inter alia, that P3s can open the door to private capture of public
decision-makers.

3.2 Sole Sourcing

Although most public procurement now occurs through a competitive bidding process, the
sole source contracting method is still used for some goods and services. Sole source
contracting involves two parties negotiating a contract without an open competitive
process.99 Sole sourcing may be preferred for efficiency purposes in emergencies, for small-
value contracts, or where there are confidentiality concerns.100 However, as sole sourcing is
not a public and transparent process, it can be difficult for public bodies to justify this
method due to concerns relating to fairness and discrimination.101 From an anti-corruption
perspective, a public entity should sole source its contracts as seldom as possible.

One added complication in the sole-sourcing context is the phenomenon of unsolicited
bids.102 Some public authorities are willing to consider project proposals initiated, designed,
and submitted by private firms, rather than the authority itself. This flips the traditional
competitive bidding model on its head: the idea for the project comes not from the public
authority, but from the private sector.

Although unsolicited bids may be seen as a welcome opportunity to introduce greater
private sector participation in the identification of public needs as well as to inject private
sector innovation into the delivery of public goods and services, they may also be a
dangerous proposition. The result of increased acceptance of unsolicited bids may be to
allow private firms to intrude upon the government's role in formulating policy and
designing public infrastructure to achieve public policies.

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

Perhaps the principal issue with unsolicited bids is that they may be associated with a lack
of competition and transparency.103 In an unsolicited bid, where there is only one party
seeking an exclusive contract for a project that was drawn up by that party, the public might
perceive the proposed project as serving special interests or being tainted by corruption.104

Professors Graeme Hodge and Carsten Greve summarize the concerns raised over
unsolicited bids:

          [Unsolicited bids add] a whole new dimension to project initiation,
          planning and completion with new powerful interest groups moving in
          alongside elected governments. Thus, we see today new infrastructure
          projects being suggested by real estate agents as well as various project
          financiers and merchant bankers, rather than bureaucrats--whose purpose,
          one would have thought, would be to do just this, as well as analyzing a
          range of smaller packages of alternative improvement options. Whilst such
          government-business deals may well end up meeting the public interest, it
          would seem more by coincidence than by design.105

John Hodges and Georgina Dellacha suggest that with unsolicited bid submissions, it may
be best for the public authority to hold a tendering process nonetheless in order to preserve
some level of competition and enhance transparency, even if there is only one bidder.106 This
is said to evidence the government's commitment to transparency and demonstrate that
there is in fact only one interested bidder.107 The effect is to lend the project greater
legitimacy in the public eye.

At the end of the day, whether unsolicited bids serve the public interest will depend on the
particular circumstances surrounding the proposed project including the actors involved,
the need for the project, whether the party proposing the project is the only one who could
successfully carry it out, and other factors.

3.3 Competitive Bidding

Public procurement more often occurs through the process of competitive bidding or
tendering. Although tendering is often used synonymously with bidding, tendering is a
specific type of competitive bidding. The tendering process involves particular contractual
relationships and obligations, which will be discussed later in this chapter. Broadly

speaking, there are four stages of the traditional competitive bidding process: planning,
bidding, bid evaluation, and implementation and monitoring.108 These are also the basic
stages in the P3 context, although some details vary. There can be many parties involved
throughout the various stages of the bidding process. The bidder is the party or individual
responding to the call for bids in the hope of winning the contract. The next section will
focus on situations in which a government entity or official is the party requesting tenders.
Other stakeholders can include contractors, engineers, agents, subcontractors and suppliers.
The following four stages briefly describe the procurement process:

     1. Planning: This stage involves needs assessment, advertising, the production of
          bidding documents, and the formation of a procurement plan.109 At this stage,
          the government assesses what is necessary to serve the public interest, with
          consideration to factors such as cost and timeliness.110 The administrative and
          technical documents needed for launching the call for bids are prepared.111

     2. Bidding: Candidates are short-listed, the government holds pre-bid
          conferences, the bids are submitted, and questions about the respective bids are
          clarified.112 There are various types of bidding procedures that may be
          employed at this stage. For example, the government may solicit tenders
          through an Invitation to Tender (ITT) or Request for Quotation (RFQ). Tenders
          are typically used when the government is searching for technical compliance
          with contract requirements and the lowest acceptable price for a specifically
          defined project. Alternatively, the government may issue a call for proposals
          through a Request for Proposal (RFP), Request for Standing Offer (RFSO), or
          Request for Supply Arrangement (RFSA). Proposal calls--particularly RFPs--
          are typically used for complex or lengthy construction projects and are most
          likely used in the P3 context. Where the government is contemplating a P3, a
          Request for Qualifications (RFQu) is often issued prior to RFPs.113 RFQus help
          the government identify a shortlist of qualified bidders who will be invited to
          submit proposals at the RFP stage.

     3. Bid evaluation: The bids are evaluated, the government compiles a bid
          evaluation report, and the contract is awarded to the winning bidder. The
          process by which the bids are evaluated and the contract granted varies
          according to the bidding approach selected, as well as the governing legislation.
          For example, in Canada, PWGSC requires that RFPs be evaluated transparently
          and that debriefs be provided to losing bidders.114

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

     4. Implementation and monitoring: The final contract between the bidder and the
          government is drafted and implemented, any changes are incorporated, the
          bidder's project is monitored and audited, and any appeals are launched.115

4. HALLMARKS OF A GOOD PROCUREMENT SYSTEM

Governments have many goals in enacting public procurement laws, including fair
competition, integrity, transparency, efficiency, user satisfaction, best value, wealth
distribution, risk avoidance, and uniformity. Transparency, competition, and integrity are
three hallmarks of a good procurement system.116

4.1 Transparency

Transparency was explained at the 1999 International Anti-Corruption Conference in the
following terms:

          Transparency, in the context of public procurement, refers to the ability of
          all interested participants to know and understand the actual means and
          processes by which contracts are awarded and managed. This requires the
          release, as a minimum, of information sufficient to allow the average
          participant to know how the system is intended to work, as well as how it
          is actually functioning. Transparency is a central characteristic of a sound
          and efficient public procurement system and is characterized by:

                · Well-defined regulations and procedures open to public
                     scrutiny.

                · Clear, standardized tender documents.

                · Bidding and tender documents containing complete
                     information; and

                · Equal opportunity in the bidding process.

          Transparency requires that published rules are the basis for all procurement
          decisions and that these rules are applied objectively to all bidders.
          Transparency is an effective means to identify and correct improper,
          wasteful--and even corrupt--practices.117

Transparency in a public procurement process is important because it reduces the risk of
corruption and bribery by opening up the process to monitoring, review, comment, and

influence by stakeholders.118 Former Secretary-General of the United Nations Ban Ki-moon
describes the role of transparency in public procurement in the following terms:

          Transparency is a core principle of high-quality public procurement. An
          open and transparent procurement process improves competition,
          increases efficiency and reduces the threat of unfairness or corruption. A
          robust transparency regime enables people to hold public bodies and
          politicians to account, thereby instilling trust in a nation's institutions.
          Transparency also supports the wise use of limited development funds,
          from planning investments in advance to measuring the results.119

Transparency in public procurement can be enhanced by implementing a number of best
practices, including:

      advance publication of procurement policies and plans;

      advertisement of tender notices;

      disclosure of evaluation criteria in solicitation documents;

      publication of contract awards and prices paid;

      establishment of appropriate and timely complaint and dispute resolution
          mechanisms;

      implementation of financial and conflict of interest disclosure requirements for
          public procurement officials; and

      publication of supplier sanction lists.120

Transparency encourages public confidence in the project, which is particularly important
in a democracy. Without transparency, corruption is free to continue in the shadows. With
transparency, corruption is subject to the glare of public scrutiny. As Justice Louis Brandeis
once wrote, "[s]unlight is said to be the best of disinfectants."121

Although transparency is recognized as a key condition for promoting integrity and
preventing corruption in public procurement, it must be balanced with other imperatives of
good governance.122 For example, demands for greater transparency and accountability may
create some tension with the objective of ensuring an efficient management of public
resources (administrative efficiency) or providing guarantees for fair competition.123 The

challenge for policy-makers is to design a system in which an appropriate degree of
transparency and accountability is present to reduce corruption risks while still pursuing
other aims of public procurement.

4.2 Competition

Competition is seen as vital to the process because, under laissez-faire economic theory, it
provides governments with the best quality for the best price.124 Robert Anderson, William
Kovacic and Anna Caroline Müller identify three leading reasons why competition is
important in public procurement:

          1) with free entry and an absence of collusion, prices will be driven
                towards marginal costs;

          2) suppliers will have an incentive to reduce their production and other
                costs over time; and

          3) competition drives innovation.125

4.3 Integrity

TI defines integrity in the public procurement context as "behaviours and actions consistent
with a set of moral or ethical principles and standards, embraced by individuals as well as
institutions that create a barrier to corruption."126 Integrity requires that procurement be
carried out in accordance with the law and without discrimination or favouritism.

In 2008, the OECD developed best practices guidance to "reinforce integrity and public trust
in how public funds are managed"127 and promote a good governance approach to
procurement based on the following principles:

          Transparency
                1. Provide an adequate degree of transparency in the entire
                     procurement cycle in order to promote fair and equitable
                     treatment for potential suppliers.
                2. Maximise transparency in competitive tendering and take
                     precautionary measures to enhance integrity, in particular for
                     exceptions to competitive tendering.

          Good management
                3. Ensure that public funds are used in procurement according to the
                     purposes intended.
                4. Ensure that procurement officials meet high professional
                     standards of knowledge, skills, and integrity.

          Prevention of misconduct, compliance and monitoring
                5. Put mechanisms in place to prevent risks to integrity in public
                     procurement.
                6. Encourage close co-operation between government and the
                     private sector to maintain high standards of integrity, particularly
                     in contract management.
                7. Provide specific mechanisms to monitor public procurement as
                     well as to detect misconduct and apply sanctions accordingly.

          Accountability and control
                8. Establish a clear chain of responsibility together with effective
                     control mechanisms.
                9. Handle complaints from potential suppliers in a fair and timely
                     manner.
                10. Empower civil society organizations, media and the wider public
                     to scrutinise public procurement.128

This list illustrates how the three key pillars of an effective procurement system--
transparency, competition, and integrity--are closely connected to one another.

Although sound procurement rules are essential to the achievement of a robust procurement
system, rules alone are not sufficient. As the OECD observes:

          Implementing rules requires a wider governance framework that
          encompasses: an adequate institutional and administrative infrastructure;
          an effective review and accountability regime; mechanisms to identify and
          close off opportunities for corruption; as well as adequate human, financial
          and technological resources to support all of the elements of the system.
          They also require a sustained political commitment to apply these rules and
          regularly update them.129

5. PRIVATE LAW ENFORCEMENT OF TENDERING FOR PUBLIC
    CONTRACTS

Private law remedies are not the focus of the analysis of public procurement in this chapter.
However, the following is a brief overview of how companies may use private law tools to
ensure that government bodies in the US, UK, and Canada follow tendering processes. Even
where the purchaser is a government body, procurement contracts are considered
"generally commercial in nature"130 and therefore typically fall into the realm of private law
remedies. Generally, the private law framework allows companies to seek a private law
remedy (the principal one being damages) against the public body.

It is somewhat problematic that a private law action for damages is by far the most common
remedy sought in public procurement disputes.131 Because civil actions are expensive, legal
recourse is often inaccessible to smaller bidders who cannot afford the legal costs or where
the value of the procurement contract does not economically warrant a lawsuit. Moreover,
the settlement of private lawsuits often involves confidentiality agreements that impede
public transparency. The US, UK, and Canada have public law bodies in place to hear
complaints about the procurement process and resolve disputes between bidders and
contracting bodies. However, the remedies available in the public law context do not always
sufficiently account for the damages the contracting party has suffered.

5.1 US

The Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (CDA) provides a mechanism for parties to make a claim
in contract law against the federal government.132 Bid protests are heard by the Government
Accountability Office (GAO) or the Court of Federal Claims. The GAO hears the majority of
the protests.133 The GAO has not allowed losing bidders to claim lost profits as part of their
damages. Instead, companies are limited to seeking the costs of preparing their quotation
and filing their protest.134 This position was solidified in the Effective Learning decision:

          [W]e know of no situation where anticipated profits may be recovered when
          the underlying claim is based upon equitable, rather than legal,
          principles.... Here, since a contract between the government and Effective
          Learning never came into being, the only relief possible was equitable in
          nature. Hence, the monetary recovery in this situation was limited to the

          reasonable value of services and did not encompass any potential profits
          that might have been earned by Effective Learning.135

The GAO's position on damages stems from precedential inability of parties who do not
secure a contract to sue and seek damages.136 US law requires a contract to exist between the
parties before a plaintiff is entitled to seek anticipated profits.137 Unlike in Canada and the
UK, US law does not imply a contract between the party soliciting bids and the bidding
parties; the only contract that exists is when the party soliciting bids selects one of the bids.
At that point, the government agency and the bidding party form a contract for goods or
services.

However, US law has developed to a point that allows bidding parties to bring an action
against the federal government for failure to follow its procurement laws and procedures.
In 1940, the US Supreme Court held in Perkins v Lukens Steel Co that aggrieved parties lacked
standing in federal court to challenge government contract awards where they failed to
receive the contract.138 In a subsequent case, Heyer Products Co v United States, the US Court
of Claims found an implied commitment in procurement requests to consider each bid fairly
and honestly, and allowed an unsuccessful bidder to file a claim for "bid preparation
expenses."139 In Scanwell Laboratories v Shaffer, the US Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia Circuit held that the Administrative Procedure Act140 reversed Perkins and that
review of public procurement decisions was available in district courts.141

5.2 UK

Blackpool & Fylde Aero Club Ltd v Blackpool Borough Council established that when an
organization, particularly a public sector body, invites tenders to be submitted, it is giving
an implicit promise to adhere to the tendering rules set out for the particular tender.142
Failure to do so will give aggrieved parties the right to bring an action for damages.

This principle was further developed in Harmon CFEM Facades (UK) Ltd v Corporate Officer of
the House of Commons, where the High Court held that when the public sector seeks tenders,
a contract exists between the bidder and public body that requires all tenders to be
considered fairly. In Harmon, the trial judge found that the bids had been manipulated and

the defendant had chosen a bid over the plaintiff's, who was in fact the lowest bidder.143 The
judge found this to be a breach of contract:

          In the public sector where competitive tenders are sought and responded
          to, a contract comes into existence whereby the prospective employer
          impliedly agrees to consider all tenders fairly.144

This creates a contract distinct from the contract being tendered for and requires that the
purchaser abide by the terms it sets out in its call for tenders.

5.3 Canada

The legal framework for procurement in Canada was established in the seminal case The
Queen (Ont) v Ron Engineering.145 This case created the concept of dual contracts in
procurement cases.146 Contract A is formed when a call for tenders is issued (the offer) and
a bid is submitted in response (the acceptance).147 Contract B arises between the entity calling
for tenders and the successful bidder.

In Quebec, although Ron Engineering has been applied by the courts, the same results are
obtained under civil law principles of offer and acceptance.148 This is because Quebec's Civil
Code imposes obligations on the parties arising from pre-contractual negotiations even
though no contractual relationship arises between the party calling for tenders and the
bidder before acceptance of the bid.149

The Supreme Court of Canada further developed this dual contract procurement paradigm
in MJB Enterprises Ltd v Defence Construction, where the Court established that Contract A
will form only between the procuring entity and compliant bidders.150 A compliant bidder
is one whose bid complies with the requirements of the tender documents. This requirement
ensures a degree of fairness and transparency. MJB also clarified that the terms of Contract
A are dictated by the terms and conditions of the tender call.151 In Martel Building Ltd v

145 The Queen (Ont) v Ron Engineering, [1981] 1 SCR 27, 1981 CanLII 17.
146 Prior to Ron Engineering, ibid, it was believed that no formal contractual relationships arose until
the acceptance of a bid. See e.g. Belle River Community Arena Inc v WJC Kaufmann Co, 20 OR (2d) 447,
87 DLR (3d) 761 (CA).
147 This is a simplification. Contract A will not always be formed upon the submission of a tender. For
example, a contract will arise only where there is a clear intention to contract. However, what is
relevant is that the submission of a tender will often give rise to contractual obligations. See MJB

Canada, the Supreme Court held that procuring entities have an obligation of fairness
towards bidders with whom Contract A has formed.152 Purchasers must be "fair and
consistent" and treat all bidders "fairly and equally."153 This means, at minimum, that when
a purchaser sets the bid requirements, the purchasing entity must fairly evaluate each bidder
based on the indicated criteria. Design Services Ltd v Canada clarified that the duty of care
owed by the procuring entity to bidders does not extend to subcontractors.154

The 2014 Federal Court case Rapiscan Systems, Inc v Canada held that government
procurement decisions could be subject to the administrative law remedy of judicial review
if an "additional public element" exists.155 The Federal Court outlined numerous
considerations to help determine the presence of an "additional public element." Where the
procurement decision is closely connected to the procuring entity's statutory powers or
mandate, it is more likely that the public law remedy of judicial review will be available.156
The operative question is whether "the matter is coloured with a `public element' sufficient
to bring it within the purview of the public law and therefore review by the Court on the
rationale that (i) it involves a breach of a statutory duty, or (ii) it undermines the integrity of
government procurement processes."157

Judy Wilson and Joel Richler extract three principles from the line of jurisprudence
emanating from Ron Engineering:

          [F]irst, the law imposes obligations on both the procuring authorities and
          the bidders. Procuring authorities must, at all times, adhere to the terms and
          conditions of Contract A and cannot accept any non-compliant bids, no
          matter how attractive they may be. As well, procuring authorities must act
          towards all compliant bidders fairly and in good faith, particularly during
          the evaluation of any bidder's submission. Also, procuring authorities
          cannot make their ultimate decisions to award or reject submissions based
          on criteria that are not disclosed in the terms and conditions of the
          procurement documents. Bidders, for their part, cannot revoke or
          supplement their submissions, unless permitted to do so by the terms and
          conditions of Contract A.

          Second, the law does permit procuring authorities to create the terms and
          conditions of Contract "A" as they see fit. Thus, privilege clauses - clauses
          which provide the procuring authority with discretionary rights - are
          recognized as fully enforceable and, if properly drafted, allow procuring
          authorities to reserve to themselves the right to award contracts to bids that
          may not be for the lowest price, or not to award contracts at all. As well,
          procuring authorities are free to impose any number of criteria on bidders

152 This is a simplification. This will be true except where it is clear that the parties did not expect and
intend fair and consistent treatment. See Martel Building Ltd v R, 2000 SCC 60 at para 88, 193 DLR
(4th) 1.

          such as: prior similar work experience; the absence of claims or prior
          litigation; local contracting; scheduling criteria; composition of construction
          teams; and so on.

          Third, and perhaps somewhat contradictory of the second principle, while
          the list of requirements and criteria imposed on bidders may be extensive,
          it will always be open to the courts to impose limitations where the
          discretion retained by the procuring authority is extreme. The courts have
          made it clear that maintaining the integrity of competitive procurement
          processes was a fundamental goal of procurement law in Canada.158

                 UNCAC

Article 9(1) of United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC) requires State
parties to "establish systems of procurement based on transparency, competition and
objective criteria in decision making, and which are also effective in preventing
corruption."159 As the Legislative Guide to UNCAC notes, Article 9 includes, at minimum:

          a) The public distribution of information relating to procurement
                procedures and contracts, including information on invitations to
                tender and relevant or pertinent information on the award of contracts,
                allowing potential tenderers sufficient time to prepare and submit their
                tenders;

          b) The establishment, in advance, of conditions for participation,
                including selection and award criteria and tendering rules, and their
                publication;

          c) The use of objective and predetermined criteria for public procurement
                decisions, in order to facilitate the subsequent verification of the correct
                application of the rules or procedures;

          d) An effective system of domestic review, including an effective system
                of appeal, to ensure legal recourse and remedies in the event that the
                rules or procedures established pursuant to paragraph 1 of article 9 are
                not followed;

                requirements.160

As with other international agreements that address domestic procurement, UNCAC
contemplates that these requirements may not apply to contracts below a certain dollar
threshold.161 The Legislative Guide to UNCAC justifies this exception on the grounds that
"excessive regulation can be counterproductive by increasing rather than diminishing
vulnerability to corrupt practices,"162 but does not provide further elaboration.

                 OECD Convention

The OECD Convention contains no articles on public procurement. However, the
Recommendations of the Council for Further Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials, adopted
in November 2009, includes the following as Recommendation XI:

          Member countries should support the efforts of the OECD Public
          Governance Committee to implement the principles contained in the 2008
          Council Recommendation on Enhancing Integrity in Public Procurement
          [C(2008)105], as well as work on transparency in public procurement in
          other international governmental organizations such as the United Nations,
          the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the European Union, and are
          encouraged to adhere to relevant international standards such as the WTO
          Agreement on Government Procurement.163

Recommendation XI(i) states that member states should, through laws and regulations,
permit authorities to suspend enterprises convicted of bribery of foreign public officials from
competition for public contracts.

                 World Bank

The World Bank funds large infrastructure projects throughout the developing world.
According to the World Bank, its procurement system includes a portfolio of approximately
$56 billion across 172 countries.164 To combat corruption, the World Bank has created its own
sanctioning system, which relies heavily on debarment as a penalty. Because of a reciprocal
agreement between the World Bank and other development banks, debarment from World
Bank projects also leads to debarment from projects funded by the African Development

Bank Group, the Asian Development Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development, and the Inter-American Development Bank.165 This is commonly referred to
as "cross-debarment." For more on the World Bank's sanctioning process, see Chapter 7,
Section 8.3.

In July 2015, the World Bank announced a new Procurement Framework, which came into
effect on July 1, 2016.166 Most notably, the new framework allows contract award decisions
to be based on criteria other than lowest price. In this respect, "value for money" was
introduced as a core procurement principle. This signals "a shift in focus from the lowest
evaluated compliant bid to bids that provide the best overall value for money, taking into
account quality, cost, and other factors as needed."167 In addition, the World Bank prepared
a series of "Standard Procurement Documents" requiring bidders to provide beneficial
ownership information.168 This followed after the World Bank announced it would be
considering ways of collecting and disseminating information on beneficial ownership of
entities participating in its procurement processes, having received a letter signed by 107
civil society organizations encouraging it to do so.169

The procurement process has been subject to some criticism. After noting that the Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) provides little deterrence to companies operating in countries
where demand for bribes is high and profits to be made are great, US lawyer and academic
Annalisa Leibold, criticized the World Bank's conduct when financing a pipeline project in
Chad:

          Even the World Bank was ineffective at preventing corruption there. It
          rushed the pipeline project, ignored important information about the
          empirical nature of the resource curse, and divorced its own analysis from
          Chad's political and economic context.170

Another US academic Paul Sarlo, criticized the World Bank's "undisciplined lending
practices," stating that "[t]he World Bank undermines the transnational anti-corruption
regime through its failure to carry out due diligence of project-implementing agencies when
it advances loans to notoriously corrupt governments."171 He points out that the personal
success of World Bank officials "depend[s] on the number of loans they approve."172 Further,
"whether a loan is stolen should make little difference to the World Bank because of its
ability to earn interest and even accelerate payment on that loan."173 Due to the lack of
incentive to ensure loans are used for their intended purpose, Sarlo called for increased
regulation of the World Bank's lending practices.

      6.1.4 WTO Agreement on Government Procurement

The WTO Agreement on Government Procurement (WTO-AGP)174 has the status of a
binding international treaty among its more than 40 members.175 Although the primary
objective of the WTO-AGP is to ensure free market access among State parties, it is relevant
to procurement in that it contains provisions that require fairness and transparency in
government procurement.176 For example, Article XVI.1 mandates that a procuring entity
"promptly inform participating suppliers of the entity's contract award decisions ... [and],
on request, provide an unsuccessful supplier with an explanation of the reasons why the
entity did not select its tender and the relative advantages of the successful supplier's
tender."177 Article XVII.1 requires that, upon request, "a Party shall provide promptly any
information necessary to determine whether a procurement was conducted fairly,
impartially, and in accordance with this Agreement, including information on the
characteristics and relative advantages of the successful tender."178 However, the WTO-AGP
applies only to "covered entities purchasing listed goods, services or construction services
of a value exceeding specified threshold values."179 These thresholds and restrictions are in
place "largely because it is a cumbersome and expensive process to open all contracts to
international bidding."180 In the context of government construction contracts in Canada, the
WTO-AGP applies to:

      6.1.5 United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement

Chapter 13 of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA),182 the successor to
the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), deals with government procurement.
Unlike its predecessor chapter in NAFTA (Chapter 10) (which is largely preserved), this
chapter does not apply to Canada.183 As a result, suppliers in the US, Mexico and Canada no
longer have a single trade agreement providing a common set of rules governing public
procurement in North America.184 Instead, there is one agreement between the US and
Canada (the WTO-AGP), another between the US and Mexico (the USMCA), and another
between Mexico and Canada (the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-
Pacific Partnership (CPTPP)).185 While the procurement rules in these agreements are similar
in many respects, they are not identical. From the perspective of contractors who operate
internationally, this lack of uniformity is less than ideal.

The objective of Chapter 13 of the USMCA is to provide suppliers of goods and services in
the US and Mexico with secure and guaranteed access to procurement opportunities in each
other's markets.186 While a detailed discussion of Chapter 13 is beyond the scope of this text,
it is significant that Article 13.17 sets out rules designed to promote integrity in procurement
practices. This provision has four components:

     1) Each Party shall ensure that criminal, civil, or administrative measures exist that
          can address corruption, fraud, and other wrongful acts in its government
          procurement.

     2) These measures may include procedures to debar, suspend, or declare ineligible
          from participation in the Party's procurements, for a stated period of time, a
          supplier that the Party has determined to have engaged in corruption, fraud, or
          other wrongful acts relevant to a supplier's eligibility to participate in a Party's
          government procurement.

     3) Each Party shall ensure that it has in place policies or procedures to address
          potential conflicts of interest on the part of those engaged in or having influence
          over a procurement.

     4) Each Party may also put in place policies or procedures, including provisions in
          tender documentation, that require successful suppliers to maintain and enforce
          effective internal controls, business ethics, and compliance programs, taking
          into account the size of the supplier, particularly SMEs, and other relevant
          factors, for preventing and detecting corruption, fraud, and other wrongful acts.

Chapter 13 also includes provisions designed to enhance transparency in government
procurement that mirror provisions in the WTO-AGP. For example, Article 13.15 provides
that "a procuring entity shall, on request, provide an unsuccessful supplier with an
explanation of the reasons why the procuring entity did not select the unsuccessful
supplier's tender or an explanation of the relative advantages of the successful supplier's
tender." Similarly, Article 13.16 provides that "[o]n request of the other Party, a Party shall
provide promptly information sufficient to demonstrate whether a procurement was
conducted fairly, impartially and in accordance with this chapter, including, if applicable,
information on the characteristics and relative advantages of the successful tender, without
disclosing confidential information."

Chapter 13 does not automatically apply to all government procurement. Coverage depends
on the type and value of the goods or services being procured, the government entity
involved and other criteria.

      6.1.6 Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership

The Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP),187
which incorporates by reference the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) (which never entered
into force due to the US's withdrawal in January 2017), is a trade agreement between 11
countries (including Australia, Canada, Japan, and Mexico) designed to promote free trade
among signatory countries. Like the USMCA, the CPTPP contains a chapter on government
procurement (Chapter 15). The CPTPP contains a provision--Article 15.18--designed to
promote integrity in procurement practices. It states:

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

          Each Party shall ensure that criminal or administrative measures exist to
          address corruption in its government procurement. These measures may
          include procedures to render ineligible for participation in the Party's
          procurements, either indefinitely or for a stated period of time, suppliers
          that the Party has determined to have engaged in fraudulent or other illegal
          actions in relation to government procurement in the Party's territory. Each
          Party shall also ensure that it has in place policies and procedures to
          eliminate to the extent possible or manage any potential conflict of interest
          on the part of those engaged in or having influence over a procurement.

Also like Chapter 13 of the USMCA, Chapter 15 of the CPTPP includes provisions designed
to enhance transparency in government procurement that mirror provisions in the WTO-
AGP. For example, Article 15.16 provides that "a procuring entity shall, on request, provide
an unsuccessful supplier with an explanation of the reasons why the procuring entity did
not select the unsuccessful supplier's tender or an explanation of the relative advantages of
the successful supplier's tender." Similarly, Article 15.17 provides that "[o]n request of any
other Party, a Party shall provide promptly information sufficient to demonstrate whether
a procurement was conducted fairly, impartially and in accordance with this chapter,
including, if applicable, information on the characteristics and relative advantages of the
successful tender, without disclosing confidential information."

Chapter 15 does not automatically apply to all government procurement. Coverage depends
on the type and value of the goods or services being procured, the government entity
involved, and other criteria.

                 Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement

The Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement188 (CETA) is a treaty between Canada
and the EU setting standards for trade in goods and services, non-tariff barriers, investment,
government procurement, and other areas like labour and the environment.189 Signed on
October 30, 2016,190 CETA has not yet fully come into force (though substantial parts have
been provisionally applied since September 21, 2017). It will fully come into force once
ratified by all signatories.

Chapter 19 of CETA deals with government procurement. This chapter includes provisions
designed to promote integrity in government procurement. For example, Article 19.4(4)
provides generally that a "procuring entity shall conduct covered procurement in a
transparent and impartial manner that: ... (b) avoids conflicts of interest; and (c) prevents

                 EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement

On June 23, 2016, the UK held a referendum to decide whether it should leave the European
Union.191 A narrow majority of voters elected to leave the EU, an event commonly referred
to as "Brexit." For the UK to formally leave the EU, however, it had to invoke Article 50 of
the Lisbon Treaty, which provides that "[a]ny Member State may decide to withdraw from
the Union in accordance with its own constitutional requirements"192 and gives the parties
two years to agree on the terms of the exit. That process formally concluded on January 31,
2020, when the UK officially left the EU.193 However, both sides agreed to preserve many
aspects of their existing trade relationship until December 31, 2020 to permit negotiation of
a new trade agreement.194 That agreement, the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement
(TCA), was struck on December 24, 2020 and came into effect provisionally on January 1,

Title VI of the TCA deals with public procurement and seeks "to guarantee each Party's
suppliers access to increased opportunities to participate in public procurement procedures
and to enhance the transparency of public procurement procedures."197 It incorporates
certain provisions of the WTO-AGP, extends the scope of covered procurement and includes
additional provisions regarding the use of electronic means in procurement; electronic
publication of notices; environmental, social and labour considerations; domestic review
procedures; and other matters. Importantly, it puts EU and UK suppliers on an equal footing
when bidding on procurement tenders covered by the agreement in one or the other
jurisdiction.

The UK is currently in the process of acceding to the WTO-AGP.198 The UK's shift from the

former.199

      6.1.10 UN Commission on International Trade Law Model Law on Public
                 Procurement

On July 1, 2011, the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL)
published the UNCITRAL Model Law on Public Procurement (MLPP).202 The MLPP is
designed as a tool for "modernizing and reforming procurement systems" and assisting
countries in implementing legislation where none is currently in place.203 It is an extensive,
detailed model law (84 pages) and accompanied by a very detailed guide (419 pages).204

The objectives of the MLPP are outlined in its preamble:

          a) Achieving economy and efficiency;
          b) Wide participation by suppliers and contractors, with procurement

                open to international participation as a general rule;
          c) Maximizing competition;
          d) Ensuring fair, equal and equitable treatment;
          e) Assuring integrity, fairness and public confidence in the procurement

                process; and
          f) Promoting transparency.205

The MLPP was intended to apply to all types of procurement and requires no threshold
amount for its application to transactions. The MLPP also provides guidance in applying
procurement law to security and defence contracts. The MLPP sets out minimum
requirements and essential principles for effective procurement legislation:

          a) the applicable law, procurement regulations, and other relevant
                information are to be made publicly available (article 5);

          b) requirements for prior publication of announcements for each
                procurement procedure (with relevant details) (articles 33-35) and ex
                post facto notice of the award of procurement contracts (article 23);

          c) items to be procured are to be described in accordance with article 10
                (that is, objectively and without reference to specific brand names as a
                general rule, so as to allow submissions to be prepared and compared
                on an objective basis);

          d) requirements for qualification procedures and permissible criteria to
                determine which suppliers or contractors will be able to participate,

                with the particular criteria that will determine whether or not
                suppliers or contractors are qualified communicated to all potential
                suppliers or contractors (articles 9 and 18);

          e) open tendering is the recommended procurement method and the use
                of any other procurement method must be objectively justified (article
                28);

          f) other procurement methods should be available to cover the main
                circumstances likely to arise (simple or low-value procurement, urgent
                and emergency procurement, repeated procurement, and the
                procurement of complex or specialized items or services) with
                conditions for use of these procurement methods (articles 29-31);

          g) a requirement for standard procedures for the conduct of each
                procurement process (Chapters III-VII);

          h) a requirement for communications with suppliers or contractors to be
                in a form and manner that does not impede access to the procurement
                (article 7);

          i) a requirement for a mandatory standstill period between the
                identification of the winning supplier or contractor and the award of
                the contract or framework agreement, in order to allow any non-
                compliance with the provisions of the Model Law to be addressed
                prior to any such contract entering into force (article 22(2)); and

          j) mandatory challenge and appeal procedures if rules or procedures are
                breached (Chapter VIII).206

The MLPP is a framework law and does not include all the regulations necessary for
implementation. However, it does provide insight into some important aspects of
procurement law and guidance on implementing effective procurement laws and
regulations.

6.2 US

The US procurement system is considered by some to be one of the most sophisticated and
developed in the world.207 Even so, it is unable to prevent all corruption, as demonstrated
by the case of a senior US Department of Defense acquisition official who pled guilty to
criminal conspiracy in connection with the negotiation of a $23 billion acquisition from
Boeing.208

US law on public procurement falls under the Competition in Contracting Act of 1984. The
Federal Acquisition Regulation further details the rules of hosting and participating in public
procurement. Although the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and the Court of

Federal Claims have heard hundreds of protests under the Federal Acquisition Regulation,
these cases have rarely resulted in a finding that there was improper motivation for
deviating from the rules.

                 Competition in Contracting Act

The Competition in Contracting Act (CICA) was passed in 1984 to promote competition and
reduce government costs of procurement.209 The CICA requires that all procurement
processes carried out by executive agencies involve a "full and open competition through
the use of competitive procedures"210 (subject to some exceptions); it also places various
requirements on all contracts over $25,000. The CICA governs all procurement contracts that
do not fall under more specific procurement legislation. Exceptions to the CICA's "full and
open competition" requirements211 include:

          1) single source contracts for goods or services;
          2) cases of unusual and compelling urgency;
          3) the maintenance of expertise or certain capacity;
          4) requirements under international agreements;
          5) situations with express authorization by statute;
          6) national security interests; and
          7) cases in which the head of the agency determines the exception is

                necessary and notifies Congress in writing.212

"Full and open competition" is fulfilled when "all responsible sources are permitted to
submit sealed bids or competitive proposals."213

                 Federal Acquisition Regulation

The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) took effect on April 1, 1984. Its purpose is to codify
and publish uniform policies and procedures for all acquisitions by executive agencies.214
The system is designed to efficiently deliver the product or service necessary not only to
fulfill public policy objectives, but also to provide the best value while promoting the
public's trust.

According to section 9.103 of the FAR, the US government will contract only with
"responsible contractors." To be deemed "responsible," contractors must meet a set of
standards contained in section 9.104, including a "satisfactory record of integrity and

business ethics."215 Contractors that fail to meet the standard of "presently responsible" can
be debarred or suspended from public procurement. Causes for debarment include
convictions for fraud, bribery, embezzlement or "any other offense indicating a lack of
business integrity or business honesty that seriously and directly affects the present
responsibility of a Government contractor or subcontractor."216 The FAR also includes a
catch-all provision that facilitates debarment for "any other cause of so serious or compelling
nature that it affects the present responsibility of a Government contractor."217 Causes for
debarment might arise from contract-related conduct or non-contractual conduct, such as
environmental misdemeanours.218 Officials in charge of debarment have wide discretion and
may consider mitigating factors or remedial measures implemented by the contractor.219
Debarment is government-wide and company-wide and generally lasts no more than three
years. 220

Suspensions are imposed pending investigations or legal proceedings when necessary to
protect the government's interest. The imposition of a suspension must be based on
"adequate evidence."221 Causes for suspension are similar to causes for debarment, except
only adequate evidence of the commission of an offence, rather than a conviction, is
required.

Part 3.10 of the FAR introduces the Contractor Code of Business Ethics and Conduct. Section
3.1002 states that contractors must operate "with the highest degree of honesty and
integrity" and have a written code of business ethics and conduct, along with a compliance
training program and internal controls system that will promote compliance with that code
of conduct. Other requirements for various types of contracts are laid out in section 52.203-
13.

To promote accountability in decision-making, the GAO operates a bid protest system. This
system allows parties who believe a federal agency has failed to comply with procurement
laws and regulations on a specific bid to file a protest with the GAO in order to have their
complaint resolved expeditiously.222

6.3 UK

Following the UK's withdrawal from the EU, EU law, including EU procurement rules, no
longer applies in the UK. This withdrawal did not, however, automatically result in the
repeal of procurement rules (including those based on EU law) that had been implemented
through domestic legislation and regulations. However, in the wake of Brexit, the UK

government has proposed sweeping changes to its domestic procurement rules. In
particular, in December 2020, the UK Cabinet Office published a green paper entitled
"Transforming Public Procurement" that proposes an "overhaul" of the UK's public
procurement regime.223 Since major changes are on the horizon, the discussion below
provides only a brief summary of the existing regime and the proposed new regime.

      6.3.1 Public Contracts Regulations 2015

Currently, the UK has two main sets of regulations224 governing public procurement: the
Public Contracts Regulations 2015 (PCR),225 which apply in England, Wales and Northern
Ireland, and the Public Contracts (Scotland) Regulations 2015, which apply in Scotland.226
Although broadly similar, the two sets of regulations differ in some respects.227 The
discussion below focuses on the PCR.

The PCR were enacted to ensure the UK's compliance with EU requirements (which are no
longer binding in the UK). Generally speaking, these regulations apply if the following
preconditions are met:

     1) The body doing the buying is a contracting authority. The definition of
          "contracting authority" is wide and includes central government, local
          authorities, associations formed by one or more contracting authorities, and
          other bodies governed by public law;

     2) The contract is for public works, public services or public supplies.
          Sometimes the contract will be a mixed contract (e.g., the supply and
          maintenance of computers). Where it is, a contracting authority must
          determine which element (e.g., the supply element or the service element) is
          the predominant element and, therefore, which set of rules will apply. This can
          be important to get right as the rules vary slightly depending on the type of
          contract (e.g., lower financial thresholds apply to services and supplies
          contracts than to works contracts); and

     3) The estimated value of the contract (net of VAT) equals or exceeds the
          relevant financial threshold. The rules expressly prohibit deliberately
          splitting contracts to bring them below the thresholds.

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

The principles of procurement are set out in section 18 of the PCR: treating economic
operators equally, without discrimination and in a transparent and proportionate manner.228
The PCR also provide that contracting authorities are not to design a procurement process
to exclude it from certain provisions of the PCR or to artificially narrow competition.229 The
PCR impose a duty on the contracting authority in relation to economic operators, and if this
duty is breached and the breach causes loss, an economic operator can bring a claim under
the PCR.230 The PCR specify the remedies that may be sought by economic operators. There
are exclusions as to when the PCR apply, such as where the authority is buying for the
defence and security sector, in which case the Defence and Security Public Contracts Regulations
2011 may cover the situation.231

In 2019 and 2020, in preparation for the UK's exit from the EU, amendments were made to
the PCR (and other statutes and regulations relating to public procurement).232

                 Public Services (Social Value) Act 2012

The Public Services (Social Value) Act 2012 (PSA)233 creates a statutory requirement for public
authorities in England and Wales "to have regard to economic, social and environmental
well-being in connection with public services contracts."234 The PSA applies only to public
service contracts, not public works or supplies contracts. A 2014 review of the PSA found
that, although implementation was underway, there were struggles in defining the
measurement technique of social value and lack of clarity on what should be measured.
These issues made it difficult to compare bids objectively.235 In conducting this review, the
government provided some guidance for public authorities on how to comply with the PSA
and include PSA considerations in the tendering process. The PSA may be seen as a toothless
initiative, as there are no penalties for non-compliance. However, the PSA does provide for
holistic consideration of the environmental, societal and economic impacts of tender
submissions, rather than limiting consideration to the actual cost of the initial procurement
project.

                 Proposed New Regime

In a December 2020 green paper entitled "Transforming Public Procurement," the UK
Cabinet Office proposed an "overhaul" of the UK's public procurement regime.236 This
proposal seeks to achieve the following objectives:

          The Government's goal is to speed up and simplify our procurement
          processes, place value for money at their heart, and unleash opportunities
          for small businesses, charities and social enterprises to innovate in public
          service delivery. The current regimes for awarding public contracts are too
          restrictive with too much red tape for buyers and suppliers alike, which
          results in attention being focused on the wrong activities rather than value
          and transparency. We need a progressive, modern regime which can adapt
          to the fast-moving environment in which business operates.237

The proposal seeks to achieve these objectives by "comprehensively streamlin[ing] and
simplify[ing] the complex framework of regulations that currently govern public
procurement" into a "single, uniform set of rules for all contract awards,"238 supplemented
by sector-specific rules (e.g., defence or utilities).

From an anti-corruption perspective, the proposed regime seeks to "minimise the risk of
corruption," including by "embedding transparency by default throughout the commercial
lifecycle,"239 requiring all contracting authorities to implement an open contracting data
standard,240 introducing new discretionary and mandatory grounds for exclusion of
suppliers (including a mandatory exclusion for any supplier with a criminal conviction
related to fraud, a mandatory exclusion for non-disclosure of beneficial ownership, and a
discretionary exclusion for suppliers who have entered into a deferred prosecution
agreement)241 and creating a centrally managed debarment list.242

The government has invited comments on its proposal, which will likely be followed by
draft legislation.

6.4 Canada

This section on Canadian law and procedures is restricted to the public procurement policy
framework at the federal level. Federal laws and policies aim not only to ensure good
governance and enforce the rule of law, but also to ensure compliance with Canada's
international treaty obligations. As Canada is a federal state, federal laws and policies
generally govern federal public procurement only. Any reference to "sub-federal
procurement" refers to procurement that occurs below the federal level (i.e., provincial or

municipal). Describing procurement laws and procedures only at the federal government
level is a serious limitation. Federal procurement laws and procedures are in general far
more detailed and stringent than most provincial and municipal procurement regimes.
Improvement of these latter regimes is a pressing need in Canada.

      6.4.1 Canada-US Agreement on Government Procurement

The Canada-US Agreement on Government Procurement (CUSAGP) came into effect on
February 16, 2010.243 Its primary goal, similar to the USMCA and the WTO-AGP, is to grant
Canada and the US access to each other's public infrastructure industry.244 However,
CUSAGP is significant in that it represents the first time Canada has made sub-federal
procurement commitments in an international treaty.245 The CUSAGP also provides
exemptions to "Buy American" provisions for Canadian bidders and guarantees US
suppliers access to provincial markets and contracts, with the exception of Nunavut.246

The core principles of the CUSAGP address non-discrimination and transparency. For the
purposes of transparency, entities subject to the CUSAGP are obligated to make their
procurement policies readily accessible and to use competitive tendering processes except
in certain circumstances.247 The exceptions cover the typical scenarios in which competitive
tenders are not necessary, such as in the event of an emergency.

In Canada, the CUSAGP applies to procurement for construction services248 in the provinces
where the value of the services is greater than or equal to C$5 million.249 For Crown
corporations and municipalities, it applies to contracts valued at C$8.5 million or more.250
Relatively few municipal contracts meet this monetary threshold.

                 Canadian Free Trade Agreement

The Canadian Free Trade Agreement (CFTA), which replaced the Agreement on Internal
Trade (AIT), is an intergovernmental trade agreement between all federal, provincial, and
territorial governments in Canada that entered into force on July 1, 2017.251 Its purpose is "to
reduce and eliminate, to the extent possible, barriers to the free movement of persons, goods,
services, and investments within Canada and to establish an open, efficient, and stable
domestic market."252 It commits federal, provincial, and territorial governments to a
comprehensive set of rules governing internal trade.253 These rules are designed to align with
Canada's international commitments (including under CETA) and to offer Canadian firms
the same access to the Canadian market as firms from Canada's international trading
partners.254 The CFTA applies to most areas of economic activity in Canada, except in respect
of entities, goods, and services that are specifically listed in the schedules for Canada and
each province and territory.255

Chapter 5 of the CFTA deals with government procurement. The purpose of this chapter is
"to establish a transparent and efficient framework to ensure fair and open access to
government procurement opportunities for all Canadian suppliers."256 The general
principles set out in this chapter provide that each party "shall provide open, transparent,
and non-discriminatory access to covered procurement by its procuring entities"257 and shall
treat the goods, services, and suppliers of any other party no less favourably than its own
goods, services, and suppliers.258 The rules in this chapter generally apply to procurement
by departments, ministries, boards, councils, publicly funded institutions (such as health or
academic institutions), municipalities and other government bodies, enterprises, and
agencies.259 However, they apply only if certain financial thresholds are met.260 Chapter 5
also provides for specific exceptions that are unique to Canada and each provincial and
territorial government.

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

From a transparency and anti-corruption perspective, Article 516 sets out basic transparency
requirements regarding the provision of information to suppliers, the publication of award
information, and the collection and reporting of statistics.261 Article 518 requires each party
to provide a "timely, effective, transparent, and non-discriminatory" administrative or
judicial review procedures for alleged breaches, as well as procedures that provide for
appropriate remedies.

      6.4.3 Criminal Code

Public procurement is also regulated or limited by a number of Criminal Code offences,
including bribery of officers,262 frauds on the government,263 breach of trust of a public
officer,264 municipal corruption,265 fraudulent disposal of goods on which money has been
advanced,266 extortion,267 and secret commissions.268 These offences are briefly described in
Chapter 2, Section 2.5. Sections 121(1)(f) and 121(2) of the Criminal Code are specific offences
in relation to federal and provincial procurement, but do not cover municipal procurement
offences. At the time of writing, these Criminal Code sections have not been used to prosecute
unlawful procurement actions. Instead, procurement offences are prosecuted under the
fraud and breach of trust offences in the Criminal Code, or the offence of "bid-rigging" under
s. 47 of the Competition Act269 (punishable by fine and/or a maximum of 14 years'
imprisonment).

      6.4.4 Federal Policy Framework and Integrity Regime

The policy framework270 for federal public procurement is set out in the Financial
Administration Act271 (and subordinate Government Contracts Regulations), the Federal
Accountability Act,272 the Auditor General Act,273 and the Department of Public Works and

Government Services Act.274 Within this legislative and regulatory framework, the principal
source of federal public procurement policy in Canada is the Integrity Regime. In brief, the
following are some of the key features of this regime:

      The purpose of the Integrity Regime is to "foster ethical business practices,
          ensure due process for suppliers and uphold the public trust in the procurement
          process."275

      The Integrity Regime is administered by Public Services and Procurement
          Canada (PSPC), formerly Public Works and Government Services Canada
          (PWGSC), on behalf of the Canadian government.

      The Integrity Regime applies government-wide to procurement and real
          property transactions over $10,000 (as well as any other contract that
          incorporates the regime by reference), subject to specified exceptions.276

      A supplier convicted of certain listed Canadian offences will be declared
          automatically ineligible for ten years (with the possibility of a reduction of up
          to five years under an administrative agreement).277

      A supplier convicted of an offence outside Canada that is "similar to" any
          Canadian offence for which a conviction would result in automatic ineligibility
          may be declared ineligible for ten years (with the possibility of a reduction of
          up to five years under an administrative agreement).278

      A supplier whose affiliate has been convicted of any Canadian offence for which
          a conviction would result in automatic ineligibility, or of a "similar offence"
          outside Canada and the supplier "directed, influenced, authorized, assented to,
          acquiesced in or participated in the commission of the offence,"279 may be
          declared ineligible for ten years (with the possibility of a reduction of up to five
          years under an administrative agreement).

      PSPC may suspend a supplier if the supplier has been charged with, or admits
          guilt of, any Canadian offence for which a conviction would result in automatic
          ineligibility, or has been charged with, or admits guilt of, a "similar offence"
          outside Canada.280

More information on the Integrity Regime can be found in Chapter 7, Section 8.6.

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

      6.4.5 Public Procurement in Quebec

An in-depth treatment of Quebec's efforts to curb public procurement corruptions is beyond
the scope of this text. However, a few brief remarks are warranted.

The issue of corruption in Quebec's construction sector was thrust into the spotlight in 2009
after reports revealed widespread bid-rigging and collusion, causing public outrage. As
mentioned in Section 1.3, then-Premier Jean Charest appointed the Charbonneau
Commission to conduct a public inquiry into corruption in the awarding and management
of public contracts in the province's construction industry. The Commission's report can be
accessed online.281 Evidence at the public inquiry revealed a thick web of corruption in the
construction sector at the provincial and municipal level and a connection between this
corruption and political party and election financing. The evidence also revealed that
organized crime had infiltrated Quebec's construction industry.

In Quebec's 2012 elections, the Parti Québécois (PQ) under Pauline Marois was elected.
Anxious to demonstrate the difference between the new government and the old, the PQ
put together its first bill--the Integrity of Public Contracts Act--in about six weeks.282 The
central feature of Bill 1 was a new system of pre-authorization for companies involved in
public procurement. Companies are required to obtain a certificate of integrity from the
Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF), Quebec's securities markets regulator, before
entering into construction and service contracts or subcontracts involving expenditures of
CDN$5 million or more, Ville de Montréal contracts covered by Orders in Council and
certain P3 contracts.283 Beginning in November 2015, the threshold for pre-authorization of
public service contracts was lowered to CDN$1 million, and the Quebec government
subsequently indicated its intention to eventually lower the threshold to CDN$100,000 for
all public contracts (except Ville de Montréal contracts, which are subject to different
thresholds).284 The certificate will be automatically denied if any of a set of objective criteria
are not met.285 The decision also depends on subjective criteria, as there is discretion to deny
applications "if the enterprise concerned fails to meet the high standards of integrity that the

public is entitled to expect from a party to a public contract."286 The legislation identifies
potentially relevant factors in making this determination.

Writing in 2015, Canadian lawyer and former politician Graham Steele, argued that this
provision is "startlingly subjective."287 He advanced a number of other critiques of Bill 1. For
example, he claimed that "the Bill 1 debate is devoid of any real diagnosis of why or where
the corruption is occurring."288 He also argued that Quebec's lawmakers had almost no
objective evidence to support a belief that their anti-corruption legislation would work to
stem corruption, yet no one opposed the bill.289 He suggested that the public outcry pushed
legislators to simply "do something, and do it quickly," therefore focusing efforts on
"building an edifice that sounds like it might work to stem corruption, rather than examining
the evidence, in the literature and precedents from around the world, for what was likely to
work [emphasis in original]."290 Steele suggested that, while public outcry was placated, Bill
1 has had "an almost entirely nominal effect."291

In 2017, after Steele published his critique, the Quebec legislature passed Bill 108, the Act to
facilitate oversight of public bodies' contracts and to establish the Autorité des marchés publics,292
which among other things amended the Act Respecting Contracting by Public Bodies and
created a new, neutral, independent body responsible for overseeing public procurement
and the application of legislation and regulations governing public contracts in Québec: the
Autorité des marchés publics (AMP). The AMP, which took over the public procurement
functions of the AMF, describes its role and mandate as follows:

          The Autorité des marchés publics (AMP) is a neutral, independent body
          that is the sole gateway for oversight of public procurement and the
          application of legislation and regulations governing public contracts in
          Québec. Its oversight role covers the public sector, the health and education
          networks, government corporations, and the municipal sector.

          However, a specific feature applies to the City of Montréal. The duties and
          powers attributed to the AMP, except those pertaining to the examination

          to the City of Montréal or a person or an organization related to the City of
          Montréal and covered by the Act, exercised by the Inspector General of the
          City of Montréal. The Inspector General assumes the same obligations as
          the AMP would pursuant to its duties and powers.

          The AMP's mission is to oversee all public contracts, in particular
          compliance with the tendering and contract award process and to receive
          complaints from interested persons. It is also responsible for the register of
          business enterprises that are authorized to enter into public contracts and
          subcontracts and the register of enterprises ineligible for public contracts.

          The Act attributes various powers to the AMP, including audit and
          investigative authority that enables the AMP, as the case may be, to issue
          orders, make recommendations or suspend or cancel contracts.293

Thus, the AMP's role is not restricted to pre-authorization; it extends more broadly to
overseeing public procurement and public contracts in the province.294 Lawyers Nathalie
Beauregard and Marjolaine Verdon-Akzam summarize the AMP's key responsibilities and
powers as follows:

          Among other tasks, the AMP must

                · examine the compliance of a tendering or awarding process
                     for a public contract of a public body - the review may be
                     done on the AMP's own initiative, or after a complaint is filed
                     by an interested person, or on the request of the Chair of the
                     Conseil du trésor or a bidder;

                · maintain the register of enterprises ineligible to enter into a
                     public contract or subcontract and the register of enterprises
                     authorized to do so; and

                · ensure that the contract management of the Ministère des
                     Transports and any other public body the government
                     designates is carried out in accordance with the normative
                     framework to which the body is subject.

          Various powers are given to the AMP to conduct audits and investigations
          and to give subsequent orders and recommendations. These may include,
          but are not limited to, orders to a public body to amend its tender
          documents or to cancel the public call for tenders, and to suspend the
          performance of any public contract or cancel such a contract.295

Notably, Bill 108 did not amend the provision creating subjective grounds to deny public
contracts.296 However, Sarah Chaster notes that the bill has been hailed as a significant
improvement:

          Bill 108 helps to better situate Quebec's pre-authorization scheme within a
          more nuanced public procurement framework. Section 21.27 of the ACPB,
          which contains the provision allowing discretion to refuse authorization if
          an enterprise "fails to meet the high standards of integrity" expected by the
          public, is not amended by the bill. This means the same "startling
          subjectivity" raised by Steele would still be present in the legislation.
          However, the broad discretion might be tempered somewhat since pre-
          authorization would now be established within the concentrated expertise
          of the AMP, whose mission would include not only pre-authorization but
          also generally overseeing all public contracts and ensuring integrity and
          ongoing compliance with public procurement processes. Bill 108 has been
          lauded as a significant change that would bring positive developments and
          greater uniformity to Quebec's public procurement processes. It responds
          directly to one of the most central recommendations made by the
          Commission with regards to public procurement [i.e., the recommendation
          that Quebec create a public procurement authority].297

It remains to be seen whether the AMP will succeed in enhancing transparency and integrity
in the Quebec public procurement. It is clear, however, that Quebec has taken an important
step in the right direction.

                 Office of the Procurement Ombudsman

The Government of Canada has put in place a Procurement Ombudsman.298 As set out in s.
22.1(3) of the Department of Public Works and Government Services Act, the mandate of the
Procurement Ombudsman is to:

          a) review the practices of departments for acquiring materiel and services
                to assess their fairness, openness and transparency and make any
                appropriate recommendations to the relevant department for the
                improvement of those practices;

          b) review any complaint respecting the compliance with any regulations
                made under the Financial Administration Act of the award of a contract
                for the acquisition of materiel or services by a department to which the

                Implementation Act, would apply if the value of the contract were not
                less than the amount referred to in Article 504 of that Agreement.

          c) review any complaint respecting the administration of a contract for the
                acquisition of materiel or services by a department; and

          d) ensure that an alternative dispute resolution process is provided, on
                request of each party to such a contract.299

A primary function of the Procurement Ombudsman is to review the procurement practices
of departments, including PSPC, and publicly report on the results. In order to ensure its
independence in carrying out this duty, the Procurement Ombudsman operates at arm's
length from PSPC.

The Office of the Procurement Ombudsman:

          · works with suppliers and federal departments to clarify and address
                procurement issues;

          · helps preserve the integrity of the federal procurement process by
                reviewing complaints from suppliers about the award or
                administration of a contract and making balanced recommendations;

          · helps facilitate the resolution of contract disputes through alternative
                dispute resolution;

          · reviews procurement practices in one or across a number of federal
                departments where recurring or systemic procurement issues are
                present;

          · makes recommendations to strengthen fairness, openness and
                transparency in federal procurement practices; and

          · shares information on effective practices identified in the federal
                government and other jurisdictions to highlight leadership and
                reinforce positive initiatives in the field of procurement.300

Bribery Convention. Phase 1 evaluated the country's legislation, phase 2 evaluated whether
the country was applying their legislation, phase 3 evaluated the country's enforcement of
the Convention and phase 4 (currently ongoing) further evaluates the country's

performance. In each phase, the Working Group provides recommendations for the country
to improve its compliance. The Working Group also publishes follow-up reports on each
country's performance.301

                 US

The 2010 Phase 3 Report on Implementing the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention in the US did not
criticize the US's implementation of the Convention in respect of its public procurement
regime. However, it did note that the US rarely chose to debar companies that were
convicted of bribery of a foreign public official even though US laws provided that
companies could be debarred from federal contracts for up to three years for convictions
under domestic and foreign anti-bribery laws. Recommendation 4 suggested that
debarments be applied equally to companies convicted of domestic and foreign bribery.302

The Working Group's 2012 follow-up for the US described the actions taken to implement
the OECD's recommendation on debarment. The follow-up report confirmed that there is a
statutory mechanism for the debarment of persons convicted of violations of the Arms Export
Control Act.303 In addition, the report noted that although the FCPA does not impose
mandatory statutory debarment, debarment was usually the result of indictment and/or
conviction.304

The 2020 Phase 4 Report commended the US on its "strong enforcement" of the FCPA and on
"maintaining its prominent role in the fight against transnational corruption."305 The report
noted that these achievements resulted from "a combination of enhanced expertise and
resources to investigate and prosecute foreign bribery, the enforcement of a broad range of
offences in foreign bribery cases, the effective use of non-trial resolution mechanisms, and
the development of published policies to incentivise companies' cooperation with law
enforcement agencies."306 The report also made various recommendations for the US to:

          · consider how it can enhance protections for whistleblowers who
                report suspected acts of foreign bribery by non-issuers and enhance
                guidance about the protections available to whistleblowers who report
                suspected acts of foreign bribery;

                and publicize its policy and guidance on how it enforces the FCPA;

                foreign bribery cases to improve the monitoring of impact of
                sanctions.307

                 UK

The 2012 Phase 3 Report on Implementing the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention in the UK noted
that while the UK had significantly enhanced its foreign bribery enforcement efforts since
the previous review, it needed to be more transparent when resolving cases. The report
made further recommendations for the UK to:

          · maintain the role and resources of the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) in
                criminal foreign bribery investigations and prosecutions;

          · avoid confidentiality agreements that prevent disclosure of key
                information about settled cases;

          · promptly adopt a roadmap to proactively extend the Convention to
                overseas territories;

          · continue to provide evidence to other countries after settlements,
                where appropriate; and

          · ensure that companies effectively move towards "zero tolerance" of
                facilitation payments.308

The 2017 Phase 4 Report commended the UK on having "taken significant steps since Phase
3 to increase enforcement of the foreign bribery offence" and on becoming "one of the major
enforcers among the Working Group countries."309 The report also acknowledged that the
UK had made "[i]mportant legislative reforms, including the introduction of deferred

that the UK had taken "taken significant steps to enhance its detection capabilities, including
through intelligence analysis by the SFO [Serious Fraud Office], improved whistleblowing
channels, and mobilisation of some of its government agencies."311

On the other hand, the report identified a number of areas of concern. For example, it noted
that "Scotland's practices and frameworks for foreign bribery enforcement could be brought
in line with those in place in England and Wales," "there is also scope to improve
communication between law enforcement authorities from England and Wales and those in
Scotland," "the persistent uncertainty about the SFO's existence and budget is harmful,"
"anti-money laundering measures should be enhanced to improve detection of foreign
bribery, including adopting the Criminal Finances Bill," and "the tax administration
[should] conduct as a matter of priority a comprehensive review of its methods and capacity
to detect and report foreign bribery."312

In its two-year follow-up report on its Phase 4 Report, the Working Group noted that the UK
had "addressed a number of key Phase 4 recommendations, notably asserting the SFO's role
in foreign bribery cases and generally enhancing the capacity for enforcement of the foreign
bribery and related offences."313 On the other hand, the report lamented that "no steps have
been taken to address long-standing recommendations to ensure the independence of
foreign bribery investigations and prosecutions, or to enhance detection through AML-
reporting mechanisms."314 The report also observed that "[d]espite an increased level of
enforcement of foreign bribery laws, the total number of finalised and ongoing cases relative
to the UK economy remains relatively low."315

                 Canada

The 2011 Phase 3 Report on Implementing the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention in Canada found
that the CFPOA was lacking because it did not include civil or administrative debarment
sanctions for companies convicted under the act.316 The suggested sanction was exclusion
from bidding on government contracts for a set period after conviction under the CFPOA.317
Canada's domestic bribery laws already provided for this:

          Persons convicted under section 121 of the Criminal Code of bribing an
          official of the Government of Canada, government of a province, or Her
          Majesty in right of Canada or a province ("Frauds on the Government"),

          have no capacity to contract with Her Majesty or receive any benefit under
          a contract with Her Majesty, pursuant to subsection 750(3) of the Criminal
          Code, under Part XXIII, entitled "Sentencing."318

This provision applies only to charges of domestic bribery, and thus it does not capture
CFPOA offences. However, the Working Group's 2013 follow-up report found that Canada
had remedied this problem in July 2012, when PSPC added convictions for foreign bribery
under s. 3 of the CFPOA to the list of offences that would automatically result in
debarment.319 For more information on PSPC's debarment policies, see Chapter 7, Section
8.6.

Other key recommendations included that Canada:

          · amend the CFPOA so that it is clear that it applies to bribery related to
                the conduct of all international business, not just for-profit business;

          · ensure that sanctions applied in practice for CFPOA violations are
                effective, proportionate and dissuasive;

          · take such measures as may be necessary to prosecute Canadian
                nationals for bribery of foreign public officials committed abroad; and

          · clarify that police and prosecutors may not consider factors such as the
                national economic interest and relations with a foreign state, when
                deciding whether to investigate or prosecute allegations of foreign
                bribery. 320

The Working Group's 2013 follow-up report noted that Canada had introduced legislation
(Bill S-14, subsequently enacted as the Fighting Foreign Corruption Act) addressing a number
of its concerns. In particular, this legislation, among other things, clarified that the offence
of foreign bribery: applies to all businesses, regardless of profit; extended the jurisdictional
scope of the CFPOA so that Canada may prosecute foreign bribery committed by Canadians
or Canadian companies, regardless of where the offence was committed; and established
specific criminal offences for bookkeeping violations committed for the purpose of bribing
foreign public officials or hiding such bribery.321 The report also noted that the Public
Prosecution Service of Canada was in the process of updating its policies.322

8. OTHER ISSUES

8.1 Role of Discretion in Public Procurement

The degree to which discretion should be regulated is a key issue facing governments in
designing effective procurement systems. Although discretion leaves space for corruption,
some discretion is required in order to ensure that the best bid--not just the lowest--is
selected. The need for discretion generally increases with the complexity of the project and
the number of factors to consider. Italian economist Gustavo Piga, describes some of the
problems associated with strict regulation of discretion:

          Reducing discretion has other drawbacks that are seldom considered in the
          fight against corruption. First, rigid procedures may shield procurement
          officials/politicians from responsibility for poor performance and failures
          (`not my fault, the rules' fault), while favoritism may be hidden by a wall of
          complex procedural rules. Second, if the agent is competent, discretion
          offers valuable flexibility, especially in complex procurement situations.324

Instead of removing discretion, holding officials accountable for defects in the procurement
process may be viewed as a more efficient way of reducing corruption.325 At a deeper level,
creating a culture of integrity within government institutions is essential, though this cannot
be achieved through laws and regulations alone.

8.2 Role of Technology in Combatting Corruption in Public

       Procurement

Technology is increasingly being viewed as an important tool for combatting corruption in
public procurement. TI describes the use and potential of technology to reduce corruption
in public procurement as follows:

          Information and communication technologies have been increasingly used
          by governments across the world as part of procurement reform processes.
          This so-called e-procurement, defined as "the use of any internet-based
          inter-organisational information system that automates and integrates any
          parts of procurement process in order to improve efficiency, transparency
          and accountability in the wider public sector" (Vaidya 2007) has been used
          by governments to conduct procurement-related tasks, such as the
          acquisition of goods and services, and the allocation of contracts to bidders
          (Neupane et al. 2014).

          There are several types of e-procurement, including e-tendering, e-auctions,
          and contract management databases (OECD 2011). Each of them aims to

                                                                                                          991
GLOBAL CORRUPTION

          address issues that are also seen as problematic from a corruption risk
          perspective in the different stages of the procurement process, namely, (i)
          contracting process, covering the initial needs assessment, budget allocation
          and initial market research through to the preparation of the tender, and (ii)
          evaluation of applications and (iii) award of contracts.

          ...

          The literature highlights several benefits of e-procurement, including:
          improvements in market access and competition, promotion of integrity,
          reduction of costs of information, easy access to information, and increased
          transparency and accountability, among others. With regard to corruption,
          Schapper (2007) stresses that "the strength of e-procurement in the anti-
          corruption agenda arises from this capacity to greatly reduce the cost and
          increase the accessibility of information as well as automate practices prone
          to corruption".

          Nevertheless, the extent to which the use of technology in public
          procurement will de facto lead to less corruption and more accountability
          depends on a series of other factors, including a clear legal framework on
          public procurement that supports the e-procurement vision and objectives,
          effective training to both public officials and business, public awareness
          initiatives to develop civic oversight, as well as, strong oversight and law
          enforcement bodies that make use of the information available to
          investigate and punish corruption and mismanagement throughout the
          procurement process.

          The establishment of an e-procurement system as a stand-alone reform is
          unlikely to bring about positive transformational results. Transparency and
          accountability must be built into e-procurement specifications and design
          in order to allow for a meaningful analysis of the information generated.
          For example, e-procurement should allow for the generation of meaningful
          management and audit reports, and the tracking of actions and decisions of
          individuals throughout the procurement cycle (Schapper 2007).

          Within this framework, when well designed and implemented, e-
          procurement in the public sector usually enhances transparency and it has
          the potential to increase accountability and minimise the risks of corruption
          (OECD 2008).326

As an illustration of recent efforts to use new technologies to combat corruption, in June
2020, the World Economic Forum published a report exploring the use of blockchain
technology as a means of reducing corruption in public procurement.327 As this report
describes, blockchain is an open, distributed ledger that can record transactions in a verified
and permanent way. This technology "provides the unique combination of permanent and
tamper-evident record-keeping, transaction transparency and auditability, automated
functions with `smart contracts', and the reduction of centralized authority and information
ownership within processes. These properties make blockchain a high-potential emerging
technology to address corruption."328 The report reaches the following conclusions about
blockchain's potential to provide "technologically induced sunlight" in public procurement
processes:

          Overall, blockchain-based e-procurement systems provide unique benefits
          related to procedural transparency, permanent record-keeping and honest
          disclosure. However, blockchain technology also presents certain
          challenges, most notably scalability and vendor anonymity. A blockchain-
          based solution is also unable to reduce corruption risk in certain human
          activities that can occur outside the electronic procurement system, most
          notably bribery or collusion among vendors or between vendors and
          tenderers. Given the challenges and limitations, the case for a blockchain-
          based e-procurement system is ambiguous and depends most on the
          specific country context, institutional goals and the technology's design,
          configuration and implementation.329

While technology offers a potentially powerful tool for enhancing transparency and
combatting corruption in public procurement, it is no panacea. It is just one aspect of a sound
public procurement system.

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

1. INTRODUCTION

Whistleblowing is one method of uncovering corruption in public and private sector
organizations. Indeed, whistleblowing may be seen as "among the most effective ... means
to expose and remedy corruption, fraud and other types of wrongdoing in the public and
private sectors."1 Transparency International (TI) cites whistleblowing as one of the key
triggers for effective corruption investigations.2 Examples of prominent whistleblowers
include Dr. Jiang Yanyong in China, who blew the whistle on the spread of the SARS virus
contrary to explicit orders, and Allan Cutler in Canada, who "disclosed suspicions of fraud
that led to the revealing of millions of misspent public funds in a sponsorship scandal,
leading to the defeat of the Liberal party in the 2006 elections."3 More recently, Dr. Li
Wenliang in China has made headlines as a whistleblower for attempting to warn others of
a "disease that looked like Sars"4--which would soon spread throughout the world in the
COVID-19 pandemic. Whistleblowers can thus play pivotal roles in promoting political
accountability and protecting public health and safety.

However, the benefits of whistleblowing can only be reaped if effective legal regimes are in
place to safeguard reporting persons from retaliation, and to ensure that the appropriate
parties act upon the disclosures in a timely and efficient manner. In the past 15-20 years, the
need to enact and enforce whistleblowing laws has become one of the most prominent
issues, nationally and internationally, in the global fight against corruption. The call for
effective whistleblowing laws has gathered steam in international conventions against
corruption, and a number of countries have responded by creating new whistleblower laws
or improving their existing whistleblower laws.5

This chapter will set out international obligations concerning whistleblower protection, then
identify best practices, and finally explore the current state of public sector whistleblower
protection primarily in the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada.

2. WHAT IS WHISTLEBLOWING?

One of the most widely used academic definitions of whistleblowing originated in an article
by Marcia Miceli and Janet Near in 1985. They defined "whistleblowing" as "the disclosure
by organization members (former or current) of the illegal, immoral or illegitimate practices
under the control of their employers to persons or organizations that may be able to effect
action."6 This definition focuses only on the act of disclosure, rather than on whistleblowing
as a process that needs to be examined before, during, and after disclosure. Many academics
have now embraced broader conceptions of whistleblowing. David Banisar, for example,
"treats whistleblowing as a means to promote accountability by allowing for the disclosure
by any person of information about misconduct while at the same time protecting the person
against sanctions of all forms."7 In their study on public sector whistleblowing in Norway,
Marit Skiveness and Sissel Trygstad identify several problems with Miceli and Near's
narrow definition of whistleblowing, and they advocate for a bifurcated definition which
recognizes whistleblowing as a process:

          [W]e suggest a distinction between weak and strong whistle-blowing. We
          see the general definition of Miceli and Near as the first step in the whistle-
          blowing process, and we define this as `weak whistle-blowing'. `Strong
          whistle-blowing' focuses on process and on cases where there is no
          improvement in, explanation for, or clarification of the reported misconduct
          from those who can do something about it. 8

J Bus Ethics 1 at 4. Reasons for adopting this definition are discussed by Rodney Smith in "The Role
of Whistle-Blowing in Governing Well: Evidence from the Australian Public Sector" (2010) 40:6 Am
Rev Pub Admin 704 at 708, and include maintaining consistency with how whistleblowing has been
defined by governments (including its definition within legislation), maintaining consistency with
other academic work, and using a definition "that allows for a wide range of propositions about
whistle-blowing to be tested."

8 Marit Skivenes & Sissel C Trygstad, "When Whistle-Blowing Works: The Norwegian Case" (2010)
63:7 Hum Relations 1071 at 1077; the three problems that the authors identify with Miceli and Near's
definition, in the context of their study, are:

            whistle-blowing concerns all forms of communication where critical voices are raised about
            wrongdoing in the presence of someone who can stop the misconduct[,] ... the definition
            rests on employees' assessments of illegitimate, immoral and/or illegal situations and can
            thus cover many types of misconduct ... [and] empirically, the definition does not seem to
            grasp how Norwegian employees and managers collaborate, nor how Norwegian working
            life is structured.

                                                                                                          997
GLOBAL CORRUPTION

Thus, when whistleblowing is examined as a process it necessitates laws or policies that
provide a clear description: (1) of what types of perceived wrongdoing should be disclosed,
(2) to whom such disclosures should be made initially and subsequently (if the initial
disclosure does not prompt an investigation), (3) how and by whom the alleged wrongdoing
should be investigated, (4) the mechanisms and procedures that are in place to encourage
persons to disclose wrongdoing while protecting the whistleblower from any disciplinary
action or adverse consequence for reporting the wrongdoing, and (5) the steps to be taken if
adverse consequences are, or appear to be, imposed on the whistleblower.

The question of what laws and practices produce the best whistleblowing regime is not one
that is susceptible to a single answer. Section 4 of this chapter will review some features of
whistleblowing regimes that arguably lead to more successful results. As will be seen, to
be effective whistleblower laws must be examined in the overall context of a country's
legal and political sophistication, as well as its social and economic realities.

3. INTERNATIONAL LEGAL FRAMEWORK

This section will briefly review existing regional and global treaties against corruption
with mandates in regard to whistleblowing laws for member states. As will be seen, the
standards for whistleblowing laws contained within these international agreements
are generally rather weak and lacking in detail.

3.1 UNCAC

Article 33 of UNCAC provides for the protection of reporting persons (i.e., whistleblowers):

          Each State Party shall consider incorporating into its domestic legal system
          appropriate measures to provide protection against any unjustified
          treatment for any person who reports in good faith and on reasonable
          grounds to the competent authorities any facts concerning offences
          established in accordance with this Convention.9

See also Björn Fasterling, "Whistleblower Protection: A Comparative Law Perspective" in AJ Brown
et al, eds, International Handbook on Whistleblowing Research (Cheltenham: Edward Elgar, 2014) 331 at
334 for a critique of Miceli and Near's definition. The author argues:

     [The] definition is problematic because rather than disclosing illegal, immoral or illegitimate
     practices, the whistleblower discloses information that he or she believes will provide
     evidence or at least a substantiated indication of illegal, immoral or illegitimate practice.
     The disclosure can under no circumstances be independent of the whistleblower's own
     subjective judgment.

9 United Nations Convention Against Corruption, 31 October 2003, I-42146 (entered into force 14
December 2005) [UNCAC], art 33.

998                                                                                                    2022
                                                    CHAPTER 13 WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTIONS

The above Article is meant to cover individuals with "information that is not sufficiently
detailed to constitute evidence in the legal sense of the word."10 However, Article 33 is
optional, not mandatory. A state need only "consider" adopting "appropriate measures" to
protect whistleblowers, and the provision only provides protection from "any unjustified
treatment" to those who acted "in good faith and on reasonable grounds" [emphasis added].
Thus, a State Party is free to deliberate, and then simply decide not to adopt any reporting
protections.11 Even with its obvious weaknesses, the protections offered under this section
represent an expansion of previously recognized protections, and the UN in supporting
documents has encouraged ratifying states to enact robust whistleblowing regimes under
Article 33:

          The UN Office on Drugs and Crime's "Anti-Corruption Toolkit" notes that
          Article 33 is an advancement from previous agreements such as the 2000
          Convention against Transnational Organized Crime which only protects
          witnesses and experts. The Toolkit extensively covers whistleblowing and
          recommends legal and administrative measures for reporting and
          protection including compensation, the creation of hotlines, and limits on
          libel and confidentiality agreements.12

In comparison, Article 32 of UNCAC provides for mandatory protection of witnesses,
experts, and victims: it dictates that states "shall take appropriate measures ... to provide
effective protection from potential retaliation or intimidation for witnesses and experts who
give testimony concerning offences established in accordance with this Convention and, as
appropriate, for their relatives and other persons close to them."13 Unfortunately, this
mandatory protection does not protect whistleblowers from retaliation or intimidation
unless they are "witnesses or victims" to the wrongdoing and they give "testimony" in the
prosecution of wrongdoers. Most potential whistleblowers do not fall into this narrow
group. Moreover, the ultimate objectives of whistleblowing laws are not simply to assist in
the prosecution of an alleged wrongdoer, but also to play a preventative role. As TI
observed, "the ideal situation is where a whistleblower raises concerns in time so that action
can be taken to prevent any offence."14

Effectively Promote Public-Interest Whistleblowing?" (2014) 153:1 Intl Labour Rev 71 at 76. The
authors also suggest, at 76, that limiting protection in Article 33 to those who have "reasonable
grounds" may be an unnecessary limitation of whistleblower protection: "It almost goes without
saying that in some situations it will be difficult to distinguish between strong suspicions and
reasonable grounds."

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

Articles 32 and 33 are integral to the overall effectiveness of UNCAC. In fact, Marco Arnone
and Leonardo Borlini argue that these provisions are essential to meeting all other objectives
within UNCAC:

          Articles 32 and 33 ... address the protection of witnesses, thereby
          complementing efforts regarding the prevention of public and private
          corruption, obstruction of justice, confiscation and recovery of criminal
          proceeds, as well as cooperation at the national and international levels.
          Even though the aim is far from easy to achieve, the underlying rationale is
          obvious: unless people feel free to testify and communicate their expertise,
          experience or knowledge to the authorities, all objectives of the Convention
          could be undermined.15

Without the protection offered in these provisions, countries attempting to operationalize
UNCAC would be unnecessarily hobbled by difficulties in uncovering, investigating, and
resolving corruption issues.

In 2017, the Corruption and Economic Crime Branch of the United Nations Office on Drugs
and Crime (UNODC) released the State of implementation of the United Nations Convention
against Corruption, a comprehensive analysis of the implementation of certain chapters of
UNCAC.16 This flagship study found that there was

          considerable variation among States parties with regard to the
          implementation of article 33 ... [m]ore than two thirds of States parties have
          not established comprehensive whistle-blower protection measures or were
          found to be only partially in compliance with the provision under review,
          although legislation was pending in a significant number of cases.17

Particular challenges reported in respect of Articles 32 and 33 were as follows:

          The main challenge in respect of the implementation of article 32 is that of
          addressing inadequate normative frameworks and, in some States parties,
          the complete absence of comprehensive measures or programmes for the
          protection of witnesses, experts and victims, as well as their relatives or
          associates. This is explained by the significant costs of such programmes,
          limited awareness of state-of-the-art measures and practices for witness and
          expert protection, specificities of the national legal systems (including
          sometimes the small size or geographical isolation of the country), weak
          inter-agency coordination and limited capacities (e.g., in terms of human
          resources and technological and institutional infrastructure). A further

          challenge concerns the non-application of existing measures in practice,
          owing to the novelty of witness protection laws and methods, lack of
          instructions and regulations for their implementation and lack of
          experience in running the relevant programmes. It was noted that most
          States parties have not entered into relocation agreements with other States
          parties, in some cases because of the alleged high complexity of such an
          operation. Finally, many States parties do not have provisions in place to
          enable the presentation and consideration of the views and concerns of
          victims.

          ...

          The challenges reported as relevant to the implementation of article 33 are
          much the same as those related to witness protection. Additionally, the need
          was emphasized for carrying out ancillary programmes to raise awareness
          on the importance of disclosing acts of corruption, the reporting
          mechanisms and the means of protection available to whistle-blowers. This
          would facilitate the practical application of laws on the protection of
          whistle-blowers. Further suggested ancillary measures include the
          provision of financial incentives for whistle-blowers, the creation of
          institutionalized whistle-blower protection policies within companies, and
          the establishment of independent bodies specifically responsible for
          implementing the domestic public interest disclosure and whistle-blower
          protection policies.18

3.2 OECD Convention

The OECD Convention itself does not specifically include provisions on whistleblowing.
Nevertheless, various subsequent OECD instruments encourage the adoption of
whistleblower protections. For example, in 1998 the OECD issued a Recommendation on
Improving Ethical Conduct in the Public Service. That recommendation stated that transparency
and accountability in the decision-making process should be encouraged through
"measures such as disclosure systems and recognition of the role of an active and
independent media."19 That recommendation was abrogated and replaced by the
Recommendation of the Council on Public Integrity, which was adopted in 2017.20 This states
that to "cultivate a culture of public integrity,"21 adherents should, among other things:

          9. Support an open organisational culture within the public sector
          responsive to integrity concerns, in particular through:

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

                a) encouraging an open culture where ethical dilemmas, public
                integrity concerns, and errors can be discussed freely, and, where
                appropriate, with employee representatives, and where leadership
                is responsive and committed to providing timely advice and
                resolving relevant issues;

                b) providing clear rules and procedures for reporting suspected
                violations of integrity standards, and ensure, in accordance with
                fundamental principles of domestic law, protection in law and
                practice against all types of unjustified treatments as a result of
                reporting in good faith and on reasonable grounds[;]

                c) providing alternative channels for reporting suspected
                violations of integrity standards, including when appropriate the
                possibility of confidentially reporting to a body with the mandate
                and capacity to conduct an independent investigation[.]22

Further, to "enable effective accountability,"23 adherents should "[a]pply an internal
control and risk management framework to safeguard integrity in public sector
organisations, in particular through ... ensuring control mechanisms are coherent and
include clear procedures for responding to credible suspicions of violations of laws and
regulations, and facilitating reporting to the competent authorities without fear of
reprisal."24

The 2003 Recommendation on Guidelines for Managing Conflict of Interest in the Public Service
stipulates that states ought to "[p]rovide clear rules and procedures for whistle-blowing,
and take steps to ensure that those who report violations in compliance with stated rules are
protected against reprisal, and that the complaint mechanisms themselves are not abused."25
The 2009 Recommendation of the OECD Council for Further Combating Bribery of Foreign Public
Officials in International Business Transactions similarly recommends that member states
should put in place "easily accessible channels ... for the reporting of suspected acts of
bribery of foreign public officials in international business transactions to law enforcement
authorities, in accordance with their legal principles."26 The 2019 Recommendation of the
Council on Guidelines on Anti-Corruption and Integrity in State-Owned Enterprises specifically
addresses reporting persons and provides, in part:

          High standards of conduct should be applied to the state, setting an
          example for conduct in SOEs and exhibiting integrity to the public as the

          ultimate owner. To this end, representatives of the ownership entity and
          others responsible for exercising ownership on behalf of the state should:

          ...

          Have clear rules and procedures for reporting concerns about real or
          encouraged illegal or irregular practices that come to their notice in the
          performance of their ownership functions. Procedures should include, as
          needed and where appropriate, reporting to competent authorities that are
          removed from the ownership function and that have the mandate and
          capacity to conduct investigations free from undue influence. Those
          reporting concerns should be protected in law and in practice against all
          types of unjustified treatments as a result.

          ...

          The state should, without intervening in the management of individual
          SOEs, take appropriate steps to encourage integrity in SOEs, expecting and
          respecting that SOE boards and top management promote a "corporate
          culture of integrity" throughout the corporate hierarchy through, inter alia:
          (i) a clearly articulated and visible corporate policy prohibiting corruption;
          (ii) facilitating the implementation of applicable anti-corruption and
          integrity provisions through strong, explicit and visible support and
          commitment from boards and management to internal controls, ethics and
          compliance measures (hereafter referred to as "integrity mechanisms"); (iii)
          encouraging an open culture that facilitates and recognises organisational
          learning, and encourages good governance and integrity and protects
          reporting persons (also known as "whistleblowers"), and; (iv) leading by
          example in their conduct.

          ...

          Encouraging the establishment of clear rules and procedures for employees
          or other reporting persons to report concerns to the board about real or
          encouraged illegal or irregular practices in or concerning SOEs (including
          subsidiaries or business partners). In the absence of timely remedial action
          or in the face of a reasonable risk of negative employment action, employees
          are encouraged to report to the competent authorities. They should be
          protected in law and practice against all types of unjustified treatments as a
          result of reporting concerns.27

Recommendations such as these show a recognition of the important role that
whistleblowers can play in reducing corruption in the public service and in business. Finally,

whistleblowers as the "ultimate line of defence for safeguarding the public interest,"28 and
identifies areas of reform for whistleblower protection frameworks in OECD countries.
However, as Arnone and Borlini note, the whistleblower protections in OECD member
states are far from uniform.29

3.3 Other Regional Conventions and Agreements

References to whistleblower protection can be found in a number of other regional
conventions and agreements. For example, the first inter-governmental agreement to tackle
whistleblower protection was the Inter-American Convention against Corruption. This
Convention came into force on March 6, 1997, under the purview of the Organization of
American States, a group of 35 member states in the Americas (including Canada and the
US) formed in 1948.30 The Convention suggests that signatories consider introducing or

protection-9789264252639-en.html>.
29 See Arnone & Borlini, supra note 15 at 424. They state:

      Whistleblower protection is seen as a horizontal issue which confronts its Member States.
      In its Report the WGB has engaged rather frequently with the issue. For instance:

      The Phase 3 report on the UK points out that the law does not apply to
      nationals working abroad on contracts made under a foreign law. The Phase 3
      report on South Korea cited the enactment of the 2011 law as an important
      development, since the law extends protective measures to private-sector
      employees who report foreign bribery cases. The Phase 3 report on Japan noted
      the requirement for a review of its 2004 law after approximately five years. As
      the Act came into force in 2006, the review took place in March 2011. It was
      conducted by the Consumer Commission--made up of representatives from
      academia, the business community, the legal profession, media, etc. They
      concluded there was no need to amend the Act but that, due to the
      insufficiency of legislative information for the review, further research was
      recommended. The Phase 2 report on Chile notes the 2007 law establishing
      whistleblower protection in the public sector, encourages the authorities to
      expand it to state companies, and recommends that Childe enhance and
      promote the protection of private- and public-sector employees. According to
      the 2009 follow-up report of the recommendations of the Phase 2 report, this
      recommendation has been only partially implemented. See TI (2013:21).

For an in-depth illustration of the OECD follow-up mechanism see Chapter 16 of Arnone & Borlini,
supra note 15. The OECD report, Government at a Glance 2017 ((Paris: OECD Publishing, 2017) at 121,
online: <http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/governance/government-at-a-glance-2015_gov_glance-2015-
en>) states that 88% of member countries have whistleblower protection laws. Out of 26 respondent
countries to the OECD's survey, all have protections in place for public sector employees, while eight
do not for private sector employees. One third of respondents provide incentives to whistleblowers.

strengthening whistleblower protections within their own legal and institutional systems as
a means of preventing corruption: Article III, section 8, provides that "state parties agree to
consider the applicability of measures ... [and] systems for protecting public servants and
private citizens who, in good faith, report acts of corruption, including protection of their
identities, in accordance with their Constitutions and the basic principles of their domestic
legal systems" [emphasis added].31 The whistleblower provision is thus optional, not
mandatory. The agreement emphasizes the role that each signatory's domestic legal context
would play in the creation and maintenance of an effective whistleblower protection
scheme. However, apart from Canada, the US and Peru, Arnone and Borlini reported that
as of 2014, the other OAS Convention members have nonexistent, or weak, whistleblower
laws.32 A March 2020 Report of the Mechanism for Follow-Up on the Implementation of the Inter-

32 Arnone & Borlini, supra note 15 at note 9, state:

            As detailed in Chapter 16 of this book, the Implementation of the Convention is overseen by
            the Mechanism for Follow-Up on the Implementation of the Inter-American Convention
            against Corruption (MESICIC). The reports show that apart from Canada, the US and Peru,
            most OAS countries do not have specific whistleblower laws, but most have some
            protection for whistleblowers contained in criminal laws, procedural laws or labor laws.
            There is also a smaller group of countries without regulation on the subject. Reports
            frequently recommend measures of protection for whistleblowers where they are
            considered incomplete (e.g., Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Nicaragua, and Trinidad and Tobago).
            The latest reports on Bolivia and Paraguay call for the implementation of whistleblower
            systems, which have been enacted, but then left aside. The report finds that in Bolivia
            whistleblowers are often persecuted. On the other hand, Costa Rica argues that no
            whistleblower system is necessary as, surprisingly, there have never been any reprisals
            against whistleblowers. Notably, in 2010 the OAS agreed [to create] a model whistleblower
            law. This model law was updated and approved by the OAS Anti-Corruption Mechanism
            on 19 March 2013.

The model law in question can be found at OAS, Model Law to Facilitate and Encourage the Reporting of
Acts of Corruption and to Protect Whistleblowers and Witnesses, Mechanism for Follow-Up on the
Implementation of the Inter-American Convention Against Corruption, 21st meeting,
SG/MESICIC/doc345/12 rev 2, (March 2013), online (pdf):
<http://www.oas.org/juridico/PDFs/model_law_reporting.pdf>. However, there are problematic
aspects of this model law. For example, firstly, the "law" appears to resemble an agreement (both
stylistically and substantially) more than it does a model of legislation, and it is unclear how this
"model" could easily be adopted by OAS countries that want to implement legislation. Secondly, the
model law (at Article 8) imposes a positive obligation on "[a]ny person having knowledge of an act
of corruption" to report to the appropriate authorities. It is unclear how such an obligation could be
effectively introduced or enforced, especially if protection against reprisals continues to be weak or
nonexistent. Finally, many of the provisions are vague, and it is unclear how the legislative goals will
be met: Article 16, for example, states that "[p]rotection for persons reporting acts of corruption must

                                                                                                         1005
GLOBAL CORRUPTION

American Convention against Corruption (MESICIC) lists, among the most common
recommendations with regard to the provisions reviewed in the second round, a number of
recommendations related to Article III, section 8. These include, inter alia, "[e]stablish
mechanisms to protect all whistleblowers and their families, not only their physical integrity,
but also to provide protection in the workplace, especially when the person is a public
official and the acts of corruption involve his superior or co-workers" and "[e]stablish
mechanisms for reporting, such as anonymous reporting or protection of identity reporting,
that guarantee the personal security and the confidentiality of the identity of public servants
and private citizens who in good faith report acts of corruption."33

On the other hand, at least one regional Convention "requires" state members to have
whistleblowing laws. The Council of Europe, a human rights organization with 47 member
states (of which 27 belong to the European Union), produced the Council of Europe Civil
Law Convention on Corruption, which came into force on November 1, 2003.34 Article 9
states: "Each Party shall provide in its internal law for appropriate protection against any
unjustified sanction for employees who have reasonable grounds to suspect corruption and
who report in good faith their suspicion to responsible persons or authorities" [emphasis
added].35 The Council of Europe has also adopted Recommendation CM/Rec(2014)7 of the
Committee of Ministers to member states on the protection of whistleblowers, which "sets
out a series of principles to guide member states when reviewing their national laws or when
introducing legislation and regulations or making amendments as may be necessary and
appropriate in the context of their legal systems."36

Another regional agreement is the Anti-Corruption Action Plan for Asia and the Pacific, which
was created out of the joint efforts of the Asian Development Bank and the OECD. It was

safeguard their physical and psychological integrity and that of their family group, their property,
and their working conditions, which could possibly be threatened as a result of their reporting an act
of corruption." While the model law goes on to suggest that this may involve legal advice,
confidentiality, protection from dismissal, or even police protection, there is little indication of how
such broad goals will be operationalized within OAS countries.

endorsed on November 30, 2001.37 Pillar 3 of the action plan specifically identifies the
protection of whistleblowers as a critical element in encouraging public participation in
combating corruption.38 However, the provisions of the action plan are not mandatory:
under Implementation, the action plan states that "[i]n order to implement these three pillars
of action, participating governments of the region concur with the attached Implementation
Plan and will endeavour to comply with its terms" [emphasis added].39

Two examples involve organizations in African countries. First, the African Union is made
up of the majority of African states and was launched in 2002.40 The Preamble to the 2003
African Union Convention on Preventing and Combating Corruption recognizes the serious
detrimental effects that corruption has on the stability of African states, as well as people in
Africa.41 It recognizes the potential of whistleblowing as a corruption prevention
mechanism, and seems to have a scope wide enough to encompass ordinary citizens within
its protection. The language of these provisions is mandatory--State Parties undertake to:

          5. Adopt legislative and other measures to protect informants and
                witnesses in corruption and related offences, including protection of
                their identities.

          6. Adopt measures that ensure citizens report instances of corruption
                without fear of consequent reprisals.

          7. Adopt national legislative measures in order to punish those who
                make false and malicious reports against innocent persons in
                corruption and related offences.42

It should be noted that clause 5 on protection of informants and witnesses requires
"legislative" measures, while clause 6 on protection of citizens who report corruption from
fear of reprisals does not require "legislative" measures and is satisfied if a state implements

The AUCPCC Preamble emphasizes the negative consequences of corruption in Africa: "Concerned
about the negative effects of corruption and impunity on the political, economic, social and cultural
stability of African States and its devastating effects on the economic and social development of the
African peoples."
42 Ibid, art 5. Arnone & Borlini, supra note 15 at 425, argue that, although the language is obligatory,
"no particular penalizing scheme can be inferred for failure to comply with these requirements."

some form of non-legislative protective measures. In addition, as Arnone and Borlini argue,
clause 7 may act as a deterrent to truthful whistleblowers, since it is wide enough to punish
honest whistleblowers who "reasonably" suspect corrupt behaviour, which on further
investigation is not proven.43 Finally, the effectiveness of the convention is weakened by the
fact that there is no credible enforcement or evaluation mechanism: each state simply self-
reports on its convention compliance.44

Second, the South African Development Community is composed of 15 member states in
the southern region of Africa. The 2001 Southern African Development Community Protocol
Against Corruption, Article 4, encourages the creation and maintenance of "systems for
protecting individuals who, in good faith, report acts of corruption."45 This provision, like
that of the African Union Convention, contains mandatory language.46 Furthermore, both of
these documents contain strongly worded provisions denouncing individuals who make
false reports.47 This is problematic because it may have a chilling effect on information
disclosures:

          Such provision, the aim of which is to prevent a misuse of the Convention
          itself, might paradoxically well result in a general impasse of the
          investigation. What is more, in many countries the menace of such
          punishment is an effective deterrent to truthful whistleblowers who expose
          the guilty.48

44 AUCPCC, supra note 41, art 22(7). Kolawole Olaniyan, "The African Union Convention on
Preventing and Combating Corruption: A Critical Appraisal" (2004) 4 Afr Hum Rts LJ 74 at 76, states
that "the Convention lacks any serious, effective or meaningful mechanism for holding states
accountable for the obligations they assume under it, or for resolving disputes among State Parties,
including a potential claim by one party that another is failing to properly carry out its obligations."
However, Lucky Bryce Jatto Jnr, in "Africa's Approach to the International War on Corruption: A
Critical Appraisal of the African Union Convention on Preventing and Combating Corruption" (2010) 10
Asper Rev Intl Bus & Trade L 79 at 93-94, suggests that the Advisory Board (created pursuant to
Article 22(1)) could, potentially, exert some influence over effectively reviewing and encouraging
development of anti-corruption policies, through its power to create its own rules of procedure:

      [U]nlike the practice with most peer-review monitoring mechanisms, which rely to some
      extent on `country self-assessments based on a questionnaire' and allow room for subjective
      and unreliable results, the AU Advisory Board receives annual reports on the progress
      made in the implementation of the AU Convention from the independent national anti-
      corruption authorities or agencies created pursuant to the AU Convention by the State
      Parties. In addition, given its mandate to `build partnerships,' the AU Advisory Board may
      invite submissions from civil society and private sector organizations.

The potential chilling effect of denouncing those who make false reports, coupled with the
lack of oversight and monitoring of ratification and enforcement, makes it unlikely that these
agreements will have any significant influence in causing member states to create effective
whistleblower protection regimes.

Finally, although not a regional agreement per se, the European Union--the political and
economic union of 27 member states in the European region--in 2019 issued Directive (EU)
2019/1937 of the European Parliament and of the Council of October 23, 2019 on the
Protection of Persons Who Report Breaches of Union Law (the Whistleblower Directive).49
It came into force on December 16, 2019. The recitals acknowledge the "fragmented" state of
whistleblower protection in the EU. The Whistleblower Directive sets out minimum
standards for the protection of persons reporting breaches of EU law (Article 1), and defines
the material scope to which it applies (Article 2). It addresses, among other things, both
internal and external reporting (chapters II and III), as well as public disclosures (chapter
IV). EU member states are required to bring into force the laws, regulations, and
administrative provisions necessary to comply with the Whistleblower Directive by
December 17, 2021 (Article 26).

4. "BEST PRACTICES" IN WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTION
      LEGISLATION

4.1 Limitations of Best Practices

Various organizations and academics have developed suggestions for "best practices" and
standards for whistleblower protection legislation. These best practices are suggestions as
to how to most effectively draft whistleblower legislation and they provide ideas for
countries attempting to develop or improve whistleblower legislation.50 By way of an
important introductory observation, Paul Latimer and AJ Brown note that effective
whistleblower protection can only exist in a democratic society that values accountability
and transparency; in other words, "[a] precondition for whistleblower laws is the rule of
law, including an independent legal system and independent judiciary."51 This precondition
will be met in varying degrees from country to country. In a similar vein, the efficacy of
whistleblower protection will be dependent not only on what is found within the four

49 EC, Directive (EU) 2019/1937 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2019 on the
Protection of Persons who Report Breaches of Union Law, [2019] OJ, L 305/17 [EC Directive].
50 The role of best practices was highlighted by TI, which suggests that UNCAC implementation
reviews ought to provide special guidance regarding the implementation of Article 33, which
"should take into consideration material developed by other institutions such as the TI `International
Principles for Whistleblower Legislation' as well as best-practice materials, guiding principles and
model legislation produced by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD), Organization of American States (OAS) and others": TI, supra note 2 at 5.

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

corners of the applicable legislation, but more importantly in how the appropriate bodies
put legislative protections into practice.

It is also important to recognize that it is seldom, if ever, effective to simply transplant
successful legislative regimes from one cultural setting to another52 or from developed
countries to developing countries.53 Whistleblowing schemes in developed democracies
may not be appropriate or effective in the "specific context of developing countries who do
not always have an institutional framework in place that supports the rule of law and
[where] a culture of transparency and accountability remains questionable."54 Thus, in
discussing best practices, it is crucial to take into account the cultural and institutional
environments of the countries that are considering the adoption of whistleblower protection
legislation. If such contextual factors are not taken into account, the efficacy of whistleblower
legislation will be seriously undermined.55 Brown warns that best practices models should
be examined with a careful eye on the legal, administrative, and political context of each
country:

          [T]he search for "ideal" or "model" laws is complicated by three problems:
          the diversity of legal approaches attempted by jurisdictions that have
          sought to prioritise whistleblower protection through special-purpose
          legislation (sometimes inaccurately called `stand-alone'); the frequent lack
          of evidence of the success of these approaches; and the lack of a common
          conceptual framework for understanding policy and legal approaches to

52 For example, in Heungsik Park et al, "Cultural Orientation and Attitudes Toward Different Forms
of Whistleblowing: A Comparison of South Korea, Turkey, and the UK" (2008) 82:4 J Bus Ethics 929
at 937, the authors conclude that legislative and organizational responsiveness to cultural context
may play a large role in the efficacy of whistleblower protection:

      [O]rganizational systems for dealing with an employee's response to wrongdoing should be
      based on an understanding of the impact of nationality and cultural orientation on
      employees' preferred ways to blow the whistle. This has obvious implications for policy
      and practice, suggesting as it does that organizations seeking to improve the likelihood of
      employees reporting wrongdoing may need to tailor their policies and procedures to a
      country-specific context.

See also Wim Vandekerckhove et al, "Understandings of Whistleblowing: Dilemmas of Societal
Culture" in Brown et al, supra note 8, 37.
53 For example, in Sajid Bashir et al, "Whistle-Blowing in Public Sector Organizations: Evidence from
Pakistan" (2011) 41:3 Am Rev Pub Admin 285 at 286, the authors suggest:

      [S]tudies in developed countries cannot be generalized and may not necessarily have any
      applicable lessons for organizations in developing countries such as Pakistan because of the
      absence of a robust legal system and the cultural dimensions of being a closely knit society
      where everyone is related to someone significant through common sect, cast [sic] or creed.

regimes as a factor that stigmatizes the actions of whistleblowers.

          whistleblowing across different legal systems, including those where
          whistleblower protection may be strong but not reflected in special-purpose
          legislation.

          [N]otwithstanding international interest, there is no single `ideal' or `model'
          law that can be readily developed or applied for most, let alone all countries.
          This is due to the diverse and intricate ways in which such mechanisms
          must rely on, and integrate with, a range of other regimes in any given
          jurisdiction.56

What should a good whistleblower law look like? There are various sources that one can
turn to in order to try to extract the best aspects or elements of a "good" whistleblower law.

4.3 General Characteristics

While the scope and significance of the appropriate elements of best practices are open to
reasonable disagreement, academics and organizations tend to focus on five broad areas: (1)
scope and clarity of legislation (2) mechanisms for disclosure (3) protection of identity (4)
protection against retaliation, and (5) remedies available for wronged whistleblowers. This
section will briefly discuss each of these areas in turn.

      4.3.1 Scope and Clarity of Legislation

The scope of whistleblower protection legislation, especially in regard to the range of people
protected and the types of disclosures covered, is an area of central concern for organizations
and academics. Banisar suggests that most legislation dedicated to whistleblower protection
is too narrow, and that the efficacy of these laws is difficult to measure.57 Best practices in
whistleblowing legislation favour wide coverage; indeed, "in time there may be a case for
whistleblowing laws to move to a full `no loopholes' approach, targeting public sector and
private sector whistleblowing with sector-blind principles and practices."58 Closing the
"loopholes" in legislation involves increasing the range of people who fall within legislative
protection. TI, for example, suggests that legislative protections should apply to all
whistleblowers, regardless of whether they work in the public or private sector.59 In
addition, members of the public may be a "useful" information source, and they may require
protection from intimidation or reprisals.60 According to Tom Devine, Legal Director of the
Government Accountability Project, "[s]eamless coverage is essential so that accessible free
expression rights extend to any relevant witness, regardless of audience, misconduct or
context to protect them against any harassment that could have a chilling effect."61

Whistleblowing-And-Mental-Health.pdf>, wherein he notes that whistleblower protection should
protect all citizens who have relevant disclosures regardless of their formal employment status. He
cites broad US whistleblower protection laws (primarily in the criminal realm) as a good example of
legislation affording protection to all those who take part in or are impacted by the activities of an
organization: "[o]verarching U.S. whistleblower laws, particularly criminal statutes, protect all
witnesses from harassment, because it obstructs government proceedings."

Whistleblower protection also should provide protection against "spillover relation"; that
is, it should protect those who are not whistleblowers, but who may be perceived as
whistleblowers, have assisted whistleblowers, or are preparing to make a disclosure.62 The
UK's Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998 (PIDA),63 which protects workers in the public and
private sectors as well as those working as independent contractors, has been seen as a
model of expansive coverage.64 In a 2013 Report, TI emphasizes PIDA's broad coverage:

          In 1998, the UK passed one of the most comprehensive whistleblower
          protection laws in the world: the Public Interest Disclosure Act. Known as
          PIDA, the law applies to the vast majority of workers across all sectors:
          government, private and non-profit. It covers a range of employment
          categories, including employees, contractors, trainees and UK workers
          based abroad.

          ...

          Several countries have used PIDA as a template for their own laws and
          proposals, including Ireland, Japan and South Africa. 65

In addition, the types of disclosures protected should be broad and should cover a wide
range of wrongdoing; that is, "[p]rotected whistleblowing should cover "any" disclosure
that would be accepted in a legal forum as evidence of significant misconduct or would
assist in carrying out legitimate compliance functions."66 TI notes that "[l]imiting the scope
of information for which individuals will be protected hinders whistleblowing. Indeed, if
people are not fully certain that the behaviour they want to report fits the criteria, they will
remain silent, meaning that organisations, authorities and the public will remain ignorant of
wrongdoing that can harm their interests."67 The substance of the disclosure should be
paramount, rather than the form of the disclosure or the category within which the
disclosure is made to fit.68 Here, again, PIDA has been seen as a leading example, despite its
use of enumerated categories of wrongdoing rather than a completely open-ended
approach:

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

          Under PIDA, whistleblowers are able [to] disclose a very broad range of
          crimes and wrongdoing, including corruption, civil offences, miscarriages
          of justice, dangers to public health or safety, dangers to the environment,
          and covering up of any of these.69

The sectoral approach, which offers protection to disclosures in certain areas (such as public
health) but not others, has been criticized as unnecessarily narrow. A piecemeal approach,
wherein protection to different types of whistleblowers is provided for in different pieces of
legislation, may similarly result in loopholes and a less effective disclosure regime overall.
This was one of the major criticisms in a TI review of whistleblower protection in European
countries, where "research found that whistleblowing legislation in the countries covered
by this report is generally fragmented and weakly enforced."70 The report recommends that
a "single, comprehensive legal framework" be provided for the protection of
whistleblowers.71 Generally speaking, there seems to be a consensus that dedicated
legislation is preferred in a whistleblower protection regime, and that broad coverage (in
terms of those protected and the types of wrongdoing that may be disclosed) is vitally
important.

A related best practices concern is the need to provide clarity in whistleblowing laws and
policies, regardless of the scope and framework of the legal regime. As TI states:

          [a]n important requirement of any whistleblowing legislation is to make
          sure that it clearly sets out its scope of application, that is, what types of
          wrongdoing are covered, whom it applies to and what level of belief in the
          concern raised the whistleblower should have.... Loopholes and lack of
          clarity might lead to situations where individuals decide to speak up in the
          belief that they are protected, when in fact they are not and as such are
          vulnerable to unfair treatments.72

The public may not understand the meaning of terms such as "the public interest," and
therefore clarity may require setting out a more detailed list of the types of wrongdoing
covered by the legislation.73 Lack of clarity in legislation, whether related to the breadth of
coverage or the manner of required disclosure, can have significant impacts on the overall
efficacy of the legal regime. For example, TI discusses how confusion regarding Latvian laws
made investigating and acting upon disclosures difficult, if not impossible:

          In Latvia, the lack of a clear set of steps for receiving and responding to a
          disclosure has even been evidenced within the Ombudsman's Office, a

report were Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania,

          government institution which oversees matters related to the protection of
          human rights and good governance. In 2007, nearly half of the
          Ombudsman's Office employees complained of alleged misconduct by the
          Office's director. The lack of clear reporting channels internally led to
          confusion about how to investigate and resolve the case. After pressure
          from non-governmental organisations, including the local TI chapter, the
          case was heard by a parliamentary body, which did not investigate the root
          of the claims. As a result, the case was ultimately dismissed.74

Whatever the preferred route, the prescribed mechanisms for disclosure ought not to be
overly complicated or formalistic. As Banisar notes:

          An overly prescriptive law which makes it difficult to disclose wrongdoing
          undermines the basic philosophy of promoting disclosure and encourages
          informal or anonymous releases. However, at the same time, a law that
          allows for unlimited disclosures will not encourage internal resolution and
          promote the development of a better internal culture of openness.75

      4.3.2 Mechanisms for Disclosure

Certain disclosure procedures have also been identified as preferable. Based in part on
Australian studies, TI recommends that internal reporting (where the first line of reporting
should be to the appropriate authorities within the organization) be encouraged through the
establishment and maintenance of internal systems of disclosure, which offer the benefits of
ease and accessibility to potential whistleblowers.76 Key to the efficacy of such internal
mechanisms is ensuring "a thorough, timely and independent investigation of concerns ...
[with] adequate enforcement and follow-up mechanisms."77

However, external means of disclosure should also be available and accessible, and it should
be possible to disclose information to other bodies such as regulators or the media (albeit,

EN.pdf>.
77 Ibid. Rodney Smith, "The Role of Whistle-Blowing in Governing Well: Evidence From the
Australian Public Sector" (2010) 50:6 Am Rev Pub Admin 704 at 719, concludes that large-scale
research into whistleblowing in the Australian public sector suggests that internal reporting is
overwhelmingly popular amongst whistleblowers, even when there are external reporting agencies
available. The study showed:

            [B]etter outcomes ... were associated with public sector organizations that publicized good
            whistle-blowing procedures, had well-trained managers and specialist staff, and that
            offered specialist support for whistle-blowers.

External agencies became important in the relatively small number of cases in which reprisals
occurred.

                                                                                                         1015
GLOBAL CORRUPTION

possibly along different tiers of disclosure).78 This is because the circumstances of the
particular case may make a certain avenue of disclosure more appropriate than another, and
"a variety of channels need to be available to match the circumstances and to allow
whistleblowers the choice of which channel they trust most to use."79 TI states that "[i]f there
is a differentiated scale of care in accessing these channels, it shall not be onerous and must
provide a means for reporting on suspicion alone."80 Similarly, Banisar recommends that
internal disclosures should be encouraged and facilitated, but that "procedures should be
straightforward and easily allow for outside organizations to seek the counsel of higher
bodies, legislators and the media in cases where it is likely that the internal procedure would
be ineffective."81 The October 2015 G20 Report likewise called for:

          [C]lear rules for when whistleblowing to the media or other third parties is
          justified or necessitated by the circumstances ... [and] clear rules for
          defining the internal disclosure procedures that can assist organisations to
          manage whistleblowing, rectify wrongdoing and prevent costly disputes,
          reputational damage and liability, in the manner best suited to their needs.82

The stepped or tiered approach can be observed in PIDA:

          PIDA uses a unique "tiered" system by which whistleblowers can make
          their disclosures and be legally protected from retaliation. Employees can
          disclose information to their employer, regulatory agencies, "external"
          individuals such as members of Parliament, or directly to the media.
          However, the standards for accuracy and urgency increase with each tier,
          so whistleblowers must heed this in order to be legally protected.83

A similar approach can be observed in the EU Whistleblower Directive. Article 7(2) provides
that "Member States shall encourage reporting through internal reporting channels before
reporting through external reporting channels, where the breach can be addressed
effectively internally and where the reporting person considers that there is no risk of
retaliation." Articles 8 and 9 address the obligation to establish reporting channels and
procedures for internal reporting and follow-up.

78 For example, Paul Stephenson & Michael Levi, The Protection of Whistleblowers: A Study on the
Feasibility of a Legal Instrument on the Protection of Employees Who Make Disclosures in the Public Interest,
CDCJ(2012)9FIN (Strasbourg: Council of Europe, 2012) at 5, online:
<http://rm.coe.int/doc/0900001680700282>, suggest that external routes (such as regulatory
authorities and law enforcement) are required where internal reporting proves ineffective, and that
"[g]oing to the press is - or should be - an option of last resort, albeit a vital one." At 29, the authors
explicitly recommend "a `stepped approach,' with different grounds required at each stage ... [and]
if at any stage there is no response, then it is clear the whistleblower can go to the next level."

Article 10 then provides that "[w]ithout prejudice to point (b) of Article 15(1) [circumstances
in which the reporting person's reasonable grounds of belief would support public
disclosure], reporting persons shall report information on breaches using the channels and
procedures referred to in Articles 11 and 12, after having first reported through internal
reporting channels, or by directly reporting through external reporting channels." Articles
11, 12, 13, and 14 address, in turn, the obligation to establish external reporting channels and
follow up on reports, the design of external reporting channels, information regarding the
receipt of reports and their follow-up, and review of the procedures by competent
authorities.

Finally, Article 15 provides for public disclosures. It states:

          1. A person who makes a public disclosure shall qualify for protection
          under this Directive if any of the following conditions is fulfilled:

                (a) the person first reported internally and externally, or directly
                externally in accordance with Chapters II and III, but no appropriate
                action was taken in response to the report within the timeframe
                referred to in point (f) of Article 9(1) or point (d) of Article 11(2); or

                (b) the person has reasonable grounds to believe that:

                     (i) the breach may constitute an imminent or manifest danger to
                     the public interest, such as where there is an emergency situation
                     or a risk of irreversible damage; or

                     (ii) in the case of external reporting, there is a risk of retaliation or
                     there is a low prospect of the breach being effectively addressed,
                     due to the particular circumstances of the case, such as those
                     where evidence may be concealed or destroyed or where an
                     authority may be in collusion with the perpetrator of the breach or
                     involved in the breach.

          2. This Article shall not apply to cases where a person directly discloses
          information to the press pursuant to specific national provisions
          establishing a system of protection relating to freedom of expression and
          information.

Certain provisions are applicable to internal and external reporting: the duty of
confidentiality (Article 16), processing of personal data (Article 17), and record keeping of
the reports (Article 18).

In an article comparing the UK and US legislative regimes, Jenny Mendelsohn argues that a
model law would be explicit in its preference for internal or external disclosure, and she
suggests that internal reporting ought to be preferred. However, she also argues that while
internal reporting should be afforded "almost automatic protection," this does not mean that
external reporting should be subject to a multitude of preconditions.84 Furthermore,

Responses to Internal and External Whistleblowing" (2009) 8:4 Wash U Global Stud L Rev 723 at 743.

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

Mendelsohn's model law would allow for disclosures to the media only when reporting
through internal and external channels has proven to be ineffective.85

After a disclosure is made, it may be appropriate to keep the reporting person informed of
the outcome of the disclosure. A 2015 guide by the UNODC indicated that not only must all
reports be assessed according to their merits, but also that those who disclose information
should be informed of decisions made on the basis of their report (e.g., whether the matter
will be investigated).86 Similarly, Devine recommends that the corrective action process
should be transparent, and that the reporting person who disclosed the issue "should be
enfranchised to review and comment on the draft report resolving alleged misconduct, to
assess whether there has been a good faith resolution."87

      4.3.3 Protection of Identity

Protection of identity is an area in which there is disagreement as to the appropriate best
practice. There is widespread recognition of the need for ensuring whistleblower
confidentiality; indeed, Devine suggests that channels of disclosure must protect
confidentiality to ensure that the flow of information is maximized, including name
protection and the protection of identifying information.88 If the identity of a whistleblower
must be revealed (e.g., because of the need for testimony in a criminal proceeding), the
whistleblower should be provided with "as much advance notice as possible."89 However,
while there is general agreement with respect to the need for whistleblower confidentiality,
there is controversy over the role of anonymous reporting.

TI suggests that not only should the identity of a whistleblower be protected (i.e., kept
confidential), but that legislation should also allow for anonymous disclosure.90 Similarly,
Banisar argues that anonymity may have a place in a model whistleblower protection law,
despite the general exclusion of anonymous disclosures from current legislation: for
example, "[a]nonymity may be ... useful (not to say essential) in some cases, such as in
jurisdictions where the legal system is weak or there are concerns about physical harm or
social ostr[a]cization."91 The October 2015 G20 Report concluded that a central area of
concern was the need for "clear rules that encourage whistleblowing by ensuring that
anonymous disclosures can be made, and will be protected."92

In contrast, Latimer and Brown suggest that anonymous disclosures should be used only as
something of a "last resort," given the perception that anonymity would discourage
whistleblower accountability and might, in fact, encourage intentionally false reports.93

Allowing anonymous disclosures might, therefore, increase the volume of disclosures so as
to make reporting systems less effective and increase the difficulty of investigations.94 Paul
Stephenson and Michael Levi, in a report commissioned by the Secretary General of the
Council of Europe, similarly question the need for anonymous disclosures where
confidentiality is protected:

          Legal and social problems stem from anonymous disclosures: anonymous
          information is rarely admissible as evidence in courts. There have been
          cases where, because the whistleblower has remained anonymous, another
          worker has been suspected and sacked ... research results indicate that
          auditors attribute lower credibility and allocate fewer investigatory
          resources when the whistleblowing report is received through an
          anonymous channel.95

It has been suggested that it may be possible to address some of the concerns with respect
to anonymous reporting (such as difficulty in assessing credibility and in seeking
clarification) through the use of technology such as proxy emails, which allow two-way
communication.96 TI suggests that the practical difficulties associated with protecting
anonymous persons, as well as the issues surrounding seeking further information and
informing the whistleblower of the progress of the investigation, may be remedied by
anonymous email, online platforms, or the use of an intermediary.97

      4.3.4 Protection Against Retaliation and Oversight of that Protection

Robust protection against retaliation is a cornerstone of effective whistleblower protection
legislation. TI reports that fear of retaliation or unfair treatment is a leading reason
influencing people not to make disclosures.98 Effective protection from reprisals is required,
as is a broad understanding of what reprisals might entail: "The law should cover all
common scenarios that could have a chilling effect on responsible exercise of free expression
rights."99 A key element in ensuring the protection of whistleblowers is educating public
employees on their rights and protections under whistleblower legislation, because
"[w]histleblowers are not protected by any law if they do not know it exists."100 Those in
positions of power, who may be receiving protected disclosures or working with
whistleblowers following disclosures, also need to be educated on their responsibilities
under the law. In addition, it is important that protection against retaliation not be limited
to a short period of time following the disclosure, as reprisals may occur months or even

94 OECD, supra note 28 at 63.
95 Stephenson & Levi, supra note 78 at 32. The authors suggest that anonymous reporting systems
may be a first step in the whistleblowing process: "The whistle-blowers' confidence may develop as
the exchange progresses: if the intelligence is to be used effectively they will need to identify
themselves to the authorities at some stage."

years after the initial disclosure.101 The EU Directive 2019/1937 seems to provide the most
robust protection against retaliation provisions to date.102

Protection within legislation is crucial, but in order to provide whistleblowers with effective
shelter from retaliation the legislation must actually be put into practice. The Government
Accountability Project, a US-based non-governmental organization, notes that
whistleblower laws may actually prove to be counterproductive if they do not have any
teeth:

          While whistleblower protection laws are increasingly popular, in many
          cases the rights have been largely symbolic and therefore
          counterproductive. Employees have risked retaliation thinking they had
          genuine protection, when in reality there was no realistic chance they could
          maintain their careers. In those instances, acting on rights contained in
          whistleblower laws has meant the near-certainty that a legal forum would
          formally endorse the retaliation, leaving the careers of reprisal victims far
          more prejudiced than if no whistleblower protection law had been in place
          at all.103

Adequate oversight is required to ensure that the legislation is doing the work that it was
designed for, and this may be accomplished through independent bodies, an
ombudsperson, sectoral bodies or courts and tribunals.104

      4.3.5 Remedies and Rewards

When retaliation cannot be prevented and whistleblowers face reprisals, adequate and
timely compensation is necessary. Compensation "must be comprehensive to cover all the
direct, indirect and future consequences of the reprisal."105 This may include reinstatement,
compensation for lost wages, awards for suffering, or a range of other reparations. It would
be beneficial not to limit the amount of compensation, and "[c]ompensation should be
broadly defined to cover all losses and seek to place the person back in an identical position
as before the disclosure."106 An effective compensation scheme may require interim relief,
given the high costs of time delays to whistleblowers seeking the remedies promised in the
whistleblowing legislation.107 In addition, it is important that whistleblower protection laws
offer reporting persons a "realistic time frame" within which to assert their rights: Devine

102 EC Directive, supra note 49. The Directive, inter alia, requires member states to ensure that
prescribed persons have access to appropriate support measures (Article 20). Further, the Directive
establishes the duty for member states to take necessary measures to prohibit any type of
whistleblower retaliation against prescribed persons, and provides an enumerated list of examples of
prohibited forms of retaliation (Article 19). It also requires member states to provide for "effective,
proportionate and dissuasive penalties" to persons that, inter alia, hinder or attempt to hinder
reporting, or retaliate (Article 23).

suggests a one year limitation period, in contrast to the 30-60 days contained in some pieces
of legislation.108

There has been significant debate over the role that rewards should play in model
whistleblower legislation. In the US, discussed in more detail in Section 5.2, various pieces
of legislation allow whistleblowers to collect cash rewards when the government recovers
money as a result of the information disclosed. The value of the information is thought to
outweigh any questions regarding the morality of the motivations behind disclosure.109 And,
if rewards are offered to whistleblowers, a further question may be: how much is
appropriate?110 However, these moral questions have not been so easily dismissed by
everyone in the field. Protect (formerly Public Concern at Work), a UK-based non-
governmental organization, did not recommend the introduction of financial incentives into
PIDA for reasons related to the underlying philosophy of encouraging reporting in this way,
as well as concerns regarding the practical implications of rewarding whistleblowers in this
manner. The 2013 Report stated:

          The majority of respondents to our consultation (including whistleblowers)
          were not in favour of rewards. The reasons given were multiple and in
          summary were as follows:

                a) inconsistent with the culture and philosophy of the UK

                b) undermines the moral stance of a genuine whistleblower
                c) could lead to false or delayed reporting

                d) could undermine credibility of witnesses in future criminal or
                     civil proceedings

                e) could result in the negative portrayal of whistleblowers

                f) would be inconsistent with the current compensatory regime in
                     the UK.

          The provision of a reward may well incentivise those who would not
          normally speak out. However, it may also encourage individuals to raise a
          concern only when there is concrete proof and monetary reward. This could
          reduce the opportunity to detect malpractice early and prevent harm.
          Additionally, it is difficult to use the model in sectors other than the
          financial sector, such as care or health.
          Rewards are not a substitute for strong legal protection. There is no reason
          why whistleblowers should not be recognised and rewarded in the

          workplace via remuneration structures, promotion or other recognition
          mechanisms including by society at large (e.g., the honours list).111

The view that monetary rewards are a valuable tool to encourage reporting misconduct has
become widespread. An increasing number of research papers and notes have been
published in recent years that tend to support the effectiveness of monetary incentives.112
The National Whistleblower Center argues that monetary rewards are an effective tool to
incentivize people to provide high-quality tips which result in successful prosecutions.113

As a final point, whistleblower protection is untenable if it saddles a victim of retaliation
with an unwieldy burden of proof. Thus, the "emerging global standard is that a
whistleblower establishes a prima facie case of violation by establishing through a
preponderance of the evidence that protected conduct was a `contributing factor' in
challenged discrimination."114 It may be possible to go even further and craft legislation that
presumes that a detrimental act against a whistleblowing employee is, in and of itself,
sufficient to shift the burden of proof to the employer to show that the act was not
retaliatory.115 This approach is reflected in the EU Whistleblower Directive. Article 21(5)
states:

burdens of proof have been:

      unrelated to the fact or consequences of the disclosure.

          he or she reported or made a public disclosure and suffered a detriment, it
          shall be presumed that the detriment was made in retaliation for the report
          or the public disclosure. In such cases, it shall be for the person who has
          taken the detrimental measure to prove that that measure was based on
          duly justified grounds.116

Furthermore, it is important to consider how evidentiary rules may unduly burden
whistleblowers seeking remedies for reprisals.117 Finally, if mounting a claim of alleged
retaliation is expensive and requires the assistance of a lawyer or other institutional advocate
(such as an ombudsperson), then such assistance should be built into the scheme. TI suggests
that legal and financial assistance may be required, as "[w]histleblowers should not be at a
financial loss for having to bring a claim to enforce their rights or seek compensation for
breaches." 118

5. US: A PATCHWORK OF LEGISLATION

The US has a long history of whistleblower protection legislation. Section 5.1 gives an
overview of the federal protections available to whistleblowers in the public sector, focusing
on those working in the federal public sector, and the sections following after will briefly
outline some of the protections available to private sector whistleblowers.

5.1 Whistleblower Protection in the Public Sector

The first whistleblower law in the US arguably appeared as early as 1863, with the
introduction of false claims legislation.119 However, the modern approach to whistleblower
protection began in 1968 with the landmark case Pickering v Board of Education, which
recognized the application of the First Amendment to protection of disclosures made in the
public interest.120 This was followed by the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978,121 which "sought
to vindicate these constitutional rights, but it substituted statutory standards for the vague
balancing test under First Amendment law."122 Unfortunately, the Office of Special Counsel
and Merit Systems Protection Board, implemented by this legislation, did not prove to be
very successful.123 Today, the US has a plethora of laws on the local, state, and federal levels

that offer protection to whistleblowers. Although these laws purport to offer protection to
whistleblowers in both the public and the private sector, there are problems "due to
increased implementation difficulties, inefficiencies and regulatory burdens entailed in
having multiple laws that have evolved in ad hoc ways over time."124 A comprehensive,
dedicated piece of legislation, such as PIDA, that covers both the public and the private
sector at the federal level, with similar models at the state level, would be preferable in this
sense. It would make it easier for whistleblowers to learn and understand their rights under
the legislation, and it would likely decrease implementation and regulatory difficulties.

The legislation that is most relevant to disclosures in the federal public sector is the 1989
Whistleblower Protection Act (WPA)125 (amended in 2012 by the Whistleblower Protection
Enhancement Act (WPEA)).126 The Report of the Committee on Homeland Security and
Governmental Affairs United States Senate to Accompany s. 743 underscores the important role
of public sector whistleblowers, and explicitly recognizes the need for strong whistleblower
protection legislation:

          The Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2012 will strengthen the
          rights of and protections for federal whistleblowers so that they can more
          effectively help root out waste, fraud, and abuse in the federal government.
          Whistleblowers play a critical role in keeping our government honest and
          efficient. Moreover, in a post-9/11 world, we must do our utmost to ensure
          that those with knowledge of problems at our nation's airports, borders, law
          enforcement agencies, and nuclear facilities are able to reveal those
          problems without fear of retaliation or harassment.

          ...

          S. 743 would address ... problems by restoring the original congressional
          intent of the WPA to adequately protect whistleblowers, by strengthening
          the WPA, and by creating new whistleblower protections for intelligence
          employees and new protections for employees whose security clearance is
          withdrawn in retaliation for having made legitimate whistleblower
          disclosures.127

Under the WPA, the employer bears the burden of showing that the detriment faced by an
employee was not connected to their whistleblowing:

          The employee only has to establish that he - 1. disclosed conduct that meets
          a specific category of wrongdoing set forth in the law; 2. made the disclosure
          to the right type of party; 3. made a report that is either outside of the

          employee's course of duties or communicated outside the normal channels;
          4. made the report to someone other than the wrongdoer; 5. had a
          reasonable belief of wrongdoing; 6. suffered a personnel action. If the
          employee establishes these elements, the burden shifts to the employer to
          establish that it would have taken the same action in absence of the
          whistleblowing.128

In 2011, the Merit Systems Protection Board released a report that compared survey data of
federal employees from 1992 with data from 2010. In regard to the rate of disclosures, the
report stated:

          While observing wrongdoing is the first step in the whistleblowing process,
          not everyone who sees wrongdoing chooses to tell anyone else what they
          have observed. To blow the whistle, someone has to make some noise. In
          2010, respondents were slightly less likely to report that they did not tell
          anyone about the wrongdoing that they observed compared with survey
          data from 1992, but in both years, a strong majority of employees told
          someone ... [T]he percentage of respondents who told no one what they
          observed dropped from 40 percent in 1992 to 34 percent in 2010. In 2010,
          family, friends, and coworkers were less likely to be told about the
          wrongdoing than they were in 1992. However, this did not correspond to
          substantially more people reporting wrongdoing to management. Instead,
          it seems that venting to equally powerless people dropped, but the
          willingness of respondents to take action that could lead to change was not
          substantially changed.129

The report went on to conclude:

          We have seen some progress in the Federal Government with respect to
          effectively utilizing Federal employees to reduce or prevent fraud, waste,
          and abuse. Since 1992, the percentage of employees who perceive any
          wrongdoing has decreased, and for those who perceive wrongdoing, the
          frequency with which they observe the wrongdoing has also decreased.
          Additionally, in comparison to 1992, respondents in 2010 were slightly
          more likely to report the wrongdoing and less likely to think they have been
          identified as the source of the report.130

The WPEA reinforced the WPA by closing loopholes in the legislation, increasing the scope
of protected disclosures and shielding "whistleblower rights against contradictory agency
non-disclosure rules through an 'anti-gag` provision."131 The October 2015 G20 Report states

that in recent years there has been a positive increase in the favourable resolution of
whistleblower retaliation cases: "From 2007 to 2012, the number of new disclosures reported
by federal employees increased from 482 to 1,148, and the number of whistleblower
retaliation cases that were favorably resolved rose from 50 to 223."132 While these numbers
indicate positive movement in terms of increased disclosures, it is impossible to determine
whether the percentage of favourable resolutions of reprisal claims has increased as well
without knowing the total number of reprisal claims. A 2015 study concluded that the
WPEA, on paper, shows some potential, but that it is an open question whether it will
translate to more robust whistleblower protection in practice:

          It remains to be seen if the clarifications in the WPEA regarding disclosures
          will, in fact, clarify what is and is not a covered disclosure. It is also
          uncertain whether the courts will broaden their interpretation of the
          protections for whistleblowers under the WPEA. The expanded jurisdiction
          written into the Act is really a 2-year experiment to test that notion. The
          cancelling of the 1999 precedent that translates "reasonable belief" to
          require irrefutable proof is another issue that may be subject to narrowing
          by the courts.

          There seems to be inherent confusion in the WPEA regarding the dictate
          that whistleblowers cannot claim protections for disclosing valid policy
          decision, but can claim protections for disclosing the consequences of a
          policy decision. Furthermore, the Act creates specific legal protections for
          scientific freedom, providing WPA rights to employees who challenge
          censorship, and makes it an abuse of authority to punish disclosures about
          scientific censorship. This begs the question: when is it censorship and when
          is it a valid policy decision to maintain the need for information to be
          classified due to national security or some other compelling reason. The
          main point here is that the WPEA may not have actually enhanced any
          protections or clarified the various aspects of whistleblower protections--
          again, time will tell.133

In addition, in October 2017 Congress enacted the Dr. Chris Kirkpatrick Whistleblower
Protection Act of 2017,134 which, inter alia:

          (1) requires agency heads to propose disciplinary action against supervisors
          who have engaged in whistleblower retaliation, related to 5 U.S.C.
          2302(b)(8), (9), or (14); (2) provides certain whistleblower protections to
          probationary Federal employees; (3) provides guidelines to enhance Federal
          employee awareness of Federal whistleblower protections; (4) creates

          personnel action by the MSPB; and (5) enhances access to information by
          OSC.135

A February 2015 Report from the US Merit Systems Protection Board indicates that the
increased protections offered by WPEA have led to a strain on available resources. The report
states:

          The WPEA provided additional rights to whistleblowers and those who
          engage in other protected activity in the Federal Government. The law
          expanded the scope of protected disclosures, broadened MSPB's
          whistleblower jurisdiction, expanded options for granting corrective action,
          and permitted review of MSPB decisions by multiple Federal Courts of
          Appeals. These changes have increased the number of whistleblower cases
          filed with MSPB and increased the complexity of MSPB's processing of
          whistleblower cases. The changes also may lead to more and lengthier
          hearings in whistleblower cases and more addendum appeals (e.g., claims
          for compensatory and other damages or for attorney's fees) for
          whistleblower cases. The WPEA also requires MSPB to track and report
          more detailed information about whistleblower cases in its performance
          reports. MSPB needs additional permanent resources to enable it to meet
          the requirements of the WPEA.136

The February 2016 Annual Performance Results and Annual Performance Plan Report from the
US Merit Systems Protection Board provided an update on these concerns, stating:

          Many whistleblower cases are being resolved formally or informally at the
          Office of Special Counsel. The more complex and contentious cases that
          remain unresolved are often the cases filed with MSPB. Thus, based on what
          we have seen so far, we still anticipate that the WPEA may lead to more and
          lengthier hearings in these cases and more addendum appeals.137

Further, the February 2020 Annual Performance Report for FY 2019 and Annual Performance
Plan for FY 2020 (Final) and FY 2021 (Proposed) from the US Merit Systems Protection Board
indicates that there have been organizational issues within the Merit Systems Protection

cases, as well as preventing the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) from releasing
"reports of merit systems studies and promulgating substantive regulations."139 The backlog
of petitions for review totaled over 2,378 as of the end of September 2019, and was expected
to take three years or more to process once the Board achieved a quorum.140 "The lack of
quorum prevented MSPB from setting FY 2018 and FY 2019 performance targets and rating
results for several PGs and one strategic objective, including PFR processing timeliness,

potential to impact the functioning of the Board.142

5.2 Encouraging through Rewards: False Claims Act

The False Claims Act (FCA)143 offers a unique understanding of how to encourage
whistleblowing, as it allows private citizens to make claims on behalf of the government (qui
tam actions) in cases of contract fraud. The US Department of Justice reports that in the fiscal
year ending September 30, 2020, it obtained more than $2.2 billion in settlements and
judgments, and that recoveries since 1986 total more than $64 billion.144 The FCA represents
a prioritization of information rather than so-called ethical motives, and offers a different
kind of remedy to wronged whistleblowers:

          The FCA is much more effective than merely protecting the whistleblower
          from retaliation or even giving the whistleblower a private cause of action
          for retaliation.... It is arguably the most protective of whistleblowers
          because a successful whistleblower recovers enough to withstand losing a
          job or suffering a stalled career.... The law values information over motive,
          and blowing the whistle to gain a large recovery is fine as long as the
          information is novel and leads to successful prosecution.145

The ethical concern surrounding a whistleblower's motives has diminished in light of the
FCA's positive outcomes:

          The concern that whistleblowers might be motivated by gain rather than a
          desire to help is ... no longer a major ethical consideration. The desire by
          the government to recover money and correct wrongdoing now trumps
          concerns regarding whistleblower motive. A "pure" motive is seen as
          secondary to the public good created by whistleblowers, regardless of
          motive. 146

Some whistleblowers under the FCA have received large sums of money: "FCA settlements
and judgments have totaled over $17 billion and virtually all whistleblowers have recovered
$1 million or more--even though the majority of suits are settled."147 For example, in August
2015, a former sales representative for NuVasive, a medical device producer, was awarded
$2.2 million under the FCA in relation to kickbacks paid by the company to doctors. A
Wisconsin pharmacist was awarded $4.3 million in 2015 after they blew the whistle on
PharMerica. They were fired after reporting that their employer was dispensing dangerous
drugs without a prescription.148 In an even larger settlement, a former sales representative
for Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. received a $33.6 million award after blowing the whistle on
the company. They served as an undercover informant for the FBI for five years and waited
nine years between their first complaint and the 2014 settlement.149 In addition, it has been
argued that US legislation such as the FCA "leads the way" when it comes to the protection
of whistleblowers that are based in a different jurisdiction.150

Long time delays between blowing the whistle and receiving recovery amounts can put
whistleblowers in disadvantaged financial situations.151 For example, in the Endo
Pharmaceuticals case mentioned above, nine years passed between the whistleblower's first
complaint and the settlement.152 Despite this, many states have introduced similar legislation
with varying amounts of recovery awarded to the qui tam plaintiff.153 The state-level
legislation has seen similar levels of success as the federal legislation.154 The debate
surrounding the morality of offering rewards was discussed in Section 4.3.5. The US is

mostly alone among the three countries discussed in this chapter in offering rewards.
Generally speaking, the ethical or public service motive for whistleblowing in the UK is still
favoured over motives related to private gain. The same may be said for Canada, with one
exception: whistleblower rewards were created under the Ontario Securities Commission in
2016.

5.3 Federal Whistleblowing Protection in the Private Sector

In addition to the protections for public sector employees discussed above, the US is home
to legislation protecting workers in the private sector. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX)155
and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank Act)156
are examples that operate on the federal level. SOX was introduced in response to a number
of scandals:

      Beginning in 2001, companies such as Enron, WorldCom, Global Crossing
      and Tyco became familiar names as accounting fraud and other business
      abuses became public.... Publicized abuses extended beyond accounting
      fraud, as reflected by Enron's manipulation of the energy markets in
      California, manipulation that stole millions of dollars from ratepayers and
      precipitated a crisis in that state.... Employees of these companies were
      aware of fraud and other abuses, but failed to come forward from fear of
      retaliation or found their warnings ignored. Some who came forward faced
      harassment. In response to the public outcry and the disclosed weaknesses
      in laws regulating corporate conduct, Congress enacted and George W.
      Bush signed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.157

SOX applies to companies traded publicly, and it "calls for companies to establish a code of
ethics and whistleblowing procedures."158 This has international ramifications, as all
countries traded publicly in the US must comply with the requirements of SOX. One of these
requirements is that companies should have mechanisms allowing for anonymous
disclosures, which many companies have complied with through the use of independent
telephone hotlines.159 This method of reporting has proven problematic in respect to
difficulties maintaining anonymity and delays in following up on disclosures.160

In 2008, the global financial crisis prompted the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Act
created the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission whistleblower incentive programs. Both programs reward individuals who
provide information to the government relating to violations of federal securities or
commodities exchange laws by giving whistleblowers a share of the money the government

recovers. Under section 922 of the Act (which provides for amendments to the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934), whistleblowers are entitled to a reward if they provide information
for Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) enforcement actions that lead to sanctions
exceeding $1 million, including enforcement actions for Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA)
violations. The making of awards is mandatory, but the amount is discretionary, within
defined limits: "If one or more whistleblowers meet the eligibility criteria for an award and
follow the required procedures for making a claim, the SEC is statutorily required to award
them, in the aggregate, at least ten but not more than thirty percent of the monetary sanctions
collected in the covered action."161

Section 922 (section 21F of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) also protects those who provide
information to the SEC from retaliation from employers. Retaliation claims under the Dodd-
Frank Act can be brought within three years after the date when the facts material to the right
of action became known or reasonably should have been known to the whistleblower. The
Dodd-Frank Act allows the applicant to bring a lawsuit directly in the appropriate district
court. In 2018, the US Supreme Court concluded that the anti-retaliation provisions in the
Dodd-Frank Act do not extend to an individual who has not reported a violation of securities
laws to the SEC.162 This decision effectively curtails the protections for internal
whistleblowing, including disclosures made to a corporate ethics or compliance program,
unless the whistleblower also made the disclosure to the SEC. Disclosures "must rest upon
a reasonable belief that the information relates to the violation of any consumer financial
protection contained in the Dodd-Frank Act or any rule, order, standard, or prohibition
prescribed or enforced by the Bureau [of Consumer Financial Protection]."163

The SEC reported that fiscal year 2020 broke records with respect to (at that time) the awards
paid and claims processed, with over 6,900 whistleblower tips received, 197 final awards
issued, 315 preliminary determinations issued, and $175 million awarded to 39
individuals.164 Although the majority of awards have been for less than $2 million,165 some
very large awards have been issued; on October 22, 2020 (after the end of fiscal year 2020),
the SEC issued the largest award to date at $114 million.166 In 2020, the SEC voted to make
certain amendments to the rules governing its whistleblower program, which, among other
things, would create a presumption that potential awards of under $5 million (with certain
requirements) would qualify for a presumption of receiving the maximum amount under
the statute.167

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

Although some commentators, such as Tim Martin,168 predicted that the Dodd-Frank Act will
increase the number of FCPA investigations, Mike Koehler predicts that its impact on FCPA
enforcement will be negligible.169 According to the SEC's report for the fiscal year of 2020,
out of over 6,900 tips, only 208 related to the FCPA.170

In addition to these pieces of legislation, a number of other laws in the US protect
whistleblowers in the private sector.171 Robert Vaughn argues that private sector
whistleblower legislation in the US has both positive and negative aspects:

          Relief under recent whistleblower laws is extensive, including
          reinstatement, back pay, compensatory damages, attorney fees and
          litigation costs, and specifically includes expert witness fees. The similarity
          between recent laws illustrates the application of a common model for their
          content. This similarity offers some advantages by tying them together and
          creating a body of federal private-sector whistleblower laws. For example,
          this similarity could empower some future reform such as a uniform federal
          law applying blanket protection to all private-sector whistleblowers. The
          similarity, however, has some disadvantages. Because the pedigree of these
          common elements rests on aspects of the Whistleblower Protection Act of
          1989, applicable to federal employees, and of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, these
          laws may be limited by restrictive interpretations of relevant statutory
          terms by the Federal Circuit in relation to the Whistleblower Protection Act
          and by the Department of Labor in relation to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.172

6. UK: PUBLIC INTEREST DISCLOSURE ACT 1998

In the UK, whistleblowers are protected by PIDA. The passage of this legislation was
preceded by a number of serious disasters that may have been prevented if employees had
come forward with information; this "has been confirmed by the findings of the official
inquiries ... which found that staff had been aware of dangers but had not mentioned them
for fear of retaliation, or had raised concerns and then been dismissed or led to resign."173

governments on the local and state level (and, through them, to private contractors) for use on public
projects; under this legislation, "[e]mployees may disclose gross management, waste, fraud, and

For example, in 1987 a ship sank, killing 193 people, because its bow doors had been opened
while sailing. Employees had raised concerns on five occasions about the risk that this
caused, but the warnings were not heeded by management.174 Prior to such tragedies and
the subsequent introduction of PIDA, the cultural attitude in the UK strongly favoured
loyalty to an employer and contractual obligations over disclosure of employment-related
issues.175 The common law did not provide much in the way of whistleblower protection,
and what protection existed was superseded in many cases by the "implied duties of the
employment relationship, which explicitly barred British employees from publicly
discussing private employment matters."176 Now, many years since the introduction of
PIDA, whistleblowers in the UK are viewed more positively by individuals and by the
media.177

As already noted, PIDA has been lauded as one of the most comprehensive pieces of
whistleblower protection legislation in the world, and has often been cited as a "model" law
due to its comprehensive coverage and tiered disclosure system. However, as discussed
further below, there are now indications that PIDA has not been effective in realizing
whistleblower protection, and that it may have been overtaken by global developments in
whistleblower protection standards.

In Wim Vandekerckhove's 2010 examination of European whistleblower protection PIDA
was used as a model against which various European laws were measured.178 This is because
PIDA's "three-tiered model" of disclosure captures a preference for internal disclosure,
while still accounting for the necessity of external disclosure in some situations. In doing so,
it provides protection for both internal and external whistleblowing against a sliding scale
of requirements:

          This legislation offers protection for internally raising concerns within and
          outside of the hierarchical line. It also offers protection for blowing the
          whistle to a prescribed regulator if the internal route failed. Finally, if that
          too was unsuccessful, wider disclosures are protected as well.179

PIDA's three-tiered model thus offers a balance between the interests of the employer in
maintaining confidentiality, and the interests of the public in having employees disclose
information related to workplace malpractice or corruption.180 When a worker makes an
internal disclosure, there is a presumption of legislative protection against reprisal as long
as the worker has acted in good faith.181 However, there are more requirements in order to
receive protection under PIDA when disclosure is made to an external regulator or to the
media. In order to make a disclosure to an external source, it must be the case that the

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

whistleblower "reasonably believes that the information disclosed, and any allegation
contained in it, are substantially true."182 The whistleblower must not have acted for the
purposes of personal gain, and it must have been reasonable to make the disclosure.183 PIDA
thus imposes increasingly onerous requirements (especially in terms of level of knowledge
and reasonableness of belief) the further that the whistleblower gets from internal
disclosure. The Canadian Public Servants Disclosure Protection Act (PSDPA), discussed in
Section 7.2, also has differing requirements depending on the recipient of the disclosure,
but they are not as onerous. For example, disclosure to the public under the PSDPA is
governed by section 16:

          16. (1) A disclosure that a public servant may make under sections 12 to 14
          may be made to the public if there is not sufficient time to make the
          disclosure under those sections and the public servant believes on
          reasonable grounds that the subject-matter of the disclosure is an act or
          omission that

                (a) constitutes a serious offence under an Act of Parliament or of the
                legislature of a province; or

                (b) constitutes an imminent risk of a substantial and specific danger to
                the life, health and safety of persons, or to the environment.184

The requirements for similar disclosure under PIDA are lengthier, to say the least:

          43G. (1) A qualifying disclosure is made in accordance with this section
          if--

                (a) the worker makes the disclosure in good faith,

                (b) he reasonably believes that the information disclosed, and any
                     allegation contained in it, are substantially true,

                (c) he does not make the disclosure for purposes of personal gain,

                (d) any of the conditions in subsection (2) is met, and

                (e) in all the circumstances of the case, it is reasonable for him to
                     make the disclosure.

          (2) The conditions referred to in subsection (1)(d) are--

                (a) that, at the time he makes the disclosure, the worker reasonably
                     believes that he will be subjected to a detriment by his employer if
                     he makes a disclosure to his employer or in accordance with

                     relevant failure will be concealed or destroyed if he makes a
                     disclosure to his employer, or

                (c) that the worker has previously made a disclosure of substantially
                     the same information--

                           (i) to his employer, or

                           (ii) in accordance with section 43F.

          (3) In determining for the purposes of subsection (1)(e) whether it is
          reasonable for the worker to make the disclosure, regard shall be had, in
          particular, to--

                (a) the identity of the person to whom the disclosure is made,

                (b) the seriousness of the relevant failure,

                (c) whether the relevant failure is continuing or is likely to occur in
                     the future,

                (d) whether the disclosure is made in breach of a duty of
                     confidentiality owed by the employer to any other person,

                (e) in a case falling within subsection (2)(c)(i) or (ii), any action which
                     the employer or the person to whom the previous disclosure in
                     accordance with section 43F was made has taken or might
                     reasonably be expected to have taken as a result of the previous
                     disclosure, and

                (f) in a case falling within subsection (2)(c)(i), whether in making the
                     disclosure to the employer the worker complied with any
                     procedure whose use by him was authorised by the employer.

          (4) For the purposes of this section a subsequent disclosure may be
          regarded as a disclosure of substantially the same information as that
          disclosed by a previous disclosure as mentioned in subsection (2)(c) even
          though the subsequent disclosure extends to information about action
          taken or not taken by any person as a result of the previous disclosure.185

Thus, while PIDA may benefit from greater clarity in its requirements (as compared to
PSDPA), it imposes a very heavy burden on a whistleblower who makes a disclosure to a
source beyond an employer, legal advisor, Minister of the Crown, or other prescribed
person.

PIDA's coverage is expansive: it protects employees in both the public and private sectors,
and it is broad enough to capture private contractors.186 In addition, the legislation covers a
wide range of wrongdoing under the purview of a protected disclosure: a disclosure
qualifies as protected where the person who makes the disclosure reasonably believes that
a criminal offence has been or is likely to be committed, there has been a failure to comply
with legal obligations, there has been or is likely to be a miscarriage of justice, there is a risk

to health, safety or the environment, or information relevant to one of these areas faces
deliberate concealment.187 Whether the wrongdoing occurred within or outside the UK or
whether non-UK law applies to the wrongdoing, is irrelevant. However, critics have
suggested that there are downsides to having an exhaustive list of wrongdoing. Instead,
PIDA's reach could be broadened by conferring some discretion on the courts: "PIDA might
have provided better protection if it had included a list of matters automatically covered
together with a final catch-all provision covering matters that, in the opinion of the court,
are in the public interest."188 The types of reprisals that whistleblowers are protected against
are similarly broad, with the legislation stating that "[a] worker has the right not to be
subjected to any detriment by any act, or any deliberate failure to act, by this employer done
on the ground that the worker has made a protected disclosure."189 If a worker experiences
reprisal, claims are made directly to the UK Employment Tribunal, rather than to a
specialized body. Remedies for reprisal include reinstatement, unlimited compensation, or
reengagement.190 PIDA's track record in its first ten years can be summarized as follows:

          In the first ten years of PIDA's operation, the number of claims made under
          it annually increased from 157 in 1999 to 1761 in 2009. This is still a small
          proportion (under 1%) of all claims made to Employment Tribunals. Over
          70% of these claims were settled or withdrawn without any public hearing.
          Of the remaining 30%, less than a quarter (22%) won. There is only partial
          information on awards: in the known cases, the average compensation was
          £113,000 (the largest single award was over £3.8m) and the total known
          compensation was £9.5m.191

Despite the broad scope of PIDA, a review of the legislation by the non-profit Protect
identified a number of opportunities for improvement.192 Among these recommendations
were the implementation of a code of practice, and the simplification of the legislative
language. A code of practice would help to clarify the rights of whistleblowers and the
appropriate procedural steps that whistleblowers should take when disclosing information
internally:

          Such a code of practice must clearly set out principles enabling workers to
          raise concerns about a danger, risk, malpractice or wrongdoing that affects
          others without fear of adverse consequences. Any such arrangements must
          be proportionate to the size of the organisation and the nature of the risks
          faced. A code of practice should set out the requirements for arrangements

and serious misuse or abuse of authority."

          covering the raising and handling of whistleblowing concerns and should
          include a written procedure for the raising of concerns. This procedure
          should include: clear assurances about protection from reprisal; that
          confidentiality will be maintained where requested; and should identify
          appropriate mechanisms for the raising of concerns, as well as, identifying
          specific individuals with the responsibility for the arrangements.193

Protect (formerly Public Concern at Work) called for more research to be done by the
government regarding the possibility of creating an ombudsman or similar independent
agency. Such an agency may be able to raise public awareness, conduct investigations into
alleged reprisals and conduct strategic litigation, among other things.194

More recently, in July 2018, the All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) for Whistleblowing
was launched. The APPG's objective was to "provide much stronger and more
comprehensive protection for whistleblowers ... to work to identify where the law fails to
protect whistleblowers and, work with industry experts, whistleblowers, regulators and
businesses, to recommend positive, effective and practical proposals for change."195
Research was conducted into whistleblowing cases between 2015 and 2018 in England and
Wales, and in 2020 the APPG concluded that significant reform was required:

          The APPG has concluded, using the evidence available that it is time for a
          root and branch reform of the legislation setting out a 10 point plan
          including the introduction of a body capable of tackling and challenging
          wrong-doing. This office will be tasked with the review of PIDA and the
          development of legislation that addresses the substantive issues to ensure
          that protecting those who speak up and wrong-doing is addressed at the
          earliest opportunity. This body will also need to review international best
          practice and look to make best practice our practice. The APPG calls for new
          whistleblowing legislation with an Office of the Whistleblower as the bearer
          of its implementation.196

Moreover, key findings of the research included that whistleblowing cases had a low success
rate, whistleblowers suffered more and longer than before, fewer whistleblowers have legal
representation than in the past, whistleblowing has a gender component, and
whistleblowing cases often include a discrimination claim but these are the least successful
cases. 197

In addition, recent commentators have indicated that PIDA may have been overtaken as a
"model" law. For example, Richard Hyde and Ashley Savage indicate that "PIDA, which
was once considered an exemplar, has now arguably been overtaken by more

7.1 Development of the Common Law Defence

Prior to the introduction of dedicated whistleblower legislation, whistleblowers had to rely
on protection provided by common law; in the employer-employee context, it was necessary
to balance the duty an employee owed to their employer and an employee's right to freedom
of expression. Slowly the balance began to shift, at least in theory, from prioritizing the duty
of loyalty to one's employer, to protecting reasonable, good faith disclosures of alleged
wrongdoing in the employer's organization. In British Columbia v BCGEU, arbitrator J.M.
Weiler considered a matter wherein employees, who had taken an oath of office, publicly
disclosed information that was critical of their public sector employer.199 The arbitrator
considered past decisions in the public sector context, and determined:

          These awards do not go so far as to prevent an employee, at the risk of losing
          his job, from making any public statements that are critical of his employer.
          An absolute "gag rule" would seem to be counter productive to the
          employer for it would inhibit any dissent within the organization.
          Employee dissidents can be a valuable resource for the decision-makers in
          the enterprise.200

However, Weiler went on to note that public criticism of this sort (that is, "going public")
should be something of a last resort after internal processes have been exhausted.201 This
decision recognized that the disclosure of information may, in fact, benefit the public sector
employer: "Neither the public nor the employer's long-term best interests are served if these
employees, from fear of losing their jobs, are so intimidated that they do not bring
information about wrongdoing at their place of employment to the attention of those who
can correct such wrongdoing."202

A few years later, in Fraser v Public Service Staff Relations Board, the Supreme Court of Canada
considered a case wherein the appellant faced disciplinary measures and eventually lost his
position at the Department of Revenue Canada after criticizing governmental policy
(specifically, metric conversion) in a letter to the editor published in a newspaper. The Court

outlined three contexts in which it would be possible for a public servant to act against their
duty of loyalty:

          As the Adjudicator indicated, a further characteristic is loyalty. As a general
          rule, federal public servants should be loyal to their employer, the
          Government of Canada. The loyalty owed is to the Government of Canada,
          not the political party in power at any one time. A public servant need not
          vote for the governing party. Nor need he or she publicly espouse its
          policies. And indeed, in some circumstances, a public servant may actively
          and publicly express opposition to the policies of a government. This would
          be appropriate if, for example, the Government were engaged in illegal
          acts, or if its policies jeopardized the life, health or safety of the public
          servant or others, or if the public servant's criticism had no impact on his
          or her ability to perform effectively the duties of a public servant or on
          the public perception of that ability. But, having stated these qualifications
          (and there may be others), it is my view that a public servant must not
          engage, as the appellant did in the present case, in sustained and highly
          visible attacks on major Government policies. In conducting himself in this
          way the appellant, in my view, displayed a lack of loyalty to the
          Government that was inconsistent with his duties as an employee of the
          Government. [emphasis added]203

Following this decision, different factors were identified within the jurisprudence as
relevant considerations when determining if a public servant's conduct fit within one of the
categories enumerated by the Supreme Court.

After the introduction of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and the enshrinement
of freedom of expression therein, the Federal Court stated that "[t]he common law duty of
loyalty as articulated in Fraser sufficiently accommodates the freedom of expression as
guaranteed by the Charter, and therefore constitutes a reasonable limit within the meaning
of section 1 of the Charter."204

7.2 Federal Legislation: Public Servants Disclosure Protection Act

      7.2.1 Legislation

This section focuses on federal whistleblower legislation. A description of provincial
whistleblower laws is beyond the scope of this chapter. It should be noted, however, that a
number of provinces have developed legislation to protect provincial public sector
employees. In Quebec, for example, in its Rapport de la Commission d'enquete sur l'octroi et la
gestion des contrats publics dans l'industrie de la construction, the Charbonneau Commission
recommended improving the support and protection of whistleblowers by protecting
confidentiality regardless of the method of reporting, providing support to whistleblowers,

and offering financial support if necessary.205 The Commission recognized that wrongdoing
can be difficult to detect without the assistance of lanceurs d'alerte, and that people may not
report wrongdoing due to a fear of reprisals.206 The Commission noted the limitations of
current whistleblower protections, which are limited in scope and may be difficult to
understand, and advocated for a more general system of whistleblower protection.207
Several of these concerns were addressed in An Act to Facilitate the Disclosure of Wrongdoings
related to Public Bodies, which came into force on May 1, 2017.

Federal public sector employees have been governed by the Public Servants Disclosure
Protection Act (PSDPA) since it came into force on April 15, 2007.208 The PSDPA reflects the
principles that have developed through the case law, but offers a more structured and robust
approach to the protection of reporting persons; in other words, the legislation "maintains
the integrity of the `whistleblower' defence from the jurisprudence and builds upon it."209
The Preamble sets out the guiding values underlying the legislation:

          Recognizing that

          the federal public administration is an important national institution and is
          part of the essential framework of Canadian parliamentary democracy;

          it is in the public interest to maintain and enhance public confidence in the
          integrity of public servants;

          confidence in public institutions can be enhanced by establishing effective
          procedures for the disclose of wrongdoings, and by establishing a code of
          conduct for the public sector;

          public servants owe a duty of loyalty to their employer and enjoy the right
          to freedom of expression as guaranteed by the Canadian Charter of Rights and
          Freedoms and that this Act strives to achieve an appropriate balance between
          those two important principles;

          the Government of Canada commits to establishing a Charter of Values of
          Public Service setting out the values that should guide public servants in
          their work and professional conduct[.]210

The PSDPA dictates the parameters of what qualifies as a protected disclosure.211 This means
that if a public sector worker "blows the whistle" on issues that are outside of the purview
of a protected disclosure, they will not have recourse to the legislation. Section 8 of the
legislation enumerates the "wrongdoings" for which disclosure is protected, including
contravention of legislation, misuse of public funds, gross mismanagement, acts or
omissions creating "substantial and specific" danger to health and safety of people or the
environment, breach of codes of conduct established under the PSDPA and counseling a
person to commit one of these wrongdoings.212 This definition signifies a legislative attempt
to itemize the kinds of conduct that would be considered corrupt or undesirable within a
public sector institution, and the provision makes it clear that not just any disclosure will
trigger legislative protection. This is problematic, as whistleblowers must: (1) have enough
knowledge of the legislative protection to know whether the wrongdoing of which they have
knowledge falls within the purview of the legislation and (2) have enough knowledge of the
wrongdoing itself to know if it falls within one of these categories. Thus, this approach is
overly restrictive, and the legislation would be improved by a broader or open-ended
understanding of wrongdoing.

The PSDPA covers those working in the federal public sector, but it does not extend to
protect disclosures by those working in the Canadian Forces, the Communications Security
Establishment, or the Canadian Security Intelligence Service.213 However, these excluded
groups are required to create internal disclosure mechanisms under section 52 of the PSDPA,
which states:

          As soon as possible after the coming into force of this section, the person
          responsible for each organization that is excluded from the definition of
          "public sector" in section 2 must establish procedures, applicable to that
          organization, for the disclosure of wrongdoings, including the protection of
          persons who disclose the wrongdoings. Those procedures must, in the
          opinion of the Treasury Board, be similar to those set out in this Act.214

Again, only those disclosures that qualify will warrant the protection of the legislation.

The PSDPA also outlines the appropriate methods of disclosure. Section 12 provides for
internal disclosure, section 13 allows for external disclosure to the Public Sector Integrity
Commissioner (Commissioner or PSIC), and section 16(1) provides for limited
circumstances under which the disclosure may be made to the public. This system was

211 Legislation often uses terms such as "protected disclosure" rather than the colloquial
"whistleblowing." One reason for this may be, as suggested in David Lewis, AJ Brown & Richard
Moberly, "Whistleblowing, Its Importance and the State of the Research" in Brown et al, supra note 8,
11 at 3, that the term whistleblower has "negative historical connotations, in many settings, alongside
or overwhelming any positive ones, particularly in countries where oppressive governments have
encouraged citizens to denounce the activities of political opponents."

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

summarized by the Public Servants Disclosure Protection Tribunal in their first interlocutory
decision, El-Helou v Courts Administration Service (El-Helou No. 1), as follows:

          The Act creates a much broader system for disclosure protection within the
          public service at several junctures and at different levels: internally to a
          supervisor or the departmental Senior Officer (section 12) of a department
          or agency; externally to the Commissioner (section 13); or where there is not
          sufficient time to disclosure a serious offence under Canadian legislation or
          an imminent risk of a substantial and specific danger, the disclosure may be
          made to the public (subsection 16(1)).215

This tiered system of disclosure attempts to operationalize the best practices principles
discussed in Section 4.3.2. Internal disclosure is prioritized, but procedures and
requirements are in place for disclosures externally and to the media.

Section 19 prohibits reprisals against public servants, and section 19.1 lays out the process
through which a public service employee can complain about an alleged reprisal. "Reprisal"
is a defined term within section 2 of the PSDPA to include actions such as disciplinary
measures, demotion, employment termination, or "any measure that adversely affects the
employment or working conditions of the public servant."216 The PSDPA relies on a central
agency, the Office of the Public Sector Integrity Commissioner appointed under section 39,
to "receive reports from public servants of wrongdoing, to investigate them and to make
recommendations to correct them."217 The PSDPA also mandated the creation of the Public
Servants Disclosure Protection Tribunal to adjudicate claims of reprisals that the
Commissioner deems appropriate; arguably, "[t]he existence of an independent tribunal
with quasi-judicial powers to adjudicate reprisals is reflective of Parliament's intention of
emphasizing and addressing the gravity of retaliation against individuals who come
forward to report suspected wrongdoing."218 Broadly speaking, the complaint procedure is
as follows. If a public servant or former public servant who made a protected disclosure has
reasonable grounds for believing that a reprisal (as defined in section 2(1)) has been taken
against them, they may file a complaint with the Commissioner (section 19.1(1)). The
complaint must be filed within 60 days of when the complainant knew or ought to have
known that the reprisal was taken (section 19.1(2)). The Commissioner may refuse to deal
with a complaint (s. 19.3(1)) or designate a person as an investigator to investigate a
complaint (section 19.7(1)); in any event, the Commissioner must decide whether or not to
deal with a complaint within 15 days after it is filed and must provide written notice or
reasons of that decision (section 19.4). If an investigation is initiated, the Commissioner
might appoint a conciliator to try to settle the case (section 20(2)), and/or make an application
to the Tribunal (section 20.4(1)). The Tribunal, consisting of judges of the Federal Court or a
superior court of a province (section 20.7(1)), can grant remedies in favour of complainants
(section 21.7(1)) and order disciplinary action against persons who take reprisals (section
21.8(1)).

Section 21.7 lays out the potential remedies that the Tribunal is able to order. Remedies
include reinstating the whistleblower's employment, rescinding measures taken by the
employer, and paying compensation to the complainant.219 However, it is problematic that
these remedies represent a closed list; in other words, the Tribunal has limited power to
respond to the specific circumstances of the case, and must find an appropriate remedy from
within the list. Furthermore, the remedies listed focus on rescinding detrimental actions,
reinstating an employee, or paying compensation. If the reprisal faced by the complainant
cannot be easily reduced to a dollar value (if, for example, the employee has been harassed
or has missed opportunities for promotion), then it is unclear how the Tribunal could fashion
an appropriate remedy.

      7.2.2 Decisions of the Tribunal and the Federal Courts

As of February 2021, the Tribunal website lists eight cases.220 Of these, five were settled
between the parties in some manner. The other three files have seen a multitude of
interlocutory decisions, judicial reviews to the Federal Court, appeals to the Federal Court
of Appeal, and, finally, decisions on the merits. In no case has the Tribunal found that the
complainant has made out their claim.

Early decisions by the Tribunal were all interlocutory in nature--indeed, the Tribunal did
not render a final decision on the merits in any case until 2017. In El-Helou No. 1, the Tribunal
affirmed the potential strength of this legislation: "The Tribunal recognizes that it must play
its role to ensure that this new legislative scheme not be `enfeebled'."221 This approach was
developed in El-Helou v Courts Administration Service (El-Helou No. 3), where the Tribunal
noted that the goal of the legislation and of the adjudicative function of the Tribunal ought
to be on the substantive content of the disclosure and the alleged reprisal, and not on the
possible procedural defects of an Application. The Tribunal highlighted the principles of
natural justice:

          It is in this context that an examination of the Act must be conducted. In
          considering the Act as a whole and the part of the Act pertaining to
          complaints of reprisal, it becomes clear that Parliament focussed on the
          substance of the complaint, and not on who may or may not have been
          identified as potential respondents in the original complaint. In addition, as
          discussed below, the processes for reprisal complaints demonstrate
          Parliament's intention to ensure that notice be provided to potential
          respondents, whether or not they were named in a complaint. This
          requirement of notice ought not to be considered as merely a procedural
          formality, but rather, as an important step in ensuring fairness to all of those
          affected by an investigation and, possibly, an Application before the
          Tribunal. In the course of an investigation, other parties might be identified

          and Parliament wanted to ensure that the principles of natural justice could
          be addressed as a complaint progressed. [emphasis added]222

In line with this approach, the Tribunal in El-Helou v Courts Administration Service (El-Helou
No. 4) recognized that it may be appropriate to adopt more relaxed standards regarding the
admission of evidence. This represents the Tribunal's desire to deal with the substance of
the reprisal, rather than evidentiary or procedural issues that may prevent a complainant
from accessing justice. The Tribunal stated:

          In addition, there is flexibility in the Act as to how the Tribunal admits
          evidence, which strongly suggests that opinion evidence and hearsay could
          be subject to more relaxed standards. Nonetheless, the Tribunal would
          need to ensure fairness in its proceedings for all the parties, and adopt a
          focused approach to its proceedings and the tendering of evidence. In this
          manner, it can assure that its time and resources are utilized judiciously.

          The Tribunal recognizes that it must weigh evidence carefully, given the
          serious consequences of the proceedings. Nevertheless, the provisions of
          the Act pertaining to a more flexible approach to the admissibility of
          evidence guide the Tribunal, and suggest that a formalistic approach ought
          not to be adopted. This general stance is also supported by Supreme Court
          of Canada jurisprudence. Given the requirements of a hearing and the
          mandate of the Tribunal, it must be cautious in any request that asks that it
          rule in an anticipatory fashion on the admissibility of evidence. [emphasis
          added]223

In this decision, the Tribunal also commented on the differing burden as between the
Commissioner's threshold for referring an application to the Tribunal, and the Tribunal's
determination of whether a reprisal has been made out:

          The "balance of probabilities" is generally the standard of proof used in civil
          proceedings and before administrative tribunals, unless otherwise
          expressed in the statute. This is the burden of proof upon which the
          Tribunal decides whether or not reprisal has been taken against the
          complainant, in relation to the disclosure of wrongdoing within the
          meaning of the Act. If Parliament had intended that the burden of proof not
          be the civil standard of proof, this would have been clearly articulated in
          the legislation. To meet the standard of proof of the balance of probabilities,
          the evidence presented will outweigh the evidence that disputes the
          allegations. It is sometimes stated that for the "balance of probabilities" to
          be satisfied, the evidence presented must show that the facts as alleged are
          more probable than they are not.

          The Commissioner's threshold for the referral of an Application and the
          Tribunal's burden of proof is different. This can be understood by
          examining the wording as well as the structure of the Act.224

The Federal Court and the Federal Court of Appeal have grappled with certain sections of
the PSDPA through judicial reviews of decisions made pursuant to the legislation. For
example, judicial reviews have been conducted of decisions by the Commissioner, such as
decisions that were not in the public interest to commence investigations into alleged
wrongdoings,225 or to dismiss complaints of reprisals and therefore not make applications to
the Tribunal in respect of those complaints;226 what follows is not an exhaustive review of
the jurisprudence.

In El-Helou v Canada (Courts Administration Service),227 the Federal Court of Appeal
considered an appeal and a cross-appeal of a Federal Court decision which allowed in part
the application for judicial review against a decision of the Commissioner dismissing the
appellant's reprisal complaints under the PSDPA. The facts of this case are unusual (and the
path rather circuitous): the Commissioner, after an investigation, referred a complaint of
reprisal to the Tribunal. Mr. El-Helou sought judicial review of the decision not to refer the
other complaints to the Tribunal; this was allowed, and a second investigation was
conducted into all of the complaints. Following that investigation, the Commissioner did not
refer any other complaints to the Tribunal, and also concluded that the complaint that had
previously been referred to the Tribunal was not founded. Mr. El-Helou sought judicial
review of the decisions made following the second investigation; the Federal Court allowed
the application in part, and this was then both appealed and cross-appealed to the Federal
Court of Appeal.

The Court of Appeal found that the disclosure of the investigator's preliminary report into
the reprisal complaints adequately informed the appellant of the case to be met in order to
allow him to provide a full response.228 Further, the Court of Appeal considered whether, as
a result of the previous decision made by the Federal Court and the subsequent
investigation, the Commissioner was functus officio with respect to a complaint that had
already been referred to the Tribunal. The Court determined that he was, but also that the
Commissioner could now adopt a position adverse to the application, stating:

          [E]ven though the Commissioner no longer believes that the appellant is
          entitled to the remedy claimed, he does not have the power to dismiss the
          complaint. Only the Tribunal retains the authority to deal with it, after
          hearing all the parties concerned. In this respect, the Commissioner's
          revised position is no more determinative of the outcome before the

                                                                                                         1045

          Tribunal than was his support for the application at the time he filed it
          before the Tribunal.

          Turning to section 21.6, the Commissioner proceeded on proper principle
          when he asked whether this provision authorized him to change his stance
          and adopt a position against the application that he filed. In holding that it
          did, the Commissioner was construing his home statute. In my view,
          reasonableness is the standard against which this aspect of the
          Commissioner's decision is to be reviewed (Dunsmuir, para. 54; A.T.A. v.
          Alberta (Information & Privacy Commissioner), 2011 SCC 61, [2011] 3 S.C.R.
          654 (S.C.C.), para. 34).

          Subsection 21.6(2) requires the Commissioner to "adopt the position that, in
          his or her opinion, is in the public interest". In my view, it was reasonable
          for the Commissioner to hold that he could adopt a position adverse to
          the application that he had filed if, in his opinion, the circumstances no
          longer supported the granting of a remedy in the public interest. Looking
          at the matter the other way, the Commissioner would be acting against the
          public interest if he were to support a complaint of reprisal even though he
          was of the view that no reprisal had taken place. It was therefore open to
          the Commissioner to reconsider his initial position and to adopt one before
          the Tribunal that is consistent with the facts revealed by the second
          investigation.

          ...

          I accept that, as a general rule, the Commissioner should not allow a
          complaint that has been referred to the Tribunal to be investigated further.
          However, I do not believe that this renders the Commissioner's decision
          unreasonable on the facts of this case.

          While as noted earlier, the appellant did object to complaint #3 being further
          investigated, he could not object to the investigation of the other complaints
          as they emanated from him. Given the extent to which they are intertwined,
          I do not see how these complaints could be investigated without eliciting
          information relevant to complaint #3. This is what Mactavish J. had in mind
          in El-Helou #1 when she suggested that the further investigation that she
          ordered -- specifically the interview of the former Chief Administrator of
          CAS -- could impact the outcome of complaint #3 even if it was no longer
          in the hands of the Commissioner (El-Helou #1, para. 90).

          Given the ongoing investigation into the other complaints, there is no
          principled reason by which the Commissioner should have turned a blind
          eye to the new information gathered in the course of the second
          investigation.

          It was therefore reasonable for the Commissioner to rely on this new
          information when deciding under section 21.6 to adopt a position before the
          Tribunal that is adverse to the application that he had filed and to amend

          the statement of particulars to reflect his current position. [emphasis
          added]229

Leave to appeal this decision to the Supreme Court of Canada was refused.

In Therrien v Canada, the Federal Court dismissed an application for judicial review of the
Commissioner's decision not to investigate allegations of wrongdoing.230 In this case, the
whistleblower made disclosures both internally and publically regarding alleged pressures
by Service Canada to deny or limit claims for Employment Insurance; their employment was
ultimately terminated, and their reliability status was revoked.231 The Court upheld the
Commissioner's decision not to investigate the complaints because they were already the
subject of a grievance process, and under section 19.3(2) the Commissioner was directed not
to deal with such complaints.232 This decision was subsequently reversed on appeal,233 with
Gleason J.A. concluding that the Commissioner violated the appellant's procedural fairness
rights, as the appellant's counsel was told that the Commissioner would be assessing
whether he would inquire into the reprisal complaint according to the factors enumerated
in section 19.3(1)(a), but the Commissioner instead dismissed the complaint under section
19.3(2). The Court considered the difference between these as follows:

          There is a meaningful difference between the two statutory provisions.
          Paragraph 19.3(1)(a) of the PSDPA affords the Commissioner discretion to
          decline to deal with a complaint where the Commissioner is of the opinion
          that the subject matter of the complaint either has been or ought more
          appropriately be dealt with under a procedure provided under another Act
          of Parliament or a collective agreement. Subsection 19.3(2), on the other
          hand, is cast in mandatory terms and requires the Commissioner to dismiss
          a complaint where its subject matter is being dealt with by a body (other
          than a law enforcement agency) acting under another Act of Parliament or
          a collective agreement. Given these differences, a complainant may well
          make different submissions under the two provisions.234

The Court went on to examine the Commissioner's interpretation of section 19.3(2), finding
the decision to be unreasonable: "in the context of a grievance, it is only where the
Commissioner is satisfied that the substance of a reprisal complaint is being dealt with on
its merits by the PSLREB that subsection 19.3(2) of the PSDPA might reasonably be found to
apply. To ascertain whether this is so, it may often be necessary for the Commissioner to
await the outcome of proceedings before the PSLREB prior to determining whether
subsection 19.3(2) of the PSDPA is applicable."235

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

In Canada (Attorney General) v Canada (Public Sector Integrity Commissioner), the Federal Court
considered section 23(1) for the first time.236 This section indicates that the Commissioner
cannot deal with a disclosure if the subject-matter of that disclosure is already being dealt
with by "a person or body acting under another Act of Parliament."237 In reaching its
conclusion, the Court emphasized the need to consider the entirety of the Act and the context
of the legislation, stating:

          The parties have focused on the phrases in subsection 23(1) but not
          necessarily in the context of the PSDPA. Given the importance of
          whistleblower legislation to "denounce and punish wrongdoings in the
          public sector" the phrase "dealing with" must take its meaning from this
          context. The phrase cannot be interpreted so broadly as to frustrate the
          scheme and purpose of the legislation. Simply bringing the wrongdoing to
          the attention of the CEO is but one aspect of the purpose of an investigation.
          Public exposure is mandatory whenever an investigation leads to a finding
          of wrongdoing.

          The legislation addresses wrongdoings of an order of magnitude that could
          shake public confidence if not reported and corrected. When the
          Commissioner is "dealing with" an allegation of wrongdoing, it is
          something that, if proven, involves a serious threat to the integrity of the
          public service. That is why, before an investigation is commenced, there is
          a period of analysis to determine there is some merit to the disclosure. That
          is also why the investigators are separate from the analysts.

          The focus of the disclosure provision of the PSDPA is to uncover past
          wrongs, bring them to light in public and put in place corrections to prevent
          recurrence.

          ...

          The PSDPA is remedial legislation. As such, section 12 of the Interpretation
          Act, RSC 1985, c.I-21 requires it to be given "such fair, large and liberal
          construction and interpretation as best ensures the attainment of its
          objects". Parliament cannot have intended that subsection 23(1) be read so
          broadly that a procedure undertaken months after the Commissioner
          begins to deal with a disclosure, led by another body for a different purpose,
          headed toward the qualitatively different outcome of a private report,
          regardless of the finding, and examining only recent, very different,
          evidence should be sufficient to prevent the Commissioner from
          determining whether a serious past allegation of wrongdoing occurred and,
          if so, exposing it.238

The Court ultimately found that the Commissioner made a reasonable decision in not ending
the investigation into the alleged wrongdoing when informed that Transport Canada was

dealing with the same incidents (that is, the actions of the Ottawa Air Section of the RCMP
Air Services Branch in making false log entries).

In Gupta v Canada, the Federal Court of Appeal considered a judicial review of the
Commissioner's decision not to investigate a whistleblower's allegations that he faced
reprisals and the threat of reprisals following a disclosure of wrongdoing.239 The Court
dismissed the whistleblower's appeal, finding that the Commissioner was reasonable in
deciding that some of the appellant's allegations of reprisals were out of time according to
section 19.1(2) of the PSDPA and in deciding not to grant an extension of time; in addition,
the Court found it was reasonable to conclude that some of the allegations did not meet the
definition of reprisals under the legislation.240 When considering the limitation period in the
PSDPA, the Court stated:

          The language of this subsection is clear - the sole criterion to determine
          whether a complaint is filed on time is one of knowledge or imputed
          knowledge of specific incidents of reprisal. The allegation that the most
          recent act of reprisal is part of an ongoing chain of reprisals does not bring
          the earlier events into the 60-day time limit.241

However, the Court did acknowledge that a victim of reprisal who is "reasonably confused
or unaware of the nature of the conduct against her or him"242 would not be captured by the
limitations period, as the 60-day period begins when the victim "ought to have known"
about a reprisal. In addition, a victim may be able to make a compelling case for the
extension of time to file a complaint if the reprisals were a sequence of connected events; in
this case, those were not the facts.243

Subsequently, in Gupta v Canada, the Federal Court of Appeal considered an appeal from the
decision of the Federal Court dismissing the application for judicial review of the
Commissioner's decision not to conduct an investigation into a disclosure by the appellant
under the PSDPA, in which the appellant alleged that he had been harassed by senior
managers and other employees.244 The Commissioner had relied on section 24(1)(f) in
declining to commence an investigation "if the Commissioner is of the opinion that there is
a valid reason for not dealing with the subject-matter of the disclosure."245 The Court found
that there was no denial of procedural fairness in the circumstances, as

          [e]ven assuming that, as Dr. Gupta submits, persons making disclosures are
          entitled to notice of the grounds on which the Commissioner may rely in
          deciding not to investigate, the information made available to Dr. Gupta
          and his counsel provided adequate notice that the Commissioner might rely

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

          on the availability of another recourse as a reason for deciding not to
          investigate the alleged harassment.246

The Court of Appeal stated:

          The Act does not prescribe the process for the Commissioner to follow
          before deciding whether to exercise what has been described as the "wide"
          discretion not to commence an investigation (Detorakis v. Canada (Attorney
          General), 2010 FC 39, 358 F.T.R. 266 (Eng.) (F.C.) at para. 43). In particular,
          the Act does not specify that the Commissioner will communicate to
          persons who have made disclosures the basis on which the Commissioner
          is considering exercising this discretion. However, it includes among the
          Commissioner's duties (in paragraph 22(d)) the duty to "ensure that the
          right to procedural fairness and natural justice of all persons involved in
          investigations is respected, including persons making disclosures."

          ...

          Dr. Gupta submits that even if the content of procedural fairness at the stage
          of a decision whether to investigate is relatively limited, the person making
          the disclosure must still be given notice of the "threshold issues" or "factors"
          that the Commissioner may consider in deciding whether to refuse to
          investigate. Dr. Gupta submits that he was not given notice that the
          availability of alternate recourse was a potential "threshold issue." In
          reliance on this Court's decision in Gladman v. Canada (Attorney General),
          2017 FCA 109 (F.C.A.) at para. 40, he also submits that at a minimum
          procedural fairness must include "the right to be informed of undisclosed
          adverse material facts being considered by a decision-maker and to make
          submissions about them (in some form)."

          In my view, it is not necessary to decide in this appeal whether fairness in
          this context requires notice of this nature, or whether recognizing a
          requirement to this effect would risk complicating and over-judicializing a
          process that was intended to be informal and expeditious. In my view, even
          if procedural fairness requires this sort of notice in this context, in the
          circumstances here Dr. Gupta had adequate notice that the Commissioner
          might decide not to investigate his disclosure of alleged harassment based
          on the assessment that the subject-matter could more appropriately be dealt
          with through another process.247

The Tribunal issued its first final decision on the merits in 2017 in Dunn v Indigenous and
Northern Affairs Canada and Lecompte.248 This was an application pursuant to section 20.4(1)(b)
of the PSDPA for a determination of whether a reprisal was taken against the complainant,
and if such a reprisal was taken for an order issuing a remedy and disciplinary action.249 In

a 423-paragraph decision, the Tribunal dismissed the application and found that no
measures had been taken against the complainant that would constitute a reprisal under the
PSDPA, and that further there was no nexus between the alleged reprisals and any protected
disclosure.

The complainant in this case, Ms. Dunn, made disclosures with respect to unjust hiring
practices and a perceived conflict of interest.250 The complainant submitted a first reprisal
complaint in respect of a staffing process, which was dismissed as unfounded.251 The second
complaint, which was the subject of the instant decision, listed six allegations of reprisal; the
two that were referred to the Tribunal involved claims that the complaint was singled out
by monitoring of her work absences and segregation from her coworkers.252

The Tribunal identified the issues to be decided as follows:

          The Tribunal must decide on the following issues in respect of an
          application by the Commissioner pursuant to section 20.4(1)(b) for a
          determination pursuant to section 21.5 (1):

                1. Did the Complainant make a "protected disclosure" under the
                Act?

                2. Did the Complainant suffer a "reprisal" under the Act?

                     a. Did the Respondent inappropriately monitor the
                     Complainant's attendance?

                     b. Did the Respondent attempt to segregate the
                     Complainant?

                     c. Should the Tribunal consider allegations of reprisal not
                     submitted by the Commissioner?

                3. Is there a nexus between the Complainant's protected disclosure
                of wrongdoing and the alleged reprisal measures such that it is
                determined that the Complainant has been subject to a reprisal?

                     a. What is the applicable test?

                     b. What is the appropriate mental element required to
                     establish a reprisal taken by Ms. Lecompte that results in
                     an order against her for disciplinary action?

                     c. Does the evidence establish a nexus in this case?

                4. If a reprisal was taken against the Complainant, whether Ms.
                Lecompte actually took it against the Complainant?

                5. If it is determined that Ms. Lecompte took a reprisal against the
                Complainant, whether to direct a further proceeding to determine

                whether to order the Employer to take appropriate disciplinary
                measures against Ms. Lecompte?

                6. Whether or not it is determined that Ms. Lecompte did not
                actually take the reprisal found to have been taken against the
                Complainant, what is the appropriate remedy pursuant to section
                21.7 (1) of the Act of all necessary measures that the Employer
                should be ordered to provide the Complainant?253

The Tribunal, in its lengthy reasons, made numerous comments on the law, including, inter
alia, on the process for determination of an application under section 20.4(1)(b),254 the
elements required to succeed on the application,255 what constitutes a protected disclosure256
(e.g., "I am of the view that such a disclosure must have some aspect of "whistleblowing" to
be protected"257), what constitutes a reprisal258 (e.g., "I find the meaning of reprisal and
retaliation to be well understood by the general population as capturing the sense of the
biblical adage of `an eye for an eye,' or more colloquially `a tit for a tat.' It is all about revenge,
which is most certainly an intentional act"259), what constitutes a nexus between the
disclosure and the reprisal and the sufficiency of the causal link (the nexus may be direct or
indirect),260 and the requisite intention for establishing the grounds for an order of a
disciplinary measure261 (e.g., "I do not conclude that the Commissioner must establish that
the reprisal measures were taken in bad faith, only that they were intended as revenge for
the protected disclosures"262).

As noted, in the result, the Tribunal found that no measure had been taken against the
complainant that would constitute a reprisal under the PSDPA, and that even if such a
measure had been proven there was no nexus with any protected disclosure. The application
was dismissed.263

The complainant applied to the Court of Appeal for judicial review of the decision.264 While
the Court dismissed the application due to the factual and credibility findings made by the
Tribunal, the panel (Stratas, Rennie, and Laskin J.J.A., per curiam) did offer a somewhat
scathing commentary on the Tribunal's approach in this case:

          We wish to raise a larger concern with how the Tribunal proceeded in this
          case. In hundreds of paragraphs, it delved deeply into several legal issues
          and ventured opinions on them. This was not necessary to decide the case

          before it. By acting in this way, the Tribunal ran counter to the imperative
          of expedition in subsection 21(1) of the Act, caused much waste and
          needless expense for the parties in this application, and greatly complicated
          our task of review.

          ...

          Therefore, we decline to deal with these legal issues in this case. But we
          wish to add that many of the legal conclusions reached by the Tribunal in
          this case warrant critical scrutiny. As a matter of administrative law, other
          members of the Tribunal are not bound by the legal conclusions reached
          here: see, e.g., Canada (Attorney General) v. Bri-Chem Supply Ltd., 2016 FCA
          257, [2017] 3 F.C.R. 123 (F.C.A.) at para. 40 and authorities cited therein. If
          the particular case requires it, and until this Court settles the matter, a
          member of the Tribunal is free to conduct her or his own analysis and reach
          different legal conclusions.265

A final example is the case of Me Agnaou, which has involved interlocutory decisions by the
Tribunal (which will not be canvassed here), judicial reviews by the Federal Court and the
Federal Court of Appeal, and finally in 2019 a final decision on the merits by the Tribunal.
In Agnaou v Canada (Agnaou FCA), the Federal Court of Appeal allowed the appeal of a
whistleblower against a decision of the Deputy Public Sector Integrity Commissioner and
declared his complaint of reprisal to be admissible.266 In reaching its decision, the Court
commented on the purpose of the PSDPA and the role of the Commissioner within the
scheme set out in the legislation, stating:

          I think it is beyond doubt that Parliament chose to adopt a different
          approach to reprisal complaints and that, as is the case under section 41 of
          the CHRA, only plain and obvious cases must be rejected summarily
          because they cannot be dealt with. Allow me to explain.

          ...

          The Commissioner clearly has very broad discretion to decide not to deal
          with a disclosure or not to investigate under section 24 of the Act. This stems
          not only from the grammatical and ordinary sense of the terms used, but
          also from the context, such as the type of reasons that the Commissioner
          may rely on to justify his decision. For example, under paragraph 24(1)(b),
          the Commissioner may decide not to commence an investigation because
          the subject-matter of the disclosure or the investigation is not sufficiently
          important, and under paragraph 24(1)(f), he or she may decide that there is
          a valid reason for not dealing with the subject-matter of the disclosure or
          the investigation. This suggests a considered analysis rather than a
          summary review. The Act sets no time limit for deciding this question, or
          for filing a disclosure after a wrongdoing has been committed.

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

          It is also clear that although the person making a disclosure has a certain
          interest in the case, the purpose of the Act is to denounce and punish
          wrongdoings in the public sector and, ultimately, build public confidence
          in the integrity of federal public servants. The public interest comes first,
          and it is the Commissioner's responsibility to protect it. This explains why,
          for example, the Commissioner may decide that the subject-matter of the
          disclosure is not sufficiently important; conversely, he or she may expand
          an investigation and consider wrongdoings uncovered in the course of that
          investigation without the need for any disclosure to have been made
          (section 33 of the Act).

          The role of the Commissioner is crucial. The Commissioner is the sole
          decision-maker throughout the process. He or she has the power not only
          to refuse to investigate, but also to recommend disciplinary action against
          public servants who engage in wrongdoings. Among other things, the
          Commissioner may also report on "any matter that arises out of an
          investigation to the Minister responsible for the portion of the public sector
          concerned or, if the matter relates to a Crown corporation, to its board or
          governing council" (section 37 of the Act).267

The Court of Appeal also highlighted the differences between the Commissioner's discretion
in deciding whether to deal with the subject matter of disclosures, as discussed above, and
the Commissioner's discretion with respect to complaints of reprisals. The Court stated:

          Parliament has established a very different process for reprisal complaints.
          In fact, this process is similar to the one provided for in the CHRA. There
          too, the public interest is a major concern. The disclosure of wrongdoings
          must be promoted while protecting the persons making disclosures and
          other persons taking part in an investigation into wrongdoings. However,
          as is often the case for complaints filed under the CHRA, reprisals
          complained of have a direct impact on the careers and working conditions
          of the public servants involved. The Act provides that a specific tribunal
          shall be established to deal with such matters, and that the Tribunal will be
          able to grant remedies to complainants, as well as impose disciplinary
          action against public servants who commit wrongdoings, where the
          Commissioner recommends it.

          In the process applicable to these complaints, the role of the Commissioner
          is similar to that of the Commission. Like the Commission, he or she handles
          complaints and ensures that they are dealt with appropriately. To do so, the
          Commission reviews complaints at two stages in the process before
          deciding whether an application to the Tribunal is warranted to protect the
          public servants making disclosures.

          ...

          Like Justice Rothstein (then of the Federal Court) in Canada Post Corporation,
          who had before him a decision dismissing a complaint under section 41 of

267 Ibid at paras 57, 59-61.  2022

1054
                                                    CHAPTER 13 WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTIONS

          the CHRA, I find that at the admissibility stage, the Commissioner must not
          summarily dismiss a reprisal complaint unless it is plain and obvious that
          it cannot be dealt with for one of the reasons described in subsection 19.1(3)
          of the Act. This interpretation respects Parliament's intention that
          complaints be dealt with in a particularly expeditious manner (within
          15 days) at this first stage in the process. It is also consistent with the
          principle generally applied when a proceeding is summarily dismissed,
          thereby depriving the complainant of his or her right to a remedy. Finally,
          a cursory review of the complaint at this preliminary stage also avoids
          duplicating the investigation and repeating the exercise set out in
          subsection 20.4(3) of the Act.268

Subsequently, in Agnaou c Canada (Procureur general) (Agnaou FC), the Federal Court
considered that same whistleblower's application for judicial review of the decision of the
Commissioner to dismiss the reprisal complaint filed at the Office of the Public Sector
Integrity Commissioner.269 Martineau J. provided the following summary of the process by
which the commissioner may refer a reprisal complaint to the Tribunal if, after receipt of an
investigation report, the Commissioner is of the opinion that the referral is warranted:

          In fact, disclosures can be made at various times and at various levels:
          internally, to a supervisor or senior officer in a department or organization
          (section 12); externally, to the Commissioner (section 13), or, if there is not
          sufficient time to make the disclosure of a serious offence under an Act of
          Parliament or an imminent risk of substantial and specific danger, the
          disclosure may be made to the public (subsection 16(1)). In this section, as
          an independent agent of Parliament, the Commissioner plays an essential
          watchdog role, investigating not only disclosures of wrongdoing that he or
          she has received from public servants (section 13), but also any other
          instance of wrongdoing of which he or she may have learned during the
          course of an investigation or as a result of information provided by a person
          who is not a public servant (section 33). However, the disclosure system
          would go ignored if the Act did not at the same time ensure the protection
          of the public servants who made the disclosures.

          Here is why, in a distinct manner, the Act allows the Commissioner to
          conduct investigations (sections 19.7 to 19.9), to conduct conciliation
          (sections 20 to 20.2), and to refer to the Public Servants Disclosure Protection
          Tribunal Canada [the Tribunal] a reprisal complaint made by a public
          servant pursuant to section 19.1 of the Act if, after receipt of the
          investigation report pursuant to section 20.3 of the Act, the Commissioner
          is of the opinion that it is warranted (section 20.4). In such cases, the
          Commissioner can apply to the Tribunal to determine whether a reprisal
          was taken, for: (a) an order respecting a remedy in favour of the
          complainant (paragraph 20.4(1)(a) of the Act); or (b) an order respecting a
          remedy in favour of the complainant and an order respecting disciplinary

GLOBAL CORRUPTION                                                                            2022

          action against any person or persons identified by the Commissioner in the
          application as being the person or persons who took the reprisal (paragraph
          20.4(1)(a) of the Act). Clearly, the success of the protection system depends
          on the expeditiousness of the Commissioner's investigations and the
          confidence of stakeholders in the remedy mechanisms.

          Furthermore, the creation of the Tribunal -- a specialized and independent
          tribunal tasked with determining whether reprisals took place and
          providing the appropriate remedy, which may include taking disciplinary
          action against any person who carried out reprisals -- is a very different
          approach from traditional labour relations models (in particular, see El-
          Helou and Courts Administration Service, Power and Delage, 2011 CanLII 93945
          (CA PSDPT), 2011-TP-01 at para 48 [El-Helou 1]). The importance taken on
          by the Commissioner's application, once sent to the Tribunal, does not come
          from the fact that it proves the veracity of its contents, since that is not the
          case. Nevertheless, the Commissioner's application pursuant to section 20.4
          of the Act is essential because it allows the Tribunal to carry out its decision-
          making function and, as required, provide an appropriate remedy (sections
          21.7 and 21.8). With respect to reprisals, unlike the Commissioner, the
          Tribunal has the authority, in the same manner and to the same extent as a
          superior court of record, to summon and enforce the attendance of
          witnesses and compel them to give oral or written evidence on oath and to
          produce any documents and things that the member or panel considers
          necessary for the full hearing and consideration of the application
          (paragraph 21.2(1)(a) of the Act). In addition, it is the judges of the Federal
          Court or other superior courts who sit on the Tribunal. These judges are
          therefore particularly well placed to decide on any issue of evidence or law
          that may arise as part of the Commissioner's application.

          It must be remembered that the Commissioner's role is not to determine the
          credibility of the persons involved or to decide on delicate issues of law, but
          to decide whether there is an objective basis for justifying that the reprisal
          complaint be investigated on its merits by the Tribunal. Thus, by holding an
          investigation into a reprisal complaint (sections 19.3 to 19.7), the
          investigator, who submits a report and its recommendations to the
          Commissioner, must not undermine the Tribunal's adjudicative function
          (El-Helou v. Courts Administration Service, 2011 CanLII 93947 (CA PSDPT),
          2011-TP-04 at para 43 [El-Helou 4]). At the risk of repeating myself, the
          Commissioner acts as a filter and not as a shield against otherwise allowable
          reprisal complaints. In fact, paragraph 20.4(3)(a) should be read in
          correlation with subsection 19.1(1), which states that a public servant or
          former public servant who has "reasonable grounds" for believing that a
          reprisal has been taken against him or her may file a complaint. It is in this
          context that the Commissioner must look at whether "there are reasonable
          grounds for believing that a reprisal was taken against the complainant"
          (paragraph 20.4(3)(a)). That being said, the expression "reasonable grounds
          to believe" refers to a threshold of proof that is less demanding that the
          "balance of probabilities" standard of proof, which typically applies to civil

1056
                                                    CHAPTER 13 WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTIONS

          trials and before many administrative tribunals, including the Tribunal (El-
          Helou 4 at paras 34-46).

          ...

          On the other hand, the existence of "reasonable grounds" is not the only
          factor that affects the exercise of the Commissioner's discretion. Among the
          other relevant factors mentioned by lawmakers in subsection 20.4(3) of
          the Act, the Commissioner is asked to take into account whether the
          investigation into the complaint could not be completed due to a lack of
          cooperation on the part of one or more chief executives or public servants
          (paragraph 20.4(3)(b)); the complaint should be dismissed on any ground
          mentioned in paragraphs 19.3(1)(a) to (d) (section 19.3 and paragraph
          20.4(3)(c)); and, having regard to all the circumstances relating to the
          complaint, it is in the public interest to make an application to the Tribunal.

          In the case at bar, the disputed decision was made under the authority of
          section 20.5 of the Act, which allows the Commissioner, after receipt of the
          investigation report prepared by an investigator under section 20.3 of
          the Act, to dismiss a reprisal complaint if the Commissioner "is of the
          opinion that an application to the Tribunal is not warranted in the
          circumstances, he or she must dismiss the complaint", hence the present
          application for judicial review.270

In this case, Martineau J. ultimately allowed the application for judicial review and set aside
the Commissioner's decision (although it should be noted that the Commissioner had also
decided that it was in the public interest to revoke that decision).271 The Court ordered that
the Commissioner apply under section 20.4(1) to the Tribunal to deal with the reprisal
complaint.

The Tribunal issued a final decision on the merits in Me Agnaou's case in 2019, concluding
that Me Agnaou had failed to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that they had made a
protected disclosure within the meaning of section 12 of the PSDPA or that the alleged
reprisal was taken against them because they had made a protected disclosure.272 With
respect to the complainant's burden, the Tribunal stated:

          The Federal Court and the Tribunal have already established that, in a
          reprisals complaint, it is for the complainant to demonstrate, on a balance
          of probabilities, that (1) he or she made a protected disclosure within the
          meaning of the Act; (2) he or she was the subject of one of the measures
          listed in the definition of "reprisal" in section 2 of the Act; and (3) the
          measure was taken against him or her because he or she has made a
          disclosure, which constitutes reprisals (Agnaou 2017 FC 338 at para 7; Dunn

          para 66 [Dunn]; El-Helou 4 at para 34, 47-49). These elements flow directly
          from the definition of reprisals provided for in section 2 of the Act. [...]273

The Tribunal went on to consider the meaning of "disclosure" in the PSDPA, stating:

          The word "disclosure" is not defined in the Act. However, Le Petit Robert
          defines it as the act of disclosure which is to [translation] "bring to the
          attention of the public (that which was known to a few). - to unveil, to
          disclose, to proclaim, to publish, to spread, to reveal (cf. to bring to light; to
          shout from the rooftops)". As for the Larousse Dictionary, it defines this
          term as the [translation] "act of disclosing, of making information
          public: Disclosure of a secret code". And it defines divulguer (to disclose) as
          [translation] "to disseminate to the public information that was originally
          considered secret, confidential; to spread a rumour; to unveil, to
          uncover: Disclose the name of a suspect". What is more, in accordance with
          the context in which the Act was passed and the purpose stated in its
          preamble, it seems fair to point out that the objective of a disclosure is, for
          the public servant, to denounce an act that undermines the integrity of the
          public service, to reveal, to sound the alarm. A person who makes a
          disclosure is known in popular parlance as a "whistle-blower."

          The very text of section 12 of the Act provides for certain elements. Thus, a
          disclosure must be made to a supervisor or the designated senior officer. In
          this case, it is common ground that Me Boileau and Me Morin were indeed
          supervisors of Me Agnaou on April 1 and 2, 2009.

          Second, in my view, a disclosure should communicate any information that
          could objectively demonstrate that a wrongdoing has been or is about to be
          committed. To this end, section 8 sets out the categories of wrongdoings
          covered, including (c) a gross mismanagement in the public
          sector. Me Agnaou indicated in these emails that the PPSC's position not to
          prosecute is contrary to its own policies and to the public interest, and the
          Federal Court of Appeal determined in Agnaou 2015 FCA 29 at paras 78, 83-
          88, that Me Agnaou's references may refer to a case of gross
          mismanagement. I therefore accept that the objective criterion to which the
          respondents have referred has been met.

          ...

          Even if I accepted Me Agnaou's argument that only his view counts in
          deciding whether he had made a disclosure under the Act by sending his

<https://www.ourcommons.ca/Content/Committee/421/OGGO/Reports/RP9055222/oggorp09/oggorp

that he or she was effectively the victim of reprisals. All witnesses that spoke about the burden of
proof expressed this to be a daunting and quasi-impossible task or, at least, that a reverse onus
would level the field for whistleblowers before the Tribunal."

1058                                                                                                   2022

          emails on April 1 and 2, he unfortunately did not prove that it was more
          likely than not that he himself wanted to make a disclosure under the Act.

          According to the evidence, the element of denunciation, of revelation or
          of sounding the alarm to which I referred above is absent. In this regard,
          I agree with Me Morin when he concludes that if Me Agnaou had wanted
          to sound the alarm, he would have sent his message to the disclosure
          protection coordinator at the PPSC, a third party, and not exclusively to the
          same persons that he alleged having wanted to denounce. It is difficult to
          conclude that Me Agnaou wanted to disclose, to sound the alarm, to reveal
          information or to denounce acts, by sending two messages to the exact same
          people he was accusing. [emphasis added]274

The Tribunal has thus incorporated an element of "denunciation" or "sounding the alarm"
into the determination of whether a disclosure has been made. This is not found in the text
of the legislation, and may impose a heavy burden on complainants.

The Tribunal went on to consider whether, in the event it was wrong on the matter of
whether there was a disclosure, the complainant had established that there was a link
between the emails (i.e., the alleged disclosure) and the measure--that his staffing priority
had not be respected, and he was "robbed"275 of a job through the reclassification of two
positions (i.e., the alleged reprisal). The Tribunal found that there was no evidence of a
connection between these:

          It should first be noted that I do not agree with the proposition that
          Me Agnaou raised at the hearing, according to which it would suffice for
          the complainant to prove that the disclosure was only one of the reasons for
          taking the measure, and not the only reason, in order to conclude that there
          were reprisals (transcripts, volume 18, p. 5054).

          I also disagree with the other proposition that Me Agnaou set out in his
          reply, namely, that if we take the position that there must be a causal link
          between the disclosure and the measure, the protection regime against
          reprisals will not work (transcripts, volume 19, p. 5325). Me Agnaou did not
          file any authorities or arguments to support his propositions, while the text
          of the Act clearly requires that, in order to find reprisals, the measure had
          to have been taken against the public servant "because the public servant
          has made a protected disclosure."

          ...

          Furthermore, even assuming that the Memorandum of Understanding
          could not have been opposed, or even that the reclassification was not valid,
          nothing in the evidence shows that it is more likely than not that the
          measure was taken, in September 2012, because Me Agnaou made a
          disclosure, in April 2009.

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

          ...

          Furthermore, proof of the link between the measure and the disclosure also
          requires, first of all, proof of knowledge, by those who took the measure, of
          the existence of the disclosure. However, this proof has not been made.276

With respect to the external disclosure, the Tribunal found that Me Agnaou did not
demonstrate the existence of a link between the disclosure to the Office of the Commissioner
and the reclassification of the positions, and he therefore did not prove that a measure had
been taken against him because he made a disclosure.277

      7.2.3 Is the PSDPA Effective? Commentary and Review

A 2011 Report that examined the legislation's effectiveness in its first three years by the
Federal Accountability Initiative for Reform (FAIR),278 a Canadian non-governmental
organization, was scathing in its review of the federal legislation:

          When FAIR testified to Parliament we predicted that the legislation would
          fail, but we could not have imagined how badly. A combination of flawed
          legislation and improper administration created a system that in three years
          uncovered not a single finding of wrongdoing and protected not a single
          whistleblower from reprisals. The Commissioner appointed to protect
          government whistleblowers resigned in disgrace following a report by the
          Auditor General condemning her behaviour. The credibility of the entire
          system is currently in tatters: it needs a complete overhaul.

          ...

          The basic approach of the Act - creating a complete new quasi-judicial
          process just for whistleblowers - is misguided and suspect, creating a
          secretive, unaccountable regime, hermetically sealed off from our courts
          and from the media. Experience has shown that watchdog agencies
          constituted like this are invariably protective of the establishment and
          indifferent or even hostile to whistleblowers.

          ...

          The text of the law is a bloated, unwieldy mess. It creates a labyrinth of
          complex provisions, full of ambiguities, exceptions and repetition, which
          almost no-one can claim to understand fully. It stands in stark contrast to

          the brevity, simplicity and clarity that we find in whistleblower legislation
          that has proven to be effective.279

FAIR identified the narrow scope of the law (applying only to workers in the federal public
sector), restriction of reporting avenues and exclusion from the courts, restrictions contained
in the definition of wrongdoing, weak provisions for the investigation and correction of
wrongdoing, and likelihood of complaint rejection as among the failures of the PSDPA.280 In
addition, it is possible to interpret the lack of any finding of wrongdoing differently; that is,
it could be interpreted as a sign that little wrongdoing has actually occurred. In a 2010 article,
for example, Kelly Saunders and Joanne Thibault state:

          There are so few real cases of wrongdoing that the public sector as a whole
          remains woefully unpracticed in working through an actual disclosure.
          Indeed, in the first two years after Canada's latest whistleblower legislation
          came into effect, not a single case of wrongdoing was uncovered. In the
          absence of practice, there are no lessons learned, no "sharpening of the saw"
          that normalizes the act of disclosure.

          ...

          The limited volume of disclosures since the introduction of stronger
          mechanisms could mean one of two things. It could mean that the
          legislation has deterred wrongdoers who are convinced that the code of
          silence, which still lingers within the public service, will not hold in the face
          of disclosure protection. Alternatively, it could mean that there really are
          not many instances of wrongdoing to expose.281

The October 2015 G20 Report echoes many of FAIR's negative findings, albeit in less
colourful language. The report notes that:

          As of September 2015 there are no active cases before the Public Servants
          Disclosure Protection Tribunal, where retaliation victims can seek remedies
          and compensation. All six cases recorded have either settled or have been
          withdrawn. Three of the cases involved long-term employees of Blue Water
          Bridge Canada who were all fired on 19 March 2013, including the vice
          president for operations. The PSIC says the former CEO misused public
          money and violated the code of ethics when he gave two managers
          severance payments worth $650,000.

          In five of six cases that the Integrity Commissioner has referred to the
          Tribunal, he has declined to ask the Tribunal to sanction those responsible
          for the reprisals. In the one case in which the Commissioner called for

          sanctions, he has since reversed himself and now says there were no
          reprisals. The whistleblower's lawyer has initiated a judicial review to
          contest this reversal.

          In April 2014 Canada's Auditor General found "gross mismanagement" in
          the handling of two PSIC cases. The audit criticized `buck-passing' by top
          managers, slow handling of cases, the loss of a confidential file, poor
          handling of conflicts of interest, and the inadvertent identification of a
          whistleblower to the alleged wrongdoer. [emphasis added] [footnotes
          omitted]282

A review of UNCAC implementation by TI, conducted in October 2013, emphasizes the
critical need for a review of the Canadian legislation.283 The review notes that the PSDPA
does not make public interest the foremost concern in the protection of whistleblowers, and
instead emphasizes the balance of rights between duty to one's employer and an employee's
freedom of expression.284 Furthermore, the TI review notes that access to justice issues are
implicated in Canada's statutory regime:

          Whistleblowers often have to bear their own legal costs, while accused
          wrongdoers will typically have access to the financial and legal resources of
          the organization. The review also raises questions about the
          implementation of the PSDPA, raising concerns regarding the
          Commissioner's power to adequately investigate claims of reprisal, the first
          Commissioner's failure to investigate allegations of reprisals against her
          own staff, and statistics that show few inquiries by whistleblowers receive
          full investigations.285

285 Ibid at 16-18. Regarding investigatory powers, the review states at 16 that "[u]nder the PSDPA, the
Integrity Commissioner has full powers under Part II of the Inquiries Act to investigate disclosures of
wrongdoing [s 29]. However, when investigating complaints of reprisals against a whistleblower, the
Commissioner is not given comparable powers [ss 19.7-19.9]." In regard to the first Commissioner's
tenure, the report states at 17-18:

      In 2010, the Auditor General reported that the first Public Sector Integrity
      Commissioner, Christiane Ouimet, failed to finalize or implement operational
      guidance to enable investigations to be conducted. The Commissioner's Office
      failed to robustly investigate complaints: from 2007 to 2010, the Commissioner's
      Office received 228 disclosures of wrongdoings or complaints; out of these only
      seven received a formal investigation of the 86 closed operational files, in "many
      cases" the decision to not formally investigate or otherwise dismiss disclosures of
      wrongdoing and complaints was not supported by the material in the
      Commissioner's file. In addition, the Auditor General's investigation found that
      the Commissioner had engaged in retaliatory action against employees whom the

In 2015, research into the whistleblowing culture in the federal public sector in Canada
found that when focus group participants were shown a short informative video about
information disclosure, the "most frequently identified aspect of the video to which
participants reacted negatively or which created some degree of concern was the prospect
of appearing before a tribunal of judges in the case of reprisals."286

Section 54 of the PSDPA mandates a five year review of the legislation. Although long
overdue, the first statutory review of the legislation was recently undertaken and in June
2017 the report of the Standing Committee on Government Operations and Estimates was
released, titled Strengthening the Protection of the Public Interest within the Public Servants
Disclosure Protection Act.287 In the course of its review, the Committee held 12 meetings, heard
from 52 witnesses, and received 12 briefs. The Committee identified six "main challenges,"
as follows:

          1. The lack of clarity around the public interest purposes of the Act;

          2. The disclosure mechanisms under the Act do not necessarily ensure the
              protection of the public interest;

          3. The Act does not sufficiently protect whistleblowers from reprisals as
              most of them face significant financial, professional and health-related
              consequences;

          4. The commonly held perception that the federal organizational culture
              towards the disclosure of wrongdoing seems to discourage it;

          5. The mandatory annual reporting as prescribed under the Act is
              inadequate to provide a meaningful evaluation of the effectiveness of the
              disclosure mechanisms; and

          6. Public servants and external experts lack confidence in the adequate
              protection of whistleblowers under the Act, notably due to the potential
              conflicts of interest of those administering the internal disclosure
              process.288

And made fifteen recommendations.289 In sum, the Committee recommended:

            Commissioner believed had complained about her. A new Commissioner was
            appointed in December 2011.

The review notes, at 18, that between 2007-2013 the Commissioner "[r]eceived 1365 inquiries and 434
disclosures; Began 55 investigations; Completed 34 investigations; Found 5 instances of wrongdoing;
and Sanctioned 0 wrongdoers." [emphasis removed]

          1. Expanding the definitions of the terms "wrongdoing" and "reprisal," and
              modifying the definition of the term "protected disclosure" under the
              Act;

          2. Amending the legislation to protect and support the whistleblowers and
              to prevent retaliation against them;

          3. Reversing the burden of proof from the whistleblower onto the employer
              in cases of reprisals;

          4. Providing legal and procedural advice, as necessary, to public servants
              seeking to make a protected disclosure of wrongdoing or file a reprisal
              complaint;

          5. Embedding in the legislation confidentiality provisions of witnesses'
              identities;

              responsible for training, education and oversight responsibilities to
              standardize the internal disclosure process; and

          7. Implementing mandatory and timely reporting of disclosure activities.290

The government response to the report (dated October 16, 2017) stated, in part:

           I agree with the opinion of the Committee and its witnesses that
          improvements are required to the disclosure and protection regime under
          the Public Servants Disclosure Protection Act. We will move forward to
          implement improvements to the administration and operation of the
          internal disclosure process and the protection from acts of reprisal against
          public servants, which will include greater guidance for the internal
          disclosure process, increased awareness activities and training for public
          servants, supervisors and managers, and enhanced reporting related to the
          internal disclosure process and acts of founded wrongdoing. Additionally,
          within the Open Government Portal, we are implementing a central website
          where Canadians will be able to access information about acts of founded
          wrongdoing within federal institutions.

          The Government remains committed to providing public servants and the
          public with a secure and confidential process for disclosing serious
          wrongdoing in the federal public sector and enhancing protection from acts
          of reprisal. We remain committed to promoting and sustaining an ethical
          workplace culture, and to supporting and strengthening Canadians'
          confidence in the integrity of the federal public sector. The Government

          reprisal.291

The 2019-2020 Annual Report produced by the Treasury Board of Canada, in compliance with
section 38.1 of the PSDPA, "contains information on disclosure activities in the federal public
sector, which includes departments, agencies and Crown corporations as defined in section
2 of the Act,"292 but does not include information on anonymous disclosures or disclosures
or complaints made to the Public Sector Integrity Commissioner of Canada. 2019-2020 saw
the second lowest number of disclosures in a five year period, with 220 new disclosures
received by federal public service organizations.293 In 2019-2020, there were 216 disclosures
received under the PSDPA (and four referrals resulting from a disclosure made in another
public sector organization), as compared to 269 in 2018-2019 and 291 in 2017-2018.294 Of the
133 active organizations reporting in this year, 24 reported disclosures and 33 reported
enquiries.295 And, of the 458 active disclosures in 2019-2020 (many of which being carried
over from previous years), 280 (61%) were assessed this year; 116 (41%) of those met the
definition of wrongdoing, and 58 (35%) were directed to other recourse processes.296 Only
38 investigations were commenced in 2019-2020 as a result of disclosures received; 3
disclosures led to a finding of wrongdoing, and 11 led to corrective measures.297
Organizations have reported that the increase in disclosures carried over from one year to
the next "stems from of a lack of internal investigative capacity or available investigative
services."298 Since 2018, there has been a National Master Standing Order for investigative
services made available to organizations in an attempt to mitigate this issue.299

It is difficult to determine what these numbers tell us about the success or failure of the
PSDPA, beyond the fact that individuals are making internal disclosures of wrongdoing.
Without data as to the number of individuals who perceive wrongdoing in the workplace, it
is impossible to determine whether a high percentage of public sector workers actually blow
the whistle on wrongdoing. In the past five years, the number of disclosures received under
the PSDPA has ranged from a high of 291 in 2017-2018 to a low of 209 in 2016-2017.300 These
numbers may indicate that fewer public sector workers disclose wrongdoing in some years,
or the numbers may demonstrate that less wrongdoing has occurred in those years. Data

gathered from the Public Service Employee Survey includes information related to the
perception of an "ethical environment" in the workplace.301 The results of the 2019 survey
indicate that 50% of public servants felt that they could initiate a formal recourse process
without fear of reprisal; generally, the Annual Report indicates that "while upward trends in
the perception of ethical leadership are important, the downward trend in the rate of
awareness about where to go for help in resolving ethical dilemmas or conflicts is a
concern."302

7.3 Ontario Securities Commission Whistleblower Program

On July 14, 2016, the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) launched a new enforcement
initiative called the Office of the Whistleblower. This program is the first paid whistleblower
program by a securities regulator in Canada, and largely resembles the Whistleblower
Program of the US SEC.303 The OSC Whistleblower Program allows eligible whistleblowers
to report information regarding possible violations of Ontario securities law anonymously
and, if the information results in an enforcement action, receive an award of up to $5
million.304 Since its launch, the OSC Whistleblower Program has awarded more than $8.6
million to whistleblowers; recently, in November of 2020, it announced that it had awarded
$585,000 to three whistleblowers, who included company outsiders.305

The next section describes in detail the features of the OSC Whistleblower Program, drawing
attention to those features that elicited commentary prior to and following the launch of the
initiative. This section will also compare features of the OSC and SEC whistleblower
programs, drawing attention to significant differences between their eligibility criteria and
award determination structures.

      7.3.1 Confidentiality

The OSC Whistleblower Program allows individuals to submit information related to
potential violations of Ontario securities law to the OSC online or by mail. Anonymous
submissions may be made through the program by retaining a lawyer who submits

information on a whistleblower's behalf.306 Before the OSC can submit an award to an
anonymous whistleblower, the whistleblower will generally be required to provide their
identity to the OSC to confirm that they are eligible to receive an award.307 While the OSC
policy includes a general commitment to make all reasonable efforts to keep a
whistleblower's identity (and any potentially identifying information) confidential, there are
specific exceptions. For example, during certain administrative proceedings under section
127 of the Securities Act (e.g., an order to terminate registration), disclosure of the
whistleblower's identity may be required to allow the respondent an opportunity to make
full answer and defence.308

The OSC Whistleblower Program also outlines the OSC's general policy of responding to
requests for information relating to a whistleblower's identity (or other possibly identifying
information) under the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FIPPA).309 While
the OSC takes the position that information requests with respect to identifying information
should be denied because specific FIPPA provisions protect such information, the ultimate
decision to disclose in this context is made by the Information and Privacy Commissioner of
Ontario or a court of competent jurisdiction.310

Taken together, the OSC's policies regarding the confidentiality of whistleblowers speak to
the limits of whistleblower initiatives generally. Dedication to reasonable efforts to maintain
confidentiality is important, but due to the nature of administrative law and freedom of
information legislation, confidentiality is far from guaranteed in all circumstances. In other
words, despite the protections afforded by the OSC Whistleblower Program, whistleblowers
are taking some risk of having their identities ultimately disclosed as a result of the
information they submit to the Commission.

      7.3.2 Eligibility Criteria for Awards

The OSC Whistleblower Program sets out criteria that must be fulfilled before the OSC will
consider issuing an award, covering both the information provided by the whistleblower
and the characteristics of the whistleblower themselves.

The eligibility criteria that information received from whistleblowers must meet are
designed to ensure that awards are only given for novel information that leads to an
enforcement action. The information must relate to a serious violation of Ontario securities
law, be original information, be voluntarily submitted, be "of high quality and contain
sufficient timely, specific and credible facts" relating to an alleged violation of securities law,

310 Policy Document, supra note 306, s 12. The OSC cites two specific FIPPA provisions in support of
its position that identifying information with respect to whistleblowers should be protected from
disclosure under the FIPPA, ibid: s 14(1)(d) (protection of confidential sources of information in a law
enforcement context) and s 21(3)(b) (protection of personal information compiled as part of an
investigation into possible violations of the law).

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

and be "of meaningful assistance to Commission Staff in investigating the matter and
obtaining an award-eligible outcome."311 To be eligible for a whistleblower award, all of
these criteria must be met.312 Consequently, if, for example, a whistleblower voluntarily
provides original information related to a violation that is not of meaningful assistance to
the OSC in its investigation, the information will not be eligible for a reward. Simply put,
these conditions restrict the availability of whistleblower awards to information that has a
direct and tangible impact on an investigation or proceedings.

Section 14(3) of the Policy Document lists disqualifying criteria that will render a piece of
information ineligible for a whistleblower award. These criteria reflect several policy goals
underlying the OSC Whistleblower Program. If information is misleading, untrue,
speculative, insufficiently specific, public or not related to a violation of Ontario securities
law, it is ineligible for a whistleblower award. These requirements reflect the purpose of the
program, which is to obtain high-quality information regarding potential violations of
securities law. Further, information subject to solicitor client privilege is ineligible for a
whistleblower award, given the broad systemic interest in maintaining solicitor client
privilege.313 Lastly, information obtained by a means that constitutes a criminal offence will

311 Ibid, s 14(1).
312 Ibid, s 14(2).
313 Ibid, s (1), defines "original information" to exclude information obtained by a whistleblower
"through a communication that was subject to solicitor-client privilege," and s 15(1)(d) indicates that
the following category is generally ineligible for an award:

      [T]hose who obtained information in connection with providing legal services to, or
      conducting the legal representation of, an employer that is, or that employs, the subject of
      the whistleblower submission, unless disclosure of that information would otherwise be
      permitted by a lawyer under applicable provincial or territorial bar or law society rules, or
      the equivalent rules applicable in another jurisdiction.

Paragraph 15(1)(d) was originally subject to the exceptions listed in s 15(2). However, changes were
proposed in 2018: see "OSC Notice and Request for Comment Proposed Change to OSC Policy 15-
601 Whistleblower Program" (18 January 2018), online: Ontario Securities Commission
<https://www.osc.gov.on.ca/en/SecuritiesLaw_rule_20180118_15-601_rfc-whistleblower-
program.htm>, wherein the OSC described the proposed change as follows:

      The proposed change would mean that the exceptions from ineligibility set out in
      subsection 15(2) of the Policy would not apply to in-house counsel in respect of matters that
      arise while the in-house counsel is acting in a legal capacity. The change is also intended to
      further clarify that the Commission does not wish to receive information that is subject to
      solicitor-client privilege or the provision of which would otherwise be in breach of
      applicable provincial or territorial bar or law society rules or equivalent rules applicable in
      another jurisdiction. Specifically, the proposed change clarifies that in Ontario, in-house
      counsel acting in a legal capacity are ineligible for a whistleblower award because their duty
      to protect the confidentiality of their clients' information would preclude them from making
      a whistleblower submission under the rules governing the legal profession in the province.

These changes were implemented in 2018. For an in-depth discussion of the Policy Document as it
stood prior to this change, see Connor Bildfell, "In-House Counsels' Eligibility for Whistleblower
Awards: A Critical and Comparative Analysis" (2017) 49:2 Ottawa L Rev 373.

1068                                                                                                     2022
                                                    CHAPTER 13 WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTIONS

be ineligible for an award, as the OSC does not want to encourage or be complicit in theft,
fraud or other illegal means of acquiring information. These common sense disqualifying
criteria ensure that whistleblowers are encouraged to submit only information that is legally
obtained and can be sufficiently relied upon to advance an investigation or proceedings.

Section 15 of the Policy Document describes categories of individuals who would "generally
be considered ineligible for a whistleblower award."314 Many of these categories refer to
roles that render a person ineligible for an award, such as counsel for the subject of the
whistleblowing submission or an employee of the Commission or a self-regulatory body.
Other provisions disqualify a whistleblower from award eligibility on the basis of their
conduct as a whistleblower. For example, section 15(1)(a) excludes individuals from
eligibility if they "without good reason refused a request for additional information from
Commission Staff."315

It should be noted that awards would generally not be given to "those who obtained or
provided the information in circumstances which would bring the administration of the
[Whistleblower Program] into disrepute."316 This general language removes the incentive
for individuals to engage in disputable activities in pursuit of a financial award, and limits
eligibility of awards to those who voluntarily submit original, high-quality information
without resorting to illegal means to acquire that information.

While individuals who fall into the categories listed under section 15(1) of the policy will
generally be ineligible to receive a whistleblower award, section 15(2) recognizes limited
exceptions regarding certain categories. Per section 15(2), a whistleblower who would
generally be ineligible under sections 15(1)(e)-(h) may be eligible for awards under certain
circumstances. These categories describe individuals who are generally ineligible because of
their relationship with the subject of the whistleblower submission.317 If a whistleblower
who falls into these categories has a reasonable basis to believe that disclosure is necessary
to prevent future or continuing substantial injury to the financial interests of the entity or
investors, they may be eligible for an award. Further, if one of the excluded whistleblowers
has a reasonable basis to believe the subject of the submission is engaged in conduct that
will impede investigations, they may be eligible for a whistleblower award.

One unique and controversial feature of the OSC's whistleblower eligibility criteria is the
lack of a requirement that whistleblowers avail themselves of internal reporting and
compliance systems before contacting the OSC Whistleblower Program. While the OSC
"encourages whistleblowers who are employees to report potential violations ... through an
internal compliance and reporting mechanism," this action is not a prerequisite to award

314 Ibid, s 15(1).
315 Ibid.
316 Ibid, s 15(1)(o).
317 These provisions exclude the following categories, respectively, from award eligibility subject to
the exceptions under s 15(2) of the Ontario Securities Commission, "OSC Policy 15-601:
Whistleblower Program" (4 October 2018): e) providers of auditing/external assurance services to the
subject of the submission, f) investigators or inquiry participants, g) directors or officers of the subject
of the submission, and h) Chief Compliance Officers (or functional equivalents) for the subject of the
submission.

                                                                                                         1069
GLOBAL CORRUPTION

eligibility. The decision not to require whistleblowers to report potential violations
internally reflects the OSC's belief that "there may be circumstances in which a
whistleblower may appropriately wish not to report" to an internal compliance
mechanism.318

The decision to not include an internal reporting requirement has been criticized by the
financial sector, which fears that the OSC Whistleblower Program (and the enticement of
financial rewards) could undermine the sector's internal compliance and reporting
programs. Critics, in particular issuers, have concerns that the OSC Whistleblower Program
is structured such that employees will be tempted to bypass internal compliance systems in
pursuit of a financial award.319 Some fear that the lack of an internal reporting requirement
will "disqualify registrants and reporting issuers from being able to self-identify, self-
remediate and self-report in order to qualify for credit for cooperation."320 While the OSC
has attempted to assuage these concerns by considering participation in internal compliance
processes as a factor that may increase an award's amount, it is unclear that this satisfies the
concerns of issuers.

Another element of whistleblower award eligibility that is regarded as controversial is the
issue of culpable whistleblower eligibility. The OSC Whistleblower Program does not
disqualify whistleblowers from awards on the basis of their unclean hands, but rather lists
culpability as a factor that can decrease the amount of the award offered.321 For the purposes
of calculating that the CDN$1 million threshold of "award eligible outcomes" has been met,
any voluntary payments by or payments ordered against entities whose liability is "based
substantially" on the conduct of the whistleblower will not be taken into account. Likewise,
any portion of sanctions that are awarded against a whistleblower will be subtracted from
the award that he or she is otherwise eligible to receive.

For the purpose of comparison, consider the position of the SEC with respect to culpable
whistleblowers. Under the SEC Whistleblower Program, whistleblowers are precluded from
award eligibility if they have been convicted of a securities-related criminal offence.322 While
the OSC regime does not absolutely preclude this class of whistleblower from receiving an
award, it does limit the circumstances in which an individual can benefit from their own
complicity. As described above, culpability will have an impact on both the determination
of an "award eligible income" and the amount of any award given. Further, the submission
of information by the whistleblower to the Commission does not preclude the possibility of

action being taken against the whistleblower.323 Together, these measures ensure that the
program does not unduly restrict the OSC with respect to the actions it can take against
culpable whistleblowers. Rather, it allows OSC staff to evaluate cases as they arise and make
an appropriate determination regarding award eligibility and other enforcement actions in
the circumstances.

      7.3.3 Award Formula

An award eligible outcome can only occur when an order made under section 127 of the
Securities Act or section 60 of the Commodities Futures Act requires the guilty party to pay
more than CDN$1 million in voluntary payments to the OSC or in financial sanctions
imposed by the OSC. If an eligible outcome results from a submission of income from an
eligible whistleblower, an award of between 5% and 15% can be paid.324 If the sanctions
imposed and/or voluntary payments made amount to over CDN$10 million dollars, the
maximum that will be awarded is generally CDN$1.5 million.325 However, if over CDN$10
million dollars is, in fact, collected, the whistleblower may receive an award between 5%
and 15% of the total, to a maximum of CDN$5 million.326

The fact that most awards under the OSC Whistleblower Program are not contingent on the
actual collection of monetary sanctions has drawn ire regarding where the cost of the
program will ultimately fall. The OSC Whistleblower Program allows for the possibility of
a whistleblower receiving an award of up to CDN$1.5 million without any money actually
being collected by the OSC. Commentators have, again, drawn a comparison to the SEC
Whistleblower Program, which requires tips to result in the collection of monetary sanctions
before a whistleblower is eligible for an award. By not tying awards to collection, some
commentators fear that the Program's costs will ultimately be borne by compliant issuers
(and, ultimately, their shareholders) through increased fees.327 Whether these concerns will
materialize remains to be seen, but it should be noted that any awards greater than CDN$1.5
million are contingent on collection of funds. Further, given the modest caps (discussed
below) on the maximum awards available, the risk that the OSC Whistleblower Program
will pass costs onto issuers and investors is necessarily limited.

Section 25 of the Policy Document outlines the factors that ought to be considered by the
OSC in determining the award amount. Factors that may increase the amount of a
whistleblower award include: the timeliness of the report, the significance of the information
provided, the degree of assistance provided, the impact of the information on the
investigation/proceeding, efforts to remediate harm caused, whether the whistleblower
participated in internal compliance systems, unique hardships experienced by the

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

whistleblower, and contributions made to the OSC's mandate.328 Factors that may decrease
the amount of a whistleblower award include: any erroneous or incomplete information, the
whistleblower's culpability, any unreasonable delay in reporting, refusing to assist the OSC
or interfering with its investigation, and interfering with internal compliance mechanisms.329
This broad range of factors allows OSC staff to tailor whistleblower awards such that they
are appropriate in all of the circumstances of a particular case and justly compensate a
whistleblower who provides actionable information to the OSC.

The OSC Whistleblower Program range of 5% to 15% of imposed sanctions (and the
CDN$1.5 million cap if sanctions are not collected) is relatively low compared to the SEC
Whistleblower Program, which offers awards in the range of 10% to 30% of monetary
sanctions collected. While this higher range can be attributed, in part, to the requirement of
collection under the SEC regime, the OSC Whistleblower Program's financial incentives are
arguably relatively modest. Further, the caps on award amounts under the OSC
Whistleblower Program forestall excessively large payments being made, whereas the SEC
Whistleblower Program (which does not include an award cap) is structured in a way that
allows very large payments to be made in the event of a large financial penalty being
collected.330

      7.3.4 Anti-Reprisal Provisions

Upon and following the introduction of the OSC Whistleblower Program, the Securities Act
(Ontario) has been amended to introduce new anti-reprisal provisions for employees who
provide information or cooperate with the OSC or other specified regulatory bodies. Part
XXI.2 of the Securities Act consists of three major components: anti-reprisal protections,
contract voiding provisions, and actions relating to reprisal.

First, Part XXI.2 prohibits reprisals against employees by employers in certain
circumstances. Section 125.5(2) defines a reprisal, for the purposes of this Part, as "any
measure taken against an employee that adversely affects his or her employment." The
section further includes a non-exhaustive list of reprisals, including termination of
employment, demotion, disciplining, or suspending of an employee, imposition of penalties
on the employee, threat of any of the above reprisals, or intimidation or coercion of an
employee in relation to their employment.

The anti-reprisal provisions at ss. 121.5(1)-(2) protect employees who provide information
regarding potential violations of Ontario securities law, seek advice about providing such
information, or express an intention to provide such information. The information can refer
to activity that has occurred, is ongoing, or is "about to occur" and the employee's belief of
a violation must be reasonable. Further, these provisions are not limited to information
provided to the Commission itself, but also information provided to the employer, a law

enforcement agency, or a "recognized self-regulatory organization."331 In other words, the
reach of Part XXI.2 goes beyond participants in the OSC Whistleblower Program and
protects employees more generally from reprisals by their employers.

On July 21, 2020, the OSC announced that it had approved a settlement agreement in respect
of manners involving, inter alia, a reprisal against an internal whistleblower.332 The
settlement included a requirement that the company create an internal whistleblower
program:

          Additionally, Coinsquare and its subsidiary seeking registration with the
          OSC (Coinsquare Capital Markets Ltd.) must implement substantial
          corporate governance improvements. These include establishing
          independent boards of directors, appointing new CEOs and CCOs, creating
          an internal whistleblower program and implementing policies and
          procedures to monitor and assess compliance with Ontario securities law.

          "Despite several employees raising concerns about inflated trading
          volumes, Coinsquare not only stuck with the practice, but lied to investors
          about it and retaliated against a whistleblower," said Jeff Kehoe, Director of
          the Enforcement Branch at the OSC. "Being an innovator in our capital
          markets is not a free pass to disregard Ontario securities law. All market
          participants - including those in novel industries - must act honestly and
          responsibly."

          "This settlement holds the Respondents accountable for their misconduct
          and requires Coinsquare to implement significant changes to improve their
          corporate governance,["] added Mr. Kehoe. "This case is also an important
          milestone, as it is the first action we have taken for a reprisal against a
          whistleblower since important protections for employee whistleblowers
          were added to Ontario securities legislation in 2016." [emphasis added]333

The second major feature of Part XXI.2, the contract voiding provision, is found in section
121.5(3). This subsection dictates that a provision of an agreement (including confidentiality
agreements) between employers and employees is "void to the extent that it precludes or
purports to preclude" the employee from providing information, cooperating with, or

right to provide information regarding potential misconduct to regulatory bodies, including
the Commission. The specific inclusion of confidentiality agreements in this section
highlights a legislative commitment to prioritize the disclosure of information about
potential violations of securities law by employees.

Finally, ss. 121.5(4)-(7) concern actions relating to reprisal. Subsection 121.5(4) states that
where a person or company has taken a reprisal against an employee in contravention of
subsection (1), without limiting the actions the employee may otherwise take, the employee
may "(a) make a complaint to be dealt with by final and binding settlement by arbitration
under a collective agreement; or (b) if final and binding settlement by arbitration under a
collective agreement is not available, bring an action in the Superior Court of Justice."
Subsection (5) speaks to the burden of proof in such an action, which lies on the person or
company to establish that they did not take a reprisal against an employee. Subsection (6)
and (7) speak to remedies, which may be one or more of the employee's reinstatement or
"[p]ayment to the employee of two times the amount of remuneration the employee would
have been paid by the employer if the contravention had not taken place between the date
of the contravention and the date of the order, with interest."

      7.3.5 Future of Whistleblower Awards

In the first two years, the OSC Whistleblower Program generated about 200 tips and was
reported to be "very effective in generating tips and shining a light on information that
previously would have remained in the shadows."334 As discussed, the OSC Whistleblower
Program has paid out over CDN$8.6 million in awards. This includes CDN$7.5 million in
2019 and CDN$0.5 million in 2020.335 Given its first-in-the-nation status, the success of the
OSC program could potentially drive the expansion of paid whistleblower protection
regimes in Canada, both within the financial sector and beyond it.336

8. CONCLUSION: WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?

An overview of best practices in whistleblower protection and legislation in the US, UK, and
Canada prompts an important question: what constitutes "success" in whistleblower
protection? Best practices are a measure against which we may judge the scope and

336 It should be noted that the Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF), which regulates securities in
Quebec, also launched a whistleblowing program in 2016. The AMF's regime does not, however,
offer rewards to whistleblowers, citing "a review of various whistleblower programs around the
world, including in the United Kingdom and Australia," which did not convince the AMF of the
effectiveness of financial incentives. See Authorité des Marchés Financiers, Press Release, "AMF

comprehensiveness of legislation, but it is impossible to draw conclusions about the true
efficacy of whistleblower protection legislation without data on how the legislation is being
enforced. In this sense, best practices are of limited use in determining the effectiveness of
whistleblower protection, and enacting a law that reflects best practices on paper may not
accurately reflect whether whistleblowers are adequately protected in practice.

There is a critical need for research and analysis as to how the law is actually being
applied.337 This has been noted by critics such as David Lewis, AJ Brown, and Richard
Moberly, who call attention to academia's focus on the whistleblower as an individual rather
than on the institutional response to disclosure:

          The vast bulk of whistleblowing research to date has focused on
          whistleblowers: what makes them report, what they report, how many and
          how often whistleblowers come forward, and what happens to them. But to
          understand whistleblowing in context, and especially how whistleblowing
          can be made more effective, it must be recognized that whistleblower and
          non-whistleblower behavior, characteristics and outcomes are only one part
          of the puzzle. Increasingly important is the behavior of those who receive
          whistleblowing disclosures, and what they do about them. Indeed, while
          the study of whistleblower behavior and outcomes may remain a necessary
          and often fascinating focus, from a public policy perspective it is the
          response to disclosures which is actually the more important field of study
          - but which is in its relative infancy.338

Furthermore, the authors emphasize the need for research that will shed light on the extent
that whistleblower legislation is being effectively utilized:

          Most researchers, policy makers and managers know that legislation, in and
          of itself, is a blunt instrument for influencing organizational and behavioral
          change. The question of whether such legislative objectives are being
          implemented, or what strategies for whistleblower support and protection
          would be best supported and promoted by legal regimes, depends on
          knowledge of what actions are actually being taken by organizations and
          regulators to support whistleblowers in practice. Moreover, these questions
          depend on how whistleblowers are supported by managers and regulators
          in a proactive sense, once the disclosure is made, and not simply in reaction
          to any detrimental outcomes they may begin to suffer.339

"Successful" whistleblower laws will help to prevent and resolve wrongdoing by
encouraging those who witness wrongdoing to disclose information, while also protecting
whistleblowers from reprisals in any form. This is what whistleblower protection legislation
in the US, UK, and Canada purports to do; however, the words of the legislation alone

337 The 2017 Review, supra note 273 at 91, stated: "Concerning the role of statistics, the Committee is
of the view that meaningful and interpretable statistics should be produced with clear indicators to
monitor the effectiveness of the Act."

cannot give us a complete picture of the effectiveness of whistleblower protection in
these countries. Regular reviews of the legislation are required to determine the impact
that the laws have had on encouraging reporting and protecting whistleblowers.
Indeed, reviews conducted of Canada's PSDPA in 2017 and the UK's PIDA in 2020
indicate that the legislation, in both cases, is not fulfilling its potential or purpose.

One potential measure of success is the impact that whistleblower legislation has
on encouraging public sector employees who witness wrongdoing to disclose this
information. Research methods such as surveys can help us to understand how many
employees witness wrongdoing, and of these how many actually submit reports.
Changes in reporting rates may help us to evaluate the impact of legislation on
information disclosure. Such data has been collected in the US by the Merit Systems
Protection Board, discussed in Section 5.1. Another example of a large-scale survey was
conducted in Australia: it suggests that 71% of Australian public sector workers observed
one of the enumerated types of wrongdoing.340 Of those respondents who observed
wrongdoing, "[t]hose who reported the wrongdoing amounted to 39 per cent ... or 28
per cent of all respondents. As shown, almost all these respondents also regarded the
wrongdoing that they reported as being at least somewhat serious; very few said they
had reported matters they regarded as trivial."341 Similar survey data of Canadian public
sector employees might help to gauge awareness of the protections offered in the PSDPA
as well as rates of reporting among those who witness wrongdoing, and qualitative focus
group research conducted in 2015 is a good first step in this regard.342

Careful attention also needs to be paid to access to justice issues; that is, are the systems
that are being set up in the legislation actually protecting whistleblowers, and are they
accessible to those who have faced retaliation as a result of disclosing information? In
Canada, the track record of the Public Servants Disclosure Protection Tribunal is
ambiguous, at best, with regard to the success of the PSDPA in protecting
whistleblowers from reprisals. Of the only eight reprisal cases listed on the Tribunal
website, five were settled between the parties or through mediation. The Tribunal has
released two final decisions on the merits; neither found that reprisals had been taken
against the complainants in those cases. In the UK, as mentioned in Section 6, claims that
are adjudicated by the Employment Tribunals have a far from even chance of being
successful: "Over 70% [of claims made in PIDA's first ten years] ... were settled or
withdrawn without any public hearing. Of the remaining 30%, less than a quarter (22%)
won."343 Thus, settlements are common in both the UK and Canada. It is difficult to
assess whether the outcomes of these settlements represent successes or failures for the
whistleblowers who have faced reprisals; it may be, in fact, that public sector
employers readily accede to settlements where complainants have strong reprisal
cases. Therefore, more in-depth research is required to understand these outcomes and
what these numbers tell us regarding the efficacy of whistleblower protection laws.

Overall, while more and different types of research are needed to adequately evaluate
whistleblower protections, it is clear that there has been positive movement in the
recognition and protection of whistleblowers in the past fifteen to twenty years.
Internationally, agreements and conventions such as UNCAC place whistleblower
protection at the forefront of the global fight against corruption. In Canada, the PSDPA
represents the country's first legislative effort to protect federal public sector
whistleblowers, and a plethora of other laws have been introduced worldwide in response
to the global movement against corruption. In order to ensure that this global legislative
movement fulfills its potential, these laws must be utilized by whistleblowers and their
protections must be enforced by the relevant institutions and authorities.

1. INTRODUCTION

Campaigning for public office generally requires money. The amount of money required
depends on variables such as the size of the jurisdiction, the type of campaigning, the
resources deployed, jurisdictional spending limits, and the level of funding that other
candidates and/or parties have. While politicians and political parties across the spectrum
claim that they need large sums of money to run campaigns and reach voters, their claim
lacks evidence that such spending is necessary. While evidence shows that higher spending
sometimes correlates with electoral success,1 North American studies and analysis highlight
the difficulty of establishing a causal connection between campaign spending and electoral
success and whether other factors, such as being the incumbent candidate, have an equal or
greater influence on election outcomes.2

Election campaigns have become increasingly expensive.3 While campaigns at a local level
may be volunteer-run with little funding, national campaigns of political party leaders
necessitate significant spending. While some expenses, such as campaign and support staff,
travel and events, may be justified, others, such as surveys and broadcast advertising, may
be questionable. Media outlets often publish survey results during elections, some
jurisdictions offer free broadcasting time for party advertisements, and several studies show
that the advertising has only a small effect on voters.4 The use of instantaneous

communications has also reduced the costs of reaching voters, including the phenomenon
of political ads going viral on social media through a combination of sharing by the public
and media coverage.5

Despite conflicting views on the efficacy of campaign spending, scholars propose several
reasons for regulating and limiting campaign finance, including contributions and
spending. The need for cash produces various threats to democratic systems, the first being
corruption. Politicians may be inclined to reward wealthy campaign backers with favours,
influence, or access. Campaign finance also carries other implications for equality and
fairness. Unregulated financing may give well-resourced members of society
disproportionate influence over electoral debate, electoral outcomes, and elected officials. In
addition, without regulation, candidates and parties may face an unfair disadvantage if they
lack personal wealth or wealthy supporters. Finally, campaign financing can affect public
confidence in the integrity of government and policy-making. Cynicism creeps in when
politicians accept hefty donations or benefit from expensive campaign advertising funded
by corporations or wealthy individuals. Scandals involving political finance can further
erode public confidence.

Campaign finance laws can help address the risks of corruption, inequality, unfairness, and
public cynicism. Lawmakers may attempt to reduce these risks by promoting transparency,
reducing politicians' reliance on large donors, and encouraging the financing of campaigns
through small outlays from a wide range of individuals. Disclosure requirements,
contribution limits, and other measures may further these goals. For example, Canada's 2003
spate of campaign finance reform, which restricted donations from individuals,
corporations, unions, and other organizations, was likely an attempt to cushion the worst
impacts of the sponsorship scandal, which erupted after Quebec advertising firms, that had
donated to the federal Liberal Party, received lucrative government contracts in return for
little work.6 Public funding of election campaigns is another option. The US, UK, and
Canada each provide some form of partial public funding. Private fundraising, however,
remains indispensable to parties and candidates in all three countries.

Regulation generally targets not only parties and candidates but also third-party
campaigners. Third-party campaigners, whether individuals or organizations, fund their
own advertising and other activities in support of a candidate or party or issue that may or
may not be associated with a specific candidate or party. If parties and candidates are
regulated, and third parties are not, private money may shift to support unregulated third-
party groups. Even with full public funding of parties and candidates, the use of private

money in third-party campaigns would raise concerns in terms of effects on corruption and
equality of access and influence in election campaigns and policy-making.

Lawmakers face various stumbling blocks when designing campaign finance regimes.
Campaign finance laws may infringe constitutional guarantees, such as freedom of
expression, freedom of association, and voting rights. Courts may, however, be willing to
allow infringements of constitutional rights for the sake of equality, fairness, public
confidence, and the prevention of corruption. Lawmakers also must be careful not to enact
regulations that inadvertently favour incumbents by, for example, imposing spending limits
that disadvantage challengers.7 Other difficulties include anticipating loopholes and
defining the scope of regulated activities. Finally, lawmakers face the challenge of
determining how to apply old regulatory approaches to new digital campaigning
techniques.

Although the US, UK, and Canada impose transparency requirements for parties,
candidates, and third-party campaigners, they each take a different approach to the
regulation of campaign finance. In the US, freedom of speech jurisprudence has defeated
various pieces of the federal campaign finance regime, including spending caps. Caps on
contributions to candidates have survived (although they are very high compared to the
average annual income level), along with a ban on corporate and union donations. Although
transparency requirements in the US apply to parties, candidates, and third parties,
transparency is weak for some types of institutional third-party campaigners.8 The UK limits
spending, but political contributions are uncapped. Further, unlike in Canada, corporations,
labour unions, and other entities are permitted to make donations to parties and candidates.
Canada caps both contributions and spending at the federal level and in almost every
province and territory (although at relatively high levels compared to the average annual
income level). Corporations and other organizations are prohibited from making
contributions to parties and candidates in almost all Canadian jurisdictions. The federal
regime also provides extensive public funding to parties and candidates.

This chapter begins with a summary of how election campaigns are financed and how
campaign finance may be regulated. Next, rationales for campaign finance regulation and
the challenges involved in designing regulatory measures are set out, followed by a
discussion of the regulation of third-party campaigners. Subsequently, the provisions
directed at campaign financing in the United Nations Convention Against Corruption
(UNCAC) and OECD guidelines are summarized. Finally, the campaign finance laws in
Canada, the UK, and the US are examined in detail. For each country, the leading cases on
freedom of expression and campaign finance are summarized first, and then each country's
regulatory regime and common criticisms of those regimes are set out.

2. METHODS OF FINANCING ELECTION CAMPAIGNS

2.1 Direct Contributions or Loans to Candidates and Political Parties

Campaigns may be financed by direct contributions to candidates or political parties.
Contributions can take the form of cash, goods and services, or loans. In the US, if a political
party or third party coordinates spending with a candidate, this spending is viewed as a
contribution to the candidate.

2.2 Public Funding

The state may fund political parties and candidates through grants, funding that matches
donations, reimbursement of election expenses, tax deductions for donors, per-vote funding,
allocation of free or discounted broadcasting time, or other subsidies.

2.3 Independent Expenditures by Third Parties

Individuals and entities other than political parties and candidates may wish to fund
advertising and other initiatives to support or oppose the electoral success of a party or
candidate. This is referred to as third-party campaigning or outside spending. Individuals
and organizations may choose to contribute to a third-party campaigner instead of a
candidate or party. Third-party campaigners include individuals, corporations, labour
unions, non-profit interest groups, or other organizations, such as the ubiquitous political
action committee, or `PAC,' in the US. Third-party campaign activities sometimes expressly
support or oppose a candidate or party. In other instances, third parties advertise about an
issue associated with a candidate or political party, often termed `issue advertising.' Third-
party campaigning can be entirely independent of parties and candidates, or third parties
may work "in the shadow of political parties" or "in close concert with them."9

2.4 Self-Funding

Wealthy candidates for public office may wish to finance their own campaigns with personal
resources. Canada imposes limits on candidate self-funding,10 but jurisprudence on freedom
of speech precludes such limits in the US.11

3. TYPES OF CAMPAIGN FINANCE REGULATION

This section describes the tools used to regulate campaign finance. The regulatory
approaches summarized below are often applied not only to general elections, but also to
nomination contests, leadership campaigns, and referendums.

Campaign finance regulation should be complemented by other laws promoting integrity
in politics, such as rules on lobbying, conflict of interest, and whistleblower protection.12
Without these rules, the improper influence of money could simply be redirected from
campaign finance to other activities like lobbying.13

3.1 Transparency Requirements

Justice Brandeis wrote in 1913 that "[s]unlight is said to be the best of disinfectants; electric
light the most efficient policeman."14 Campaign finance regimes often attempt to prevent
corruption through the disclosure of political contributions and spending. Disclosure may
discourage large donations and deter politicians from rewarding donors or supportive
third-party campaigners with favours.15 Disclosure of contributions and third-party
spending, if made before election day (which many jurisdictions do not require), can also
help facilitate informed voting, as awareness of the "interested money behind a candidate
may give voters insight into what interests the candidate will promote if elected."16 Critics
of disclosure requirements argue that revealing the identity of donors represents an
unacceptable incursion on donors' privacy interests.17

3.2 Spending and Contribution Limits

Campaign finance regimes may attempt to curb demand for political money by imposing
ceilings on spending by candidates, political parties, and third parties. The supply of
political money can be limited by imposing ceilings on donations. Donation caps can help
address corruption and equality concerns by encouraging candidates, parties, and third-
party campaigners to seek small donations from a broad range of donors.

3.3 Public Funding

Some campaign finance regimes provide public funding to political parties and candidates.
Public funding is intended to dilute the influence of wealthy supporters and level the
playing field for small or new parties.18 However, legislation sometimes favours large
parties and incumbents by calibrating funding to electoral performance.19 Public funding
also compensates for falling party incomes and increasing campaign costs,20 which have
skyrocketed due to expensive mass media techniques and the professionalization of
parties.21 Meanwhile, revenues are declining because of falling party membership.22 Public
funding, in the form of an annual subsidy based on the votes received during the previous
election, can supplement a party's annual income, even if public support and donations
decrease.

Another means of reducing reliance on large donations is to allocate free broadcasting time
to political parties and candidates. For example, the UK has imposed a blanket ban on paid
political advertising on television and radio and provides free airtime to political parties
during elections.23 The scheme aims to reduce demand for money during election
campaigns, level the playing field between competitors, and prevent distortion of electoral
debate by the wealthy.24 The question remains whether such measures are becoming
irrelevant in the age of digital campaigning.

Opponents of public funding argue that taxpayers should not be forced to fund parties with
whom they disagree.25 They also point out that public funding of political parties diminishes
their participatory character by replacing "labour and fund-raising efforts once provided by
party members and interested citizens."26

18 van Biezen, supra note 3 at 200-201.
19 For example, in Figueroa v Canada (Attorney General), 2003 SCC 37, the Supreme Court of Canada
struck down a law stipulating that parties must endorse at least fifty candidates in a general election
to access public funding. In the Court's view, this requirement was an unjustifiable infringement of
the right to vote in section 3 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms because as the Court noted at para
54, it "exacerbates a pre-existing disparity in the capacity of the various political parties to
communicate their positions to the general public." The Court emphasized at para 39 that all parties
have something meaningful to contribute to electoral debate, not simply those who are a "genuine
`government option.'" This set the stage for a later ruling by the Court concluding at para 91 that
thresholds for some benefits that parties receive from the state were constitutional. Four years later,
in Longley v Canada (Attorney General), 2007 ONCA 852, the Ontario Court of Appeal ruled at para 54
that it was constitutionally justifiable to have a legal threshold that required political parties, in order
to receive annual per-vote public funding, be supported by two percent of the total number of valid
votes cast in the previous election or five percent of the votes cast in the districts in which the party
ran candidates.

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

4. RATIONALES FOR CAMPAIGN FINANCE REGULATION

4.1 Corruption and the Appearance of Corruption

If an individual or entity spends large sums supporting a politician's election campaign, the
politician may feel obliged to repay the favour. Corruption could come in the form of quid
pro quos, such as the provision of contracts, licenses, or tax breaks in exchange for large
political donations.27 Campaign financing may also produce more subtle yet pernicious
forms of corruption. First, politicians often provide wealthy backers with special access.28 As
noted by the dissenting justices in Citizens United v Federal Election Commission (Citizens
United), access is a precondition for influence in the legislative process.29 Privileged access
may also lead to public cynicism. Second, monetary support for a candidate's campaign
could taint the candidate's judgment once elected and give wealthy supporters undue
influence over lawmakers. There are many opportunities for influence and distortion
throughout the legislative process, starting with the decision to introduce bills or
amendments in the first place.30 Samuel Issacharoff observes that, after the election,
lawmakers may be influenced by gratitude to large donors and a desire to secure "future
support in order to retain the perquisites of office."31 This can produce a kind of
"clientelism," in which private interests capture the powers of the state and obtain
"legislation in the private interest."32 Yet the subtlety of such influence may allow politicians
to "feel as if nothing improper has occurred."33 Aside from effective governance issues, the
potential for the wealthy to exert undue influence on the legislative process raises obvious
equality concerns.34

It may be impossible to separate the influence of large donors and supportive third-party
campaigners over lawmakers from the influence of principles, constituents, and other
factors.35 An example of this difficulty is provided by McCormick v United States (McCormick),
in which the US Supreme Court overturned an elected official's conviction for corruption

and struck down the law criminalizing the conduct.36 The defendant politician had a long-
standing reputation for favouring legislation beneficial to foreign doctors. The defendant
was charged with corruption after accepting money from foreign doctors for his election
campaign and subsequently sponsored legislation favourable to them. Because this was not
a clear quid pro quo, the Court held that the defendant's actions did not constitute corruption.
Dembitskiy criticizes this decision for its failure to address the appearance of corruption,
which may be present even where an elected official is guided by their own principles, not
their donors.37

Publicly funded election campaigns help address the risk of corruption, but comprehensive
public funding requires public support and political will. If election campaigns continue to
be financed wholly or partly through private funds, many argue that corruption can be
reduced by encouraging smaller donations from more sources.38 This approach also accords
with the argument that contributions are a valid form of participation in electoral debate.39
In the US, micro-donations have become increasingly important in elections.40 For example,
President Trump raised as much from small donors (contributing $200 or less) as Clinton
and Sanders combined.41 Ninety-nine percent of the $229 million raised by Sanders came
from individual donors.42 In 2008, 38% of contributions to major party candidates seeking
nomination came from micro-donors, compared to 25% in 2000.43 From the perspective of
corruption, fairness, equality, and public confidence, this trend is promising. On the other
hand, some point out that reliance on small individual donations could lead politicians to
cater to groups of small donors on the fringes, as opposed to cultivating the electoral support
of voters who are more centrist but unlikely to make a donation.44

The prevention of corruption is accepted by courts in the US, UK, and Canada as a legitimate
justification for the burdens on freedom of expression involved in campaign finance

38 Issacharoff, supra note 31 at 118, 137. Quebec's financement populaire embodies this approach. At
both the provincial and municipal levels, campaign finance scandals have led to the imposition of
low contribution caps in the hopes of achieving the "popular financing" of political parties; the
scheme is supplemented by public funding: see Maxime Pelletier, "Municipal Political Reform in
Quebec: The Myth of `Popular Finance'" (2014) 43 J Eastern Township Stud 63. Pelletier observes that
only a small percentage of voters in Quebec make political contributions and suggests that popular
finance will remain a pipe dream if few citizens are interested in donating money to parties and
candidates.

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

regulation. The US Supreme Court has further held that preventing corruption or the
appearance of corruption is the only possible justification for the limits on political speech
caused by contribution limits, spending limits, and other campaign finance laws. However,
judicial definitions of corruption vary. The majority of the US Supreme Court has defined
corruption narrowly to include only direct quid pro quo exchanges, not undue influence and
access. However, direct quid pro quos are almost impossible to prove and are already
captured by bribery laws.45 The dissenting judges of the US Supreme Court in Citizens United
argued in favour of viewing corruption as a "spectrum," noting that "the difference between
selling a vote and selling access is a matter of degree, not kind."46

Even under a broader conception of corruption, the anti-corruption rationale for campaign
finance regulation fails, according to US courts, to justify some types of regulation.47 For
example, the majority of the US Supreme Court views the anti-corruption rationale as
insufficient to justify restrictions on independent third-party expenditures, as the lack of
coordination between the third party and the candidate reduces the value of the expenditure
to the candidate, therefore reducing the risk of quid pro quo exchanges.48 However, others
argue that the absence of coordination does not prevent candidates from feeling grateful to
third parties who have spent vast sums supporting their candidacies or from wishing to
maintain their support for future elections.49

4.2 Equality, Fairness, and Participation

Campaign finance regulations are sometimes motivated by the desire to promote equality
and fairness in the electoral system. This egalitarian model of campaign finance can be
contrasted with the libertarian model. The libertarian model responds to fears that "a
regulated marketplace of ideas may result in the entrenchment of the powerful."50 The
egalitarian model responds to concerns that "an unregulated marketplace of ideas may
result in the entrenchment of the wealthy."51 The Supreme Court of Canada has accepted
the egalitarian model of campaign finance as a valid legislative choice.52 The majority of the
US Supreme Court has settled on the libertarian model.53

Various goals are tied to the equality and fairness rationale. First, many argue that campaign
finance must be regulated to prevent the wealthy from drowning out other speakers and
setting the issue agenda of electoral debate.54 Otherwise, under-resourced viewpoints will
be lost, and under-resourced citizens will be barred from meaningful participation in debate.

Defenders HL), Lord Bingham pointed out that, if "the playing field of debate" is not level,
views "may come to be accepted by the public not because they are shown in public debate
to be right but because, by dint of constant repetition, the public have been conditioned to
accept them."55 The Supreme Court of Canada has similarly emphasized that "[t]o ensure a
right of equal participation in democratic government, laws limiting spending are needed
to ... ensure that one person's exercise of the freedom to spend does not hinder the
communication opportunities of others."56

Second, many argue that unregulated campaign finance allows the wealthy to
disproportionately impact electoral outcomes.57 This is sometimes seen as a form of
corruption, but a corruption of voters and the electoral system rather than elected officials.58
Third, as discussed above, in the context of the anti-corruption rationale, campaign finance
regulation seeks to ensure the wealthy do not have disproportionate influence over policy
outcomes after the election. Finally, the equality and fairness rationale calls for regulation to
level the playing field for parties and candidates. Unregulated campaigns may give
candidates with personal wealth or wealthy supporters an unfair advantage. For example,
in the US, the so-called "wealth primary" can screen out candidates with insufficient
financial heft, which bodes poorly for racial and gender diversity in public office.59

In attempting to ensure the wealthy do not wield disproportionate influence over debate,
electoral outcomes, and post-election policy, the egalitarian model responds to concerns that
wealthy donors and third-party campaigners are unrepresentative of wider society. In the
US, studies have found the donor class to be "underrepresentative of most Americans."60
Most donors are "wealthier and older than average Americans, and they are more likely to
be white and male than the general population."61 Martin Gilen and Benjamin Page found
that the policy preferences of wealthy donors differ from non-donors and people of colour.62
For example, an American study in 2016 found that 44% of donors giving $5,000 or more
supported the Affordable Care Act, compared to 53% of American adults. Likewise, 39% of
donors contributing $1,000 or more supported the Waxman-Markey clean energy bill,
compared to 63% of non-donors.63 Even if the policy preferences of the wealthy sometimes

align with those of the general public, John Sarbanes and Raymond O'Mara argue we should
not be distracted from the problematic nature of the outsized impact of the wealthy in policy
outcomes.64

4.3 Informed Voting

Campaign finance regulation is often touted as a means of facilitating informed voting.
Measures such as spending and contribution caps prevent well-resourced speakers from
drowning out other speakers, thus making space for the effective dissemination of more
information and viewpoints. Courts in Canada and Europe have upheld campaign finance
regulations on the basis of the informed voting rationale. They interpret constitutional
voting rights to include the right to an informed vote.65 On the other hand, others argue that
informed voting is better served by relaxing campaign finance and allowing unfettered
dissemination of information. For example, the majority of the US Supreme Court views
spending restrictions as a dangerous limitation on the quantity of information accessible to
voters.66

4.4 Public Confidence

Various studies in the US, UK, and Canada show falling public confidence in the electoral
system, risking the "decay of civic engagement."67 In a UK study by Jennifer vanHeerde-
Hudson and Justin Fisher, public opinion was characterized by the perception that "there is
just `too much money' in politics"68 and the belief that wealthy donors have undue influence
over politicians. In a 2012 survey in the US, 77% of respondents thought members of
Congress were more likely to act in the interests of those who spent money supporting their
election campaigns than they were to act in the public interest.69 A 2014 poll indicated that
three in four American voters think wealthy individuals have a better shot at influencing
elections than the rest of the population has.70 In Canada, after decades of corruption
scandals at several levels of government, a national survey of 1,513 adult Canadians,
released in October 2015, found that: 44% somewhat agreed and 19% completely agreed that
"politics has a tendency to corrupt otherwise honest people"; 36% somewhat agreed and
15% strongly agreed with the statement that they would vote for a party that they didn't
really support if the politician or party they support acted unethically; and 14% somewhat

agreed and 4% strongly agreed with the statement that political corruption had led them to
stop voting.71

Arguments in favour of stricter campaign finance regulation often raise the issue of voter
confidence. For example, in Canada v Somerville (Somerville), the government argued that
third-party spending limits are necessary to prevent the perception that lawmakers are more
accountable to their wealthy supporters than their electors.72 In Harper v Canada (Harper), the
Supreme Court of Canada cited public confidence as a permissible justification for third-
party spending limits and their limits on freedom of expression.73 The US Supreme Court
also accepts that the government may limit free speech to prevent the appearance of
corruption, but the majority defines corruption narrowly to include only direct quid pro quo
exchanges.74

4.5 Other Rationales

Campaign fundraising is time-consuming for politicians. Limits on campaign spending may
reduce the time politicians spend on fundraising, allowing them to focus on policy
development and other valuable functions.75 In addition, some argue that unrestrained
campaign spending compromises the quality of public debate. For example, Ronald
Dworkin argues that if electoral debate is simply a free-for-all, discourse may "be so
cheapened as to altogether lose its democratic character."76 Similarly, the Neill Committee
in the UK justified a ban on paid political advertising on broadcast media by pointing to the
undesirability of a "continuous barrage of party political propaganda."77

5. CHALLENGES IN REGULATING CAMPAIGN FINANCE

5.1 Freedom of Expression and Association

Campaign finance regulation often entails limits on freedom of expression. As the US
Supreme Court remarked in Buckley v Valeo (Buckley), "virtually every type of
communication in a modern mass democracy is dependent on expenditure."78 Limiting

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

spending and fundraising therefore limits the "quantity of expression."79 Further, campaign
finance regulations impact political speech, which enjoys a preferred position under US law
and stronger protection under the European Convention on Human Rights.80 Some
regulations also hinder freedom of association by preventing individuals from freely
pooling their resources to finance a political message. Governments attempting to restrict
spending, fundraising, broadcasting, and other aspects of election campaigns must therefore
show that restrictions are a justified infringement of freedom of expression and association.

As Dworkin observes, critics of campaign finance regulation view any restriction of political
speech as harmful to democracy, even if that restriction is aimed at enhancing the quality of
democracy.81 These critics focus on the danger posed by government, rather than the
wealthy, to democracy and individual freedom. The majority of the US Supreme Court
follows this libertarian approach to freedom of speech. In McCutcheon v Federal Election
Commission, for example, Chief Justice Roberts maintained that the government cannot be
trusted to judge the value of certain speech over other speech, "even when the government
purports to act through legislation reflecting `collective speech.'"82

Dworkin dismisses this libertarian model as "prophylactic overkill."83 Under Dworkin's
"partnership" model of democracy, citizens participate in elections not only by voting, but
by attempting to influence the opinions of others.84 Dworkin argues that citizens who lose
must be "satisfied that they had a chance to convince others ... not merely that they have
been outnumbered."85 However, if the "admission price" to political debate is too high,
citizens will be denied, based on wealth, the opportunity to make persuasive efforts, "a
circumstance ... remote from the substance of opinion or argument."86

Many commentators agree with Dworkin, that campaign finance regulation can be a
justified limit on freedom of speech. Some proponents of campaign finance reform go
further, arguing that restrictions on spending and fundraising, for example, may actually
enhance free speech values. Restrictions may prevent the wealthy from drowning out other
speakers and thus facilitate the dissemination of a wider range of perspectives. In this vein,
Owen Fiss argues that the state can be "a friend of speech," not just its enemy.87 According
to Fiss, free speech should protect not only individual self-expression but also popular

money spent in politics, that the rich can now have in the United States." In this sense, the campaign
finance laws struck down by the US Supreme Court do not victimize anyone, as Dworkin notes, they
do not make anyone's position "worse, with respect to the liberty in question, than it would most
likely have been in a defensible distribution."

sovereignty.88 To accomplish this, "the state may have to act to further the robustness of
public debate in circumstances where powers outside the state are stifling speech."89

5.2 Entrenching Incumbents and Differential Impacts on Political

       Parties

Campaign finance regulations tend to have disproportionate impacts on different parties
and candidates. These impacts may be unintended. For example, in Canada, the federal
Liberal Party introduced campaign finance measures, which ultimately turned out most
favourable to the Conservative Party.90 In other instances, partisan finagling may be at work.
Raymond La Raja argues that the design of campaign finance regulation can often "be tied to
partisan strategies for influencing the value of one faction's resources relative to one's
rivals."91

Most concerning is the potential for campaign finance regulation that favours incumbents.92
For example, ceilings on candidate spending may give incumbents an advantage because
they already have publicity.93 As a result, critics argue that spending caps "limit competition
and undemocratically serve to preserve the status quo."94 Such arguments are particularly
salient in the US, where "elections are candidate-centered and big campaigns are sometimes
needed to blast out incumbents."95

Campaign finance regulations may also have differential impacts depending on the ideology
and fundraising methods of different political parties. For example, in the UK, restrictions
on donations from labour unions would clearly disadvantage the Labour Party. In Canada,
scholars pointed out that for years after they were established, "contribution limits have
created a persistent funding advantage for the federal Conservative Party"96 as it had greater
success gathering many small donations from individuals. Because party expenditure is also
limited, the Conservative Party often has money left over to spend on attack ads between
elections.97 The federal New Democratic Party, on the other hand, faced a greater
disadvantage than the Liberals and Conservatives after the erosion of public funding in
Canada in 2014, since the New Democrats derived a larger portion of their income from the
public funding regime.98

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

5.3 Loopholes

Loopholes are another challenge in crafting effective campaign finance regimes. The goals
of ameliorating corruption, unfairness, and inequality will be subverted if donors simply
find new ways to funnel money to politicians. Issacharoff points out that "the perverse
`hydraulic' of money finding its outlet" has caused many attempts at campaign finance
reform to "backfire."99 For example, after Congress tightened regulations governing party
fundraising and spending in the US in 2002,100 spending by third-party campaigners
jumped, suggesting that money was simply redirected to a new outlet.101 Even if campaign
finance regulations are skillfully designed to minimize these shifts, prospective donors may
direct money to other activities like lobbying to achieve their ends.102

5.4 Circumscribing the Scope of Regulated Activities

Another difficulty in designing campaign finance regulations is drawing the line between
regulated and unregulated activities. Distinguishing between election activities and general
political activities can be difficult, and entities and individuals will always try to fall on the
unregulated side of the line.103 Third parties might attempt to split costs between election-
related spending and general expenses to avoid hitting the thresholds for regulatory
requirements.104 In addition, it may be unclear whether an advertisement on a contentious
political issue during an election aims to improve the chances of a particular political party
or is merely part of general political debate. Responding to this difficulty, Eric Barendt has
argued that the Supreme Court of Canada's willingness to allow third-party spending
limits105 is based on the incorrect assumption that "a sensible line can be drawn between
campaign expenditure on the one hand and expenditure on general political and social
discussion"106 on the other.

Lawmakers may also encounter difficulty in drawing the line between regulated and
unregulated time periods. Campaign finance regulation often kicks in when an election
begins. However, because election campaigning has become more or less permanent, some
commentators argue that lawmakers should approach political finance as a whole rather
than focusing on campaign finance alone.107 Further, contemporary digital campaigning
techniques have shifted the timing of expenses. Many costly activities, such as forming
databases of voters, occur before the election period begins, allowing expenses for these

activities to slip through the regulatory net.108 On the other hand, an overly broad cap on
general party expenditures could impact valuable activities such as policy development.109

5.5 New Campaigning Techniques

The next challenge in campaign finance is the application of old regulatory regimes to new
methods of campaigning. Traditionally, campaign finance regulation is designed with
media like television and radio in mind. However, campaigns are increasingly reliant on
digital techniques like "micro-targeting," which involves using data purchased from data
companies to predict how particular voters might feel about certain issues and targeting
small groups of voters with tailored advertisements.110 Existing regulatory frameworks may
be ill-suited to these new techniques. For example, spending caps may be undermined by
the difficulty of tracking online and social media expenses.111 Further, as discussed in Section
5.4, some activities involved in digital campaigning may take place before the election period
begins, allowing expenses for these activities to escape unregulated.112

6. REGULATION OF THIRD-PARTY CAMPAIGNERS

6.1 The Role of Third-Party Campaigners

In this section the proper role of third-party campaigners in elections is debated. On one
hand, third parties may provide helpful perspectives and additional information not offered
by parties and candidates. As the Alberta Court of Appeal observed in Somerville:

          The citizenry looks to its community, political and religious leaders, and
          interest groups for input. Voters want the benefit of the independent advice
          and information on candidates and parties from others with similar
          ideologies and without the self interest involved in candidate and party
          advertising.113

The Alberta Court of Appeal noted further that, without third-party campaigners, voters
would only receive the information politicians and the media choose to disseminate.114 This
is particularly problematic in relation to issues avoided by political parties as "non-winners"
since their positions on such issues are "critical to the voter."115 The dissent in Harper echoed
these points, arguing that deliberative democracy necessitates giving a voice to unpopular

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

views avoided by political parties or candidates.116 In this conception of elections, "parties
and third parties are on an equal footing" and third party "voices are seen to be in the
interests of either open deliberation or competitive pluralism."117

On the other hand, many commentators argue that political parties and candidates should
be the primary players in elections, rather than unaccountable third-party groups with
narrow interests.118 The Royal Commission on Electoral Reform and Party Financing (the
Canadian Lortie Commission) summarized this argument:

          Parties remain the primary political organizations for recruiting and
          selecting candidates for election to the House of Commons, for organizing
          the processes of responsible parliamentary government, and for
          formulating policy that accommodates and reconciles competing regional
          and socio-economic interests. As legitimate as interest groups are in a free
          and democratic society, by their nature they cannot perform these crucial
          functions.... It is therefore imperative that electoral reform address the
          fundamental objective of strengthening political parties as primary political
          organizations.119

In addition, since third-party organizations, such as corporations, do not have the right to
vote, some argue they should be barred "from exercising an undue voice within the electoral
process."120

The growth of outside spending, suggest some commentators, can deteriorate the centrality
of candidates and political parties in campaigns. Diana Dwyre argues that this deterioration
is "detrimental to the overall health of American representative democracy" that can lead to
a "democratic deficit"121 and a disenchanted electorate. Parties "link voters to lawmakers"
and provide an "accountability mechanism."122 They also give voters an idea of what to
expect from candidates.123

6.2 Reinforcing other Campaign Finance Controls

Third-party campaign regulations may help ensure the effectiveness of regulations
governing parties and candidates. If party and candidate spending is limited without
corresponding limits on third-party spending, parties and candidates may be forced to use
their limited spending capacity to "fend off attacks" by third parties rather than advertising

their policy positions.124 The regulation of third parties also prevents circumvention of
regulations governing spending, contributions, and transparency for candidates and
political parties. A failure to regulate third parties could produce a "waterbed effect" in
which front groups are "used to channel spending for parties and candidates."125 Anika
Gauja and Graeme Orr add that third-party regulations must prevent organizations from
proliferating to circumvent spending caps.126

6.3 Freedom of Speech

Third-party spending caps raise particularly potent freedom of expression concerns. Their
constitutional validity is therefore controversial. As noted by the Alberta Court of Appeal in
Somerville, limits on third-party spending "purport ... to protect the democratic process, by
means of infringing the very rights which are fundamental to a democracy."127

Third-party spending limits have survived freedom of expression challenges in Canada and
the UK. However, in the US, caps on independent third-party expenditures have been struck
down as an unjustifiable limit on freedom of speech.128 Freedom of expression and third-
party spending limits are discussed further below in the context of the Canadian cases of
Somerville,129 Libman v Quebec,130 and Harper;131 the British case of Bowman v the United
Kingdom;132 and the American cases of Buckley,133 Austin v Michigan Chamber of Commerce,134
McConnell v Federal Election Commission,135 Citizens United,136 and SpeechNow.org v Federal
Election Commission.137

6.4 Spending and Corruption

A lack of consensus persists regarding the extent to which independent third-party
campaigning entails a risk of corruption. Many argue that politicians may be inclined to
reward third parties who fund advertising to support their campaigns, even if the third
parties act independently. However, American courts, assisted in this conclusion by a
narrow definition of corruption, have concluded that independent third-party campaign

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

expenditures entail no significant risk of corruption or the appearance of corruption. This
debate is summarized in Section 8.3.

6.5 Institutional Third Parties

Institutional campaign spending may carry different implications for the quality of
democracy depending on the type of institution in question. Jacob Rowbottom points out
that "some institutions can be an important vehicle for participation.... Other institutions,
however, may act as a conduit for wealthy individuals and organisations."138 In some cases,
the difference between an individual donation and an institutional donation may be
meaningless, as when an individual controls the institution and lacks accountability to
members.139 For example, Robert Boatright notes that some interest groups in the US have a
small membership to whom they are accountable, making them look more like for-profit
corporations than vehicles for "representing citizens' views to politicians."140 In other cases,
institutional spending results from the "pooling of resources among lots of people,"141 which
reduces both corruption and equality concerns. This type of institutional spending is also a
means of enhancing the effectiveness of small donations.142 Some institutions may also
require "internal debate" before making political expenditures, contributing to the
deliberative process.143

Blanket prohibitions or caps on institutional political spending may close off healthy
"channels for participation."144 Rowbottom argues that the design of campaigning controls
for institutions should not be based on their status as corporations, unions, or
unincorporated associations, but rather on the "democratic credentials of the institution"145
and its ability to provide an effective channel for citizen participation.

      6.5.1 Corporations

For-profit corporations are an example of an institution in which members have little
influence over political spending. Rowbottom points out that "since a company does not
represent its shareholders (or anyone else) and has its own legal identity ... it may be
questioned why companies are legally permissible donors at all."146 A corporation's money

level in Canada and are also prohibited from making contributions to candidates at the federal level
in the US: see Sections 8.2.2 and 10.2(b). Corporations may, however, engage in third-party
campaigning in Canada and the US. For an opposing view on the role of corporations in elections,
see the judgement of Kennedy J in Citizens United, supra note 29. At 364, Kennedy J maintained that
"[o]n certain topics, corporations may possess valuable expertise, leaving them the best

is not the property of the shareholders. If a company makes a political donation or
expenditure at odds with the views of a shareholder, the shareholder's only recourse may
be, if they hold a small minority of shares, to sell their shares.147 As noted by the dissent in
the American case of Citizens United, corporate communications are "at least one degree
removed from the views of individual citizens, and ... may not even reflect the views of
those who pay for it."148 If a corporation is closely held or has a controlling shareholder,
donations from the corporation could be viewed by candidates and by the public as
donations from the controlling individual, raising issues related to corruption and public
confidence.149 Directors are somewhat restrained when directing money to political
purposes by their duty to further the company's interests, but this restraint is vaguely
defined and therefore not very effective.150

In the UK, companies are required to obtain a member resolution authorizing any political
donations or expenditures in advance.151 However, the resolution "must be expressed in
general terms ... and must not purport to authorize particular donations or expenditure."152
Further, the resolution will have effect for four years.153 As a result, this mechanism does
little to promote accountability or attenuate the control of the company's management over
political spending.

In contrast to for-profit corporations, incorporated interest groups could be a healthy means
of participation for small donors wishing to act collectively. Individuals contribute money
to the group because of its political agenda, as opposed to for-profit corporations, in which
the company's political activities have nothing to do with investor support.154 Thus, as
Rowbottom points out, corporate status "says little about whether donations should be
permissible or capped."155

Issacharoff maintains that for-profit corporations in the US lack the desire and ability to
overwhelm elections.156 Studies indicate that corporate spending is low compared to other
third-party spending in the US.157 Further, after a US Supreme Court decision struck down
restrictions on corporate electioneering, there was no explosion in corporate spending.158
Rather, money has come primarily from wealthy individuals.159 Issacharoff explains this
phenomenon by pointing out that corporations are probably unwilling to risk a backlash by
supporting candidates with controversial positions.160 For example, Target faced a boycott

equipped to point out errors or fallacies in speech of all sorts."

in 2010 after contributing to a candidate that opposed same-sex marriage.161 Issacharoff
argues that for-profit corporations are more likely to direct their money towards lobbying,
which is more effective and discreet.162

      6.5.2 Labour Unions

Labour unions163 are often grouped with corporations in discussions of campaign finance.
For example, the dissenting justices of the US Supreme Court in Citizens United discussed
corporations and unions together, stating that both represent "narrow interests."164
However, political spending by labour unions arguably differs from political spending by
for-profit corporations in regards to its implications for corruption and equality. Ewing,
commenting in the UK context, points out that "the trade union model of party funding is
one that involves millions of people of modest means making a small annual contribution
to sustain the political process."165 In Ewing's view, "[t]his is precisely what we should be
trying to encourage."166 Rowbottom adds that unions often have some form of "internal
democracy," such as requirements for internal debate on proposed political spending and
measures to promote the accountability of union leaders.167 For these reasons, Rowbottom
argues that union spending is not problematic from the perspective of equality.168
Nevertheless, unions are the most heavily regulated donors in the UK.169 In contrast to the
thin shareholder resolution requirement for UK corporations, unions in the UK must ballot
their members to establish a separate political fund for any political spending.170 Individual
members must then opt in to payments into the fund.171

6.6 Incidence of Third-Party Electioneering in Canada and the UK

Gauja and Orr argue that "there is relatively little demand for `big money' third-party
campaigning in parliamentary democracies," especially those, like Canada and the UK, that
are "culturally, rather than legally driven,"172 to accept limits on third-party spending. In the
UK, third parties rarely approach their spending limits, although this could be partly due to
gaps in reporting requirements or cost splitting by third parties.173 Similarly, third parties in
Canada have not generally reached their spending limits.174 Colin Feasby argues that third

parties in Canada, up until 2012, have shown little "appetite ... for big money campaigns,"
while the "lack of co-ordination between third parties suggests that third parties are not
affecting electoral fortunes on a national level."175 In Canada's 2008 federal general election,
while political parties spent over CDN$58 million, third-party spending was relatively
negligible at just under CDN$1.5 million.176 In the 2015 federal general election, 104 third
parties collectively spent over CDN$6 million on election advertising, but spending limits
were much higher in 2015 because of the unusually long campaign.177 Lawlor and Crandall
add that third parties are probably not used to circumventing party and candidate
contribution limits.178 Based on these observations, they argue that third-party spending
restrictions in Canada seem "to be a preventative rather than a responsive approach."179

However, Canada's 1988 federal general election suggests that third-party spending limits
could play a significant role in elections in which a single issue dominates, although such
elections are rare in Canada.180 The 1988 election, during which third-party spending was
unlimited, was essentially reduced to a referendum on free trade.181 Most of the CDN$4.7
million spent by third-party campaigners was directed toward the free trade issue and four
times more money went toward promoting free trade than opposing it.182 This indirectly
supported the ultimately successful Progressive Conservative Party, which campaigned on
a platform supporting free trade. As the Supreme Court of Canada noted in Libman v Quebec
(Libman), "[t]he 1988 federal election showed clearly how independent spending could
influence the outcome of voting."183

7.2 OECD

The OECD's Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises advise companies to follow local law on
political contributions, stating that "enterprises should ... [n]ot make illegal contributions to
candidates for public office or to political parties or other political organizations. Political
contributions should fully comply with public disclosure requirements and should be
reported to senior management."185 Political financing is also mentioned in the
Recommendation for Further Combating Bribery, which recommends that companies develop
measures to prevent bribery in a range of areas, including "political contributions."186

The OECD is showing an increased interest in campaign finance and its consequences for
integrity in government. This interest is demonstrated in its 2016 report, Financing
Democracy: Funding of Political Parties and Election Campaigns and the Risk of Policy Capture.187
The report outlines a recommended policy framework with four "pillars." First, policy-
makers should encourage transparency and accountability through "[c]omprehensive
disclosure of income sources of political parties and candidates" and "user-friendly"188
organization of disclosed information. Second, policy-makers should promote a level
playing field through measures such as public funding, spending limits, bans on certain
types of private contributions (e.g., contributions from corporations, unions, and other
organizations), and rules to limit abuse of state resources.189 Third, policy-makers should
foster a culture of integrity by developing rules in areas like conflict of interest and
whistleblower protection.190 Standards of integrity for private donors are also important in
creating a culture of integrity.191 Finally, policy-makers should encourage regular review of
campaign finance regimes and ensure compliance through dissuasive sanctions,
independent oversight, and the provision of support to political parties to assist in
compliance.192

       CHAPTER 14 CAMPAIGN FINANCE

8. US

In the US, freedom of speech jurisprudence has led to the demise of various campaign
finance regulatory measures.193 Commenting on this deregulatory bent, Boatright observes
that the US "begins from a different place"194 compared to some other countries when it
comes to the regulation of campaign finance. This "different place" involves a long-standing
reluctance to regulate campaign finance and the recognition of third-party campaigner
organizations as an integral part of the electoral process.195 Despite these cultural tendencies
and the American courts' fierce protection of freedom of speech, limits and source
restrictions on political contributions and transparency requirements for political spending
have survived. However, it should be noted that the amount limits on contributions, ranging
from $2,900 up to $109,500 in 2021, are high compared to the average annual income in the
US.196 Further, transparency requirements for some types of third parties are weak, allowing
political money to be funnelled through non-transparent organizations.197

The next section focuses on the interaction between free speech and campaign finance
regulation, followed by a brief overview of the federal regulatory scheme in the US.

8.1 Constitutional Rights and Campaign Finance Regulation

      8.1.1 First Amendment

The First Amendment of the US Constitution (the First Amendment) states:

          Congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of speech, or of the
          press, or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the
          Government for a redress of grievances.198

Political speech enjoys a "preferred position"199 in American constitutional law. According
to the US Supreme Court, "[l]aws that burden political speech are `subject to strict scrutiny,'
which requires government to prove that the restriction `furthers a compelling interest and
is narrowly tailored to achieve that interest.'"200 In the context of campaign finance
regulation, the US Supreme Court has generally held, beginning with a ruling in 1976, that

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

the only permissible governmental interest in restricting political speech is the prevention
of corruption.201 Further, the majority of the US Supreme Court has defined corruption
narrowly to include only direct quid pro quo exchanges.202 In the majority's view, influence
and access alone do not raise the spectre of corruption.203 Kang calls this approach to
corruption "disappointingly underdeveloped."204

By narrowly circumscribing the possible justifications for campaign finance regulation, the
majority of the US Supreme Court guards against the risk of governmental influence over
voters' thoughts and decisions while overlooking the potential for undue influence by the
wealthy over public discourse and elected officials. Other interests, such as equality and
fairness, are considered insufficiently compelling to justify burdens on First Amendment
rights. Thus, the protection of individual freedom is arguably accomplished at the expense
of equality between individuals. This libertarian approach to campaign finance accords with
the view that the First Amendment is "premised on mistrust of governmental power."205 In
line with this mistrust, Chief Justice Roberts of the US Supreme Court maintains that the
public must be left to "determine for itself what speech and speakers are worthy of
consideration."206

The US Supreme Court's adoption of a libertarian campaign finance model has resulted in
the rejection of campaign expenditure limits. However, the Court has concluded that
contribution limits are permissible because they pursue the legitimate governmental interest
of anti-corruption.207 The Court has also upheld transparency requirements for both
expenditures and contributions, although loopholes in statutes allow for both secret
donations and spending.208

A contingent of justices on the US Supreme Court has accepted a wider range of justifications
for the burdens on political speech associated with campaign finance regulations. At one
point, these justices formed the majority of the Court, leading to decisions upholding various
campaign finance controls.209 However, from 2006 to 2016, in a series of cases decided by
five-four split rulings, that contingent was in the minority in every case. Their earlier
decisions were overruled, and several restrictions on donations and spending were removed
and public funding systems were ruled unconstitutional.210

                         CHAPTER 14 CAMPAIGN FINANCE

8.1.2  Jurisprudence on the Constitutional Validity of Campaign Finance
       Regulation

8.1.2.1 Buckley v Valeo

Buckley v Valeo (Buckley) is a foundational case for American campaign finance regulation
and represents the beginning of the end for expenditure limits in the US.211 In Buckley, the
US Supreme Court found that ceilings on independent, uncoordinated third-party campaign
expenditures were an unacceptable restriction on political speech under the First
Amendment.212 In the majority's view, the impugned spending ceiling precluded anyone
other than candidates, parties, and the press from making "any significant use of the most
effective modes of communication."213 The Court observed that "virtually every type of
communication in a modern mass democracy is dependent on expenditure."214 Thus,
restricting spending "reduces the quantity of expression by restricting the number of issues
discussed, the depth of their exploration, and the size of the audience reached."215

In the Court's view, the government's interest in preventing corruption did not justify the
third-party expenditure limits.216 The Court held that independent third-party campaign
expenditures do not pose the same risk of corruption as large contributions to candidates.217
The Court explained that "[t]he absence of prearrangement and coordination of an
expenditure with the candidate ... alleviates the danger that expenditures will be given as a
quid pro quo for improper commitments from the candidate."218

The Court also rejected the argument that independent expenditure caps were justified by a
governmental interest in "equalizing the relative ability of individuals and groups to
influence the outcome of elections."219 According to the Court, the idea that "government
may restrict the speech of some elements of our society in order to enhance the relative voice
of others is wholly foreign to the First Amendment."220 Rather, the First Amendment was
intended to promote unfettered dissemination of information and ideas.221 The Court cited
similar concerns in striking down a limit on candidate self-funding.222

The Court did, however, uphold limits on direct contributions to candidates. First, unlike
expenditure ceilings, contribution caps impose only a "marginal," indirect restriction on the
contributor's right to free speech.223 According to the Court, a "contribution serves as a

211 Buckley, supra note 11.
212 "Uncoordinated" refers to not being coordinated with candidates. In other words, the spending
ceiling at issue applied to independent third-party campaigners.

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

general expression of support for the candidate and his views"224 and this symbolic
expression does not depend on the size of the contribution. Further, the eventual speaker
will be someone other than the contributor.225 Second, the Court found that the contribution
limits pursued the permissible objective of preventing corruption and its appearance.
According to the Court, contribution limits address the risk that large donations will be
"given to secure a political quid pro quo from current and potential office holders."226 Equally
important, contribution limits address "the impact of the appearance of corruption
stemming from public awareness of the opportunities for abuse inherent in a regime of large
individual financial contributions."227

In Buckley, the US Supreme Court established several principles that continue to influence
American jurisprudence on campaign finance regulation. First, the Court rejected the
egalitarian rationale for regulation. Only the anti-corruption rationale was accepted as a
legitimate justification for limits on political speech during election campaigns. Second, the
Court held that independent expenditures by third parties do not raise a significant risk of
corruption. This holding set the stage for the growth of independent third-party spending
in American elections by groups such as super-PACs (discussed further below). Finally, the
Court distinguished between the First Amendment implications of contributions and
expenditures. This explains why the concept of coordination is important in American
campaign finance law. If spending by a third party or political party is coordinated with a
candidate, it is viewed as a contribution to the candidate. As a result, coordinated
expenditures, like contributions, are subject to caps and other restrictions. Only truly
independent expenditures are unregulated. Various commentators have criticized this
distinction between expenditures and contributions as unworkable in practice.228 Chief
Justice Burger's dissenting opinion in Buckley argued that "contributions and expenditures
are two sides of the same First Amendment coin."229

          8.1.2.2 Austin v Michigan Chamber of Commerce and McConnell v Federal
                     Election Commission

The cases of Austin v Michigan Chamber of Commerce (Austin)230 and McConnell v Federal
Election Commission (McConnell)231 are no longer in line with the US Supreme Court's
approach to campaign finance regulation. The views expressed in the majority judgements
in both cases reflect the views of the dissenting justices in more recent cases on campaign
finance regulation.

In Austin, the majority of the US Supreme Court upheld a Michigan law that prohibited
corporations from using general funds for independent expenditures in support of or
opposition to a candidate's election. Corporations could still pay for political advertising,
but were required to use a separate fund.232 Although the majority appeared to accept the
idea, originating in Buckley, that political speech may only be burdened in the name of
preventing corruption, the majority broadened the concept of corruption to include "the
corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of wealth that are accumulated
with the help of the corporate form and that have little or no correlation to the public's
support for the corporation's political ideas."233 Thus, the majority appeared to blend the
equality rationale for campaign finance regulation with the anti-corruption rationale. The
majority's decision also accepted that the speech of corporations and natural persons may
be treated differently since corporate status confers "special benefits ... and present[s] the
potential for distorting the political process."234 This decision was overturned in Citizens
United, discussed further in Section 8.1.2.4.

In McConnell, the majority of the US Supreme Court upheld the ban on "soft money" in the
Bipartisan Campaign Finance Reform Act (BCRA) of 2002.235 Soft money referred to unregulated
donations to political parties for the purpose of party-building activities, such as issue
advertising and voter-turnout efforts. Before the BCRA, political parties could raise
unlimited funds for these activities.236 In McConnell, the majority held that contributions may
be restricted for anti-corruption purposes, as in Buckley. However, it expanded the definition
of "corruption" beyond the quid pro quo to include the risk of undue influence on lawmakers.
In the majority's view, the soft money ban was directed toward the legitimate goal of
preventing corruption, as it prevented the circumvention of contribution limits. The soft
money ban is still in place.

In accordance with Austin, the majority in McConnell also upheld a provision prohibiting
corporations and trade unions from using general funds for independent expenditures on
"electioneering communications." Electioneering communications are a category of election
advertisements created by the BCRA that refer to a candidate in the period before the
election. The category is broader than the category of "express advocacy," which involves
words like "vote for" or "vote against." The Court noted that corporations were allowed to
establish segregated funds to pay for electioneering communications. Further, the same
rationale for prohibiting corporations from spending general funds on express advocacy,
discussed in Austin, also applied to the broader category of electioneering communications.
This part of the judgment was overturned in Citizens United.

232 Corporations could only solicit contributions to the segregated political fund from certain persons:

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

          8.1.2.3 Davis v Federal Election Commission

Davis v Federal Election Commission (Davis) aligns with current US Supreme Court
jurisprudence on campaign finance regulation and freedom of speech.237 In Davis, the
majority of the US Supreme Court struck down the "millionaire's amendment," a provision
of the BCRA stipulating that candidates could benefit from a higher donation ceiling if facing
a self-funded opponent whose spending reached a certain threshold. The Court found that
the impugned provision was an unjustifiable burden on the freedom of speech of self-
funded candidates. In Buckley, the Court had already struck down an attempt to cap
candidates' use of personal funds since the cap interfered with candidates' right to advocate
intensively for their election and lacked an anti-corruption purpose.238 In Davis, the Court
emphasized "the fundamental nature of the right to spend personal funds for campaign
speech" and observed that the millionaire's amendment imposed "an unprecedented
penalty on any candidate who robustly exercises that First Amendment right."239 This
penalty was not justified by an anti-corruption interest, as using personal funds actually
decreases the risk of corruption by reducing candidates' dependence on donations. Relying
on Buckley, the Court rejected the idea that egalitarian concerns could justify a burden on
First Amendment rights.240 The Court warned that allowing the state to limit political speech
for the purpose of furthering equality "would permit Congress to arrogate the voters'
authority to evaluate the strengths of candidates competing for office."241 The majority
likened wealth to other "strengths" candidates may have, such as fame or "a well-known
family name," and emphasized that "[t]he Constitution ... confers upon voters, not
Congress, the power to choose"242 officeholders.

          8.1.2.4 Citizens United v Federal Election Commission

In Citizens United,243 the majority of the US Supreme Court departed from its earlier decisions
in McConnell and Austin. Although the Court upheld a ban on direct contributions to
candidates from corporations and unions, along with various transparency requirements,
the majority struck down limits on independent expenditures by corporations and unions.
Under the BCRA, corporations and unions were prohibited from using general treasury
funds for independent expenditures on express advocacy and electioneering
communications. As mentioned above, express advocacy involves the use of "magic words"
like "vote for" or "vote against." Electioneering communications, a category of
communications created by the BCRA, refer to a candidate in the period before the election,
but fall short of express advocacy. The majority of the Court held that the First Amendment
precludes the government from prohibiting the use of general funds for either express
advocacy or electioneering communications.

Writing for the majority, Justice Kennedy began by asserting that the First Amendment
restrains government from treating speakers differently based on their identity. Thus,
corporations, including for-profit corporations, cannot be treated differently from natural
persons in the context of political speech. Restricting some speakers but not others would
"deprive the public of the right and privilege to determine for itself what speech and
speakers are worthy of consideration."244 In Justice Kennedy's view, the "governing rule"
should be "more speech, not less."245

In response to the majority's decision on this point, Justice Stevens quipped that "American
democracy is imperfect, [but] few ... would have thought its flaws included a dearth of
corporate money in politics."246 Justice Stevens disagreed that corporations and natural
persons must be treated identically in the electoral context. Rather, in this context, "the
distinction between corporate and human speakers is significant."247 Corporations are not
part of "We the People" and carry a special risk of corrupting the electoral process.248 Unlike
human speech, corporate speech is "derivative," and restrictions on corporate speech do not
prevent individuals from speaking themselves.249 Further, the amount of money in a
corporation's general account does not reflect public or even shareholder support for the
corporation's political activities.250

The majority went on to find that the impugned provisions amounted to content-based
"censorship" and an outright ban on corporate speech.251 The dissent disagreed, pointing
out that, far from banning corporate speech, the BCRA continued to allow corporations to
fund political speech by forming separate segregated fund accounts. However, in Justice
Kennedy's view, creating these accounts was too administratively "burdensome" to be an
adequate alternative.252 The dissent also argued that an exception to the prohibition could
be carved out for non-profit corporations that raise funds almost exclusively from
individuals, like Citizens United. However, to Justice Kennedy, the alternatives suggested
by the dissent were unworkable because they would nonetheless "chill ... political
speech."253 Further, according to Justice Kennedy, the "purpose and effect [of the ban on
corporate independent expenditures] are to silence entities whose voices the Government
deems to be suspect."254 Although the impugned prohibition was not overtly content-based,

248 Ibid at 465, 454. At 454, Stevens J noted that "[b]usiness corporations must engage the political
process in instrumental terms if they are to maximize shareholder value. The unparalleled resources,
professional lobbyists, and single-minded focus they bring to this effort ... make quid pro quo
corruption and its appearance inherently more likely when they ... spend unrestricted sums on
elections." Stevens J then pointed, at 455, to past instances in which corporations received something
from elected officials in exchange for funding independent, uncoordinated issue advertisements.

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

Justice Kennedy noted that restrictions "based on the identity of the speaker" can be "a
means to control content."255

The majority and the dissent also disagreed on the governmental interests capable of
justifying limits on electoral speech. Following Buckley, Justice Kennedy held that the
government may only limit campaign expenditure in the name of preventing corruption or
its appearance. In Justice Kennedy's view, independent, uncoordinated expenditures do not
give rise to corruption or the appearance of corruption. Justice Kennedy reached this
conclusion by defining corruption narrowly to encompass only direct quid pro quo
exchanges. According to the majority, the provision of "influence or access" is not corruption
and "will not cause the electorate to lose faith in our democracy."256 Justice Kennedy
attempted to support this proposition by explaining that "[d]emocracy is premised on
responsiveness," and the only reason to vote for or contribute to a candidate is to ensure the
candidate "will respond by producing those political outcomes the supporter favors."257 This
seems to suggest that, in Justice Kennedy's view, big donors should benefit from greater
influence, or "responsiveness," than non-donors.

The dissent disagreed with Justice Kennedy's definition of corruption. First, in the
dissident's view, Justice Kennedy defined quid pro quo corruption too narrowly. Justice
Stevens argued that quid pro quo exchanges need not "take the form of outright vote buying
or bribes.... Rather, they encompass the myriad ways in which outside parties may induce
an officeholder to confer a legislative benefit in direct response to, or anticipation of, some
outlay of money the parties have made or will make on behalf of the officeholder."258

Second, the dissent would have expanded the definition of corruption beyond the quid pro
quo exchange:

          Corruption can take many forms. Bribery may be the paradigm case. But
          the difference between selling a vote and selling access is a matter of degree,
          not kind. And selling access is not qualitatively different from giving special
          preference to those who spent money on one's behalf. Corruption operates
          along a spectrum, and the majority's apparent belief that quid pro quo
          arrangements can be neatly demarcated from other improper influences
          does not accord with the theory or reality of politics.259

Further, the dissent observed that, even if "ingratiation and access" are not corruption, they
create the opportunity for and the appearance of quid pro quo exchanges.260

The dissent and the majority also disagreed on the validity of Austin's "anti-distortion"
rationale for regulating corporate campaign finance. The majority rejected the idea from
Austin that the state may limit corporate speech to prevent the distortion of electoral debate

by well-resourced corporations. Relying on Buckley, Justice Kennedy held that Congress
cannot restrict political speech based on the speaker's wealth or with the goal of equalizing
the relative ability of people and entities to influence electoral outcomes.261 In Justice
Kennedy's view, attempts by Congress to regulate electoral speech for these equality-related
purposes would constitute an impermissible attempt to influence voters' choices.262

The dissent argued in favour of the "anti-distortion" rationale from Austin. In the dissident's
view, the impugned law represented an acceptable attempt to balance the First Amendment
rights of listeners against those of speakers.263 Corporations amass funds that natural
persons cannot, allowing them to flood broadcast media with their communications. Since
citizens do not have unlimited time to consider all speech transmitted during an election,
"corporate domination of the airwaves prior to an election may decrease the average
listener's exposure to relevant viewpoints."264 Further, corporate domination of electoral
debate could lead individuals to feel cynicism about their own ability to be heard.265 The
dissent concluded that Austin's "anti-distortion" rationale was intended to "facilitate First
Amendment values by preserving some breathing room around the electoral `marketplace'
of ideas."266

Although the majority struck down the prohibition on the use of corporate and union
general funds, they upheld disclaimer and disclosure requirements for entities funding
express advocacy and electioneering communications. According to Justice Kennedy, these
transparency requirements were justified burdens on speech because they allow "the
electorate to make informed decisions and give proper weight to different speakers and
messages." 267

In October 2014, the Federal Election Commission (FEC) approved new rules in response to
Citizens United. The rules permit corporations and unions to make independent
expenditures on express advocacy and electioneering communications.268 The regulations
were also revised to allow corporations and unions to finance partisan voter registration and
get-out-the-vote initiatives, as long as these activities are uncoordinated with parties or
candidates.269 Funds used for these activities are required to be disclosed if express advocacy
is involved and the reporting threshold of $2,000 is exceeded.270 The FEC further clarified
that foreign nationals, national banks, and corporations created by a law of Congress
continue to be prohibited from contributing to accounts used to fund electioneering
communications. 271

          8.1.2.5 SpeechNow.org v Federal Election Commission

Political action committees, or PACs, are organized under section 527 of the Internal Revenue
Code.272 So-called "traditional PACs" coordinate at least some of their spending with
candidates. This coordinated spending is treated as a contribution to the candidate. Prior to
the US Supreme Court's decision in SpeechNow.org v Federal Election Commission (SpeechNow),
contributions to all PACs were subject to the same restrictions as contributions to
candidates.273 For example, PACs could not accept donations over $5,000, just like
candidates. These restrictions were intended to prevent donors from circumventing caps on
donations to candidates, as prospective donors could, in the absence of such restrictions,
simply create a PAC, donate large amounts to the PAC, and direct the PAC to engage in
coordinated spending with the candidate.

In SpeechNow, a PAC organized solely to make uncoordinated expenditures challenged the
contribution cap.274 The District of Columbia Circuit Court sided with SpeechNow.org on
the basis that restricting independent expenditures does not serve the governmental interest
of preventing corruption or its appearance. This decision hatched the "super-PAC," or
"independent-expenditure-only PAC," which engages solely in uncoordinated spending
and therefore has unlimited fundraising and spending capacity. The Court did, however,
uphold registration and disclosure requirements for super-PACs. After this decision, the
FEC released an advisory opinion clarifying that the combined effect of Citizens United and
SpeechNow is to allow corporations and unions to contribute unlimited amounts to super-
PACs. 275

          8.1.2.6 McCutcheon v Federal Election Commission

In McCutcheon v Federal Election Commission (McCutcheon), the US Supreme Court struck
down the BCRA's aggregate limits on contributions from a single contributor to different
candidates, national party committees, and traditional PACs.276 However, the Court upheld
the base limits on contributions per election to a single candidate and the base limits on
contributions per year to national party committees and traditional PACs. The Court also
upheld disclosure requirements for contributions. The majority pointed out that disclosure
serves a valuable informational role for the electorate and deters corruption. In the majority's
view, disclosure requirements are preferable to contribution caps, as limiting contributions
could provoke the movement of money into less transparent campaigning vehicles.277

Chief Justice Roberts, for the majority, found that the aggregate limits imposed a significant
infringement on freedom of speech and association since a "donor must limit the number of
candidates he supports and may have to choose which of several policy concerns he will

advance."278 The government argued that donors could support a large number of
candidates and stay within the aggregate limits by simply contributing less to each
candidate or committee. However, Chief Justice Roberts found this option inadequate
because it would impose a "special burden on broader participation" in support of a wide
range of candidates or causes.279 This conclusion flowed from Chief Justice Roberts'
conviction that all forms of political expression, regardless of whether that expression
involves handing out a few leaflets or spending vast sums on a national advertising
campaign, are deserving of equal protection.280

Chief Justice Roberts confirmed that the sole governmental interest capable of justifying
restrictions on campaign finance is the prevention of quid pro quo corruption or its
appearance. Chief Justice Roberts also confirmed that corruption does not include
"ingratiation and access," but is limited to a "direct exchange of an official act for money."281
Each contribution is subject to base limits, meaning the aggregate limits do not, in
themselves, prevent corruption.282 Therefore, the First Amendment bars Congress from
imposing contribution limits to prevent parties and candidates from rewarding donors with
privileged access and influence. In Chief Justice Roberts' view, it is a "central feature of
democracy" that "constituents support candidates who share their beliefs and interests, and
candidates who are elected can be expected to be responsive to those concerns."283 To
prohibit this support would, in Chief Justice Roberts' view, "dangerously broaden ... the
circumscribed definition of quid pro quo corruption" to include "general, broad-based
support of a political party."284 Chief Justice Roberts also rejected the argument that
aggregate limits prevent circumvention of base limits, finding fears of circumvention too
speculative. Owing to other provisions in the BCRA, such as restrictions on earmarking,
Chief Justice Roberts argued that it would be difficult for a donor to channel large sums to
a candidate and still get credit for the donation. If the donor receives no credit for their
donation, there is no risk of a quid pro quo.

Thus, like Justice Kennedy in Citizens United, Justice Roberts appeared comfortable with the
idea that officeholders would be particularly responsive to wealthy backers. The dissent
criticized this approach for failing to differentiate "between influence resting upon public
opinion and influence bought by money alone."285 As in Citizens United, the majority also
confirmed that the government must not "restrict the political participation of some in order
to enhance the relative influence of others."286 The majority emphasized that the First
Amendment is intended to ensure that public debate is left in the hands of the public, not
the government.287 In accordance with the libertarian approach to freedom of speech, Chief
Justice Roberts maintained that government cannot be trusted to judge the value of certain

speech over other speech, "even when the government purports to act through legislation
reflecting `collective speech.'"288 In Chief Justice Roberts's view, by attempting to level the
playing field through aggregate limits, Congress was meddling impermissibly in electoral
debate and trying "to help decide who should govern."289 Thus, Congress must not
intervene even if non-interference means the wealthy decide who governs.

As in Citizens United, the dissent, written by Justice Breyer, argued for a broader conception
of corruption that goes beyond "act[s] akin to bribery" to capture the influence that large
contributions may exert over elected officials' judgement, as the government had argued.290
The dissent concluded that candidates who solicit large cheques for their party "will be
deeply grateful to the checkwriter, and surely could reward him with a quid pro quo favor."291
Further, Justice Breyer suggested that corruption encompasses the tendency of money to
drown out the "voices of the many" and disrupt the responsiveness of elected officials to the
people.292 This conception of corruption echoes the equality rationale for campaign finance
regulation.

8.2 Regulatory Regime

This section provides a brief overview of federal campaign finance regulations in the US.293

      8.2.1 Expenditures

Because of the jurisprudence discussed above, campaign expenditures are unlimited in the
US for candidates, political parties, and third parties. Third parties, such as corporations,
unions, and independent-expenditure-only PACs (or "super-PACs"), may spend unlimited
amounts in support of a candidate, party, or issue associated with a candidate or party, as
long as that spending is not coordinated with a candidate. Candidates may also spend
unlimited personal funds on their own campaigns.

      8.2.2 Contributions and Coordinated Spending

Contributions to candidates are defined as including money and in-kind services and are
subject to caps and source restrictions.294 Candidates are prohibited from accepting direct

contributions from corporations, unions, foreign nationals, national banks or federal
government contractors.295 Coordinated spending with a candidate is viewed as a
contribution to the candidate. As a result, these prohibited contributors may not engage in
coordinated spending with a candidate.296 Further, to prevent circumvention of the rules
governing contributions to candidates, donations to entities that engage in coordinated
spending with candidates, such as political party committees and traditional PACs, are also
subject to caps and source restrictions.297 Before the BCRA was enacted, limits on
contributions to political party committees could be circumvented by donating "soft money"
to the party. Soft money was used for "party-building activities" and was unregulated.298
However, the BCRA closed this loophole, stipulating that political parties may only raise
money for permitted purposes under federal regulation.299

Super-PACs, which engage solely in "independent expenditures," are not subject to these
caps or source restrictions. Super-PACs, therefore, have unlimited spending and fundraising
capacity. Hybrid-PACs, which engage in both coordinated and independent spending, are
required to maintain a separate fund for independent expenditures, which will not be
subject to contribution caps or source restrictions. All expenditures by single-candidate
PACs are considered contributions to their candidate, even if some of the PAC's spending
is technically uncoordinated.

A relatively new political finance phenomenon in the US remains unaddressed by
legislation, namely when an advisor or former advisor to a politician establishes a non-profit
organization that raises and spends money to back their politician's agenda and actions
while in office. These non-profits evade legislation in four ways:

     1. they don't lobby and so are not subject to the disclosure requirements in
          lobbying registration laws;

     2. they are not making financial contributions or giving gifts to the politician and
          so are not restricted by contribution limits;

     3. they don't campaign during election periods and so are not subject to
          disclosure requirements that apply during those periods; and

     4. loopholes in conflict of interest laws can allow an advisor to also play a role in
          such a non-profit, and a politician essentially to work in coordination with the
          non-profit and his or her former advisors.300

295 52 USC §§ 30118, 30119, 30121; 11 CFR § 110.20 (2012). Issacharoff notes this rule may be up for
grabs in relation to corporations after Citizens United, in which the majority of the US Supreme Court
frowned upon making distinctions between corporations and natural persons: Issacharoff, supra note

A criminal case filed in Ohio in July 2020 will test elements of whether such a "contribution"
scheme is legal. Larry Householder, Speaker of the House in Ohio, his advisor, two lobbyists,
and a non-profit 501(c)(4) entity established in 2017 by the advisor, called Generation Now,
were charged for participating in an alleged racketeering conspiracy.301 The conspiracy
involved approximately $60 million paid to Generation Now by a power utility company.
Generation Now, effectively controlled by Householder and his advisor, used the money to
campaign in support of legislation that provided a billion-dollar bailout of two nuclear
plants owned by the power utility company and against a referendum that would have
overturned the legislation.302 Part of the money was allegedly also used to support a slate of
21 state election candidates connected to Householder who, after being elected, would
support him becoming Speaker, and also $400,000 was allegedly given directly to
Householder to pay for various personal expenses.303 The advisor and one of the lobbyists
pleaded guilty on October 29, 2020,304 and Generation Now pleaded guilty in February
2021.305 The case will take into account the US Supreme Court's ruling in McCormick
concerning whether contributions can amount to corruption.306

In March 2021, the US House of Representatives passed a Democrat-backed bill entitled the
For the People Act that contains several changes to the US federal election and government
ethics laws, including restrictions on contributions and coordination. A version of the bill
was introduced in the Senate where it was blocked by Republican senators in June 2021. A
similar Democrat bill was blocked in 2019.307 A subsequent Freedom to Vote Act, which

mirrored the For the People Act but rolled back various provisions to address concerns of
Republican Senators, was also blocked by the Senate in October 2021.308 Among many other
changes to federal US law, the For the People Act proposed to restrict super-PACs by
expanding the type of spending that will be considered a contribution to a candidate.
Further, people with connections to a candidate would have been categorized as
"coordinated spenders" so that if they worked with a super-PAC, all of its spending will be
considered a contribution to the candidate.309

      8.2.3 Transparency Requirements

The US Supreme Court's rulings on the country's political finance system are somewhat
based on the premise that transparency is enough to combat corruption. Disclosure of
donors and supporters allows voters to determine which parties and candidates they want
to support and makes it more difficult for politicians and governments to return the favour
of the donations and support. However, US statutes and regulations have loopholes that
allow for what has come to be called "dark money" to be donated in support of various
political actors and organizations without disclosing the source.310

Generally, candidates, parties, and super-PACs are all required to disclose their donors and
campaign expenditures regularly (annually, quarterly, or monthly, depending on the year.)
However, spending during the pre-election period does not require disclosure. Further,
some donations are not required to be disclosed before election day, simply because of
deadlines for filing disclosure reports.311 For example, in reports to the FEC, super-PACs are
required to include the source, amount, and date of contributions to the super-PAC for any
purpose, along with the amount, purpose, date, and recipient of disbursements over $200 in
a calendar year.312 Super-PACs are also required to disclose separately their spending on
express advocacy, but this rule means spending that does not explicitly support or oppose a
candidate or party is not required to be disclosed.313

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

Corporations, unions, and groups organized under 26 USC § 501(c), often termed "501(c)
organizations,"314 are required to disclose expenditures made for the purpose of express
advocacy and electioneering communications.315 However, corporations, unions, and 501(c)
organizations are not required to report the source of their donations to the FEC, unless the
donations were made specifically for the purpose of funding express advocacy or
electioneering communications.316 The same general rules apply to groups organized under
26 USC § 527, or "527 organizations" that are not candidate or party committees or political
action committees, meaning their main activities are not political.317

Some entities also have disclosure obligations to agencies other than the FEC, such as tax-
exempt charities and other organizations reporting to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).318
In April 2021, the US Supreme Court heard a case in which a charity challenged as
unconstitutional a California legal requirement that it disclose its significant donors to the
state government. The charity claimed this requirement restricts their donors' freedom of
expression rights by possibly exposing their donation to the public.319 If the Court rules that
the requirement is unconstitutional, it will likely derail any future statutory measure that
requires 501(c) organizations that are charities or tax-exempt to disclose their donors.

The blocked For the People Act included measures to strengthen and close loopholes in donor
and spending disclosure requirements.320 If fully enacted, the bill would have, among many

314 501(c) organizations may engage in political campaigning activity so long as it is not their primary
activity; however, Dwyre notes that the Internal Revenue Agency has done little to investigate
whether 501(c) organizations are making campaigning activity their primary activity: Dwyre, supra
note 8 at 48-50. The most relevant types of 501(c) organizations in the context of election campaigns
are labour organizations (organized under 26 USC § 501(c)(5)), trade associations or business leagues
like the Chamber of Commerce (organized under 26 USC § 501(c)(6)), and "social welfare
organizations" (organized under 26 USC § 501(c)(4)): Dwyre, supra note 8 at 48-50.

"electioneering communications" was created by the BCRA and captures a broader range of
advertising than the category of "express advocacy" does.

      8.2.4 Public Funding

The US has used an egalitarian opt-in public funding system for candidates in parties'
presidential candidate nomination races, known as "primaries," and for general presidential
election candidates since 1976. However, the Republican Party presidential candidates have
not opted into the system since John McCain's candidacy in 2008. This is mainly due to
funding amounts for major party candidates that have not increased in decades and are
significantly less than what candidates are able to raise. For example, the 2020 general
election amount for presidential candidates was $103.7 million.329

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

To qualify for public funding in the primaries, a candidate must raise $5,000 in a minimum
of 20 states in donations of no more than $250 each.330 Candidates who opt in are required
to limit their spending in each state primary and overall, and limit spending of their own
funds to $50,000. In return, the candidate receives public funding that matches the first $250
of each donation they receive.331

In the general presidential election, candidates are automatically qualified for a lump-sum
public funding grant that varies in amount depending on whether the candidate is from a
major party (whose candidate received more than 25% of the vote in the previous election),
minor party (whose candidate received between 5% and 25% of the vote in the previous
election) or new party (whose candidate receives the funding after the election if the
candidate obtains more than 5% of the votes), along with a few other detailed provisions.
However, to receive funding, a candidate is required to:

     1. limit their spending (the limit increases by the cost of living allowance amount
          (COLA) each election cycle, and exempts some core expenses);

     2. limit spending of their own funds to $50,000;

     3. not receive private contributions other than into a special account only to be
          used to pay for legal and accounting expenses incurred to comply with the law;

     4. keep records of spending and cooperate with an FEC audit; and

     5. use closed-captioning in all TV commercials.332

The blocked For the People Act bill would have replaced the lump-sum public funding grants
for presidential candidates in primaries and the general election with a system that provides
$6 for every $1 that a candidate raises, up to a maximum of $250 million in public funding
for the general election. If a candidate participated in the public funding program during
their party's primaries and won the party nomination, they must also use the program
during the general election. The bill would have also eliminated the cap on spending by
participating candidates and increased the amount national party committees can spend in
coordination with their candidate.333

From 1976 to 2012, the US government also provided public grants to federal political party
committees for party conventions,334 but this funding was terminated in 2014.335 Public
funding has been proposed several times for federal elections for members of Congress, but

330 Ibid. A contributor may contribute up to that election's candidate contribution limit, but only $250
of their donation counts towards qualifying for the system. The public funding comes from
taxpayers who indicate on their annual tax form that they would like $3 of their taxes to be diverted
to the fund.

has never been enacted.336 The blocked For the People Act bill, would have provided public
funding of six times the amount of any donation of $200 or less received by a candidate. The
source of the public funding was proposed to be a small surcharge on some criminal fines
and civil and administrative penalties collected by the federal government, primarily from
corporate defendants and their executives, as well as wealthy individuals who commit tax
fraud and are in the highest tax bracket. As well, the bill would have established pilot
"voucher" donation system programs in three states.337 Finally, to encourage parties to seek
small donations, the bill would have allowed parties to establish special accounts for
donations of $200 or less and then transfer up to $10,000 from the account to any candidate
or spending unlimited amounts from the account in coordination with any candidate.338

Several states provide public funding in the form of lump sums for candidates who raise a
specific amount in small donations or matching donations and for party conventions and
voter turnout activities.339 These, along with tax deductions for donations, and "voucher"
systems (where each voter is provided with a voucher of an amount of public funds which
the voter can donate to one or more candidates) are the only public funding systems that the
courts have ruled are constitutional in the US. The majority ruling in the US Supreme Court's
2007 ruling in Davis (summarized in Section 8.1.2.3) was echoed in Arizona Free Enterprise
Club's Freedom Club PAC v Bennett (Bennett),340 which struck down Arizona's "millionaire's
amendment" system. The system, as in the measures in the federal BCRA that were struck
in Davis, provided an initial amount of public funding to a candidate who opted into the
system, and then dollar-for-dollar matching funding to that candidate if they faced a
privately financed candidate whose expenditures, combined with support from the
expenditures of independent groups, exceeded the publicly financed candidate's initial
public funding. The candidate would receive matching funds up to twice the amount of the
candidate's initial public funding. In Bennett, as in Davis, the Supreme Court rejected
arguments that the system levelled the playing field for candidates and instead criticized it
for inhibiting the freedom of the privately financed candidate to spend as much as they
want. The ruling chilled and derailed similar public funding systems in other states.

campaigns.341 To assist in promoting compliance, the FEC promulgates rules and regulations
and issues advisory opinions, of which there are over 1,000.342 The FEC is only responsible
for civil enforcement of campaign finance laws, not criminal enforcement, which falls under
the Justice Department's mandate.343

8.3 Criticisms of Campaign Finance Regulation

The American regulatory regime is often criticized for encouraging the movement of
campaign money away from relatively transparent political parties to unaccountable and
less transparent outside spending groups, such as 501(c) organizations.344 The dissenting
justices in Citizens United deplored this trend, noting that political parties represent "broad
coalitions" while corporations and unions, the third parties at issue, in that case, represent
"narrow interests."345 Other types of third parties may also represent narrow interests. For
example, in the 2012 general election, 93% of the money spent by super-PACs came from
0.0011% of the population, raising significant equality concerns.346

The growth of outside spending is driven by the absence of independent expenditure limits
for third parties, the BCRA's prohibition on soft money for political parties, the limits on
coordinated spending in support of political parties and candidates, and the less stringent
transparency requirements for outside spenders like corporations, unions, 501(c) groups,
and 527 non-political organizations. Although the lack of mandatory disclosure makes
confirmation impossible, Dwyre speculates that many corporations direct their election
campaign spending through 501(c) organizations to avoid revealing their support for
particular candidates or parties.347

According to a majority of US Supreme Court cases, like Citizens United, all this outside
spending raises no risk of corruption or even the risk of the appearance of corruption, as
long as the spending is independent and uncoordinated with candidates. Yet this premise is
highly debatable. Many question whether `independent expenditures' are truly
`independent' in the current environment of pervasive outside spending. Dwyre observes
that many super-PACs are run by "former party officials, Congressional staff, and partisan
operatives,"348 and candidates and elected officials are allowed to speak at super-PAC
fundraisers. Boatright argues that there is "implicit coordination between groups and
between groups and candidates and parties."349 He suggests that some party functions have

been de facto outsourced to outside groups because of the restrictions on party financing,
creating a "network" of parties and outside groups that is guided by "mechanisms of
coordination."350 Boatright bolsters this argument by pointing out that personnel tend to
move between interest groups, candidate campaigns, and political party committees,
suggesting there is "informal" coordination.351 This can have the effect of reducing the
responsiveness of parties to voters, and also raises the spectre of corruption, since parties
and candidates may wish to show gratitude toward the outside groups in their "network."352

Even if outside spending is truly independent, many argue that independent expenditures
nonetheless give rise to the risk or appearance of corruption. Based on the record before
Congress in the lead-up to the BCRA's enactment, the dissent in Citizens United pointed out
that "corporate independent expenditures ... had become essentially interchangeable with
direct contributions in their capacity to generate quid pro quo arrangements."353 The record
indicated that candidates' campaigns are generally aware of who is behind independent
advertisements on the candidates' behalf.354 Further, even if independent outside spending
does not produce direct quid pro quo corruption, Richard Hasen argues that it may lead to
the sale of access to candidates.355 Hasen makes the common sense observation that
"[p]residential candidates are likely to notice and appreciate when an individual spends
millions of dollars supporting or opposing the candidate through an independent effort,"
which may lead to "special access ... after the election."356 The record cited by the dissent in
Citizens United supported this argument since it demonstrated that "the sponsors of ...
advertisements were routinely granted special access after the campaign was over."357

Some commentators argue that political party financing in the US should be deregulated to
reduce outside spending and restore the role of the political parties in elections. Boatright
has suggested raising contribution caps for political parties, relaxing restrictions on
coordinated spending of parties and candidates, providing more public funding to political
parties, and tightening disclosure requirements for third parties.358 However, Sarbanes and
O'Mara argue that deregulating contributions to political parties would only exacerbate the
disproportionate influence of wealthy donors in American politics.359 Others agree that
deregulating party finance is not the answer, as allowing "parties to engage in the same type
of courting and solicitation of the very wealthy as Super PACs" is unlikely to "mitigate the
ongoing distributional shift of the campaign finance system toward the interests of the very
wealthy." 360

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

Campaign finance legislation in the US is criticized for a variety of other problems. For
example, the BCRA's ban on soft money was intended to reduce the risk of corruption by
preventing political parties from accepting unregulated, unlimited contributions. However,
Hasen argues that the practice of "bundling" has replaced, to some extent, the use of soft
money to gain access to politicians.361 Bundling involves one individual soliciting many
donations from their acquaintances. Bundlers who reach certain thresholds are rewarded
with access and other perquisites.362 Others criticize the regulatory regime for falling behind
new developments in campaign finance. The public funding regime for presidential
candidates provides an example of this "policy drift."363 Dwyre calls the presidential public
funding regime a "quaint remnant of a bygone era when public funding provided a way to
level the playing field between presidential contenders."364 Hasen agrees that the scheme is
"no longer viable."365 For example, in 2008, former President Obama opted out of the public
funding regime and raised $745.7 million for his presidential campaign.366 If he had opted
in, he would have received $84.1 million in public funding, and his spending would have
been limited to that amount.367

The FEC is also criticized for its lack of success in imposing "serious sanctions on high-stakes
violations."368 Enforcement problems are exacerbated by a complicated and slow
enforcement process.369 Further, the FEC's endless advisory opinions and other policy
documents have led to an unwieldy and overly complex regime.370 Dwyre also notes that
political deadlock among the Commissioners has prevented the FEC from keeping up with
changing practices and newly discovered loopholes, thus feeding policy drift.371

9. UK

Campaign finance-related scandals in past decades have led to increasing regulation of
political financing in the UK.372 The UK's campaign finance regime imposes spending limits
and transparency requirements on parties, candidates, and third-party campaigners.
However, unlike in Canada and the US, contributions to parties and candidates are

uncapped, although contributions are only allowed from permissible sources. In other
words, demand is limited, but supply is not. Paid political broadcasting is also prohibited in
the UK. The UK's limits on political spending and broadcasting have survived challenges
based on freedom of expression, providing a stark contrast to American freedom of speech
jurisprudence.373

9.1 Freedom of Expression and Campaign Finance Regulation

In two cases dealing with the UK's campaign finance laws, the European Court of Human
Rights (ECtHR) accepted that states may impose some limits on campaign financing
without falling afoul of the guarantees of freedom of expression and free elections.374
Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights (the Convention)375 provides as
follows:

          1. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include
          freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas
          without interference by public authority ...

          2. The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and
          responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions
          or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic
          society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public
          safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health
          or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for
          preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for
          maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.

Article 3 of Protocol 1 to the Convention provides that contracting parties shall "undertake
to hold free elections ... under conditions which will ensure the free expression of the
opinion of the people in the choice of the legislature."376

373 See Section 8.1.2 for a discussion of freedom of speech jurisprudence in the US. Issacharoff points
out that the UK has a tradition of treating elections as "an administrative tallying of preferences as
they exist", which could play a part in the courts' willingness to allow limits on freedom of
expression during elections: Samuel Issacharoff, "The Constitutional Logic of Campaign Finance
Regulation" (2009) 26:2 Pepperdine L Rev 373 at 384.
374 Brexit does not directly affect the weight of the Convention and ECtHR decisions in the UK. The
ECtHR is a judicial body of the Council of Europe, which is separate from the European Union, and
the Convention is incorporated into UK law through the UK Human Rights Act. For more

      9.1.1 Bowman v the United Kingdom

In Bowman v the United Kingdom (Bowman), the ECtHR considered a provision of the
Representation of the People Act, 1983 (RPA), providing that third parties could spend no more
than 5 on publications promoting the election of a particular candidate in any one
constituency in the six weeks before a general election.377 The applicant was charged under
the RPA after distributing some 1.5 million leaflets in various constituencies to inform voters
about candidates' views on abortion.378

Although the spending limit infringed freedom of expression, the ECtHR accepted that it
had the legitimate aim of protecting the rights and freedoms of others, as required by Article
10(2) of the Convention. The ECtHR identified the "others" as other candidates, since the
provision aimed to promote "equality between candidates" and the electorate.379 However,
the ECtHR found that the impugned provision was disproportionate to its goal. The
spending cap formed a "total barrier" for third parties wishing to inform people in their area
about a candidate's views on a particular issue, even though the limit applied only in the
four to six weeks before a general election.380 In response to this decision, Parliament raised
the third-party spending cap at the constituency level for general parliamentary elections.381

In Bowman, the ECtHR discussed the interaction between the right to free elections and the
right to free expression. According to the ECtHR, these two guarantees are the "bedrock" of
democracy and reinforce one another, but they may also come into conflict.382 The ECtHR
accepted that states may need to limit freedom of expression during elections to ensure "free
expression of the opinion of the people," as required by the right to free elections. However,
information must nonetheless be permitted to "circulate freely" during an election.383 Like
the Supreme Court of Canada in Harper,384 the ECtHR thus acknowledged the usefulness of
third-party spending limits in enhancing electoral debate, but warned against stifling the
flow of information through too restrictive spending caps.

      9.1.2 Animal Defenders International v the United Kingdom

In Animal Defenders International v the United Kingdom (Animal Defenders), the ECtHR
confirmed its willingness to allow limits on free expression of opinion during elections for
the sake of fairness and robust debate.385 In this case, the applicant challenged a blanket ban
on paid political advertising on broadcast media for political parties, candidates, and third

parties under the Communications Act 2003.386 The UK House of Lords and the ECtHR upheld
the ban.

In its decision, the House of Lords emphasized that a level playing field in public debate
enables citizens "to make up their own minds on the important issues of the day."387
According to the House of Lords, the blanket ban on paid political advertising "avoid[s] the
grosser distortions [in electoral debate] which unrestricted access to the broadcast media
will bring."388 In recognizing the need to prevent the wealthy from distorting electoral
debate, the House of Lords accepted the egalitarian rationale for campaign regulation and
acknowledged that limiting electoral speech can actually enhance the exchange of
information and ideas. Speaking bluntly, Baroness Hale bolstered the majority's conclusions
by warning against "the dominance of advertising, not only in elections but also in the
formation of political opinion, in the United States of America" and the "[e]normous
sums"389 spent on such advertising.

At the ECtHR, the parties agreed that the legislative objective of the ban on paid political
advertising was to preserve the "impartiality of broadcasting on public interest matters and,
thereby ... protect ... the democratic process."390 The majority of the ECtHR accepted that
this objective fell within the legitimate aim of protecting the rights of others, as required by
Article 10(2) of the Convention. The ECtHR also concluded that the ban could reasonably be
considered necessary in a democratic society. According to the majority, without the ban,
the wealthy could "obtain competitive advantage in the area of paid advertising and thereby
curtail a free and pluralist debate, of which the State remains the ultimate guarantor."391

Finally, on the issue of proportionality, the majority of the ECtHR found the ban to be
properly tailored to the "risk of distortion."392 The ban applied to media with "particular
influence," those media being television and radio, and a narrower ban could lead to abuse
and uncertainty.393 The ECtHR also pointed out the availability of alternatives to paid
political advertising for third-party groups, such as participation in radio or television
programs or the formation of a charitable arm to fund non-political paid advertising.394

By concluding that the state is the "ultimate guarantor" of robust debate, the ECtHR
revealed a significant divergence from the US Supreme Court's approach to freedom of
speech. In campaign finance cases, the majority of the US Supreme Court has demonstrated
an unwavering suspicion of state power and has emphasized the role of constitutional rights
in shielding the individual from that power.395 In Animal Defenders, by contrast, the ECtHR's

approach recalls Fiss' theory that the state may enhance free speech, not merely threaten
it.396

9.2 Regulatory Regime

The UK's campaign finance regime attempts to level the playing field for parties and
candidates by limiting demand for, but not supply of, political money. In the UK, parties,
candidates, and third parties are subject to expenditure limits, but contributions to all three
are uncapped, although contributions are only allowed from permissible sources. The UK's
ban on paid political advertising on broadcast media is intended to further curb political
parties' demand for money.

Under the UK's scheme of uncapped contributions, parties and candidates could rely solely
on a small number of large donors to finance their campaigns. This raises obvious corruption
concerns. The system includes disclosure requirements which, it is argued, address the risk
of corruption by discouraging large contributions, as big donors may find themselves the
subject of unwanted media attention, and ensuring the public knows what support parties
and candidates have received.

In the UK, different legislation applies to the campaigning of political parties and
candidates. Registered parties are governed by the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums
Act 2000 (PPERA),397 while candidates are governed by the RPA.398 Both acts also regulate
third-party campaigning in general parliamentary elections, with PPERA addressing
national third-party campaigns and RPA addressing third-party campaigns at the
constituency level. The campaign finance provisions in both acts were amended by the
Electoral Administration Act 2006,399 the Political Parties and Elections Act 2009,400 and the
Transparency of Lobbying, Non-Party Campaigning and Trade Union Administration Act 2014 (the
Transparency of Non-Party Campaigning Act).401 The next section will focus on the rules in
PPERA and the RPA in relation to general parliamentary elections. The UK also regulates
campaign financing in referendums and local government elections.

Appeal explained that the purpose of spending caps is to promote "a level financial playing
field between competing candidates, so as to prevent perversion of the voters' democratic
choice between competing candidates within constituencies by significant disparities of
local expenditure."404 By contrast, American courts view the objective of levelling the
playing field as an insufficient basis for restricting campaign spending.405

a) Expenses Captured by Spending Limits

          (i) Registered Parties: Definition of "Campaign Expenditure"

Registered parties are subject to ceilings on "campaign expenditure" under PPERA.
Campaign expenditure is defined as an expense incurred by a party for election purposes
that falls within Schedule 8 of PPERA, which lists such matters as advertising, publishing
documents with the party's policies, market research, and rallies or other events.406 The
phrase "for election purposes" is defined as "for the purpose of or in connection with (a)
promoting or procuring electoral success for the party ... or (b) otherwise enhancing the
standing"407 of the party or its candidates. This includes attempts to prejudice the chances
or standing of other parties or candidates.408 Further, an activity could be done "for election
purposes" even if no express mention is made of any party or candidate.409 Finally, a
registered party's campaign expenditure does not include expenditures that are to be
included in a candidate's election expenses return, which prevents the same expenses from
counting toward the spending limits of both a candidate and its party.

Even if an expense falls within the definition of campaign expenditure, it will not count
towards the party's spending limit under PPERA, unless it was incurred in the 365 days
before a general parliamentary election.410

          (ii) Candidates: Definition of "Election Expenses"

The RPA limits the amount candidates may spend on "election expenses." The definition of
election expenses is similar to the definition of campaign expenditure for political parties.
Election expenses are defined in the RPA as:

          - any expenses incurred at any time
          - in respect of any matter specified in Part 1 of Schedule 4A
          - which is used for the purposes of the candidate's election
          - after the date when he becomes a candidate at the election.411

404 Ibid at 255.
405 See e.g. Buckley, supra note 11.

                                      1129
GLOBAL CORRUPTION

The matters in Part 1 of Schedule 4A include advertising, distributing unsolicited material
to electors, transport, public meetings, and accommodation and administration costs. The
phrase "for the purposes of the candidate's election" is defined as "with a view to, or
otherwise in connection with, promoting or procuring the candidates election," which
includes "prejudicing the electoral prospects of another candidate."412 Exclusions are made
for certain expenses, such as those related to the publication of non-advertising material in
newspapers and periodicals.413 Further, the value of volunteer services provided on the
volunteer's own time is not considered an election expense.414

b) Spending Limits

          (i) Registered Parties

In the 365 days before a general parliamentary election, registered parties' campaign
expenditure is limited to 30,000 per constituency contested by the party, or 810,000 in
England, 120,000 in Scotland, and 60,000 in Wales, whichever is greater.415 Constituency-
level branches of registered parties are not subject to limits on spending in support of
candidates in their constituencies.416 However, if a constituency-level branch spends money
promoting the party as a whole, this spending will count toward the national party's
spending limit.417

It should be noted that, while general election dates are somewhat fixed every four years by
statute in the UK, an election can occur at any time in two scenarios: First, the Prime Minister
can propose a resolution calling an election and two-thirds of the members of the House of
Commons approve the resolution, or second, a majority of members approve a resolution
stating non-confidence in the government, and do not vote to withdraw that resolution in
the two-weeks after it is approved. The Queen can approve the calling of the election instead
of approving an opposition party or combination of parties to attempt to govern after the
government has resigned.418 As a result, if such a vote occurs and an election is called with
only two weeks of notice, the spending limits do not apply retroactively for the period of the
previous 365 days.

          (ii) Candidates

Candidate spending limits are determined by adding a base amount and a "top up" that
depends on the number of registered electors in the candidate's constituency.419 There are

two relevant time periods for candidate spending under the RPA. One limit applies to post-
candidacy election expenses, while a separate limit applies to pre-candidacy election
expenses under certain circumstances. The limit for post-candidacy expenses covers all
election expenses incurred for things used after the person becomes a candidate, even if the
expenses were actually incurred before they became a candidate, as indicated by the
definition of election expenses.420 In the 2017 general parliamentary election, the post-
candidacy spending limit consisted of a base amount of 8,700 with a top up of 9p per elector
in county constituencies.421

A separate spending cap applies to pre-candidacy election expenses in some circumstances.
If Parliament is not dissolved for 55 months, election expenses will be capped between the
end of the 55-month period and the day a person becomes a candidate.422 In other words, if
an expense is incurred for something used during this pre-candidacy window, it will count
toward the pre-candidacy spending limit. This window could last up to four months. In the
2015 general parliamentary election, spending during this period was limited to a base
amount of 30,700 with a top up of 6p per elector.423 The addition of this pre-candidacy limit
in 2009 was presumably directed toward preventing the circumvention of pre-existing post-
candidacy spending limits.

          9.2.1.2 Contributions to Registered Parties and Candidates

As mentioned, contributions to candidates and political parties in the UK are subject to
source restrictions and disclosure requirements, but the amount of each contribution is
unlimited. The source restrictions and disclosure requirements apply to all donations to
political parties, regardless of whether donations are specifically intended for the purpose
of election campaigning, although disclosure is required more frequently during election
periods.

a) Definition of "Donation"

          (i) Definition of "donation" for parties: PPERA

"Donation" is defined in section 50(2) of PPERA to include gifts of money or property;
membership fees; payments of the party's expenses by a third person; and the provision of
property, services, or facilities "otherwise than on commercial terms." "Sponsorship" is also
included in the definition and is defined in section 51 of PPERA as the transfer of money or
property to the party to help the party meet expenses for events, research, or publications.

(UK), SI 2014/1870, art 4. See also Electoral Commission, Guidance for Candidates and Agents, supra
note 419 at 7. In the 2017 parliamentary general election, there was no pre-candidacy spending limit,
since Parliament was dissolved before the 55 month period expired.
422 RPA, supra note 398, s 76ZA. Note that, for the purposes of section 76ZA, the definition of
"election expenses" in section 90ZA(1) is changed to omit the words "after the date when he becomes
a candidate at the election": s 76ZA(1).

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

However, sponsorship does not include the price of admission to events and payments to
access party publications.424 The definition of donation also excludes various things, such as
the provision of volunteer services on one's own time free of charge.425 In addition,
donations of 500 or less are excluded from the definition of donation and are therefore
exempt from source restrictions and disclosure requirements.426

Loans with a value over 500 are included within the regulatory scheme.427 After the self-
explanatory "loans for peerages" scandal of 2006, the Election Administration Act 2006
amended PPERA to ensure loans could not be used to circumvent source restrictions and
disclosure requirements for donations.428

          (ii) Definition of "donation" for candidates: the RPA

The definition of donation under the RPA is similar to the definition under PPERA. Donation
is defined to include gifts; sponsorship; money lent on non-commercial terms; and the
provision of property, services, or facilities on non-commercial terms.429 Donations of 50 or
less are excluded.430 Volunteer services provided free of charge on the volunteer's own time
are also excluded.431

b) Source Restrictions

Source restrictions are similar for candidates and registered parties.432 As indicated by the
definitions of donation, these restrictions are triggered by donations and loans over 500 for
parties and by donations over 50 for candidates. Donations and loans over these thresholds
are only allowed from permissible donors whose identities are disclosed.433 Permissible
donors include individuals registered in the electoral register in the UK, companies and
limited liability partnerships that carry on business in the UK, unincorporated associations
that carry on their activities primarily in the UK and have their main office in the UK, and
trade unions listed under UK legislation.434 Charities are not allowed to make political
donations.435 An additional restriction applies to donations and loans to political parties.

Individuals contributing or lending more than 7,500 to a registered party are required to be
resident, ordinarily resident, and domiciled in the UK for tax purposes.436

When accepting a donation from an unincorporated association, the Electoral Commission
advises party officers to ascertain whether the association has an identifiable membership,
a set of rules or a constitution, and a separate existence from its members.437 If these criteria
are met, the party officer may accept the donation without inquiring further into the identity
of the individuals funding the association, even if those individuals might be impermissible
donors. The party officer is required simply to record the association's name and the address
of its main office, in accordance with PPERA's transparency requirements.438 If the above
criteria are not met, party officers are directed to "consider whether the donation is actually
from individuals" within the association "or if someone within the association is acting as
an agent for others."439 If so, the officer is required to ensure the individuals in question are
permissible donors.440

c) Disclosure Requirements

Donations and loans to registered parties, along with donations to candidates, are subject to
disclosure requirements. These transparency requirements will be discussed next.

          9.2.1.3 Transparency Requirements for Registered Parties and Candidates

a) Registered Parties

The treasurer of a registered party is required to submit a campaign expenditure return to
the Electoral Commission within six months after a general election.441 The return is required
to contain all campaign expenditures in the 365 days before the election, along with
supporting invoices and receipts.442 The treasurer is also required to submit a declaration
that the return is complete and correct and, if the party's campaign expenditure exceeds
250,000, an auditor's report.443 The Electoral Commission is required to make the campaign
expenditure returns available for public inspection "as soon as reasonably practicable,"444
but may destroy returns two years after receiving them.

437 Electoral Commission, Permissibility Checks, supra note 435 at 9.
438 Ibid. However, some additional transparency is provided by the reporting requirements for
unincorporated associations. If an unincorporated association donates or lends over 25,000 in a year
to a registered party, the association is required to report to the Electoral Commission any gifts over
7,500 received by the association before and after the association makes the donation or loan:

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

Party treasurers are required to also submit quarterly donation reports.445 As mentioned,
only contributions over 500 meet the definition of donation and only loans of a value of
over 500 count as regulated transactions under PPERA. Donation reports are required to
include donations or loans over 7,500, donations or loans from the same source that add up
to 7,500 in a calendar year, and donations or loans over 1,500 that come from a source
already reported in that year.446 Further, the treasurer is required to include donations or
loans over 1,500 to the party's accounting units or constituency-level branches.447 If one
person makes several donations to different branches of the party, the donations will be
treated as a donation to the central party and is required to be reported if over 7,500 in the
aggregate.448 Reports are required to include information about the donor or lender, such as
name and address.449 During a general election, these reports are required to be submitted
weekly.450 If there is nothing to report, the treasurer is required to submit a nil return.451 The
Electoral Commission maintains a register of donations and loans reported under PPERA,
which is required to includes the amount and source of each donation or loan.452 Donations
are to be entered into the register "as soon as reasonably practicable."453

b) Candidates

Candidates are required to submit a spending return within 35 days after the election result
is declared.454 The return is required to include all election expenses incurred and payments
made, along with a statement of the amount of money provided from the candidate's own
resources to cover election expenses.455 Even if the candidate has incurred no election
expenses, they are required to submit a nil return.456 The return is required to also list
donations received and information about the donations, such as the date of acceptance, the
amount of the donation, and the name and address of the donor.457 As noted above, these
requirements only apply to donations over 50, as donations under this threshold do not
meet the definition of donation in the RPA.458 If a candidate fails to deliver their return on
time and is a Member of Parliament, the candidate is prohibited from sitting or voting in the

donation returns to be published in at least two newspapers in their constituency.460

      9.2.2 Public Funding

The UK's campaign finance regime provides little in the way of public funding for parties
or candidates. There are no tax credits for political donations and no reimbursements or
allowances. Justin Fisher notes that a tradition of "voluntarism as the basis for party finance"
may explain the absence of robust public funding for election campaigns in the UK.461

          9.2.2.1 Policy Development Grants

Policy development grants for political parties are intended to help fund long-term research,
thus encouraging parties to become a source of ideas in politics, not just electoral
campaigning machines.462 The Electoral Commission is not authorized to make more than
2 million in policy grants per year.463

          9.2.2.2 Broadcasting Regulations

The Communications Act 2003 prohibits paid political advertising on television and radio and
requires broadcasters to provide free airtime to registered political parties for political and
campaign broadcasts.464 Licensed broadcasters are required to allocate political broadcasting
time in accordance with the minimum requirements set out by Ofcom, the UK's
communications regulator.465 As long as these minimum requirements are met, broadcasters

Ofcom <https://www.ofcom.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0035/99188/pprb-rules-march-2017.pdf>.
Ofcom advises at paragraph 14 that, before general elections, licensed broadcasters and the BBC
should allocate one or more Party Election Broadcasts to each registered party "having regard to the
circumstances of a particular election, the nation in which it is held, and the individual party's past
electoral support and/or current support in that nation." At paragraph 15, Ofcom clarifies that
registered parties should qualify for an election broadcast if contesting one sixth or more of the seats
in a general election (in jurisdictions using proportional representation voting a formula determines
whether a party qualifies). Further, Ofcom states at paragraph 16 that licensed broadcasters and the
BBC "should consider making additional allocations of ... [election broadcasts] to registered parties
... if evidence of their past electoral support and/or current support at a particular election or in a
relevant nation/electoral area means it would be appropriate to do so." Paragraph 24 to 26 stipulates

have the discretion to set their own rules on the length, frequency, allocation, and scheduling
of political broadcasts.466

Under section 321(2) of the Communications Act 2003, an advertisement will contravene the
prohibition on paid political advertising if it is inserted by a body whose objects are wholly
or mainly of a political nature or if it is directed towards a political end. Objects of a political
nature and political ends include attempts to influence the outcome of elections or
referendums, among other non-election-related purposes.467

The regulation of political broadcasting is motivated by the "fear of the societal
consequences of unbridled private control of an especially potent form of
communication,"468 although the potency of television and radio is arguably being diluted
by other media. The prohibition on paid political broadcasting also aims to reduce demand
for campaign funds among political parties and candidates, which theoretically helps to
address corruption, equality, and fairness concerns.

As discussed above, the European Court of Human Rights upheld the ban on paid political
advertising in Animal Defenders.469 A "strong cultural antipathy to political advertising"470 in
the UK also supports the continuing existence of the ban.

      9.2.3 Third-Party Campaign Financing

The RPA governs third-party campaigns in relation to candidates in either a ward for a local
municipal government election or a constituency for a UK general election. Broader
campaigns for or against a political party or category of candidates, or on policies or issues
associated with a party or category of candidates, are governed by PPERA.471

The regulation of third-party campaigners in the UK mirrors the regulation of political
parties and candidates. Third-party campaigners are subject to spending limits and, if they
spend above a certain amount, they are required to comply with reporting requirements and
source restrictions for donations.

that registered parties may choose for each television broadcast a length of 2'40", 3'40", or 4'40" and
a length of up to 2'30" for each radio broadcast, and that political broadcasts are required to be aired
between 5:30 pm and 11:30 pm on television and between 6:00 am and 10:00 pm on radio. In the
context of general elections, paragraphs one and eight state that the relevant licensed broadcasters
are "licensed public service television channel[s]" and "national (i.e., UK-wide, commercial)
analogue radio service[s]."

          9.2.3.1 Activities Captured by Third-Party Campaign Regulations

a) PPERA

          (i) Meaning of "Recognised" Third Party

"Third party" is defined in PPERA as "any person or body other than a registered party,"472
or a registered party if it campaigns to promote the electoral success of other parties or
candidates from other parties.

PPERA creates a scheme of unregistered and registered, or "recognised" third parties for
general national elections. Unregistered third-party campaigners can only spend up to a
certain amount on controlled expenditures during the regulated period and are then
required to register. Once registered, they become a "recognised third party" with a much
higher spending limit, and are subject to various other requirements, such as reporting
requirements.473

          (ii) Definition of "Controlled Expenditure"

As mentioned above, once a third party reaches a certain threshold of "controlled
expenditure," they must register and meet various requirements. The definition of
controlled expenditure in section 85 of PPERA has two components. First, a controlled
expenditure is an expense incurred by or on behalf of the third party that falls under Part 1
of Schedule 8A, which includes expenses incurred for the "production or publication of
material ... made available to the public in whatever form and by whatever means,"474
canvassing or market research, press conferences, and public rallies other than annual
conferences of the third party, among other things. Various expenses are excluded from the
definition, such as expenses incurred by an individual to provide volunteer services on their
own time.475 Second, a controlled expenditure must be capable of being reasonably
"regarded as intended to promote or procure the electoral success"476 of a party and its
candidates or of a particular category of parties or candidates. A category of parties or
candidates may be characterized by, for example, a policy position.477 A third party
promotes the electoral success of parties or candidates if it engages in "prejudicing the
electoral prospects ... of other parties or candidates.478

Promoting electoral success also does not require express mention of any party or
candidate,479 nor does the expenditure need to be solely for the purpose of promoting a party

or candidate's electoral success in order to fit within the definition of controlled
expenditure.480

In its guidance for non-party campaigners, the Electoral Commission has superimposed an
alternative or additional two-step test for determining whether spending on an activity is a
controlled expenditure under PPERA. The first step is the "purpose test," which involves
asking whether the activity can reasonably be regarded as intended to influence voters to
vote for or against a party or category of candidates.481 The purpose test will be met if the
activity promotes or opposes policies so closely associated with the party or category of
candidates that it can reasonably be regarded as intended to influence voters.482 The second
step is the "public test," which involves asking whether the activity is aimed at, seen by or
heard by the public or involves the public.483 The "public" does not include members of the
non-party campaigner organization or its "committed supporters."484

b) The RPA

Under the RPA, persons other than the candidate, the candidate's election agent, and those
authorized by the election agent are subject to regulations if they incur expenses for matters
such as public meetings or advertising with a view to promoting or procuring the election
of a candidate.485

          9.2.3.2 Contributions to Recognised Third Parties under PPERA

Under PPERA, donations to recognised third parties are not capped but are subject to other
requirements if their value exceeds 500, such as reporting requirements.486 The reporting
requirements are discussed in Section 9.2.3.4. Donations of over 500 to recognised third
parties for the purpose of controlled expenditures are only allowed from permissible donors,
just like donations to political parties.487 In relation to a recognised third party, donations
are defined as gifts; sponsorship; membership fees; and the provision of goods, services, and
facilities, among other things, but volunteer services do not count as a donation.488

          9.2.3.3 Spending by Third Parties

a) PPERA

The spending limits for recognised third parties in different parts of the UK apply for 365
days before a parliamentary general election,489 but expenses incurred before the regulated
period will count toward the limit if they are incurred for property, services or facilities that
are used during this regulated period.490 Again, under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011, if
approval for an election occurs before the standard four years date, the spending limits do
not apply retroactively for the period of the previous 365 days.491

Recognised third parties have a higher spending limit than unregistered third parties. In
England, the limit on controlled, non-targeted expenditures by a recognised third party is
2% of the maximum campaign expenditure limit for England.492 The "maximum campaign
expenditure limit" refers to the maximum amount a political party is allowed to spend in a
particular part of the UK.493 A recognised third party may not spend more than 0.05% of the
maximum campaign expenditure limit in any one constituency.494 If a recognised third party
exceeds the spending limit, they will commit an offence under PPERA if they reasonably
ought to have known that their expenditures would exceed the limit.495

If a registered third party's spending is "targeted" at convincing voters to vote for a specific
party, and the spending is approved by that party, the third party can spend whatever
amount the party approves up to the maximum limit. However, if the spending is targeted
in favour of one party but not approved by that party, then the spending limit is much lower
(approximately 6% of the maximum limit).496 This allowance for express, authorized
coordination of campaigning by a party and third party raises obvious questions concerning
the party's political feeling. If they win the election, they may have a sense of obligation to
return the favour of the third party's targeted support.

Unregistered third parties can spend up to 20,000 in England and up to 10,000 in each of
Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland on controlled expenditures in the 365 days before a
parliamentary general election.497 Like recognised third parties, unregistered third parties
are prohibited from spending more than 0.05% of the maximum campaign expenditure in a

particular constituency.498 If a third party exceeds these limits without registering, they will
commit an offence under PPERA.499

b) The RPA

Under the RPA, third parties can spend up to 700 campaigning for the election of a
candidate after the date the person becomes a candidate.500 Expenses incurred before the
person becomes a candidate will count toward this limit if incurred for something to be used
after the candidacy begins.501 A person becomes a candidate the day Parliament is dissolved.
If a person's intention to become a candidate is not expressed until after dissolution, they
will become a candidate on the date this intention is declared or the date of the person's
nomination, whichever is earlier.502

          9.2.3.4 Transparency Requirements for Third-Party Campaigners

a) Attribution

Under PPERA, published election material is required to contain the names and addresses
of the printer, promoter, and person on whose behalf it is published.503 The "promoter" is
defined as "the person causing the material to be published."504 "Election material" is
defined as "material which can reasonably be regarded as intended to promote or procure
electoral success"505 for a registered party, for a category of registered parties or for a
category of candidates. For example, if a company causes material to be published in support
of a registered party, the company's name and address is required to appear on the material.

b) Reporting Requirements

          (i) PPERA

Unregistered third parties have no disclosure obligations. However, recognised third parties
are required to prepare a return if they incur any controlled expenditures during the 365
days before polling day.506 The return is required to include a statement of payments made
in respect of controlled expenditures and a statement of donations received for the purpose
of controlled expenditures for the relevant election.507 For donations from permissible
donors with a value of more than 7,500, the return is required to state the amount or nature
of the donation, the date it was received, and information about the donor.508 The total value
of all donations worth more than 500 and that do not exceed 7,500 is also required to be

reported.509 If a recognised third party incurs more than 250,000 for controlled expenditures
during the 365 days before polling day, they are required to also submit an auditor's report
with their return.510

          (ii) The RPA

If a third-party campaigner incurs expenses that require authorization by a candidate's
election agent, such as expenses totalling over 700, the third party is required to submit a
return stating the amount of the expenses and the candidate for whom they were incurred.511
The return is required to be submitted within 21 days after the election results are
declared.512 If the expenses are under 700, meaning the candidate's election agent need not
authorize the expenses, the Electoral Commission may nonetheless require the third party
to submit a return that either shows the expenses incurred or contains a statement that the
expenses were 200 or less.513

          9.2.3.5 Rules Governing Specific Types of Third Parties

a) Companies

Companies are required to obtain a resolution from their members authorizing political
donations or expenditures in advance.514 A resolution is not required unless the donation
exceeds 5,000 by itself or in combination with other political donations made in the 12-
month period leading up to the donation.515 The resolution "must be expressed in general
terms ... and must not purport to authorize particular donations or expenditure."516 The
resolution is in effect for four years.517

b) Trade Unions

Trade unions are required to ballot their members to establish a separate political fund for
political donations and expenditures.518 Members are required to opt in to contribute to the
union's political fund and may withdraw their opt-in notice at any time.519 Further, the trade
union is required to take all reasonable steps to notify members of their right to withdraw
from contributing to the political fund.520

Trade unions are required to provide detailed information in annual returns regarding
payments out of their political fund if those payments exceed 2,000 in a calendar year.521
For example, if a union contributes to a third-party campaigning organisation, the union's
annual return is required to include the name of the organisation, the amount paid to that
organisation, the names of the political parties or candidates that the union hoped to support
through the expenditure, and the amount of the expenditure spent in relation to each
political party or candidate.522

c) Unincorporated Associations

If an unincorporated association donates or lends over 25,000 in a year to a registered party
or recognised third party, the association is required to report to the Electoral Commission
any gifts over 7,500 received by the association before and after the association makes the
political contribution.523 The Electoral Commission is required to maintain a register of gifts
reported to them by unincorporated associations.524

      9.2.4 Role of the Electoral Commission

The Electoral Commission supervises compliance with PPERA and other electoral law
statutes, such as the RPA.525 It has the power to demand the production of documents or
records of income and expenditure, copy those documents and records, and enter the
premises of an individual or organization to retrieve those documents and records.526 Failure
to deliver documents to the Electoral Commission can lead to civil penalties.527 The police,
however, are responsible for initiating enforcement actions for criminal offences under
PPERA. 528

Since 2009, four out of nine commissioners on the Electoral Commission have been
nominated by the political parties.529 This was introduced in response to criticisms that the
commissioners, who formerly could not be members of parties or have held political office
in the last ten years, were too apolitical and did not understand the "practical workings of
political parties."530

9.3 Criticisms of Campaign Finance Regulation

A heavily criticized aspect of the UK's campaign finance regime is the absence of donation
caps.531 Even though most campaign finance scandals in the UK involve donations, only
spending is capped.532 Uncapped donations allow reliance on a small number of large
donors, which raises concerns regarding corruption, equality, fairness, and public
confidence.533 Admittedly, the UK's spending limits might relieve the need for big donations
to some extent by reducing the demand for money. In addition, transparency requirements
supposedly deter large donations through negative press attention. For example, after the
disclosure requirements in PPERA came into force in 2000, the media seized on instances in
which large donors to the Labour Party obtained some benefit from the government around
the same time they made donations.534 The resulting scandal may have deterred future large
donors.535 However, Fisher notes this deterrence did not appear to be at work in the 2008
and 2010 elections.536 Fisher argues further that, in spite of PPERA's spending limits, the
demand for money among parties has continued unabated, especially after the devolution
of power to Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland and associated extra elections.537 The
major parties' reliance on large donations could also be exacerbated by "the decline of other
forms of party income."538

Others criticize PPERA's spending limits for leaving out local, constituency-level party
branches.539 As noted by Ron Johnston and Charles Pattie, candidates are subject to stricter
regulation than parties at the constituency level.540 They argue in favour of stricter regulation
for local party units, particularly in light of the importance of local party branches in
campaigning for marginal seats and the apparent effectiveness of local campaigning.541
Fisher adds that spending at the constituency level will only become more important as
volunteer campaigning drops with falling party membership.542

531 According to Fisher, one reason for the UK's failure to impose a donation ceiling is the Labour
Party's structure of affiliated trade unions: see Fisher, supra note 372 at 161.
532 Ewing & Rowbottom, supra note 103 at 77.
533 For example, in the Brexit referendum, which was subject to similar rules as general elections, ten
donors were responsible for over half of donations to the campaigns and 100 donors were
responsible for 95% of all reported donations: Steve Goodrich, Take Back Control: How Big Money
Undermines Trust in Politics, ed by Duncan Hames (London: Transparency International UK, 2016) at

534 Ewing, supra note 165 at 63.
535 The scandals also led the Labour Party to set up extra "safeguards," for example, the party
instituted a requirement that donors sign a statement declaring that they are not seeking personal or
commercial benefits: ibid at 67.

toward the national party's spending limits. See Section 9.2.1.1.

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

Criticism has also been directed toward the source restrictions and transparency
requirements for political donations. Rowbottom argues that the permissible donor scheme
can be circumvented through the use of corporate vehicles.543 For example, a foreign national
could effectively make a political donation through a company carrying on business in the
UK, as long as the company did not act as an agent for the foreign national.544 Lesser
transparency requirements in Northern Ireland, where donors need not be disclosed, may
also allow circumvention of PPERA's transparency rules. For example, the Democratic
Unionist Party of Northern Ireland caused controversy after accepting a 425,000 donation
for the purpose of pro-Brexit advertising in England and Scotland.545 The party was not
required by the law of Northern Ireland to disclose the source of the donation, even though
the advertising took place outside of Northern Ireland.

Complexity is another problem plaguing the UK's campaign finance regime. Navraj
Ghaleigh observes that PPERA's labyrinthine intricacy "impose[s] a regulatory burden that
risks unintended consequences."546 Volunteers at the local party level are unlikely to fully
understand the requirements of PPERA's "heavily amended" provisions, which could lead
to fears of liability and a chilling effect.547 Gauja and Orr also note that the introduction of
stricter third-party campaigning regulations in 2014 could hinder the ability of voluntary
organizations to "speak on issues of concern," creating a "chilling effect on democracy."548
Some organizations may be unable to pay for independent legal advice to sort out the
complex third-party rules, although the Electoral Commission releases guidance for third-
party campaigners under section 3 of the Transparency of Non-Party Campaigning Act.549 Small
political parties may also lack the resources to meet reporting requirements, although the
Electoral Commission may provide some assistance.550

ultimate source of this type of donation could remain murky. As discussed in Section 9.2.1.2(b),
under PPERA, parties may, under certain circumstances, accept donations from an unincorporated
association without inquiring into the identities of the individuals funding the unincorporated
association.

The UK's ban on paid political advertising on broadcast media has drawn criticism for its
impact on freedom of expression, particularly in relation to public interest organizations.551
Critics argue the ban is overbroad since it captures "not just political parties but social
advocacy groups seeking to take part in debate about matters of controversy."552 Using
Amnesty International as an example, Barendt explains that the ban may preclude charities
from running short advertisements on radio or television.553 To Barendt, this constitutes "a
monstrous and unjustifiable infringement of freedom of expression."554 The case of Animal
Defenders, which involved advertisements funded by an animal welfare organization,
arguably provided an example of overbreadth. As noted by three of the dissenting justices
in that case, nobody was suggesting that Animal Defenders International "was a financially
powerful body with the aim or possibility of ... unduly distorting the public debate."555 Five
other dissenting justices in Animal Defenders argued further that "the prohibition applied to
the most protected form of expression (public interest speech), by one of the most important
actors in the democratic process (an NGO) and on one of the most influential media
(broadcasting)." 556

Critics also observe that the ban on paid political advertising prevents public interest groups
from responding to commercial advertising on broadcast media. As Lewis points out,
"under the current state of affairs a car manufacturer may advertise its SUVs on television
without limit (finances permitting), but an NGO wishing to publicize the impact of such
vehicles on the environment is prohibited, by law, from doing so."557 Similarly, in Barendt's
view:

          It can make no sense to allow commercial ads for automobiles and gas and
          other products associated with driving, or to allow the government to insert
          public service adverts ... but not to allow groups to pay for political adverts
          to make the opposite case.558

551 The ban's impact on political parties is less extreme, since broadcasters are required to provide
parties with airtime for party political broadcasts. See Animal Defenders ECHR, supra note 385,
dissenting judgement of Tulkens J at para 14.

and was not necessary in a democratic society.

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

Critics of the ban on paid political advertising maintain that less restrictive options exist to
level the playing field of public debate.559 Barendt argues that lawmakers can prevent "the
domination of politics by ultra rich ... groups" through spending limits on advertising and
restrictions on "the number of spots which could be purchased."560 Both supporters and
critics of the ban also question why it applies only to broadcast media.561 Television and
radio are declining in importance, while digital advertising, particularly on social media
websites, is growing in importance. As a result, the goal of promoting a level playing field
is undermined by the lack of regulation governing digital political advertisements, leading
some commentators to argue that regulation should be extended to non-broadcast media.562

Other criticisms of UK campaign finance law include the parsimoniousness of the public
funding regime, which derives partly from public hostility toward the public funding of
election campaigns.563 Keith Ewing and Jacob Rowbottom also point to holes in the reporting
requirements for third parties. Regulations do not cover internal communications between
organizations and their members, while some third parties, like newspaper companies, are
excluded altogether.564 In addition, Ghaleigh criticizes the lack of sanctioning options for
contraventions of PPERA. The Electoral Commission may either issue a reprimand, which
is essentially "nothing," or refer the matter to the criminal prosecution authorities, which
may be overly heavy-handed in some cases.565 Finally, because of the Electoral
Commission's "broad range of duties," some critics warn against the "risk of
overburdening." 566

10. CANADA

Canada's federal campaign finance regime is more extensive than the regulatory regime in
the US or the UK. In Canada, both contributions and expenditures are capped. A
"remarkable degree of consensus"567 exists regarding the need for campaign expenditure
ceilings for parties and candidates, with no constitutional challenges or significant
legislative proposals targeting caps. Third-party spending limits have been challenged but
upheld by the Supreme Court of Canada (SCC).568 Further, in 2003, Parliament introduced

Broadcasting Ban on Advocacy Advertising" (2003) 66:2 Mod L Rev 224; Sarah Sackman, "Debating

560 Minutes of Evidence, supra note 553. See also Sackman, supra note 559 at 482. Barendt also suggests
that radio and television can be distinguished from each other in designing a regulatory regime, as
the price of advertising on radio "would not be extortionate." Thus, the potential for distortion by
the wealthy is smaller in the context of radio advertising: Minutes of Evidence, supra note 553.

"one of the most generous schemes for public funding of political parties that has been seen
in a liberal democracy,"569 although an important element of that scheme was repealed in
2014.

10.1 Constitutional Rights and Campaign Finance Regulation

      10.1.1 Freedom of Expression

Freedom of expression is enshrined in section 2(b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and
Freedoms (the Charter). In R v Keegstra,570 the SCC stated that "[t]he connection between
freedom of expression and the political process is perhaps the linchpin of the section 2(b)
guarantee, and the nature of this connection is largely derived from the Canadian
commitment to democracy." The test for determining whether legislation infringes section
2(b) is found in Irwin Toy Ltd v Quebec.571 First, a court will ask whether the activity in
question fits within the sphere of activities protected by freedom of expression. This first
step is established easily in regards to election-related communications, as political
expression "lies at the core of the guarantee of free expression."572 Second, a court will ask
whether the legislation's purpose or effect is to restrict freedom of expression.

Freedom of association is protected under section 2(d) of the Charter. According to the SCC,
section 2(d) facilitates the exercise of other freedoms and guarantees the ability to exercise
Charter rights collectively.573 The right to vote is protected under section 3 of the Charter.

Once an infringement of a Charter right is established, courts consider section 1 of the Charter.
Section 1 allows the impugned law to stand if the limit on the right in question is reasonable
and demonstrably justifiable in a free and democratic society. At the section 1 stage of the
analysis, courts ask whether the objective of the impugned law is pressing and substantial
and whether the means chosen by the legislature are proportionate to its ends. In
considering proportionality, the courts ask whether the means are rationally connected to
the law's objectives, whether the impairment of Charter rights is as little as is reasonably
possible and whether the deleterious and salutary effects of the law are proportionate.574

      10.1.2 Constitutional Validity of Campaign Finance Regulation

          10.1.2.1 Canada v Somerville

Spending limits for third-party campaigners (individuals, businesses, unions, and other
organizations) have been challenged several times in Canada. Although the SCC upheld
limits in Harper,575 discussed further below, the Alberta Court of Appeal earlier struck down

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

a CDN$1,000 cap on third-party spending on election advertising in Somerville.576 According
to the Alberta Court of Appeal in Somerville, third-party spending limits "severely limit[ed]"
the communicative power of third parties, thus violating their right to freedom of
expression.577 The spending limits also constituted a limit on freedom of association since
they prevented people from combining "resources to pursue common goals, influence
others, exchange ideas and effect change."578 Further, the Alberta Court of Appeal found
that the impugned provisions violated the right to vote under section 3 of the Charter. In the
Court's view, the limits had "the effect of obstructing citizens' access to information to such
an extent that the right to cast an `informed vote' is breached."579

The Court held that the impugned provisions could not be justified under section 1 of the
Charter. Without effective third-party advertising, citizens would only be as informed "as
the news media, the parties and the candidates themselves want the citizens to be."580 The
Court rejected the government's argument that the law was intended to prevent distortion
of the political process. Rather, in the Court's view, the spending limits had the unacceptable
objective of preserving the preferential position of political parties by preventing third
parties from being "heard in any effective way."581

          10.1.2.2 Libman v Quebec

In Libman, the SCC struck down a provision in the province of Quebec that restricted third-
party campaigning in referendums.582 The statutory provisions at issue in the Libman case
allowed only minimal spending by individuals or groups that did not become affiliated
organizations of the official, registered committees in a referendum. These restrictions led
the SCC to conclude that the entire law was unconstitutional as it did much more than
"minimally impair" the freedom of expression of these individuals and groups, and
therefore failed that part of the section 1 Charter analysis.583

However, in Libman, the SCC accepted in principle the constitutionality of third-party
spending limits in referendums and elections. The SCC found that the three objectives of the
legislation were pressing and substantial. The first objective was the egalitarian goal of
ensuring the wealthy do not have a "dis-proportionate influence by dominating the
referendum debate."584 Second, the spending limits aimed to facilitate informed voting "by
ensuring some positions are not buried by others."585 The third objective was to encourage

public confidence by demonstrating that the political process is not "dominated by the
power of money."586

Moving to the next stage of the section 1 analysis, the SCC found that the third-party
spending limits were rationally connected to their three objectives.587 Based on the report of
the Lortie Commission,588 the SCC remarked that third-party spending must be limited to
ensure the effectiveness of party and candidate spending limits, which are, in turn, key to
electoral fairness.589 The SCC also accepted that third-party spending limits must be lower
than limits for candidates and parties because private resources are unlikely to be spread
equally across candidates and policy positions.590 If limits are too high, third-party spending
could produce "disproportionate" and unfair advantages for certain candidates.591

The SCC stated in Libman that it was up to the legislature to decide what larger amount non-
affiliated groups and individuals should be allowed to spend on paid advertising during a
referendum. However, it strongly suggested that it agreed with the Lortie Commission's
proposal of a CDN$1,000 limit at the national level and a proportionally lower amount at a
provincial level.592 In doing so, the SCC explicitly rejected the Alberta Court of Appeal's
ruling in Somerville that found a limit of CDN$1,000 on ad spending by a third party during
a federal election (along with a requirement to disclose the sponsor of each ad and a
prohibition on colluding with anyone else to exceed the limit) to be unconstitutional because
it was much lower than the spending limit for parties and candidates.593

          10.1.2.3 Harper v Canada

Despite the Libman precedent, in the subsequent Harper case filed in the fall of 2000, the
courts in Alberta continued to reject a limit on third-party advertising spending even though
the limit had been increased by the federal government significantly, leading through
appeals to the SCC's 2004 ruling in the case. Libman set the stage for Harper, in which the
SCC upheld third-party spending limits and accepted that Parliament may choose an
"egalitarian model of elections."594 The impugned provisions of the Canada Elections Act (the
CEA) limited third-party spending on "election advertising" to CDN$150,000, of which only
CDN$3,000 could be spent in a given electoral district.595 Election advertising includes taking
a position on an issue with which a candidate is associated, otherwise known as issue
advertising. The SCC also upheld registration and disclosure requirements for third parties.

Although the impugned spending limits infringed freedom of expression, the majority of
the SCC found the infringement was justified. The spending limits had the pressing and

substantial objectives of reducing the domination of political discourse by the wealthy,
preventing circumvention of candidate and party spending limits, and enhancing public
confidence in the electoral system.596 The spending limits also satisfied the proportionality
test under section 1 of the Charter. At this stage of the analysis, the majority emphasized the
need for "deference to the balance Parliament has struck between political expression and
meaningful participation."597

The challenger, Stephen Harper, who would later win the 2006 election and become Prime
Minister of Canada, led a third-party group called the National Citizens Coalition. Harper
argued that the impugned third-party spending limits unjustifiably infringed the right to
vote in section 3 of the Charter by hindering electoral debate. However, the majority of the
SCC held that the impugned provisions actually enhanced the right to vote. Section 3
imports the "right to play a meaningful role in the electoral process,"598 but this does not
confer the right "to mount a media campaign capable of determining the outcome"599 of an
election. Rather, the right to "play a meaningful role in the electoral process" encompasses
the right to an informed vote. Since "unequal dissemination of points of view undermines
the voter's ability to be informed," measures that promote "equality in the political
discourse,"600 such as the impugned spending limits, facilitate informed voting and
meaningful participation.

The majority of the SCC framed Harper as a clash between the right to meaningful
participation under section 3 and the right to freedom of expression under section 2(b).601 In
this case, the right to meaningful participation prevailed. The majority warned, however,
that spending limits must not be so low that conveying information becomes impossible, as
this could jeopardize the "informational component of the right to vote."602 Parliament must
therefore find a middle road between overly stringent restrictions on the dissemination of
information and overly permissive spending ceilings that allow some speakers to drown out
others.

The dissent disagreed on the location of this middle road, but did not explicitly reject the
constitutionality of all third-party spending limits. In light of the expense involved in mass
communication, the dissent viewed the impugned spending ceiling as so low that it
"effectively denies the right of an ordinary citizen to give meaningful and effective
expression to [their] political views during a federal election campaign."603 As a result,
"effective communication" during elections was "confined to registered political parties and
their candidates."604 This could lead to inadequate coverage of viewpoints and issues

unpopular with parties and candidates.605 The spending caps, therefore, undermine "the
right to listen" and "curtail the diversity of perspectives heard."606

Feasby notes that the CEA's third-party spending limits could be vulnerable to a fresh
Charter challenge. In Harper, the majority held that evidence of a reasoned apprehension of
harm is sufficient to justify an infringement of freedom of expression in cases involving
"inconclusive or conflicting social science evidence of harm."607 However, since Harper, more
evidence on third-party spending has become available owing to the accumulation of data
from third-party disclosure requirements.608 The disclosed information suggests there is
little "appetite amongst third parties for big money campaigns."609

          10.1.2.4 Reference re Election Act (BC)

Advertising spending limits for third parties between elections have been set in a few
jurisdictions in Canada, but only for 40-60 days before a fixed date election campaign period
begins. In the only two rulings on a pre-election limit, both by the Court of Appeal in the
province of British Columbia (BC), the limit was rejected as unconstitutional based on the
overbroad definition of advertising in the statutory provision.610 The definition covered not
only advertising that promoted or opposed a candidate or party, but also advertising about
issues. As a result, the limit did not minimally impair freedom of expression. In the first case,
the provision was also ruled unconstitutional because the advertising restriction period
overlapped with the sitting of the legislature which, the court concluded, is an important
time period for allowing third parties to advocate their views.611

In November 2017, the BC legislature again amended its provincial election law to limit
third-party ad spending (including on canvassing by phone or in person and on mailings)
during the 60-day period before the election campaign period and during election
campaigns. However, for the pre-election period, the law attempts to address the concerns
expressed in the court rulings with a more specific limit that only applies to advertising that
"directly promotes or opposes"612 a party or candidate (during the election campaign period,

issue-related advertising is also limited). The new BC statutory provisions have not, as of

10.2 Regulatory Regime

This section describes the campaign financing regime for federal parliamentary elections in
Canada. Federal campaign financing is governed by the CEA,613 which was most recently
amended by Bill C-50614 and Bill C-76, in ways that affect the political finance system.615 Both
bills were enacted in December 2018, with some provisions of Bill C-76 coming into effect in
spring 2019. Each province has also enacted its own regime in relation to campaign financing
for elections to the provincial legislative assemblies.

The primary features of the federal regime are:

     a) contribution limits for political parties and candidates, including nomination
          contest candidates and political party leadership candidates;

     b) source restrictions on contributions to political parties and candidates, and to
          third-parties only in terms of a prohibition on foreign funding;

     c) spending limits for third-parties, political parties, and candidates, including
          nomination race contestants, but not party leadership contestants as a party is
          allowed to set its own limit for its leadership race;

     d) transparency requirements for third-parties, political parties, and all types of
          candidates; and

     e) a public funding scheme involving reimbursements and tax credits and free
          broadcast advertising time.

Unlike regulatory regimes in the UK and the US, the federal regime in Canada limits both
the supply of and demand for money in elections, as politicians are subject to limits on the
size of donations they may receive and the amount of money they may spend on election
campaigns. By contrast, the federal regime in the US imposes caps only on political
contributions, not spending. The UK, on the other hand, imposes spending caps on
politicians and third-party campaigners, but has no contribution ceilings.

      10.2.1 Campaign Financing

          10.2.1.1 Spending Limits

The provisions discussed in this section apply to expenditures by candidates, registered
political parties, registered electoral district associations, nomination contestants, and
leadership contestants.

a) Expenses Captured by Spending Limits

The spending limits in the CEA apply to "election expenses," which are defined in section
376(1). Election expenses include any costs incurred or non-monetary contributions received
by a registered party or candidate for goods or services used to directly promote or oppose
a party, its leader, or a candidate during an election period. The definition also expressly
includes some specific types of expenses, such as costs incurred or non-monetary
contributions provided for the production of promotional material and for the publication
or broadcast of that material.616 Other specific types of expenses include: expenses to make
campaign activities and materials accessible to people with disabilities, travel and living
expenses for the candidate, personal expenses of the candidate, and some litigation
expenses.617 "Expenses" are defined in section 349 to include the commercial value of
products (property) or services that are donated or provided, other than volunteer labour.618
The "election period" begins when the writ is issued and ends on polling day.619 Expenses
outside of this period are not included in the definition of election expenses. Given their
campaigns are different from general elections, with often a more extended campaign
period, slightly different definitions of "expenses" apply to nomination race contestants620
and party leadership race contestants.621 Still, the categories of exclusions are the same other
than the exclusion for accessibility expenses.

Bill C-76, established a new, pre-election period. If an election is held on the fixed date (the
third day in October every four years) the pre-election period begins June 30th and ends the
day the election period begins.622 During this period, spending by parties on partisan
advertising623 is limited.624 However, the limit is so high that it is essentially meaningless as

621 Ibid, ss 379.1-379.4.
622 Ibid, s 2(1).
623 Partisan advertising is defined as advertising that promotes or opposes a party, nomination
contestant, candidate, or party leadership contestant (if a party happens to be having a leadership
race at that time).
624 Ibid, s 429.1, 429.2.

                                                                                                         1153
GLOBAL CORRUPTION

no party will likely spend that much on advertising during the pre-election period.625 In
2019, the limit was slightly more than CDN$2 million and it increases annually at the rate of
inflation. If the election is not held on the fixed election date, then the provisions concerning
the pre-election period are not in force.

b) Spending Limits

          (i) Registered Parties

A registered party's election expenses limit is calculated by multiplying an amount of money
per registered voter (CDN$1.06 in 2019, increased annually at the rate of inflation) by the
number of voters in all electoral districts in which the party has candidates.626 If the election
period lasts longer than 36 days, the limit is increased by a certain amount for each day
beyond the 36 day period. Typically, the election period is between 36-42 days. For example,
in the 40 day pre-election period of the 2019 election, expense limits for parties with
candidates in every district was a typical amount of approximately CDN$29 million.
However, in the 2015 general election that lasted 78 days, parties that had candidates in
every electoral district had spending limits of approximately CDN$54.9 million.627 Bill C-76
amended the CEA to limit the election period to 50 days maximum.628 Transfers of funds
from a registered party to its candidates do not count toward the spending limit under the
CEA.629 The CEA also expressly prohibits a registered party and a third party from colluding
to circumvent the spending limit630 and from sharing information to coordinate campaign
activities.631

          (ii) Candidates

The election expense limit for each candidate in each electoral district is calculated by
multiplying the number of voters in the district by amounts of money per registered voter
(with higher amounts for the initial 15,000, and then 10,000, voters in the district). Amounts
increase annually at the rate of inflation.632 The expense limit is higher in districts with low
population density because of increased costs of travel to reach voters.633

For example, in the 2019 election, the approximate limits for districts across Canada varied
from a low of CDN$86,000 to a high of CDN$145,000, with an average of CDN$110,000.634
The limit is increased if the election period lasts longer than 36 days up to the maximum
election period of 50 days.635 Like registered parties, candidates, and their agents and
associates are prohibited from colluding with third parties to circumvent the spending
limit636 and from sharing information to coordinate campaign activities.637 The Chief
Electoral Officer may also establish categories of personal expenses and fix maximum
amounts that may be incurred by election candidates.638 However, at the time of writing, no
personal expense limits appear to exist.

For a contestant in a nomination contest to become an election candidate, the expense limit
is 20% of the limit for a candidate in the previous election in that district (unless the district
boundaries have changed since the last election).639

As noted above, spending limits for political party leadership contests are set by the party's
governing body. A party is required to give the Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) notice of when
the contest will begin and end.640

          (iii) Electoral District Associations

During the election period, electoral district associations of registered parties are prohibited
from transmitting election advertising or incurring any expenses for election advertising.641
Associations are only permitted to produce and place partisan advertising messages during
the pre-election period (if the pre-election period provisions apply) if they are limited
substantially to the district or if they are provided or sold to the association's party.642

          10.2.1.2 Contributions

The provisions discussed in this section apply to contributions to candidates, registered
political parties, registered electoral district associations, nomination contestants, and
leadership contestants.

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

a) Definition of "Contribution"

Under the CEA, a "contribution" can be monetary or non-monetary (property, use of
property, and services) and includes money from a candidate's own funds.643 Non-monetary
transactions or contributions are required to be at fair market value.644 Loans are only
allowed from registered financial institutions and individuals, and the outstanding amount
of a loan from an individual cannot exceed an individual's contribution limit when
combined with any other contributions made by that individual.645 Transfers and loans
between the party, its electoral district associations, and its candidates are not included
under the definition of contribution.646 Thus, the CEA targets "money being transferred from
the private to the political domain,"647 not transfers within the political domain. Other
exclusions from the definition of contribution include annual party membership fees of
CDN$25 or less.648 However, the CEA expressly includes fees for party and leadership
conventions within the definition of contribution.649 The CEA also clarifies that, if a
candidate or party sells tickets to a campaign fundraising event, the amount of the
contribution will be the difference between the price of the ticket and its fair market value.650

b) Source Restrictions

Contributions are only permitted from individuals who are Canadian citizens or permanent
residents.651 Similarly, loans are permitted only from certain financial institutions or from
individuals who are Canadian citizens or permanent residents.652 This means corporations
(other than financial institutions), unions, and other non-natural legal persons cannot donate
or make loans to a political party or candidate. However, these entities can make
contributions to third parties for the purpose of election advertising, as discussed further
below, or engage as a third party in campaigning themselves.

Members of Parliament (MPs) are prohibited by various provisions and Elections Canada's
enforcement policy from using the MP resources or staff time to contribute in support of
their own campaign during the pre-election period (if they are running for re-election) or to
support nomination or party leadership contestants when those contests occur.653

Attempts to conceal the identity of the source of a contribution are prohibited by section 368
of the CEA. Indirect contributions and loans are also prohibited, as source restrictions and
contribution limits could otherwise be circumvented.654 This means an individual cannot
make a contribution using money from another person or entity that was provided for the
purpose of making a contribution.655

c) Contribution Limits

In 2021, individuals may contribute (in money, property, use of property and/or services the
individual would usually charge for) no more than a total of CDN$1,650 per calendar year
to a particular registered party and no more than CDN$1,650 per calendar year as an overall
combined total to the registered electoral district associations, candidates, and nomination
contestants of a registered party.656 The limit automatically increases by $25 annually.657 The
same limit applies to contributions to political party leadership contestants.658

As mentioned above, the outstanding amount of any loans made by an individual counts
toward their contribution limit.659 However, banks and other federally regulated financial
institutions are allowed to loan an unlimited amount of money to district associations,
candidates, contestants, and political parties. This is, arguably, one of the most unethical
aspects of Canada's system. Since, usually, every party has a bank loan to finance its election
campaign, MPs may have a conflict of interest when addressing proposals concerning
financial institutions and financial services issues.660

Candidates are allowed to contribute up to CDN$5,000 to their own campaign, and
leadership contestants are allowed to contribute up to CDN$25,000 to their own campaign.661
Section 368(1) of the CEA prohibits attempts to circumvent contribution limits.

          10.2.1.3 Transparency Requirements

a) Registered Parties

Registered parties are required to submit an election expenses return to the Chief Electoral
Officer after a general election, along with an auditor's report and a declaration by the
party's chief agent that the return is complete and accurate.662 The return is required to set
out all election expenses incurred and non-monetary-contributions used as election
expenses.663 Aside from this election-expense reporting requirement, registered parties are

also subject to ongoing reporting requirements. Each quarter, and annually by July 1st of
each year covering the previous calendar year, the party's chief agent is required to provide
the Chief Electoral Officer with a financial transactions return, along with an auditor's report
and a declaration by the chief agent that the return is complete and accurate.664 The financial
transactions return is required to set out contributions received by the party during the
quarter or year; the number of contributors; the name and address of contributors who gave
more than CDN$200; the value of goods, services, or funds transferred by the registered
party to a candidate or electoral district association (and vice versa); and a statement of
election expenses incurred in by-elections during the fiscal period, among other things.665

Parties are also required to disclose in or on an election advertising message that the message
has been authorized by the official agent of the party.666

Bill C-50 in 2018 added a new disclosure requirement for parties in-between election periods.
The requirement applies to a fundraising event that will be attended by a Cabinet minister
or the leader, interim leader or leadership contestant of a registered party and an event that
is organized by a party or anyone or any entity to raise money for the party, an electoral
district registered association, nomination contestant, candidate or leadership contestant of
a registered party.667 The requirement does not apply to events that are held during an
election period at a party leadership race debate or events at a party convention with a ticket
price that amounts to a contribution of less than CDN$200 or that are to "express
appreciation" for individuals who have made a contribution to the party.668

Events that meet the disclosure requirement must be published "in a prominent location"
on the parties website prior to the event. The publication is required to include: the date,
time, and location of the event; who or what entity it is benefitting; which leader and/or
minister(s) are attending; the ticket price (and amount of the price that is a contribution);
and the event contact person.669 Within 30 days after the event, the party is required to file a
report with the Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) containing all the same information, as well as
the name and municipality of all attendees (subject to named exceptions) and a list of every
person or entity "that organized the event or any part of it."670 The CEO maintains a registry
of the events on Elections Canada's website.671

For all such fundraising events that are held during an election period, a party is required,
within 90 days after election day, to file with the CEO one report covering all the events and
containing the required information listed above.672

b) Candidates

Election candidates are required to disclose in or on an election advertising message that the
message has been authorized by the official agent of the candidate.673 A candidate's official
agent is also required to provide the CEO with an electoral campaign finance return within
four months of election day, along with an auditor's report and declaration by both the
official agent and the candidate that the return is complete and accurate.674 The return is
required to set out the candidate's election expenses, loans, contributions, and the identity
of contributors who gave more than CDN$200, among other things.675 The return is also
required to state any "electoral campaign expenses" not already reported as election
expenses.676 Electoral campaign expenses are defined as any "expense reasonably incurred
as an incidence of the election,"677 including personal expenses, travel and living expenses,
accessibility expenses, and litigation expenses. Further, the candidate is required to send
their official agent a written statement setting out personal expenses paid by the
candidate.678

For a nomination contest to select a party's election candidate in an electoral district, a party
or the district association is required to file a report with the CEO within 30 days after the
selection vote date. The report is required to set out the date of the selection vote, the
contestants' names and addresses, and the name of the winner.679 A person is considered to
be a contestant as soon as they accept a contribution, incur an expense, or borrow money,
and is required at that time to appoint a financial agent for opening and maintaining a
dedicated campaign bank account to accept contributions and make payments.680
Nomination race contestants who accept more than CDN$1,000 in contributions or spend
more than CDN$1,000 on their campaign are also required to file with the CEO, within four
months after the conclusion of the selection vote day, a campaign return that lists all
campaign expenses (including personal expenses), loans, contributions, and the identity of
contributors who gave more than CDN$200, among other things.681

Party leadership race contestants are required to register with the CEO as soon as they
receive a contribution or incur a campaign expense, including appointing and identifying
their financial agent for opening and maintaining a dedicated campaign bank account to
accept contributions and make payments, and their auditor for the campaign account.682
Unlike nomination contest and election candidates, leadership contestants who accept more
than CDN$10,000 in contributions or spend more than CDN$10,000 on their campaign are
required to file a return with the CEO covering the period from the start of their campaign
up to four weeks before the leadership voting day, and a second return one week before

voting day that covers the three-week period after the first report. Both reports are required
to list loans, contributions, and the identity of contributors who gave more than CDN$200,
among other things.683 Leadership contestants are also required to file with the CEO, within
six months after the leadership voting day, an audited campaign return that lists all
campaign expenses (including personal expenses), loans, contributions, and the identity of
contributors who gave more than CDN$200, among other things.684

c) Electoral District Associations

Electoral district associations are subject to annual reporting requirements, not election-
specific reporting requirements. This is because they are not allowed to spend money during
election periods other than transferring money to the campaign account of the association's
registered candidate. Associations are required to submit a financial transactions return to
the CEO by June 1st of each year for transactions during the previous calendar year. The
return is required to state contributions, the identity of donors who give more than
CDN$200, expenses, loans, and other items.685 The report is required to be accompanied by
an auditor's report and a declaration by the association's financial agent that the return is
complete and accurate.686

      10.2.2 Public Funding

          10.2.2.1 Quarterly Allowances

Quarterly allowances for registered parties, based on the number of votes received by a
party in the previous election (the amount in 2014 was approximately CDN$2 per vote) were
phased out by the Conservative federal government beginning in 2014. The phasing-out
process ended in 2016.687

          10.2.2.2 Reimbursement of Election Expenses

In the 2015 general election (which lasted 78 days) reimbursements of election expenses for
all registered parties and candidates totalled approximately CDN$104 million.688 On the
other hand, in the 2019 general election, reimbursements totaled CDN$64.4 million.689
Registered parties are reimbursed for 50% of their election expenses if the candidates
endorsed by the party receive at least 2% of the votes cast in the election or 5% of the votes

cast in electoral districts in which the party ran candidates.690 If a candidate gets at least 10%
of the vote but only spends 30% or less of their total spending limit, they will be reimbursed
for 15% of the total amount they were permitted to spend under section 477.49 of the CEA.691
If a candidate receives at least 10% of the vote and incurred more than 30% of the total
amount they were allowed to spend, they will be reimbursed for 60% of their paid election
expenses or 60% of the total amount they were allowed to spend, whichever is less.692
Electoral district associations may also be reimbursed up to CDN$1,500 for auditing
expenses incurred to meet the requirements of the CEA.693

          10.2.2.3 Tax Deductions

Monetary contributions to registered parties, registered electoral district associations, and
candidates entitle the donor to a tax credit under the Income Tax Act.694 The amount of the
credit is based on the size of the donation. Donations up to CDN$400 entitle the donor to a
75% tax credit. Donations over CDN$400 entitle the donor to a CDN$300 tax credit plus 50%
of the amount by which the donation exceeds CDN$400. The tax credit is decreased further
for donations over CDN$750.695 This scheme is intended to encourage small contributions
from a broad range of donors.696

          10.2.2.4 Free Broadcasting Time

Free broadcasting time is reserved and allocated to political parties for political broadcasts
during elections.697 The allocation is based on performance in the last election, but the
Broadcasting Arbitrator can modify the allocation if necessary for fairness or the public
interest.698 The allocation scheme was challenged in Reform Party of Canada v Canada on the
basis that it entrenched incumbents and therefore breached the rights of smaller parties to
freedom of expression and equality.699 However, the allocation system was upheld, although
the Broadcast Arbitrator subsequently adopted a practice of allocating one-third of the
available time equally among all registered parties.700 The Court also held that a prohibition
on the purchase of additional broadcasting time by political parties was an unjustifiable limit
on freedom of expression. This can be contrasted with the UK, in which the House of Lords
and the European Court of Human Rights have upheld a blanket ban on paid political
advertising.701

      10.2.3 Regulation of Third-Party Campaign Financing

Canada's federal campaign finance regime subscribes to the idea that political parties are
the "principal vehicles for communal political organization and expression,"702 which is
reflected in spending limits for third-party campaigners under the CEA. The Supreme Court
of Canada has echoed this idea, stating in Libman that, although third parties have an
important contribution to make, "it is the candidates and political parties that are running
for election."703

          10.2.3.1 Activities Captured by Third-Party Campaign Regulations

a) Definition of "third party"

"Third party" is defined in section 349 of the CEA as "a person or a group, other than a
candidate, registered party or electoral district association of a registered party." Thus, a
third-party campaigner could be any individual, corporation, or other organization that
promotes or opposes a candidate or political party during a pre-election or election period,
promotes an election-related issue or promotes or opposes a candidate or party.704

b) Definition of "election advertising," "partisan advertising," "partisan activity," and "election
surveys"

If a third party engages in "election advertising" as defined in the CEA, they will be subject
to the CEA's requirements in regard to spending limits, contributions received by the third
party, and transparency. The components of the election advertising include:

     - transmission to the public by any means
     - during an election period
     - of an advertising message that promotes or opposes a registered party or the

          election of a candidate.705

The definition includes an advertising message "that takes a position on an issue with which
a registered party or candidate is associated,"706 also known as issue advertising. The
election period begins when the writ is issued and ends on polling day.707

Various communications are excluded. For example, election advertising does not include:

                                                                 CHAPTER 14 CAMPAIGN FINANCE

           news releases, editorials, debates, interviews, columns and books that
                were to be published even if an election was not held;708

           the transmission of documents by an organization to its members,
                employees, or shareholders;

           the transmission of an individual's personal political views on a non-
                commercial basis on the Internet; and

          the making of phone calls to encourage people to vote.709

During the pre-election period, the spending limit, contribution and transparency
requirements apply to third-party "partisan advertising" and other activities described
below.710 If a snap election is called (i.e., no third party is notified in advance that an election
is going to occur), the provisions concerning the pre-election period are not in force.

Elections Canada has clarified that communications on the Internet will only be considered
election advertising or partisan advertising if they have, or normally would have, a
placement cost.711 Elections Canada explains this requirement by pointing out that such
communications give the well-resourced an unfair advantage, while communications
without a placement cost do not. However, this means that the cost of producing Internet
material will not be considered an advertising expense unless there is a placement cost for
the material, even if production is costly and the communication meets all other criteria of
advertising.

In addition, Bill C-76 added two other new categories of regulated third-party activity called
"partisan activity" and "election survey." Partisan activity is defined similarly to partisan
advertising but includes non-advertising activities like door-knocking, telephone calls, and
events. An election survey is a survey conducted by a third party in order to plan and
undertake partisan activities.712

c) Definition of expenses for election advertising, partisan advertising, partisan activity, and

election survey

An "election advertising expense" is incurred to produce an election advertising message
during the election or to acquire the means of transmitting that message and a "partisan
advertising expense" has the same meaning for such advertising during the pre-election
period.713 "Partisan activity expense" is defined as an expense of a third party in undertaking
a partisan activity. An "election survey expense" is defined as an expense incurred in
conducting the survey.714 "Expenses" are defined in section 349 of the CEA to include the

commercial value of property or services that are donated or provided, other than volunteer
labour.

          10.2.3.2 Contributions to Third-Party Campaigners

Contributions to third parties of money, property, use of property, or services are subject to
source restrictions, but not limits. Third parties can accept contributions of any amount from
anyone or any entity for the purpose of partisan advertising, partisan activities, or election
surveys during the pre-election or election period. However, they are prohibited from
accepting contributions for these activities from foreign nationals, corporations that do not
carry on business in Canada, unions that do not have bargaining rights in Canada, foreign
political parties, or foreign governments or their agents.715 Further, third parties cannot use
a contribution from an anonymous donor for the purpose of these activities.716

If a third party is a union, corporation, or other entity with a governing body it is not
permitted to undertake the above activities if they involve spending more than CDN$500 in
either of the periods. An exception to this prohibition is if its governing body passes a
resolution authorizing it to undertake the activities in either or both of the periods. It is
required to include a copy of the resolution in the third-party registration forms it submits
to Elections Canada. 717

          10.2.3.3 Spending on Partisan Advertising, Partisan Activities, Election Surveys,
                     and Election Advertising

During the pre-election period, combined total spending by third parties on partisan
advertising, partisan activities, and election surveys is limited. However, the base limit of
CDN$700,000, plus inflation since 2004, is so high (surpassing CDN$1 million in 2019)718 that
it is essentially meaningless. It is unlikely that a third party will reach that limit in the pre-
election period. Bill C-76 also set a CDN$7,000 limit (CDN$10,234 in 2019 due to inflation)
for combined total spending on these pre-election period activities in a single district.719
However, if an election is called before the fixed election date the provisions concerning the
pre-election period are not in force.

The spending limit on election advertising also covers partisan activities and election
surveys undertaken during the election period. Individuals who are not citizens or
permanent residents who do not reside in Canada and corporations that do not carry on
business in Canada are not permitted to spend on these activities during the pre-election720
or the election period.721

Since Bill C-76 extended the spending limit for the election period to a wider range of third-
party activities, the federal government increased the combined total limit for national
spending from CDN$150,000 to CDN$350,000, multiplied by an inflation adjustment factor
with the baseline year of 2004.722 This meant that the election period spending limit for a
third party in the 2019 election was CDN$511,700. The bill did not increase the third-party
spending limit of CDN$3,000 (CDN$4,386 in 2019 with inflation) for activities that promote
or oppose the election of candidates in a single electoral district, an amount that counts
towards the national limit if a third party undertakes both national and local campaign
activities (the same CDN$3,000 limit, adjusted for inflation, also applies for by-elections).723
Unlike for parties and candidates, there is no provision in the statute to increase the
spending limit for third parties if the election period lasts longer than 36 days.

Third parties are prohibited from attempting to circumvent spending limits by splitting
themselves into multiple third parties or by acting in collusion with other third parties or
with parties' potential candidates/candidate or their agents or associates, during both the
pre-election724 and election periods.725 Anti-collusion rules also prohibit sharing information
in order to coordinate activities, including organizing events.726

          10.2.3.4 Transparency Requirements for Third-Party Campaigners

a) Registration

Third parties are required to register once their incurred expenses on partisan advertising,
election advertising, partisan activities, and election surveys reach a combined total of
CDN$500 during the pre-election and/or election period.727 The CEO is required to publish
registered third parties' names and addresses as they are registered.728

Registered third parties have several notable obligations. First, they are required to set up a
separate bank account to accept contributions and pay for the expenses for all of pre-election
and election period activities.729 Second, they are required to appoint a financial agent to
accept contributions for activities during the pre-election and/or election period.730Third,
parties that spend more than CDN$10,000 during the pre-election period are required to
appoint an auditor and provide the auditor's name and contact information to the CEO.731

b) Attribution

Third parties are required to identify themselves in any partisan and election advertising
that they produce and to indicate they have authorized the advertisement during the pre-
election or election periods.732

c) Reporting

Third parties may be required to file several interim expense returns with the CEO during
the pre-election and election period, depending upon whether their contributions or
spending amounts exceed specified thresholds at certain times. A third party is required to
file a return:

     1) within five days of registration if it receives contributions over CDN$10,000
          specifically for pre-election period activities or spends over CDN$10,000 on
          pre-election activities since the previous election;733

     2) on September 15th if it receives contributions over CDN$10,000 specifically for
          pre-election period activities or spends over $10,000 on pre-election period
          activities between the previous election day and either September 14th or the
          end of the pre-election period, whichever is earlier;734

     3) 21 days before the general election day if it receives contributions over
          CDN$10,000 specifically for election period activities or spends CDN$10,000
          on election activities between the previous election day and 23 days before the
          election day;735 and

     4) seven days before the general election day if it receives contributions over
          CDN$10,000 specifically for election period activities or spends over
          CDN$10,000 on election activities between the previous election day and nine
          days before the election day.736

Interim expense returns are required to include:

      Partisan activity expenses by the date and location of the activity;
      Partisan and/or election advertising expenses by the date and location they

          were placed/transmitted;

      Election survey expenses by the date each survey was conducted;
      The amount by class of contributor (individual, corporation, government,

          union, non-profit, citizen association) of donations and loans;

     For each contributor who made contribution(s) or loan(s) totalling more than

          CDN$200, their name, address (including president or CEO of any numbered
          company) and class, and the amount and date of each contribution;

      The amount of the third-party's own funds that were used to pay for the
          activities.737

If a third party cannot identify which contributions (donations and loans) it has received for
the pre-election period activities, it is required to identify in the return all of its contributors
since the previous election day.738 Third parties that file multiple interim returns are not
required to repeat information already filed in a previous return.739

Third parties are also required to file final third party expense returns four months after the
election day. These returns are required to include the same information as interim expense
returns. However, unlike interim returns, previously filed information is not omitted.740 The
third party's auditor is required to confirm that the return is a fair reflection of the third
party's accounting records.741

The CEO is required to publish all pre-election third party interim expense reports as soon
as feasible and all post-election third party expense reports within one year of the start of
the election period.742 If the information is not released until a year after the writ drops, the
delay could undercut the anti-corruption goals of disclosure, as the potential for undue
influence may not be discovered until irrevocable decisions have been made by lawmakers.
The public and the media could therefore be temporarily deprived of potentially relevant
information in evaluating lawmakers' proposals and decisions.

      10.2.4 Role of the Chief Electoral Officer and the Commissioner of Canada
                 Elections

The CEO directs and supervises elections and elections officers; issues guidelines,
interpretation notes, and advisory opinions on the application and interpretation of the
statute and regulations; may undertake voter education initiatives and voting studies; and
assists other countries with election processes.743 The CEO also publishes disclosed
information on political financing in searchable online databases.744

The Commissioner of Canada Elections is responsible for compliance with the requirements
of the statute and regulations, including investigating non-compliance and prosecuting,

imposing fines or entering into compliance agreements (which can include fines).745 Bill C-
76 amended the CEA to give the Commissioner the power to require the production of
evidence when investigating election expenses or seek a court order.746

10.3 Criticisms of Campaign Finance Regulation

The Canadian political finance regime has apparently had some success in reducing reliance
on large donors. Before the regulations limiting contributions were introduced in 2004, 2%
of donors were responsible for 54% of funds raised annually by politicians.747 From 2004 to
2008, when the individual donation limit was CDN$5,000, the 1% of donors who gave more
than CDN$1,200 per year accounted for only 17% of the total amount contributed to all
parties (parties only, not including donations to their candidates or electoral district
associations).748 However, several issues raise serious questions of how much the Canadian
federal political finance system fulfills egalitarian principles.

Recent donation figures show that federal parties continue to rely on a relatively small
number of donors for a significant percentage of their annual funding. For example, in 2015,
only 4.37% of donors donated CDN$1,100 or more to the federal Liberal Party, but they
provided 22.87% of the Party's total funds that year.749

One concern is the increased access to Party leaders and top party officials that are offered
in exchange for donations. For example, the Liberal Party offers donors who donate the
maximum annual amount entry into its Laurier Club, which offers events and special access
to the Party's leader and top party officials. (who, since November 2015, have been the Prime
Minister and Cabinet ministers). Only 0.85% of donors donated the maximum in 2015, 790
people out of the 93,429 people who donated to the Party that year.750 In spring 2016, the
Liberal Party also launched a new "Leader's Circle" for donors that both donated the
maximum annual amount and recruited ten other people who each donated the maximum
amount. The Leader's Circle provided even greater access to the Prime Minister and Cabinet
ministers, although the scheme was cancelled after media coverage and public criticism.751

Several other Liberal Party fundraising events from 2014 to 2017 offered top donors access
to top Party officials or were hosted by business executives whose business has lobbied the
federal government, with significant amounts of money raised for the Party at each event.752

In addition, there is evidence from Canada's federal system, and from several provincial
systems across Canada, that banning corporate and union donations and limiting individual
donations result in executives and their families, mainly from businesses who lobby the
government, begin to donate the maximum individual amount allowed.753 Questions remain
whether some of these donations were from business funds illegally funneled through
executives and their families.

A key problem inhibiting the analysis of donation patterns such as these is that donations to
nomination race contestants, election candidates, parties, and third parties made during
elections are not required to be disclosed before election day. However, as noted above, third
parties are often required to file interim returns before election day listing their donors,
contestants for party leadership are required to disclose details concerning their donors and
donations during and just before the contest vote, and parties are required to disclose that
information quarterly. If this is possible, and given that many donations are now made
electronically, it should be possible to require parties, electoral district associations,
candidates, and third parties to disclose details of donors and donations soon after they are
received, instead of months later.

Inequality continues to exist in spending limits in Canada. It is questionable whether the
spending limit that applies to single voters who become third parties and closely held
private corporations should apply to citizen groups with tens of thousands of supporters.
This allows wealthy individuals and corporate executives to spend as much on trying to
influence issues, candidates, and parties as tens of thousands of voters spend together. As
well, election candidates are allowed to donate CDN$5,000 to their own campaign, and party
leadership contestants are allowed to donate CDN$25,000 to their own campaign. These
amounts, which are much higher than the current CDN$1,650 donation limit (as of spring
2021) that applies to all other donations from individuals, favour wealthy candidates who
can afford to make these donations.

In 2011, the Canadian province of Quebec implemented several reforms after a corruption
scandal revealed similar donation patterns. In response, Quebec decreased the limit on
individual donations from CDN$2,000 annually down to CDN$100 annually754 and created
a requirement that a donation of more than CDN$50 to a party be routed through the

provincial elections agency, Elections Quebec, to verify whether the money is legitimately
coming from the individual donor, rather than a corporation, union, or other organization.755

There have also been criticisms of the phasing out of quarterly per-vote funding allowances
for registered political parties.756 Before the quarterly allowances were eliminated, the public
funding regime adequately offset losses to party income caused by contribution caps.757
Without the quarterly allowance system, the CEO has warned that contribution caps may
lead parties to resort to "illicit and undisclosed funding strategies."758 The CEO has also
argued that combining contribution caps with inadequate public funding may produce a
state of perpetual campaigning, as parties attempt to inspire more contributions from more
donors.759 Permanent campaigning could negatively impact "the overall tone of political
discourse and the level of public cynicism."760 On the other hand, some point out that less
public funding might have the "merciful consequence" of reducing attack ads and restricting
campaign advertising to the actual election period.761

In contrast to the cancellation of direct public funding of parties at the federal level in
Canada, Quebec 762 also provides annual public funding to match the amounts that parties
raise in between elections and the matching amounts are based on donations made to parties
during election campaigns.763 The funding is weighted to match the first CDN$20,000 of
contributions at a higher rate (CDN$2.50 per dollar raised) than contributions above that
amount up to CDN$200,000 (at rate of CDN$1.00 per dollar raised), which increases the
equalization effect of the funding.764 It is important to note, however, that despite its
egalitarian characteristics, Quebec disadvantages independent members of the legislature
and independent candidates, as it offers them only the relatively small amount of up to

755 Quebec's provincial law allows an additional CDN$100 to be donated to each party and
independent candidate during each election campaign. Donations above CDN$50 annually must be
routed through Elections Quebec. See "Contributions" (last visited 31 October 2021), online: Elections

CDN$800 in matching funding annually and, for a candidate, up to CDN$800 during the
election campaign period.765

An additional area of Canada's federal political finance system that raises questions is
enforcement. After one actual illegal funneling scheme was revealed in 2016, the
Commissioner of Canada Elections reached compliance agreements with involved parties,
instead of prosecuting.766 The single individual charged pleaded guilty, ending the
possibility of disclosing others involved in the scheme, although a media outlet revealed a
confidential document that listed many of the donors involved.767

In 2013, Elections Canada promised a full audit to determine the extent of top donations
from businesses and organizations and their families, and whether donations from
businesses and other organizations were being funneled through their executives and family
members. However, Elections Canada never undertook the audit and further refused to
undertake the audit when requested to do so by an advocacy group in May 2019.768 In
addition, the Commissioner allowed a third-party citizen group to violate the provisions
that prohibit collusion between third parties and candidates in the 2019 election without
imposing any penalty.769 The Commissioner is yet to rule on another alleged collusion
situation from the 2019 election involving several third parties.770

Bill C-76 amended the statute to allow the federal Commissioner of Canada Elections to fine
violators up to CDN$1,500 for persons and CDN$5,000 for entities instead of prosecuting,

and also to include payments as part of a negotiated compliance agreement.771 In August
2019, instead of prosecuting, as part of a compliance agreement the Commissioner used this
new power to fine two companies involved in an illegal donation funneling scheme. The
fine was three times the amount of the illegal donations made, and the Commissioner stated
that "Canadians should expect to see us make full use of this new tool from this point on"772
which will hopefully act as a warning to those planning to violate the law and encourage
compliance.

While the above ruling may be a sign of stronger enforcement of the federal election law,
another problem area is that the full enforcement record of Elections Canada and the
Commissioner remains largely hidden. The Commissioner is permitted to release any
information about an investigation if, in the Commissioner's opinion, it is in the public
interest.773 However, Elections Canada and the Commissioner have resisted disclosure in the
past, including the ruling in more than 3,000 complaints filed from 1997 to 2011.774 Without
this information, it is impossible to determine whether the Commissioner is enforcing the
provisions fairly, impartially, or effectively.

In contrast, when questionable donation patterns like those revealed at the federal Canadian
level were revealed in Quebec in 2011, Elections Quebec undertook an audit within months.
The audit examined donations made to provincial parties between 2006 and 2011 and found
CDN$12.8 million in likely funnelled donations.775 As well, an extensive public inquiry was
undertaken776 and dozens of people were subsequently prosecuted and convicted for
participating in illegal donation and bribery schemes.777 While these enforcement actions

11. CONCLUSION

Campaign finance is a high-profile issue, and scandals break out regularly.779 Frustration
and cynicism arise when wealthy individuals, corporations, unions, or other organizations
support a candidate's election campaign and benefit from favourable policies after the
candidate is elected. Even when it is impossible to determine whether policies and decisions
result from a politician's own principles or from the need to maintain future financial
support by rewarding past support, the relationship between politicians and their financial
backers can be toxic for public confidence.780 Further, aside from the risk of corruption of
elected officials, many argue that unregulated campaign finance may corrupt the electoral

process itself by allowing the wealthy to set the electoral debate agenda and exert
disproportionate influence over the outcome of elections.781 This influence arguably
undermines the foundational principle of "one person, one vote."782

Tension exists between the goal of alleviating the potentially poisonous effects of wealth in
politics and the goal of facilitating free and open debate. This tension is often framed as a
clash between equality and freedom, and it makes campaign finance regulation a
controversial and partisan issue, particularly in the US.

The jurisprudence in this chapter demonstrates that the US, UK, and Canada each have
different approaches to resolving this tension. Courts and governments in all three countries
strive to construct a middle path between the goals of freedom and equality, accepting
political finance regulations with equality-related objectives as long as open debate is not
overly restricted. However, parts of the systems in all three countries tilt either towards
freedom of expression or equality. The US system overall tilts more in favour of freedom of
expression for wealthy individuals, businesses, and organizations. The UK's ban on paid
political advertising by parties or third parties during election campaign periods provides
an example of a tilt towards equality, but its lack of donation limits, which favours wealthy
donors, is a tilt towards freedom of expression.

Meanwhile, in Canada individuals and private corporations controlled by a few people, as
third parties, are allowed to spend or donate disproportionate amounts and some election
candidates and party leadership candidates are allowed to donate a disproportionate
amount to their own campaign. Both of these measures greatly favour wealthy individuals.

Different cultural, political, and judicial approaches to campaign finance regulations have
led to the divergent regulatory regimes in the three countries. Criticisms of each regime
demonstrate that lawmakers and courts continue to grapple with the ongoing challenge of
developing and evaluating political finance regulations that effectively constrain unethical
influence of excessive donations and spending on parties, politicians, and governments,
without unduly constraining participation in public and elections debate in all sectors of
society.

                 CHAPTER 15 COLLECTIVE ACTION

1. INTRODUCTION

Taking "collective action" against corruption is considered by many to be the optimal
approach to combatting corruption in a variety of contexts, especially where corruption is
pervasive at a systemic level. The leading anti-corruption NGO, Transparency International,
asserts that:

          [T]o root out corruption, we need to hold those entrusted with power to
          account using both prevention and punishment mechanisms. The key to
          making prevention and punishment more effective is to work with people,
          as individuals and as part of collective action, to take part in anti-corruption
          efforts. Increasingly there must be a popular rejection of corruption - a
          refusal to bribe, vote for the corrupt or turn a blind eye to corruption - if we
          are to create sustained public pressure for change.1

Collective action can be initiated in any location by any group of motivated stakeholders,
rather than depending solely on the actions of government or law enforcement to combat
corruption. Instead, collective action can be used to attract support from governments and
law enforcement and exert pressure on them to play their part more effectively.

The World Bank describes collective action as "a collaborative and sustained process of
cooperation amongst stakeholders. It increases the impact and credibility of individual
action, brings vulnerable individual players into an alliance of like-minded organizations
and levels the playing field between competitors."2

After examining the current rise in the use of collective action in the private sector, this
chapter surveys five broad categories in the field, ranging from relatively passive public
education and awareness raising to activities that are intended to have a direct impact on
corruption in specific circumstances. A group of interested stakeholders can begin at the
`passive' level and move towards a more `active' level of collective action. The suggested
five broad categories are:

          1. Education and awareness raising programs--from local to
                international. The example provided in this chapter is the Vancouver,
                BC based Anti-Corruption Law Program (ACLP);

          2. Development and promotion of anti-corruption tools that can be
                adopted by `bribe payers' (the supply side of corruption). The example
                provided in this chapter is the International Federation of Consulting
                Engineers (FIDIC) Integrity Management System;

This chapter provides examples of each of the above types of collective action, citing the
contributing factors to their success and also identifying the critical factors for sustainability.
The concluding section of this chapter presents lessons learned and recommendations for
success.

2. GROWTH OF COLLECTIVE ACTION IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR

Through collective action--a process of cooperation between various stakeholders with the
aim of jointly countering corruption--companies can together take concrete steps to scale-
up efforts and strengthen good business practices.3

The UN Global Compact outlines a variety of incentives or reasons for companies to take
part in collective action in the fight against corruption. Collective action will enable them to:

          a) create a deeper understanding of corruption issues;
          b) consolidate knowledge and financial and technical resources to

                achieve greater impact;
          c) create solutions that are perceived as more credible, acceptable and are

                more sustainable;
          d) help ensure fair competition and a level playing field for all

                stakeholders;
          e) create a more stable and enabling business environment; and
          f) complement existing anti-corruption efforts in vulnerable regions and

                sectors, where industry or government-led regulations are not robust.4

Similarly, Mark Pieth, the world's leading scholar on collective action, asserts that "there
could be a strong business case for collectively combating corruption" as "collective risk
management is always, at least in part, expectation management: with similar levels of
regulation amongst all competitors, companies are also better able to limit costs."5 This
points to the need to establish a level playing field as a way of overcoming the dilemma
often faced by many well-intentioned corporations-that is, "even large companies are
uneasy about `going it alone'. They are uncertain whether their competitors are following
the same virtuous path and they are aware they may be sidelined by ministers `on the take'
and replaced by less scrupulous suppliers."6 Of course, the success of such collective action
will depend on the genuine effort made by individual players to enforce a particular
agreement that has been reached in the industry. And while some remain skeptical as to the
true potential of such agreements being reached, research has shown that the private sector
is becoming much more active in combatting corruption:

          First, it [i.e., the private sector] is very much interested in extending the anti-
          corruption standards to other exporting nations, especially Brazil, Russia,
          India, and China (the BRIC countries). Here, the G20 format is proving very
          handy. Second, the private sector has become even more insistent than the
          peer countries that anti-corruption standards are applied equally. Third,
          companies have acknowledged that they are dependent on the evolution of
          a reliable body of common standards.7

Similar findings in support of a collective action approach to fighting corruption are also
noted by Elizabeth Dávid-Barret:

          [T]here are indications that the G20's goals [of engaging the private sector
          in the fight against corruption] are not so pie-in-the-sky. A recent flurry of
          corporate activity to start and join anti-corruption clubs signals a major shift
          in norms about bribery in business. Collective action initiatives, in which
          companies make voluntary commitments above and beyond the legal
          requirements for anti-bribery compliance, have proliferated in recent years.
          Everybody seems to want to be part of an anti-corruption club.8

As the author of this article suggests, it is likely that this changing behaviour is a response
to rapid change in norms about bribery in international business: "bribery is no longer
`business as usual.'"9

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

In spite of this upward trend in private sector engagement in the fight against corruption, it
remains true that companies rarely end up cooperating on their own: "competitors usually
trust each other little and they usually fear being perceived as `trusting' each other too much.
In other words, many companies are wary of anti-corruption compacts lest they be regarded
as engaging in anti-competitive behavior."10 As a result, collective action has repeatedly
been promoted first by "an ad hoc group of representatives from one or more non-
governmental organizations (NGOs), together with select private sector protagonists."11 The
following excerpt outlines in greater detail the process by which collective action initiatives
will most likely take hold--though the author also cautions that there is no set model for
these initiatives:

          These consortia [an ad hoc group of representatives from one or more non-
          governmental organizations (NGOs), together with select private sector
          protagonists] perform a crucial task in the early days of a Collective Action
          initiative by bringing together a group of industry representatives that is
          able to generate its own momentum. Together, they attempt to convince
          other major players to participate. At the outset, the participants avoid
          committing to anything beyond a preliminary exchange of views. It takes
          time to convince the participants of the benefits of the initiative, and much
          depends on the subtlety of the mediators. Once the initiative has taken off,
          however, the collaboration is publicized and corporate exponents take their
          share of the responsibility. In the meantime, it is also the task of the NGO
          representatives to ensure that the members of the group do not embark on
          anti-competitive behavior. Thus, in starting a particular Collective Action
          initiative, the key factor is not (simply) the size of the group, as frequently
          suggested in academic debates about the conditions for overcoming
          Collective Action problems. It is assumed that a few, especially strong,
          players achieve more than a multitude of small actors-the larger the
          number, the greater the risk of truancy.12

This demonstrates that there remains an important role to be played by many actors in
industry-wide anti-corruption initiatives which require a collective effort. In this context,
NGOs and not-for-profits can also provide guidance: "[t]here can be great advantage in
hearing those messages from an organization that stands to gain nothing in terms of business
or revenues. Likewise, regulators have a proven interest in hearing what independent anti-
bribery and corruption experts view as best practice standards and what best works in
tackling corruption."13 Moreover, because "the anti-corruption field is moving fast across
the world, with new corruption trends, new legislation, changing enforcement patterns, and

the emergence of tech-related challenges and solutions,"14 an emphasis on raising awareness
and education industry-wide is increasingly critical.

As noted, education and training initiatives are an important part of collective action, and
companies are increasingly turning to these mechanisms to ensure more robust internal
compliance in order to prevent individual actors from engaging in corrupt practices. While
much work remains to be done, this is a promising step, and one that should prove feasible
for many corporations.

When asked in June 2017 about the biggest change in the compliance landscape, Joe Spinelli,
who has been involved in FCPA enforcement and compliance for over 30 years, replied "it's
the deep engagement of boards and senior management. Today they understand the risks
of reputational damage and want to stay a step ahead of the compliance process."15 In a
similar vein, companies are increasingly looking for ways of facilitating this compliance and
internal awareness of potential corrupt practices. Richard Bistrong, a contributor to the
FCPA Blog notes:

          Companies often ask me to record video for internal training. They want
          real-world stories of corruption and commerce which they can embed into
          an existing on-line anti-bribery compliance training."16 Karen Griffin,
          executive vice president and chief compliance officer at Mastercard [which
          was involved in the production of the video], said: "we recognized the need
          to move beyond the traditional classroom exercise to help our teams
          understand the potential impact of bribery and compliance events."17

3. PUBLIC EDUCATION AND AWARENESS RAISING

The Vancouver, Canada-based Anti-Corruption Law Program (ACLP)18 (the Program) is an
ongoing series of public education events--including keynote public lectures, seminars,
partial-day and full-day invited conferences, and colloquium format sessions--open to
lawyers, business-people, law enforcement officials, government representatives and
bureaucrats, students, and academics alike. These public education events are designed to
provide a fertile setting for learning and informed discussion among participant panelists
and registrants regarding the law's role in the global fight against corrupt business practices.

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

The Program is a collaborative effort founded by three organizations: The Peter A. Allard
School of Law (Allard School of Law) at the University of British Columbia (UBC),
Transparency International Canada (TI Canada), and the International Centre for Criminal
Law Reform and Criminal Justice Policy at UBC (ICCLR). In 2016, these stakeholders
combined forces and engaged in collective action to bring together anti-corruption experts.
The Program focused on having such experts teach each other (and registrants) about best
practices, policies, and enforcement strategies to fight corruption. The three founding
organizations each had core competencies and experiences in research and scholarship,
teaching, raising awareness, and advocating in the fight against corruption, both within
Canada and abroad. Rather than combatting corruption as individual organizations, these
three founding partners of the ACLP combined resources to work together, providing a clear
example of the power of collective action in advancing the anti-corruption movement in
Canada. The Program attracted support from a number of public and private organizations,
including law firms, accounting/consulting firms, engineering firms, resource extraction
companies, NGOs, government organizations, and interdisciplinary academic units at UBC,
as well as other universities in Canada and abroad.

The need for robust and easily accessible public education, applied research, and scholarship
in the area of anti-corruption was evident; sophisticated ongoing professional education in
this area was underdeveloped in Canada, and rigorous applied research in anti-corruption
in the Canadian context was severely lacking. In order to be effective in the fight against
corruption, legal practitioners, public policy-makers, and business-people alike needed an
accessible learning forum in which to cultivate a deeper understanding of the potential use
of law; the Program set out to fulfill this unmet need.

3.1 Anti-Corruption Law Program Outcomes

The key intended outcomes of the Program include:

     (1) Forming and nurturing collaborative relationships, including working
          partnerships among the Peter A. Allard School of Law, the legal profession,
          leading organizations in the business community, credible and respected
          NGOs (such as TI Canada), research institutions (such as ICCLR), and other
          academic units at UBC and other universities in Canada;

     (2) Providing new support for collaborative learning opportunities for leading
          academic scholars, legal practitioners, business-people, and J.D. and MBA
          students;

     (3) Creating enhanced opportunities for future applied collaborative and
          interdisciplinary research and academic scholarship; and

     (4) Attracting additional funding and support for research and learning
          opportunities from Program partners and other organizations who wish to

          participate in and support the goals and objectives of the Program, as well as
          its interdisciplinary, collaborative, and interactive pedagogical approach.19

3.2 Anti-Corruption Law Program: Public Education Events

The Program ran as a `pilot project' in its first year (from fall of 2016 to the fall of 2017). This
pilot project consisted of nine professional education events that were organized in
collaboration with various partner organizations between September 2016 and December
2017. Several of these professional education sessions were designed to recur on an annual
or semi-annual basis, providing informed and inspired yearly-updated content to reflect
current developments in this rapidly evolving and dynamic area of law reform. The
Program's content has been vetted, critiqued, and revised on an ongoing basis by the very
audience of business-people, lawyers, lawmakers, and regulators who are the drivers and
architects of the anti-corruption legal systems at play.

Prior to the educational sessions in the Program, attendees were provided with current
reading materials from leading experts in the field which reflect the latest developments and
insights in each subject area. These materials help prepare participants in advance of each
session, better equipping participants to engage in an interactive dialogue. This
participatory component helps foster a learning environment where participants learn from
one another in an iterative, real-time process.

By the end of 2019, 20 educational events had been organized and hosted by the Program.
The COVID-19 pandemic prevented face-to-face meetings, resulting in the suspension of the
Program in 2020. The Program was relaunched in 2021 as monthly online webinars that are
archived on the websites of the three partner founding organizations for future reference by
registrants and other interested parties.20

The range of topic areas presented in the Program include (among other areas):

      Government procurement;
      Money laundering in the casino industry, real estate industry, and luxury

          vehicle industry;
      Internal corporate compliance systems;
      Enhanced law enforcement strategies and resources;

          below); and
      The role of the Integrity Vice Presidency of the World Bank in global

The emergence of virtual meeting technology has enabled the Program to tap into both
expert panelists and audiences from around the globe. The Program provides an excellent
example of how like-minded organizations and individuals can take collective action to raise
awareness and teach one another best practices in fighting corruption.

4. DEVELOPMENT AND PROMOTION OF ANTI-CORRUPTION
      TOOLS

The engineering and construction industries were singled out in the TI 2005 Global Corruption
Report.21 The introduction to this report, written by Peter Eigen, founder of Transparency
International, included the following important statements:

          Nowhere is corruption more ingrained than in the construction sector....
          [T]ransparency in public contracting is arguably the single most important
          factor in determining the success of donor support in sustainable
          development. Corrupt contracting processes leave developing countries
          saddled with sub-standard infrastructure and excessive debt.22

Although they are over 15 years old, these comments remain valid.

The International Federation of Consulting Engineers (FIDIC),23 founded in Europe in 1913,
has since grown to become "[t]he global representative body for national associations of
consulting engineers."24 FIDIC is unlike many global organizations, in that it is an
"association of associations" and its members are national associations of consulting
engineers. Individual engineering firms are typically members of their national association,
and so they are not direct members of the global organization. FIDIC now indirectly
represents 40,000 engineering firms that employ about 1 million engineers and other

professional and support staff.25 The national associations of 102 countries--from Albania
to Zimbabwe--are members of FIDIC, and elect representatives to the Board of Directors at
each annual meeting.26

Since 1957, FIDIC has published model contracts that have been adopted in many countries
for use on international infrastructure projects. FIDIC model contracts all follow a standard
format, using a standard set of General Conditions, which are only to be modified using
customized clauses called Particular Conditions.

Current FIDIC contracts include:

     · Red Book - Construction - Design by Owner;
     · Yellow Book - Plant and Design Build;
     · Silver Book - EPC/Turnkey Contracts;
     · White Book - Client/Consultant Model Services Agreement;
     · Sub-Consultancy Agreement; and
     · Model Representative Agreement.27

Several Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs--also known as International Lending
Agencies or IFIs), including the African Development Bank, the Asian Development Bank,
the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Inter-American Development
Bank and the World Bank, have created in cooperation with FIDIC, a special version of the
Red Book for use on MDB-financed projects called the MDB Harmonised Edition.28 This
illustrates the importance of the relationship between FIDIC and the MDBs, particularly in
the area of contract management on major infrastructure projects.

The consulting engineering industry has grown dramatically in importance over the past 50
years, particularly in emerging countries. There are many examples of cooperative working
relationships between firms based in developed countries and smaller and newer firms
based in developing countries. Furthermore, the MDBs have emphasized the importance of
allowing developing country firms to have a fair level of access to consulting opportunities
in their own country and in the broader region in which they are located. Barriers to entry

to the consulting engineering industry can be low in many developing countries. While this
encourages innovation and opportunities for engineers and related professionals, it can also
encourage corrupt behavior if firms are able to dissolve and reform upon allegations of
corruption.

Maintaining a strong and cooperative working relationship between the global consulting
engineering industry, the World Bank, and other MDBs is important to FIDIC, its member
associations and firms, and the MDBs. In 1996, following the World Bank's establishment of
an internal system in the mid-1990s to combat corruption on World Bank projects, FIDIC
issued its first formal policy statement on corruption.29 For the first time FIDIC, as a leading
international organization, identified corruption as a serious issue affecting the global
consulting engineering industry. This led to further actions to develop a "Business Integrity
Management System" (BIMS) that would address the needs and business practices of
consulting engineering firms, modeled on the established format of quality management
systems and incorporating many of the features of corporate anti-corruption compliance
systems.30 The term "integrity management" was deliberately chosen to emphasize the
positive aspects of behaving with integrity, and is seen as a logical complement to the
development of strong and ethical relationships between consulting engineering firms and
their clients, based on the aspiration of serving as a "trusted advisor" to the client.31

BIMS, the FIDIC approach to integrity management, was outlined in 1997-98 and presented
to the International Lending Agencies (ILAs) at the 1999 Biennial Meeting of International
Lending Agencies and the Consulting Industry (BIMILACI).32 The FIDIC approach to
integrity management was assessed in a paper prepared by Georg Engeli and Mark Pieth--
two well-known authorities on this topic.33 This paper was reviewed at the FIDIC 2000
conference, and led to the issue of three important FIDIC documents:

      Guidelines for Business Integrity Management in the Consulting Industry (2001);34

      Business Integrity Management System Training Manual (2002);35 and

      Model Representative Agreement - Test Edition (2004).36

Since 2010, FIDIC has replaced the acronym BIMS with FIMS (FIDIC Integrity Management
System) to eliminate confusion with unrelated systems that use the acronym BIMS. New
documents to describe FIMS and the recommended approach to implementing a flexible and
scalable FIMS within a consulting engineering firm have been issued since 2010:

      Guidelines for Integrity Management in the Consulting Industry - Part I - Policies
          and Principles (2011);37

      Guidelines for Integrity Management in the Consulting Industry - Part II - FIMS
          Procedures (2015);38

      Model Representative Agreement - First Edition (2013);39 and

      Guidelines for Integrity Management in the Consulting Industry - Part III - FIMS
          and ISO 37001 (2019) (FIMS III).40

The FIDIC Model Representative Agreement deserves special emphasis, as experience has
shown that actions by "third parties" often constitute the greatest integrity risk to any firm,
including a consulting engineering firm that is operating in a country outside of its home
jurisdiction.41 The use of a "Representative" or an "Agent" by consulting engineering firms
operating in foreign countries is relatively common. While the use of a Representative is
often justified by the firm's lack of understanding of local business practices and legal
requirements, bribery by Representatives can often occur without the knowledge or
participation of the firm's own staff. However, numerous court cases have shown that third
party actions will create liability for the firm that retains a Representative who acts in a
corrupt manner.42 In the past, Representatives were often engaged with agreements that
contained very limited information regarding scope of work, basis of remuneration, and any
limits to their duties and obligations. The common practice of paying the Representative on
the basis of a percentage of the fees paid by the client created opportunities for the
Representative to pay bribes with a portion of the commission income.

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

The Model Representative Agreement,43 which follows the established format of FIDIC
contracts (standard General Conditions, Particular Conditions to name the Parties and
countries of operation, etc.), spells out the Representative's anti-corruption obligations,
training and reporting requirements, and the limits to the Representative's scope of work
and authority. The Model Representative Agreement is available to all FIDIC member firms at
low cost, in either digital or hard copy form.

The most recent document, known as FIMS III,44 compares and contrasts the provisions of a
typical FIMS and the requirements of the ISO 37001 anti-bribery standard. FIMS III explains
how a firm's FIMS can be expanded to allow eventual certification of an anti-bribery system
in accordance with the requirements of ISO 37001. This standard is narrowly focused on
bribery activities; a FIMS provides the consulting firm with a broader framework for
protection against corrupt acts.

Following the publication of these resource documents and the adoption of FIMS or similar
systems by some engineering firms, FIDIC, acting primarily through its Integrity
Management Committee (IMC), has continued to explain and promote its recommended
approach to integrity management within consulting engineering firms. FIDIC has also
encouraged pilot projects within a variety of international engineering firms, both large and
small.

The indirect nature of firm representation by FIDIC has made it difficult to track the
adoption of FIMS or related integrity management systems by engineering firms. Most large,
multinational engineering firms typically maintain in-house legal resources. Many such
firms have developed and adopted relatively rigorous compliance-type systems to suit their
needs. However, small to medium sized firms have appeared to be reluctant to commit to
the overhead cost resources needed to implement a comprehensive FIMS. Therefore, FIDIC
initiated a pilot program in 2010 involving six member firms, to test the FIMS concepts and
identify the strengths and weaknesses of the FIMS approach to integrity management.45 The
pilot program concluded that:

     1. Firm size can be a challenge--smaller firms may believe that they lack the
          resources and understanding of the key issues. In response, the pilot program
          recommended that smaller firms begin with a well-worded Code of Conduct and
          expand their FIMS over time.

     2. Endemic corruption, if present in the home market, often leads to fear of losing
          business and business failure. In response, the pilot program recommended that
          firms review their business, their aspirations to operate ethically, and their
          clients--it may be necessary to "fire a client."

     3. Employees may see the proposed FIMS as a threat from management--"you don't

          trust us." In response, the pilot program recommended the involvement of
          employees in the design and implementation of the firm's FIMS, to avoid
          establishing a top-down "them and us" atmosphere within the firm.

     4. A firm (especially a larger firm) may already have a compliance system, and may
          argue that it is unnecessary to adopt a FIMS. The pilot program noted that a FIMS
          can be used to expand into integrity areas not covered by a typical compliance
          system (e.g., corporate and personal conflict of interest). ISO 37001 certification
          may also be a desirable outcome of a robust compliance system; FIMS III provides
          a roadmap for that process.

     5. The need for high level support (known as "tone from the top") may mean that a
          leadership change can cause the FIMS to be abandoned or to fail. The pilot
          program acknowledged that all such initiatives require continuous top level
          support, which can spell the end of an ambitious program if this support is ever
          withdrawn.46

The FIDIC Integrity Management Committee continues to promote the adoption of FIMS
and related anti-corruption measures by member firms. The following near-term initiatives
to expand adoption are under consideration:

      Aggressive promotion of integrity management through the FIDIC Member
          Associations, which would allow more direct access to member firm key decision-
          makers;

      Integration of integrity management measures into other FIDIC programs that are
          intended to assist firms to improve their businesses by targeting higher value-
          added services;

      Development of a searchable database that would allow interested parties (existing
          and potential clients, ILAs, existing and potential employees) to determine which
          engineering firms have established a FIMS, other type of compliance system, or an
          ISO 37001 anti-bribery system; and

      Development of targeted integrity guidance documents to assist smaller and
          medium-sized consulting firms with moving forward in the creation and
          management of their own FIMS.

5. A SECTOR-WIDE INITIATIVE TO REFRAIN FROM CORRUPTION

The Maritime Anti-Corruption Network (MACN)47 is a global success story in how
industries may effectively employ collective action to safeguard against corruption. The
MACN's origins root partially in response to the UK's 2011 enactment of the Bribery Act,48 a
piece of legislation which codified the illegality of facilitation payments. The shipping

                                                                                        1189
GLOBAL CORRUPTION

industry had battled such forms of corruption for many decades, with facilitation payments
becoming so embedded in the industry that most considered it near impossible to effectively
conduct maritime business without them. A small group of committed maritime companies,
primarily operating out of Northern Europe, banded together to discuss how the industry
could protect itself against such perverse sector-wide corruption concerns. While such
facilitation payments were typically small in monetary value, such as requiring cartons of
cigarettes (the Suez Canal was termed the `Marlboro Canal' by many ship captains), these
payments had become so pervasive that ships would regularly carry hundreds of cartons of
cigarettes to ensure they would not be unfairly treated by port authorities; ships who refused
to comply with facilitation payment demands could find themselves stuck in ports for an
extended period of time or be forced to negotiate their way through a canal without a pilot--
a significant safety issue.49

The success of this group relied largely on their system of detecting and reporting bribery.
The MACN employed Chatham House Rules,50 allowing members to speak more openly
about corruption issues and risks. MACN also launched an anonymous reporting
mechanism to collect corrupt demands globally. By ensuring anonymity, the MACN was
able to ask their members and non-members to report any demands for bribery which they
encountered throughout the course of their business. The anonymous reporting mechanisms
decreased companies' concerns and ultimately increased their level of reporting. The MACN
was able to collect significant data on problematic ports, allowing the collective to tailor
projects to those areas which faced the highest corruption risks. The MACN's practical and
non-judgemental approach led to phenomenal growth; starting with 12 shipping companies
in 2012, the MACN now has over 150 members reporting over 45,000 anonymous incidents
of facilitation demands since 2012.51 The reporting system enabled the MACN to target those
areas suffering the most abuse, putting pressure on these ports to cease corrupt maritime
practices.

As Cecilia Müller Torbrand, CEO of MACN, puts it:

          It doesn't matter how rigorous a company's ABC compliance program is -
          if they are the only company that says no - bad practices will continue, and
          the company will face a competitive disadvantage in many markets. The
          change comes when companies are adhering to the same standards and
          when governments, business and civil society address corruption risks
          together. Collective action is all about working together and identifying
          incentives for everyone in order to create ownership, implement solutions
          and finally achieve a sustainable change.52

Nigeria was one port identified as a significant corruption risk to maritime trade. MACN
members put intense pressure on the Nigerian port authority to help rid the sector of corrupt

practices, lest they continue to face increased pressure from shipping companies. Today, the
situation is much improved; the Nigerian government actively participates in helping
shipping companies effectively respond to requests for facilitation payments and levies fines
against corrupt officials (this case study is further explored at Section 5.1).53

Another project was initiated in Argentina, where data from MACN member companies
highlighted a systemic issue regarding demands for payments for unclean grain holds.
Inspectors tended to have broad discretion, thereby vesting in them the power to accept or
reject shipments based on their categorization. Once the issue was brought to the attention
of senior government officials, they worked with the MACN to remove bad actors from
positions of authority, establishing an adequate system of procedural controls. Through this
collaborative effort, government officials and the MACN reduced corruption at the
Argentinean port by approximately 90%. The true catalyst behind this effort was the senior
government officials' willingness to rid the port of corruption. Until this matter was brought
to light, shipping companies had largely assumed that senior government officials were
either themselves profiting from these corrupt practices, or were simply uninterested in
becoming involved in these matters. Yet, as MACN members have repeatedly seen over the
years, local governments in these high-risk nations have an interest in cleaning up their ports
and establishing a reputation of clean and ethical conduct to encourage increased trade.54

The MACN screens its members to ensure that they have a sincere desire to improve internal
control mechanisms and increase compliance with the UK Bribery Act and the US FCPA.
Members are not immediately removed from the MACN or shamed if they are implicated
in issues of non-compliance; rather, the MACN views such incidents as opportunities for
members to reaffirm their intentions and refocus their efforts. The MACN engages in a
concerted effort to ensure all members are provided with industry-leading compliance tools.
Recently, an online anti-corruption and bribery training program was made available to all
MACN members free of charge.55 Member meetings are also held free of charge to MACN
members, encouraging strong attendance; MACN member meetings typically attract in
excess of 100-200 participants, and include breakout sessions where members are provided
with actionable tools to combat corruption.56

The three main pillars of the MACN are the three C's: capacity building, collective action,
and collaboration.57 Each member is asked to make progress on its anti-bribery and
corruption program. In order to achieve these goals, members are provided with free tools

on the MACN website, and also given detailed expert and peer advice at member meetings
(held bi-annually around the globe).

A major contributing factor for the MACN's success is that the group is made up of
businesses involved in the maritime industry; as such, the MACN understands the nuances
of the sector and can appreciate the real-world challenges member companies face in their
dealings. Additionally, the extra days a vessel is forced to remain in a port can cost tens of
thousands of dollars. A company with over 100 vessels is therefore looking at corruption
costs well into the millions of dollars. The ports themselves also have an interest in rooting
out corruption; poorer economies may well go bankrupt if they can no longer import or
export goods out of their ports, increasing domestic efforts in rooting out corrupt practices.
With MACN member companies approaching 50% of world tonnage,58 the MACN wields a
massive amount of economic power to influence systemic issues in ports around the globe.

The MACN launched the Port Integrity Campaign in India with the full support of the
Ministry of Shipping and the Indian National Shipowners' Association.59 The pilot program
was successfully launched in the Mumbai ports, and is now being rolled out to other ports
in surrounding regions. In the Suez Canal, the MACN launched a collective "Say No"
campaign which has resulted in significant improvement in the port's compliance efforts.60
Through further collaborative efforts, the MACN has created onboard communication
toolkits for captains and port agents.61 With several shipping companies working in tandem
with one another, it has become nearly impossible for pilots to refuse service or provide
subpar service to ships who refuse to engage in corrupt practices. This frontline material has
also been further developed to support captains in ports globally.

The growth of the MACN and the network's impact is impossible to ignore. As the program
continues to grow, so too does the influence of displaying the MACN logo on ships. Ports
who see the MACN logo are now significantly less likely to attempt to acquire facilitation
payments from these ships, as the MACN's growing network of companies have continually
refused to engage in these corrupt practices. The MACN's influence has grown to include
other industries that rely on shipping, such as the oil and gas sector, where companies rely
on clean supply chains to ensure their reputations remain intact. Collective action has even
turned into a business opportunity for MACN members, as some companies have opted to
only use ships adorned with the MACN logo when transporting their goods. Today, major
corporations such as BP, Shell, and BHP have begun seeking out ships displaying the MACN
logo to carry their cargo.

5.1 Case Study: The Nigerian Port Industry and the MACN

The Nigerian Port case study illustrates the powerful potential of collective action
undertaken at the industry level. A 2017 study on sector-specific coordinated governance
initiatives in curbing corruption surveyed MACN members who commented:

          As a large group, we also started a pilot project in Nigeria and we got a lot
          of credits for tackling Nigerian ports. Nigeria is such a difficult country to
          work in and many of MACN members are not even doing ports calls in
          Nigeria but we consider this a learning journey and we worked with UNDP
          on identifying key challenges, risks in six Nigerian ports ... our reporting
          program shows in 2013 members reported 50 incidents of bribes being
          requested at a certain port. We have a collective action, three years later,
          members show only two incidents.62

However, the long-term sustenance of collective action changes require effort from the local
government and authorities. In this light, the following excerpt illustrates a promising
development:

          Plans are in the pipeline by the Federal Government to deploy its anti-
          corruption mechanisms to significantly reduce the menace of fraudulent
          and criminal activities at the Nigerian ports.
          This comes as the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA), is currently studying the
          various tariffs across ports in West Africa, with a view to determining how
          competitive Nigerian ports are compared to its neighbours.
          An October 2016 report identified corruption, which is closely linked to the
          inefficiencies at the ports, as costing Nigeria the loss of about N$1trillion
          annually.
          These corruptive tendencies also contribute in making the Nigerian ports
          among the most expensive in the world due to the legion of charges ports
          users are being subjected [to] daily.
          If these multi-challenges are resolved, experts believe Nigeria will be on the
          path to becoming the maritime hub in West Africa, as being clamoured for.
          Already, the Managing Director, Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA), Hadiza
          Bala Usman, has confirmed that the Presidential Advisory Committee on
          Anti-Corruption will soon open an office in the NPA in line with a report
          submitted by the Independent Corrupt Practices Commission (ICPC) on the
          corruption index in ports administration.

          Usman, who is also a member of the Presidential Advisory Committee on
          Anti-Corruption, affirmed that the Authority will embark on strong anti-
          corruption measures in 2017.

          The move will further sanitise the sector and enhance smooth operations
          and clearance of cargo at the ports. Many illegal payments that contribute
          to making Nigerian ports charges non-competitive in [the] West African
          region would be eradicated and enhance the ease of doing business at the
          ports.

          The NPA boss, who visited major customs agents and freight forwarders
          last weekend, also assured that the Authority will interact more with
          stakeholders in 2017, in order to keep abreast with happenings at the
          various ports.

          To this end, she said the NPA would introduce quarterly stakeholders
          meetings to know what is on ground at the ports, and be better informed on
          the plight of operators.

          ...

          To this end, she said there was the need for government to look into
          corruption at the ports and how to plug the leakages.63

6. SAFEGUARDING INTEGRITY IN MAJOR SPORT EVENTS

The International Olympic Committee (IOC), like other International Sport Organizations
(ISOs), has traditionally operated in a relatively independent manner free of domestic and/or
international governmental control pursuant to ISOs' "principle of autonomy" in sports
governance.65 Over the past decade however, the world of Major Sport Events (MSEs) has
evolved towards a much more collaborative relationship between ISOs. This sea change in
the model of governance of MSEs largely arose following allegations of bribery influencing
the selection process for the hosts of the FIFA World Cup in 2006 (Germany), 2010 (South
Africa), and 2022 (Qatar), as well as the Rio 2016 Olympic Games. In addition, the value
proposition for hosting these MSEs was called into question due to concerns of perceived

gigantism and the failures of Sochi 2014 and Rio 2016 to deliver the promised legacies of the
Olympic Games.66

These developments lead to independent ISO actors, such as the IOC, to increasingly enter
into more collaborative working relationships with host governments and other key
stakeholders in the sports industry. While remaining separate in their areas of specific
expertise, these public and private entities moved to a more intimate, inclusive and
collaborative institutional model for the planning, delivery, and oversight of MSEs. By
working together, these entities became more equipped to ensure better sustainability and
integrity outcomes for host communities.

This process of moving towards closer working relationships between the IOC and host
communities was facilitated by the IOC undergoing strategic reforms in two fundamental
areas: (i) the IOC reimagined the appropriate scale of the Games project and the efficiencies,
cost control measures, and delivery systems that should be applied to the awarding criteria,
allowing for the "New Norm" of Host City Selection and Games Delivery that focused on
producing optimal Games sustainability outcomes; and (ii) the measures taken by the IOC
to improve its internal systems to ensure greater transparency, accountability, and integrity
in its own operations.67

6.1 Olympic Agenda 2020: "New Norm" of Host City Selection and

       Games Delivery

In September 2013, the IOC introduced the "Olympic Agenda 2020."68 This was an open,
inclusive, and wide-ranging consultation involving multiple Olympic Movement
stakeholders as well as interested civil society organizations. The consultation aimed to
produce a new strategic roadmap for the future of the Olympic Movement that would
increase the IOC's capacity to leverage the Games to bring about positive change globally.
Through strengthening its own internal governance systems, the IOC increased the level of
transparency and ethical practices in its operations and outreach. The Olympic Agenda 2020
process ultimately developed 40 recommendations that were approved by the IOC Session
in December 2014.69

Importantly, the IOC intensified its efforts in the following years to continue renewing its
process of awarding future Games. A collaborative working process involving the IOC's
partners, industry experts, and the Olympic Games Delivery Executive Steering Committee

analysed every function of the Games operations, including venues, energy, broadcasting
accommodation, transport and technology, to determine how the Games could be made
more affordable, beneficial, and sustainable for future host cities.

This renewal process produced the "New Norm"--a set of 118 reforms pursuant to six
recommendations of Olympic Agenda 2020, adopted by the IOC at its 132nd Session in
2018.70 These reforms are designed to produce maximum cost savings (upwards of hundreds
of millions of dollars) in the delivery of the Games without compromising the Olympic
Games experience. The plan invites opportunities to reduce venue sizes, rethink transport
options in favour of public transit, optimise the use of pre-existing infrastructure, and reuse
the field of play of competition venues for various sports.71

The expanded Invitation Phase process communicated in Olympic Agenda 2020 and the
New Norm would apply immediately to the 2026 Olympic Winter Games Bid Process.72 But
the new collaborative approach to Games delivery and the rescaled model of the Games
contemplated in the new Candidature Phase would apply immediately to the process of
selecting the Paris 2024 and Los Angeles 2028 Summer Olympic Games.73 Both cities
previously hosted the Games; as such, their existing civic assets would obviate the need for
new large capital investments, such as those undertaken in relation to the Sochi 2014 Winter
Games and the Rio 2016 Summer Games.

6.2 Transparency and Accountability in IOC Operations and the Chief

       Ethics and Compliance Officer

The IOC enhanced the transparency of its operations by requiring the IOC financial
statements be prepared and audited pursuant to the global benchmark International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).74 A dedicated IOC Audit Committee oversees risk

management, financial reporting, compliance, internal controls, and governance within the
IOC.75 The IOC ultimately began requiring the publishing of an annual activity and financial
report, including the allowance policy for the expenses of IOC members which reaffirms the
volunteer status of IOC members. In doing so, the IOC demonstrated increased
accountability of its operations and greater transparency for the raising and spending of
revenue.

As a result of Olympic Agenda 2020, the Rules of Conduct for the Bid Process76 underwent
two significant changes designed to help promote transparency and integrity in the Bid
Process: (i) the new IOC Rules required consultants advising bidding cities to register with
a publicly listed IOC services (thus avoiding undisclosed conflicts of interest in the
consultancy sector); and (ii) the Host City Contract would henceforth be made public.77

Olympic Agenda 2020 also recommended the creation of the Chief Ethics and Compliance
Officer (CECO) position, which the IOC introduced in 2015.78 The function of the Ethics and
Compliance Office is primarily preventative, providing information and education on the
ethical principles guiding the IOC. The Office further provides an educational and advisory
role for the entire Olympic Movement, helping participants understand and apply ethical
rules and principles. For example, the work of the CECO includes protecting IOC Members
from the risk of being unwitting targets of `extreme promotion' by bid cities through an
iterative process, whereby the CECO answers questions regarding acceptable conduct in
promotional efforts by bid cities.

6.3 Collective Action in the MSEs Industry

The integrity of sports competitions is essential to attract the attention of fans and
participants; no one sport organization, regulator of the sports betting industry or law
enforcement entity can successfully address the issue of match fixing alone. Each
organization plays an important role in recognizing possible synergies in their joint efforts
and applying their resources to collectively address such issues; these interested parties
must work together in a coherent and synchronized way. Collective action among all these
organizations is required to provide the education and awareness, clear prohibitions against

betting on Olympic events, monitoring of betting patterns, safe reporting systems, and the
well-resourced investigation and sanctioning systems that are needed to tackle this
existential reputational problem for sport.

In Olympic Agenda 2020, IOC President Thomas Bach stated "we have first and foremost to
protect the clean athletes ... from doping, match-fixing, manipulation and corruption. We
have to change our way of thinking. We have to consider every single cent in the fight
against these evils not as an expense but as an investment in the future of Olympic Sport."79

      6.3.1 Integrity Betting Intelligence System

To mitigate the risk of competition manipulation, the IOC entered into a collaborative
working partnership with the stakeholders of the Olympic Movement and other interested
international organizations involved in safeguarding the integrity of sports competitions.
An early step to address this threat was the launch of the IOC's Integrity Betting Intelligence
System (IBIS)80 in 2014. IBIS is a centralized mechanism for the exchange of information and
intelligence that enables the sport movement to allocate and analyse information and
intelligence about potential match fixing. Once potential match fixing is identified by an IBIS
stakeholder, relevant entities (both from the licensed betting industry as well as government
regulatory agencies) are contacted. IBIS is a useful tool that enables closer cooperation
among sports organizations, sports betting operators and law enforcement who are aligned
in their goals to remove match fixing in sports competitions.

      6.3.2 International Forum on Sports Integrity

In 2015 the IOC hosted the first International Forum on Sports Integrity (the Forum).81 The
meeting included representatives from world governments, the Council of Europe, the
European Union, INTERPOL, Europol, United Nations agencies, sports betting operators,
Olympic Movement stakeholders, among other interested parties. The Forum is fully
supported by the Association of National Olympic Committees (ANOC), Association of
Summer Olympic International Federations (ASOIF), and Association of International
Olympic Winter Sports Federations (AIOWF).

The Forum was chaired by IOC President Thomas Bach who in his Opening Remarks stated:

          In Olympic Agenda 2020 we stressed the need to protect clean athletes from
          match-fixing, manipulation of competitions and related corruption....
          Today's forum has brought all key players around the table to address this
          need and coordinate our action. We are pleased with the support we have
          received so far in this regard, in particular from the Council of Europe. We

          European and non-European governments sign the Council of Europe's
          Convention on the Manipulation of Sports Competitions and continue to
          work hand-in-hand with us.82

The Forum created a roadmap for future action aimed at strengthening and coordinating all
activities to protect clean athletes from match fixing, manipulation of competitions, and
related corruption. The Forum called on European and non-European governments alike to
sign the Council of Europe Convention on the Manipulation of Sports Competitions, which
ensures that domestic laws enable criminal investigations and sanctioning of the
manipulation of sports competitions when it involves coercive, corrupt and/or fraudulent
practices.

The ongoing work of the Forum focuses on themes such as education and information,
intelligence and investigation, and legislation and regulation. The Forum's collaborative
research lead to reports of strategies to combat match fixing, including the Resource Guide on
Good Practices in the Investigation of Match-Fixing (the UNODC and the ICSS),83 and a
Handbook on Protecting Sport from Competition Manipulation (the IOC and Interpol).84 Europol
also produced a Situation Report entitled The Involvement of Organized Crime Groups in Sports
Corruption.85 The Forum allows these entities to work together to implement the strategies
identified in these top-level reports.

The IOC launched its new Integrity and Compliance Hotline86 at the Forum. The hotline is a
new reporting mechanism intended to bring to light potential cases of competition
manipulation as well as other violations of the integrity of sport. The web-based hotline is
open to athletes, coaches, referees, and the public, while guaranteeing 100% anonymity.
Anyone can report suspicious approaches or activities related to competition manipulation
and/or infringements of the IOC Code of Ethics87 or other matters--including financial
misconduct or other legal, regulatory, and ethical breaches--over which the IOC has
jurisdiction.

      6.3.3 International Partnership Against Corruption in Sport

The International Forum on Sport Integrity was also the occasion for the launch of the
International Partnership Against Corruption in Sport (IPACS).88 IPACS is a multi-
stakeholder platform, including government and inter-governmental organizations, such as
the United Nations, the European Union, the Council of Europe, Interpol, the United
Nations Office of Drugs and Crime (UNODC), and UNESCO, who joined forces in order to
"bring together international sports organisations, governments, inter-governmental
organisations, and other relevant stakeholders to strengthen and support efforts to eliminate
corruption and promote a culture of good governance in and around sport."89

The IOC, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the
Council of Europe, the UNODC, and the government of the United Kingdom coordinate the
work of IPACS. An important operating assumption informing these new working
partnerships is the recognition that no single organization can effectively address the
multiple corruption challenges facing sports on its own. Collective action among the major
public and private stakeholders in the sports world is needed. IPACS accomplishes its work
through expert task forces overseen by an IPACS Steering Committee and regular high-level
meetings among the IPACS organizations.

IPACS ultimately established four distinct working groups, focused upon:

      Task Force 1: reducing the risk of corruption in procurement relating to
          sporting events and infrastructure;90

      Task Force 2: ensuring integrity in the selection of major sporting events, with
          an initial focus on managing conflicts of interests;91

      Task Force 3: optimising the processes of compliance with good governance
          principles to mitigate the risk of corruption;92 and

      Task Force 4: enhancing effective cooperation between law enforcement,
          criminal justice authorities and sport organisations.93

      6.3.4 Summary of IOC Initiatives for Collective Action

Ultimately, Olympic Agenda 2020 has resulted in a more robust and collaborative
relationship between the IOC and the Olympic Movement to support host communities,
both at the bid and delivery stages of the Games cycle. The internal governance reforms of
the IOC have built a significant new capacity to raise awareness and educate members of
the Olympic Movement regarding the IOC's Code of Ethics, as well as how to identify,
investigate, and sanction alleged violations. Such measures apply to every element of the
work of the IOC, from the awarding of the Games to the design, build and hosting of the
Games.

Throughout this period, the IOC successfully strengthened its internal integrity
management systems to become more transparent and accountable. Further, the IOC
enhanced its collaborative relationships with other members of the Olympic Movement to
maximize the benefits local communities receive from hosting the Games. The IOC's
willingness to work closely with external partners has reasserted the Olympic Movement's
potential to utilize collective action in order to harness the power of sport for positive results.
These kinds of working relationships have not required the IOC to diminish its basic
principle of autonomy. Instead, the new collaborative approach has strengthened the IOC's
capability to deliver the Games.

How can the IOC's experience working with host nations and Olympic Movement
stakeholders be used in the closer working arrangements contemplated in Olympic Agenda
2020? How may these partnerships allow the IOC (while working closely with event
delivery partners) to reduce corruption in the build and hosting stages of the Games? How
can the IOC (and other ISOs) ensure that their officials comply with ethical conduct and
avoid considering inappropriate self-interests in the decision-making process? What bright
lines of ethical decision-making should apply both to the IOC and the other organizations
involved in MSEs?

No one organization may unilaterally dictate such guidelines to another organization
involved in these multi-stakeholder events. To bridge these fault lines of inter-
organizational behaviour, commonly accepted ethical norms to guide decision-making must
be embraced, communicated, and enforced. The future management of MSEs requires
greater consensus about the ways of doing business in this complex multi-stakeholder
environment. IBIS, the Forum, and IPACS are examples of important collective action
initiatives among global sport stakeholders who have embraced this kind of shared thinking
regarding appropriate conduct by both public and private actors in the MSE ecosystem. The
IOC and leading government organizations joined together to develop common standards
of behaviour and enforcement systems, applicable both internally and externally among
stakeholder organizations. Ultimately, IBIS, the Forum and IPACS (and other similar
collaborative initiatives) showcase how taking collective action on shared objectives can
make significant collective progress in the fight against corruption in the global sport
context.

7. INTEGRITY PACTS AND MONITORS

An integrity pact is a tool Transparency International (TI) developed in the 1990s to enhance
the power of collective action.94 It is "both a signed document and approach to public
contracting which commits a contracting authority and bidders to comply with best practice
and maximum transparency."95 In this project- or transaction-specific agreement between a
customer (usually a public entity, such as a government or government agency) and all
bidders for the contract (usually companies),96 the parties agree to a fair and transparent
process,97 thus enforcing accountability in public contracting.98 Importantly, Integrity Pacts
provide a proactive instrument to supplement the largely reactive process of law
enforcement.99 TI states that "when Integrity Pacts are first tried, there are often fears that
taking time for transparency and accountability will delay work. Experience has shown,
however, that they help ensure projects are delivered on time and within or below
budget."100

For this reason, TI further states that it is "highly desirable to make the signing of the
[Integrity Pact] mandatory,"101 because the Integrity Pact can function only if all bidders
submit to it. Although this mandatory, complete form of the Integrity Pact reflects the ideal
use of this mechanism, it is also valued for its flexibility: "in some jurisdictions they are used
in their complete form; in other jurisdictions only essential elements are used."102 Sometimes
they are voluntary and the party seeking the project tries to convince all bidders of the
advantages of having an Integrity Pact in place, other times they are imposed.103

7.1 Importance of Fairness Monitors

TI notes that "the Integrity Pact is based on a simple principle: full transparency at every
step of a well-designed contracting process."104 As such, Integrity Pacts are generally
overseen by Fairness Monitors--either independent experts or NGOs--that ensure
"increased levels of transparency and accountability, compliance with the Pact's
commitments."105

This independent monitoring is critical to preserve not only the terms of the Pact, but also
to determine when non-compliance measures outlined in the Integrity Pact need to be
enforced. Juanita Olaya, writing for the Water Integrity Network and Transparency
International, states this mechanism's importance:

          Without the monitoring system, the advantages created by an IP may be
          unrealized. The monitor scrutinises the process closely and guards the
          implementation and enforcement of the IP. He is the source of credibility,
          reassuring both the authority and the bidders that the process will go as
          agreed, and is a source of information for the general public, building trust
          in the contracting process.106

Olaya also notes that there are certain necessary qualities of a good monitor, including
independence, knowledge (of the project's contractual process and technical aspects),
capacity (time, effort, resources), accountability, and commitment.107 But beyond these
characteristics, there is no standard monitoring mechanism: the chosen monitor can be an
organisation or an individual, a governmental or non-governmental body, a national or
international body, etc.108

8. ACTIVE PARTICIPATION BY CIVIL SOCIETY IN GOVERNMENT
      PROCUREMENT

A report published by the G20 in 2020 noted that worldwide spending on infrastructure
reached approximately $2.7 trillion a year.109 According to estimates, between 10 and 30% of
investment in infrastructure is lost due to corruption, mismanagement, and inefficiency.110
The IMF found that losses due to inefficiency affect all countries, with an average 15%

efficiency gap in advanced economies, 34% in emerging markets and up to an astonishing
53% in low-income developing countries.111 Weaknesses in public investment management
institutions cause inefficiency, which increases the risk of rent-seeking and corruption,
resulting in major value losses from global spending on public infrastructure.112
Infrastructure development involves large, long-lasting, and complex projects characterized
by high degrees of information asymmetry. This structure makes it harder to detect inflated
prices, inferior quality, and/or slow-moving delivery.113

One recent example of this issue was found following a federal investigation in Brazil which
unveiled massive kickbacks paid by companies in return for construction contracts with
Petrobras, a majority-state-owned oil company.114 A group of companies colluded to secure
contracts with Petrobras, overcharging and diverting some of the funds and facilitating
kickback payments directed to Petrobras's management and top-level Brazilian political
elites. According to estimates from the Institute for Strategic Studies on Petroleum, Natural
Gas and Biofuels, this embezzlement scheme led to a reduction of 2% of GDP in Petrobras
investments and a 5% reduction in gross fixed capital formation, in addition to the
embezzlement of about $2.5 billion in public funds (0.13% of GDP) during 2004-2012.115 The
corrupt scheme remained undisclosed for such a long period partially due to serious
vulnerabilities in the internal control framework of Brazil's national oil company, a low level
of transparency, lax disclosure rules, and a fragmented external oversight system, involving
multiple government agencies that proved to be incapable of detecting the irregularities.116

The Infrastructure Transparency Initiative (referred to as CoST) was previously known as
the Construction Sector Transparency Initiative. It is a global multi-stakeholder program
that strives to achieve greater transparency, participation, and accountability in public sector
infrastructure constructions. CoST was launched in 2015 and is funded by the UK and the
Netherlands. It is an important example of collective action that brings together
governments, businesses and civil society to promote the disclosure, validation, and
interpretation of data from infrastructure projects. CoST is operating in 19 participating
countries, most of which are developing nations. By helping make data on infrastructure
public and accessible, CoST informs and empowers civil society organizations and citizens
to hold decision-makers accountable for funds held in public trust. In doing so, CoST seeks
to improve the quality of public infrastructure projects and reduce risks of inefficiency,
mismanagement, and corruption.117

8.1 CoST Pilot Project

The creation of CoST was inspired by the success of the Extractive Industries Transparency
Initiative (EITI) in bringing good governance practices in the non-renewable natural
resources sector, and it employs a similar framework. Since its creation in 2003, the EITI has
established a global standard to promote the open and accountable management of oil, gas,
and mineral resources. It does so through bringing together multi-stakeholder groups of
government, companies and civil society to implement, adapt and supervise the observance
of the EITI Standard.118 The Standard requires the disclosure of information along the
extractive industry value chain, from the point of extraction as revenues make their way
through the government, and reports on whether public benefit resulted. The EITI seeks to
strengthen public and corporate governance, promote understanding of natural resource
management, and provide the data to inform reforms for greater transparency and
accountability in the extractives sector. Since the launch of its pilot project in four countries
in 2003, the EITI has grown to include 56 member countries worldwide.119

CoST shares a similar story. It began as a 2008-2010 pilot initiative by the World Bank and
the United Kingdom's Department for International Development.120 The CoST pilot project
spanned eight countries: Ethiopia, Malawi, Philippines, Tanzania, the UK, Vietnam, Zambia,
and Guatemala (which joined in 2009). In each country, CoST organized a national Multi-
Stakeholder Group (MSG), comprising representatives from government, industry, and civil
society.121 The pilot program consisted of a comprehensive baseline study of several core
indicators across countries: a) existing levels of transparency and rules on disclosure
regarding public infrastructure projects b) levels of competition in procurement (bidding
statistics), and c) performance of construction projects in terms of time, cost and quality (i.e.,
time and cost overruns, and orders to remedy defective work).122 A standard methodology
was developed to evaluate each of the aforementioned indicators in participating countries,
enabling future assessment of the results of various reforms.123

MSGs were tasked to profile the local construction sector, the laws and regulations relating
to public administration and transparency, and relevant institutions and initiatives relating
to governance in the country. The groups tested disclosure processes across several
procuring entities to assemble a list of key project data and performed assurance reviews of
disclosed data, identifying causes for concern and helping stakeholders to understand the

main issues.124 The pilot project drew data from the assessment of 100 infrastructure projects
in essential services: housing, road-building, supply of water, healthcare, education and
emergency prevention infrastructure.125 CoST looked specifically at how a multi-stakeholder
approach could increase transparency and accountability in the delivery of infrastructure
projects.126

The pilot presented noteworthy findings necessary for replicating CoST on a broad scale.
The study found that existing transparency requirements regarding tenders were aimed at
participants, but did little to inform the public about projects.127 Moreover, none of the pilot
countries required disclosure of changes to contract time and cost during project
implementation, and only one country required disclosure of final cost and time after project
completion.128 Time overruns for construction were found to be extensive and exceeded cost
overruns.129 The study also identified the most important barriers to broader disclosure:

     (i) Poor information management and limited technical capacity of procuring
              entities. In many countries, systems for storing and retrieving project
              information were found to be weak or non-existent. Moreover, the large
              number of agencies involved in planning, procurement, and delivery of
              construction projects lead to scattered storage of project information in hard
              copies rather than a compilation of all the project data in unified electronic
              databases.

     (ii) Skepticism over the potential benefits of wider disclosure. In the UK,
              officials from procurement entities expressed the view that public interest in
              information about construction project execution was generally lacking and
              questioned the value of transparency as a tool against corruption.

     (iii) The additional cost of compiling information in the absence of electronic
              data storage. Officials in Malawi, Zambia, Guatemala, and the UK
              suggested that in the absence of electronic storage and an improved records
              management system, the compilation of project-level data in an appropriate
              format for publication would carry significant costs that might outweigh
              potential benefits.130

The pilot project resulted in substantive recommendations for legislative improvements,
enhancing broader transparency and strengthening its enforcement, and building technical
capacity for data management to facilitate public disclosure.131 The pilot project

"demonstrated that the CoST approach could be applied across different contexts and
various government systems and infrastructure sub-sectors."132

8.2 After Initial Success: CoST Approach, Development, and Toolkit

Subsequent to the successful pilot project, CoST was established as a London-based charity
and by 2020 expanded its activity to an impressive 19 national and sub-national members
and affiliates spanning four continents.133 Over time CoST has become a well-recognized
international initiative in promoting transparency through collective action. The success of
the CoST approach resulted in many governments institutionalizing it through legal and
policy frameworks. CoST facilitates the collaborative efforts of governments, the private
sector and communities to achieve better economic efficiency in infrastructure projects by
providing them with a set of principles and guidance on increasing transparency,
accountability, and participation in public infrastructure.134 In addition to working with
CoST members at the national level, CoST engages with a variety of key international
organizations (World Bank, TI, FIDIC, Article 19, Open Contracting Partnership, Hivos,
Civic-20), facilitating the global exchange of experience and knowledge on transparency and
accountability in public infrastructure135 and pursuing common goals to better the delivery
of infrastructure.136

CoST's collaborative approach has four core features:

      Multi-stakeholder working: In each country, CoST is directed by groups
          comprising representatives of key stakeholders of infrastructure projects:
          government, private sector and civil society. CoST serves as a neutral forum for
          the stakeholders to negotiate and pursue shared objectives to ensure value for
          money from infrastructure investment.

      Disclosure: CoST increases transparency by promoting the public disclosure of
          data on public infrastructure projects such as the purpose, scope, costs, and
          implementation of infrastructure projects. To facilitate disclosure, CoST has
          designed a CoST Infrastructure Data Standard (CoST IDS).137 This tool requires
          procuring entities to disclose 40 data points ("items") across key stages of the
          infrastructure project cycle. In turn, it puts data from the inception to the
          completion of infrastructure projects into an accessible, understandable, and
          applicable format for both policy-makers and the public. In 2018-2019 in
          collaboration with Open Contracting Partnership, CoST has designed a new

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

          Open Contracting for Infrastructure Data Standard (OC4IDS) that members are
          encouraged to adopt.138

      Assurance: CoST conducts an independent review of the disclosed data. CoST
          validates technical data, interprets it into plain language, and identifies
          concerns through this assurance process. Stakeholders can then understand the
          main issues, and it acts as a basis for holding decision-makers to account.

      Social accountability: Social accountability stakeholders such as the media,
          civil society, and citizens work with CoST to publicly promote the findings from
          the CoST assurance process and to use the disclosed data to monitor
          infrastructure projects. The social accountability factor creates a platform for
          communities to address officials on the issues that are important to them. Civil
          society representatives hold positions on multi-stakeholder groups which guide
          the delivery of programmes. To ensure the expertise of participants from civil
          society, CoST carries out regular training programmes on identifying and
          processing relevant project data through the government's online data
          disclosure platforms. The same training is available for journalists. In 2017,
          Josue Quintana, a CoST-trained reporter in Honduras, published an article
          exposing a miscalculation of about $170 million on a road and bridge expansion
          and reconstruction project. The government reviewed the contract after
          growing media pressure and receiving guidance from the CoST Honduras
          assurance process.139

In 2018 CoST developed the manual Infrastructure Monitoring Tool, and in 2020 it launched
the Electronic Infrastructure Monitoring Tool (e-IMT), an online platform for tracking the
progress and quality of infrastructure delivery. The main function of the e-IMT is to compile
and provide access to up-to-date pivotal project information regarding its status and any
issues. The e-IMT's oversight role prevents financial mismanagement, health and safety
failings, and poor project outcomes.140

CoST has developed several informative tools and standards to facilitate disclosure and
increase the technical capabilities of member countries to manage data on infrastructure
projects and make it publicly accessible:

      Open Contracting for Infrastructure Data Standard (OC4IDS):141 This toolkit,
          developed with Open Contracting Partnership, provides a comprehensive

141 In 2018, Open Contracting Partnership and CoST came together in a collaborative effort to develop
a standard for transparency in infrastructure project delivery. The CoST IDS identifies key items and
creates a framework for disclosing project data by procuring entities. Much of this data can be

          approach to disclosure, combining current best standards for publishing
          contract and project-level data. It is applied to e-platforms, encouraging vital
          data centralization and accessibility in `real time.' The OC4IDS provides tools
          for publishing and monitoring standardized data on infrastructure projects.142

      CoST Infrastructure Disclosure Platform: Developed by CoST Honduras, the
          Information and Monitoring System for Works and Supervision Contracts
          (SISOCS) provides easy access to data on thousands of public and public-private
          partnership projects. The platform code for this tool became open source in 2021,
          enabling worldwide attention on the transparency of a range of high-value
          projects.

      Infrastructure Transparency Index (ITI): A tool that measures and compares
          levels of transparency in the infrastructure sector. Procuring entities are scored
          on key transparency indicators including disclosure practices and citizen
          participation and assessed for improvement of their performance in a country's
          infrastructure sector over time.

      CoST data analytics guidance: CoST Ukraine's data analytical tool generates
          visual representations of state investments in infrastructure. The tool brings
          attention to data related to the successful bidders, changes to budgets and
          timeframes, and geographical differences in investment. CoST provides
          disclosure guidance for CoST members on how to adopt and use the tool on e-
          platforms in the private sector.143

captured and verified through the Open Contracting Data Standard (OCDS), another tool developed
by Open Contracting Partnership, to describe millions of procurement processes around the world
relating to goods, services and public works. Infrastructure projects are typically long-term processes
that include numerous contracts for planning, design and preparation work, construction, and
implementation monitoring.
Another problem arose from scattered published data on infrastructure projects and contracts, which
populated disparate systems and needed to be manually matched, creating additional obstacles and
extra time expenditures for monitors. The collaborative efforts of the two organizations linked the
OCDS and CoST IDS, thereby creating a comprehensive dataset (known as OC4IDS) to facilitate
monitoring. OC4IDS leverages both standards, combining CoST's work on which project data to
disclose with OCP's work on what to disclose about contracting processes. The project was
implemented during June 2018-March 2019, providing CoST MSGs with access to scalable tools and
methods to secure access to open data on infrastructure projects, monitor project design and
performance, and drive better quality and more affordable infrastructure. "About" (last visited 25

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

The CoST program, scalable to different political, economic and social systems, involves
modifying the universal approach for each country's context. Before developing and
implementing country-specific recommendations, CoST conducts a baseline study, which
aims to identify the main vulnerabilities and need for reforms and technical assistance. For
example, in the scoping study on Ukraine, CoST noted that despite disclosure and
availability of information in the public domain, there was one significant missing link--the
lack of any significant impact on how Ukrainian state road operators managed business and
spent money. Therefore, the main focus of CoST Ukraine shifted towards launching a
platform for systemic public oversight and assurance regarding large-scale investment
projects in the road building sector.144

8.3 CoST Success Stories and Results

Thanks to CoST support and technical assistance, by the end of 2020, CoST members
disclosed data on more than 38,000 investments.145 Tools and standards developed by CoST
through almost ten years of work are now recognized as international best practices,
receiving endorsements from the G20, UNDP, the European Investment Bank, Transparency
International, World Bank, Global Infrastructure Basel, and FIDIC. In 2019, over 5,200 people
from government, civil society, investigative journalism, and the private sector were trained
to use infrastructure data.146 The number of private sector representatives who received
training in 2019 doubled in comparison to the previous year, indicating a shift in the industry
towards more transparency and signaling early success in collective action.147

Besides the general increase in transparency and public awareness on spending in delivering
infrastructure projects, CoST assurance reports prevent efficiency gaps and improve
delivery quality. Evidence produced by CoST has been used to catalyze the closure of
corrupt public institutions in Honduras;148 to pressure a Ukrainian contractor into correcting
serious defects in a bridge;149 to trigger institutional reforms that reduced waste and
inefficiency in Afghanistan;150 and to deter wasteful procurement in Thailand, leading to
savings of $460 million.151 Findings from CoST studies and reports also helped to advocate
for legislative amendments in Guatemala, stopping the frequently used scheme of

establishing NGOs as a means of bypassing procurement regulations and siphoning off
funding intended for public infrastructure projects.152

CoST helped avoid waste of over $7.4 million in the over-run on road rehabilitation in
Malawi.153 CoST also generated savings of $3.5 million on building a road in Ethiopia,154
money that enabled the government to undertake other important development projects.
The CoST process in building a road in Ethiopia is further described as follows.

 An Example of the CoST Process at Work

 Road projects represent around a quarter of the annual infrastructure budget of the
 Ethiopian federal government. The Road Sector Development Program therefore
 constitutes one of the major lines of federal spending.

 From 2010 to 2016, CoST Ethiopia's assurance process reviewed 52 building, road and
 water infrastructure projects representing investments worth $3.27 billion.155 Thirty-two of
 them are road sub-sector projects. The building of the Gindebir to Gobenza Road in Eastern
 Ethiopia exemplifies CoST's impact. The exorbitant price of the road caught public
 attention and triggered an inquiry from the federal anti-corruption agency, and the agency
 requested technical support from CoST Ethiopia to evaluate the cost of the road.

 As a 2018 CoST report notes, "CoST Ethiopia's Assurance Team highlighted that original
 plans for the road in Eastern Ethiopia exaggerated the volume of retaining wall and
 excavation required for the road-building project. CoST Ethiopia's MSG then held a
 workshop involving the media and civil society organizations, sparking considerable
 interest in reviewing costs. As a result, the Government of Ethiopia adopted an alternative
 design for the road project. Furthermore, the original designers were debarred from
 Government contracts for two years."156

 The design adopted by the government resulted in $3.5 million in savings, which Eyasu
 Yimer, Vice-Chair of Transparency Ethiopia, noted could be applied towards "[building]
 a two-block school that may allow 500 students to attend."

 Lastly, the 2018 CoST report also notes that "CoST Ethiopia's disclosure of information on
 a rural road project led to a reduction in construction time by six months, bringing the

 benefits to the rural community earlier than expected. Since the first sections of the road
 opened in 2011, it is reported that the income of local farmers has more than doubled."157

CoST supported member governments to improve their response to the COVID-19 crisis. As
a result, CoST compiled robust guidance on application of the CoST approach in situations
of crisis. In Honduras, the CoST approach was implemented as a governance component
during the construction of 93 new health facilities as part of the rapid response to the
COVID-19 pandemic.158

8.4 Future Projects

The 2020 independent review recognized the significant impact of CoST worldwide, but also
pointed out the areas of further improvement. Among them, the report noted: "a more
robust monitoring, evaluation, accountability and learning framework; a more diverse
funding base; a significant increase in income; recognition for CoST members and individual
reformers who drive success; and prioritising the development and roll-out of the
Infrastructure Transparency Index."159

Recognizing the need to accelerate the delivery of good quality infrastructure services in
order to reach the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals and meet global
challenges, CoST has recently adopted a Business Plan for 2021-2025. Its focus for the years
to come is scaling up and responding to latent demand to deliver a step-change in impact.
The plan outlines the following strategic priorities:

      increasing global impact through a growing number of CoST members and
          affiliates (the projected increase in 12 new members);

      increasing international support for improving transparency, participation and
          accountability in infrastructure investment;

      improving learning and knowledge sharing; and

      ensuring efficient use of resources to maximize impact.160

8.5 Best Practice in Collective Action

CoST's success lies with its approach. It is directed towards committed, resilient, and
influential multi-stakeholder groups from government, civil society, and private sectors. By
bringing them all together around the table, CoST ensures key components: political will,
innovation by large industry players, and effective monitoring of the use of public funds. A
committed group of stakeholders starts changing "the rules of the game," shifting the

construction industry towards more transparency and accountability in project delivery.
Empowering media and civil society representatives through ongoing training and
education events guarantees monitoring of compliance with disclosure requirements and
delivery of infrastructure projects. Assurance reports highlight issues and lead to
government action. Finally, the institutionalization of the implemented rules on disclosure
ensures the long-lasting effect of the change, entrenching them against potential political
turbulence.

CoST presents an excellent example of the success of collective action in curbing corruption.
As an independent arbiter, CoST works to persuade all stakeholders that they benefit from
reducing mismanagement and corruption. Governments benefit from better management of
public infrastructure projects, including more competitive prices and a larger bidder pool.
For politicians, better performance means greater chances of re-election, while bureaucrats
enjoy increased job security and opportunities for promotion. The private sector profits from
an improved investment climate and level playing field. Citizens enjoy advantages that
come from better quality infrastructure, better value received for taxes paid, and greater
trust in both government and the private sector.161 Once the key players reach this
understanding and decide to implement new disclosure rules, the next most important
question for everyone involved in the collaborative effort against corruption is how to
ensure that no one cheats the rules and unduly benefits from deflecting.

As an independent non-profit organization, CoST enjoys a heightened level of trust from
key stakeholders: government, business, and civil society. Greater credibility makes CoST
well placed to launch collective action and bring together pivotal players who might suffer
from a lack of mutual trust. Therefore, CoST bridges the gap between various parties and
builds trust between them, guaranteeing that all the players abide by the same rules and
align their activities in a collaborative effort to bring more transparency and integrity in
infrastructure. After setting up a multi-stakeholder group in a member country, CoST also
balances the power inequality between parties. The most important role played by CoST in
the initial stage of implementing disclosure procedures is that of the external monitor,
issuing assurance reports and ensuring that both government and businesses fully abide by
the new rules and make the information on infrastructure procurement publicly available.
Simultaneously, CoST provides training to media and civil society representatives, building
up their capacity to take over monitoring once the project has been implemented.

Such an approach guarantees that the multi-stakeholder group can continue to exist
independently even after CoST "exits." Moreover, government, business, and civil society
are all well-equipped to perform their function within the partnership. They also have
relatively equal bargaining power and an effective system of "checks and balances" to
prevent collusion and deviation. This ultimately promotes trust and institutionalizes a new
culture and new rules of doing business, makes deflections intolerable, and drives smaller
market actors to embrace new rules--thereby creating a self-fulfilling virtuous spiral.

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

CoST collaboration with Open Contracting Partnership on developing OC4IDS represents
collective action on an even larger scale. The cooperation between the two organizations in
turn facilitates collective action by other parties. The OC4IDS is not merely a tool to link two
otherwise separate datasets for better monitoring. Rather, it serves the much more important
function of bringing together multi-stakeholder groups of different projects--project data
and contract data transparency--to align their interests and powers in advocating for more
transparency, integrity, and better funds management.

                 CHAPTER 16 ROLE OF NGOS

1. INTRODUCTION

The role of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in combatting corruption is recognized
in the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC)1 as a key part of any anti-
corruption effort in any country. The Preamble states:

          Bearing in mind that the prevention and eradication of corruption is a
          responsibility of all States and that they must cooperate with one another,
          with the support and involvement of individuals and groups outside the
          public sector, such as civil society, non-governmental organizations and
          community-based organizations, if their efforts in this area are to be
          effective.

Article 13 of the UNCAC, entitled "Participation of society" states:

          1. Each State Party shall take appropriate measures, within its means and in
                accordance with fundamental principles of its domestic law, to promote
                the active participation of individuals and groups outside the public
                sector, such as civil society, non-governmental organizations and
                community-based organizations, in the prevention of and the fight against
                corruption and to raise public awareness regarding the existence, causes
                and gravity of and the threat posed by corruption. This participation
                should be strengthened by such measures as:

                     (a) Enhancing the transparency of and promoting the
                           contribution of the public to decision-making processes;

                     (b) Ensuring that the public has effective access to information;

                     (c) Undertaking public information activities that contribute to
                           non-tolerance of corruption, as well as public education
                           programmes, including school and university curricula;

                     (d) Respecting, promoting and protecting the freedom to seek,
                           receive, publish and disseminate information concerning
                           corruption. That freedom may be subject to certain
                           restrictions, but these shall only be such as are provided for by
                           law and are necessary:

                                (i) For respect of the rights or reputations of others;

                                (ii) For the protection of national security or ordre
                                     public or of public health or morals.

          2. Each State Party shall take appropriate measures to ensure that the
                relevant anti-corruption bodies referred to in this Convention are known
                to the public and shall provide access to such bodies, where appropriate,

                for the reporting, including anonymously, of any incidents that may be
                considered to constitute an offence established in accordance with this
                Convention.

The UNCAC's Chapter VII: Mechanisms for Implementation, Article 63 states:

          Conference of the States Parties to the Convention

                1. A Conference of the States Parties to the Convention is hereby
                     established to improve the capacity of and cooperation between
                     States Parties to achieve the objectives set forth in this Convention
                     and to promote and review its implementation.

                     ...

                4. The Conference of the States Parties shall agree upon activities,
                     procedures and methods of work to achieve the objectives set
                     forth in paragraph 1 of this article, including:

                     ...

                     (c) Cooperating with relevant international and regional
                           organizations and mechanisms and non-governmental
                           organizations ...

The communiqués of bi-annual United Nations anti-corruption conferences have
highlighted the need for every jurisdiction to implement broad, multi-pronged enforcement
measures. The importance of raising public awareness of corruption through education and
public promotion initiatives and support of civil society anti-corruption organizations is a
particular measure that continues to receive emphasis.2

The 34 member countries of the OECD have adopted several guidelines concerning political
ethics enforcement, including The 10 Principles for Transparency and Integrity in Lobbying.3
Principle 10 states that civil society (non-profit, citizen organizations, media, etc.) should be
involved in the regular review of the implementation and impact of restrictions on lobbyists,
along with public office holders, lobbyists, and watchdog agencies.

Regional anti-corruption conventions also require the participation of NGOs. For example,
Article 12 of the African Union Convention on Preventing and Combating Corruption
(AUCPCC) states that parties should involve NGOs in raising public awareness and
assisting with the implementation of the Convention. Article 12 also states NGOs should
play a role in monitoring compliance.4

Courts have also recognized the key role of NGOs. A ruling by the European Court of
Human Rights stated that NGOs are "one of the most important actors in the democratic
process."5

However, despite these lofty words and commitments, in reality, anti-corruption efforts are
a multi-year struggle for NGOs. In many cases, it is an out-and-out decades-long battle to
pressure and push governments and big businesses to make even the most basic changes to
rules and enforcement measures to combat corruption. Often, an ongoing campaign is
necessary to prevent rollback of any changes that have been won.

The strategies and tactics deployed by NGOs to manifest these changes vary country by
country, jurisdiction by jurisdiction, and span across the full spectrum of nonviolent (and in
some situations, violent) actions. Of course, there are debates about which strategies and
tactics are effective. The debates are based upon competing and conflicting theories
regarding how social change occurs and arguments concerning what has actually happened
in any country or jurisdiction efforts to stop corruption.

Given space limitations, this chapter provides a sketch of the role of NGOs in combatting
corruption. Thousands of NGOs are involved in anti-corruption work worldwide, and it is
impossible to summarize their efforts in one chapter. Determining which anti-corruption
strategies have been, or will be, effective in a given jurisdiction is immensely challenging.
Such debates require the consideration of a wide range of topics, a multitude of events, and
all conceivable anti-corruption efforts. Given that there is debate on how exactly changes
have occurred, any discussion on anti-corruption efforts also necessarily involves the
discourse surrounding the theories, methods and approaches of documenting any historical
event.6

As a result, this chapter provides only an overview of these strategies and tactics and the
debates concerning their effectiveness, along with a case study based on the author's
experience since 1993 as the Coordinator of Democracy Watch in Canada. To be clear, this
chapter focuses on the role of citizen-run NGOs, as opposed to NGOs that are affiliated
directly or indirectly with governments or politicians, such as the Global Organization of
Parliamentarians Against Corruption (GOPAC) and the Inter-Parliamentary Union, because
their structure and operations differ in significant ways. Associations of politicians often
undertake some of the same activities as citizen-run NGOs and face the same types of

resistance to their anti-corruption efforts as citizen-run NGOs, especially their members who
are politicians in opposition parties. However, very different and distinct laws, structures
and societal roles usually apply to political parties, politicians, and government-affiliated
NGOs, which makes it difficult to summarize their role while simultaneously summarizing
the role of citizen-run NGOs. Further, this chapter focuses on NGOs that are involved in the
distinct role of advocating for anti-corruption measures, as opposed to other NGOs like
media outlets that play a role in monitoring governments and corruption. All of these
actors--political associations, parties, citizen-run NGOs, media, and the public overall--are
part of what is commonly called "civil society." The role of citizen-run advocacy NGOs as
one sector of civil society involved in anti-corruption efforts is the focus of this chapter.

2. RELATIONSHIPS WITH GOVERNMENTS AND BUSINESSES

A major factor in the role, strategies, and tactics of any NGO working on anti-corruption
initiatives is its relationship with the governments and businesses in which jurisdiction(s) it
operates. The range of relationships begins at the low end with violent repression in
jurisdictions where none or few of the rights set out in the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and the International
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights7 have been recognized or enacted into law. In
jurisdictions where rights have been enacted and are respected and enforced at a basic level,
the relationship often moves to nonviolent repression and resistance. In jurisdictions where
a fuller set of rights have been enacted and are respected and enforced through a more
comprehensive system, the range of possible relationships cover every step of Sherry
Arnstein's classic "Ladder of Citizen Participation," for governments and businesses:

     1. manipulating NGOs and citizens through dishonest, secretive and unethical
          dealings and public relations efforts; to

     2. informing NGOs of policy changes; to

     3. consulting them while developing changes; to

     4. placating and co-opting them; to

     5. partnering with them (in rare cases); to

     6. delegating powers to them (even more rare); and, at the top end to

     7. circumstances where NGOs and citizens have control over policy (extremely
          rare).8

Based on the provisions of the UNCAC, OECD, and other international conventions,
governments are required to have the following relationship with NGOs:

     1. To protect, through laws and other supports, all of the fundamental rights of
          freedom of association, freedom of expression, and the right to petition the
          government and the courts for changes, set out in the Universal Declaration of
          Human Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights,
          and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, subject only to
          restrictions to protect the rights and reputations of others (for example,
          through laws prohibiting defamation, and those protecting national security
          and public order (i.e., laws prohibiting violent protests));

     2. To promote the active participation of NGOs in anti-corruption efforts;

     3. To promote the transparent contribution of NGOs to government decision-
          making processes concerning anti-corruption measures, including involving
          them in developing, implementing, and regularly reviewing these measures;

     4. To ensure access to government information;

     5. To raise public awareness regarding the existence, causes and gravity of and
          the threat posed by corruption; and

     6. To allow, arguably, funding from outside the jurisdiction to support NGOs'
          work, including anti-corruption activities.

In 2020, the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) included
Article 33 in its General Comment #37 on Article 21 of the International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights (ICCPR). Article 21 protects the right to peaceful assembly. With regard to the
sixth requirement mentioned above, the World Movement of Democracy argues that the
inclusion of Article 33 is "the strongest international mechanism yet for protecting civil
society's right to receive funding."9 The General Comment is enforceable in international
law, and Article 33 sets out the requirements for governments to protect the actions of
individuals and organizations leading up to a gathering, including the protection of actions
related to the "mobilization of resources."10 However, as discussed below, the practice of
international funding has been controversial, and the right of NGOs to receive outside
support has been attacked more and more aggressively by governments around the world
since 2005.

2.1 Evolution of International Aid

Democracy aid efforts, with anti-corruption aid as a subset of those efforts, evolved and
expanded from the late 1980s with three main approaches. These approaches are aimed at

changing the relationship between governments and NGOs, and the citizens involved in
both, to fulfill the requirements discussed in Section 2. Of course, this undertaking was just
the beginning of a sustained long-term effort, given that so few governments had fulfilled
even a few of the requirements. The three main approaches are:

     1. support for key democratic institutions and processes (especially free and fair
          elections and political parties);

     2. strengthening key institutions that check the power of the national government,
          especially parliaments, judiciaries, and local governments; and

     3. support for civil society (NGOs, media, labour unions, and civic-education
          initiatives).11

Initial aid efforts supported NGOs, but primarily NGOs that existed only due to the support
of international aid or those that provided state services. NGOs that advocated for reform
to stop corruption and ensure the proper use of public money for the provision of public
goods and services received much less support.12 The lessons learned from the past four
decades have led substantially more aid organizations to recognize that capacity-building
within local NGOs, which are rooted in, connected to, and supported by the mass of the
public, can be key to advancing democratic (and relatedly, anti-corruption) reforms.13

Advocacy NGOs generally need support from outside their jurisdiction, especially in
countries where income inequality is extreme, as the public simply does not have the money
to sustain these organizations at a level that allows for effective action. As well, even in
countries with a lower rate of income inequality, advocacy NGOs often criticize and
challenge political parties, politicians and officials across the political spectrum--thus
making it difficult to raise funding from anyone who supports any party or politician.
Finally, anti-corruption advocacy is often aimed at the political and business elite of any
country, who usually control significant funding sources such as government and private or
family foundation grants. These `elites' are often reluctant to support initiatives aimed at
challenging how they are exercising their power, especially those which challenge corrupt
activities.

2.2 Funding Systems in the US, UK, and Canada

The US, however, is an exception to the general trends regarding NGO fundraising. For
example, Candid, an NGO, is supported by several foundations that provide grants for
democratic reform work in the US. Candid has a data tool that illustrates this point. A search
of the foundation grants in Candid's database in August 2021, reveals that since 2011 a total

of 828 funders had granted $287.4 million to 1,084 organizations under the category
"campaign finance." This $287.4 million is part of the $12.3 billion granted by 13,971 funders
to 27,508 organizations for democratic reform work in the US since 2011.14

The UK is also somewhat an exception to this trend, though not to the same extent as the
US. The government funding body, the "Westminster Foundation for Democracy," supports
NGOs and civil society groups in 38 non-UK countries.15 The UK Democracy Fund16
supports several democratic reform and education organizations, including some that work
on anti-corruption initiatives. Transparency International UK (TI UK) had a $9 million
annual budget in 2020, but about half the amount came from international funders, with
much of the funding allocated towards addressing corruption outside the UK.17 TI UK is a
member of the UK Anti-Corruption Coalition (the Coalition), which focuses on a wide scope
of anti-corruption issues both inside and outside the UK. The Coalition largely consists of
organizations concerned with international development issues and the UK government's
role abroad, including its implicit and explicit support of corrupt practices by other
governments. The composition of the Coalition lends to its focus on issues of corrupt
practices by other governments.18 Bond19 is a network of more than 400 international
development organizations and other international initiatives based in the UK. Bond,
however, primarily works on stopping corruption in other countries rather than in the UK.
Overall, the UK has far fewer organizations working on democratic reforms and anti-
corruption when compared proportionally to the US.20

In stark contrast, there is almost no government funding nor grants from private or family
foundations available for anti-corruption (or any kind of democratic reform) work focused
on the laws that apply to politicians and government officials and their actions in Canada.
The Canadian government grants tens of millions annually to support NGOs and civil
society organizations trying to win democratic reforms abroad.21 The government, however,
provides no support for these efforts in Canada (nor do any sub-national governments in
Canada). Based on US statistics, discussed above, and the fact that the Canadian economy is
approximately one-tenth the size of the US economy, Canada should have had, since 2011,

83 funders grant $29 million to 100 organizations working on campaign finance reforms
alone. In other words, an average of $2.9 million should have been granted annually over
the past decade just for work on that issue. And 1,400 funders should have granted $1.2
billion to 2,750 democratic reform organizations over the past decade for democratic reform
work.

Even Transparency International Canada only had a budget of approximately CDN$358,700
in 2020.22 This budget is barely adequate to operate at a basic level, let alone undertake multi-
pronged activities. Almost half that budget came from one anonymous donor; one-quarter
from sources outside Canada, and only four percent from the government. Since it was
established in 1996 and throughout its history, TI Canada received even less annual funding.
Further, the funding was almost exclusively for initiatives focused on anti-corruption
activities outside of Canada--mainly bribery of foreign governments by Canadian
companies. Only in the past few years did TI Canada begin to undertake any initiatives
focused on stopping corruption from occurring within Canada. These initiatives call for laws
to be enacted establishing registries that disclose the actual owners of all corporations and
properties in the country (known as a "beneficial ownership" law).23

Democracy Watch is the only national NGO in Canada that focuses on anti-corruption
advocacy broadly. Democracy Watch's work involves campaigns for reforms and
enforcement of laws, and filing complaints and court cases against both public sector and
business officials across the political spectrum, in the areas of bribery, money laundering,
government procurement, political finance, lobbying, conflict of interest, access to
information, and whistleblower protection.24 Since the establishment of Democracy Watch
in 1993, no government program has ever had grants available to support activities in any
of these areas. Only two private foundations have ever provided grants to Democracy
Watch, and those grants were discretionary and not part of an ongoing or even temporary
anti-corruption granting program. The organization relies almost entirely on donations from
individual Canadians, 95% of whom donate less than CDN$150 annually, and has never had
enough funding to pay for more than two employees.25

2.3 International Aid and NGO Challenges

In many countries funding from outside the country supports NGOs' anti-corruption efforts
worldwide. However, foreign governments and international agencies and NGOs'
involvement in supporting domestic NGOs can have negative effects, no matter how
grassroots-based the domestic NGOs. Foreign and international involvement raises
questions of who is directing the activities of the domestic NGOs, whose interests are being

furthered, and whether the dependency on international funding changes the domestic
NGOs' priorities to suit the funders. When suspicions arise due to support from foreign
governments and their agencies (such as the US National Endowment for Democracy), as
well as international agencies, it becomes relatively easy for a government to incite the public
to believe that the foreign entity is attempting to undermine or even overthrow the
government. This narrative is particularly compelling given the history of the US, Russia,
England, China, and other colonial and imperial powers intervening in the affairs of other
countries.26 Particular concerns emerge with internationally operating NGOs connected to
political parties. The International Republican Institute's direct connection with the US
Republican Party and the National Democratic Institute's loose connection with the US
Democratic Party, serve as two examples of this phenomenon.27 NGOs in a developing
country working in concert with or in support of opposition parties raise similar questions.

The difficulties of providing support have become acute in the past 15 years. Through the
1980s and up to the mid-2000s, funding from international sources was generally not
actively challenged or questioned. However, according to the World Movement for
Democracy, since 2012, governments in 70 countries have enacted more than 160 laws to
restrict the rights of NGOs to receive international funding to support their activities.28
Several factors have led to these restrictions: first, the effectiveness of NGOs to mobilize the
public can threaten governments and governing parties and politicians; second, many
governments resist international pressure generally, and, more specifically, international
pressure applied through the support of NGOs; and third, many governments look to
undermine opposition parties and movements by tying them to foreign governments and
agencies.29

Funders have adopted a variety of methods to try to neutralize these efforts by governments.
One method has been funding campaigns to stop the enactment of such laws. Alternatively,
funders have increased funding transparency to reduce the public's level of suspicion
(which raises the issue of revealing details about the people who run the NGOs--making
them more vulnerable to attacks by the government). Lastly, funders have assisted NGOs
with public education initiatives concerning their role and legitimacy.30 However,

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

governments keep trying to cut off outside support for anti-corruption, democratic reform,
and development groups. The measures and changes in practices required to solve this
problem are likely much more nuanced and multi-faceted, especially given the growing
restrictions on civil society and resistance to the pressure of NGOs by governments in
several established democracies.31 A recent example of this pressure is when the President
of Mexico filed a diplomatic note with the US Embassy calling on the US Agency for
International Development to stop funding the NGO Mexicans Against Corruption and
Impunity.32 In reality, as long as NGOs need this external funding to have any chance of
success in sustaining their efforts long enough to win changes, many governments will
continue to try to block this funding.

2.4 Method for Sustaining NGOs Worldwide

Leading US activist Ralph Nader pioneered and developed a promising solution, albeit
politically unpopular, that can be implemented in almost all countries and lowers the costs
of both reaching the public and rallying their financial support for domestic NGOs. The
method involves having the government establish citizen-run and citizen-funded
independent NGOs by law for each government and business sector.33 Each NGO is given
the right to include a notice in the emails and mailings sent to the public by the government
institutions or businesses in each sector. The notice invites the public to join the NGO for a
nominal annual fee. Nader calls the method the "silicon chip" of citizen organizing, as it
exponentially increases the resources and power of citizens in each sector. It can be applied
in almost every government and business sector.34

For example, a government would enact a law creating an anti-corruption NGO to watch
over government ethics (political finance, lobbying, and conflict of interest), spending, and

procurement. The NGO would have the right to include a notice in the electronic
communications and mailings that the government sends to the public about taxes, social
spending supports, etc. In countries where government offices, banks, and other financial
institutions are the hub locations where the public pay their taxes and receive public
services, the NGO's notice would be distributed to each member of the public who comes to
the location. The email notice would be a line like "to join the government ethics and
spending watchdog group, click here." Mailings or handouts would contain a brief
pamphlet describing the NGO and inviting people to join for a nominal annual fee. A board
of directors elected from amongst its members would run the NGO. Strict conflict of interest
rules would render government officials or their family members, friends and associates
ineligible from board membership.35

Another example, in the business sector, would be the government creating an NGO to
watch over financial institutions and services, given their frequent connections to corrupt
practices such as money laundering. Each financial institution would be required to include
the NGO's notice at the top of each email or electronic communication or in one or two
mailings sent to customers annually. The notice would invite customers to join the financial
services watchdog group, and the NGO would have a democratic structure with a board
elected from among its members.36

The US demonstrates the potential for this method to create broad-based, well-resourced,
self-sustaining NGOs. Groups established in three states in the early 1980s to watch over
public energy and water utilities are still going strong with tens of thousands of supporters.37
Moreover, the groups have saved taxpayers tens of billions of dollars while also pushing for
and winning leading sustainable energy and water conservation measures. Three to five
percent of the public usually join the groups.38 At that rate, in Canada, where there are
approximately 30 million taxpayers and 25 million banking customers,39 a CDN$20 annual

membership fee would give a government ethics and spending NGO between 900,000 and
1.5 million members and an annual budget of CDN$18 million to CDN$30 million. A
financial services industry watchdog NGO would have between 750,000 and 1.25 million
members and an annual budget of CDN$15 million to CDN$25 million. Both organizations
would transform the policies, activities, effectiveness, and accountability in respect to
government ethics and spending.

Again, it will not be easy to convince a single government or business to create well
resourced, self-sustaining NGOs let alone all of them. However, given opposition parties
often seek policy proposals from NGOs to build support and increase their chances of
winning power, a first step towards its enactment is NGOs proposing its implementation. If
it is enacted, it will significantly change the balance of power between governments, big
businesses, and the public in a positive way that will very likely make winning other key
changes and protections more possible.

A multi-year effort is needed to win anti-corruption rules and implement strong
enforcement and high penalties. Even if an NGO develops a broad base with deep roots in
the community and becomes well-resourced and funded from domestic sources, including
from the method discussed above, true reform necessitates a multi-year effort. The following
section summarizes the main strategies and tactics that NGOs deploy in these long-term
efforts to win key changes.

3. STRATEGIES AND TACTICS

The four general citizen action strategies that NGOs undertake are:

     1. Community organization to build power through the involvement and
          empowerment of members of a community and confrontation and negotiation
          with people in power in government and business;

     2. Advocacy through research, setting out a policy agenda, public education
          initiatives, lobbying, and lawsuits;

     3. Service delivery for short-term disaster or humanitarian crisis relief and/or
          long-term initiatives based on assessments of community needs and planned
          objectives, sometimes with the aim of developing an alternative economy to
          develop the community; and

     4. Community development for planned objectives, such as building a
          community centre, park, road, or housing development.40

In the area of anti-corruption work, the first two strategies are usually deployed as changes
to laws, regulations, actions of government and big business officials, and public awareness
and attitudes are the usual goals. As categorized by A Rani Parker, NGOs that deploy these

first two strategies are usually advocacy NGOs (ANGOs) as compared to NGOs that deploy
the third and fourth strategies which are usually operating NGOs (ONGOs), while some
NGOs are hybrids whose activities span all four strategy areas (HNGOs).41

The tactics used in pursuing these strategies are wide-ranging. Gene Sharp alone
documented 198 methods of nonviolent action for social change.42 Which strategy and tactic
any NGO deploys at any one time varies based on a wide-ranging set of factors:

     1. The NGO's mission statement: Some NGOs only do one or a few related
          things. For example, a "think-tank" usually only produces research and policy
          position papers and holds conferences to discuss issues. Other NGOs deploy a
          broad array of strategies and tactics.

     2. The NGO's relationship with institutions of power: As discussed in Section 2,
          the human rights laws, and enforcement infrastructure for those laws, greatly
          affect NGOs' relationships with governments and big businesses and the
          strategies and tactics various NGOs will use to attempt to win changes.

     3. The issue and situation: Different issues, situations, and cultural forces affect
          the specific strategy and tactic that an NGO will choose at any one time.

     4. Theory of change: An NGO's theory of how social change occurs will also
          affect its choices of strategies and tactics.

While some critics and historians speculate or make definitive statements concerning why a
politician, government official, or the head of a big business changed something, whether a
law, policy, or practice, others recognize that it is extremely difficult to determine why any
change occurs.43 The difficulty is that the decision-maker may claim to make the change for
a reason that is not the real reason. Usually only a few people, the closest confidantes of the
decision-maker, will know the real reason, and the decision-maker may mislead even them.
After the fact, depending on how the change is viewed, it is not unusual to see the decision-
maker and those involved in the decision-making process take credit for the change
happening or blame the others involved. This is augmented by the fact that minutes of
decision-making meetings in governments and big businesses are usually very brief, only
listing topics discussed but not what was said, and that meetings and other communications
of the real decision-makers are often kept secret for years.44 Anyone trying to determine why

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

a change has happened is forced to rely on the unreliable rumour mill in the short term and
equally unreliable memoirs of the participants in the medium term.

Given the difficulty of determining why changes have been won in the past, it is difficult to
determine which strategies and tactics, in any jurisdiction, have been successful in the past
or may be successful in the future.45 Although some strategies are generally considered more
effective than others, comparison is difficult in the face of complex, multi-faceted, and
changing situations with multiple actors. As a result, this chapter cannot pronounce exactly
what the roles, strategies or tactics of NGOs should be most effective in any situation or anti-
corruption effort. Instead, this section summarizes some of the main strategies and tactics
used by NGOs and the results of studies which provide some insight as to their effectiveness.

Legal realism scholars, and subsequently legal pluralism and law and society scholars, have
documented the gap between the "law on the books and the law in action"46 and the effects
of various institutions, social networks (especially power and inequality relationships), and
local cultures on how law actually governs the actions of people and organizations. Their
studies have revealed that the hegemony of a legal system is not based on legal principles
and written rules alone (or, in some cases, even at all), but instead on the actions and
decisions of people who hold power of various sorts (legal, political, social, and cultural).
There people range from community leaders whose actions can establish community norms,
through to courts, regulators, and bureaucrats exercising their discretion in multiple
transactions with each other and members of the public, transactions that apply legal rules
consistently or inconsistently (or even ignore them altogether).47

The legal consciousness school of legal theory (an extension of this scholarship) proposes
that the lines law draws in society are animated, even defined, by the actions of individuals
and communities in response to the law.48 Patricia Ewick and Susan Silbey propose that
people position themselves as "conforming" (often unconsciously), "contesting" (through
advocacy) or "resisting" the law (through non-compliance or protest).49

Taking into account these general frameworks, I propose the following general criteria for
assessing the effectiveness of NGO strategies and tactics in leading or contributing to anti-
corruption changes:

     1. Did the effort begin with research on the political landscape of the jurisdiction
          concerning the key processes and actors that make legal, social, and cultural
          changes, and the network of actors who participate in and protect corrupt
          practices?;

     2. Did the NGO (or group of NGOs working in a formal or informal coalition) build a
           social movement that used multi-pronged strategies and tactics?;

     3. Was each strategy and tactic strategically chosen for systemic impact?;

     4. Are the NGO's staff professional and effective, or do they cause problems and
           hold the NGO back from success?

     5. Did the NGO build partnerships or fragment the movement?;

     6. Was the NGO adequately funded in order to allow it to sustain its efforts?;

     7. Was the effectiveness of each strategy and tactic evaluated systematically?;

     8. Did the NGO, and the social movement it fostered, coordinated, or was involved
           in, change the legal rules (including the enforcement system and penalties for
           violations) in important ways and/or hold wrongdoers accountable?;

     9. Were the NGO and the social movement effective enough to stop those in power
           from exercising their discretion to maintain the status quo by ignoring the new
           legal rules (or thwarting the enforcement system and penalties in any way)?; and

     10. Finally, overall, did the NGO and the social movement change not only the legal
           rules but also the legal and social culture enough to ensure the actions of the
           people and organizations governed by the rules actually changed?50

As the summaries of common strategies and tactics and case studies below make clear, the
final two criteria listed above are, not surprisingly, often the most difficult to achieve. Many
NGOs worldwide have built and sustained partnerships and movements that have used
multi-pronged strategies and tactics to win changes to legal rules, enforcement systems, and
penalties for the purpose of holding wrongdoers accountable. However, it is more difficult
to stop those in power from exercising their legal discretion to thwart changes to rules,
enforcement mechanisms, and penalties. In part, the case studies are cautionary tales about
how important it is to ensure that new rules are strong, clear, and restrict that discretion.
This includes restricting the discretion of enforcement entities to ensure the rules are
complied with through strong and strict enforcement. Further, winning a permanent change
to the culture of government and business institutions so that the culture actively prevents,
rather than encourages and fosters, corruption is an ultimate, very difficult change to win.
This is true not only for NGOs but also for anyone and any organization involved in anti-
corruption efforts.

Set out below are summaries of common strategies and tactics used by NGOs worldwide to
win changes in many areas, including anti-corruption. As noted in Section 2, the
government's relationship with NGOs and citizens has a significant impact on the strategies
and tactics NGOs in a jurisdiction will undertake. The summaries below begin with tactics
commonly used in jurisdictions where fundamental human rights are not recognized or
enforced and move to strategies and tactics used in jurisdictions with well-developed laws
and enforcement systems.

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

It is important to note that in undertaking anti-corruption initiatives, NGOs will not only be
subject to resistance from governments and businesses, but they can also significantly
undermine their efforts if NGOs do not establish and maintain internal procedures,
monitoring, and enforcement systems to prevent corruption within their own
organization.51

3.1 Research and Disclosure

An initial role of NGOs is to research the political landscape of the jurisdiction concerning
the key processes and actors that make legal, social, and cultural changes. This information
is essential to participating effectively in those processes, building allies, and neutralizing
those who will resist change.52

Another role of NGOs is to track the level of corruption in each jurisdiction. Sarah Chayes
argues that it is key for governments to answer a series of questions concerning the structure
and function of the "kleptocratic network" in any country before engaging with the
government of the country to ensure that members of that network are not inadvertently
supported.53 NGOs must not only gather information on key actors participating in and
sustaining corrupt practices, the structure and operations of their network, and the
network's strengths and vulnerabilities, but also the cultural environment of corruption in
the jurisdiction. This research is not an easy task. Corrupt actions are either illegal or
stigmatized in most jurisdictions. As a result, those involved usually attempt to keep their
actions secret. However, documenting the absence of anti-corruption measures in a
jurisdiction's laws (or flaws in the measures) and the absence of effective enforcement
agencies (or flaws in the enforcement policies and practices of existing agencies) is a step
towards reform. Even an evaluation that relies on incomplete information can, through
issuing a regular report, assist in raising awareness of corruption problems and the negative
effect of corruption in the country, which is one step in the long road of effectively ending
corruption.

International NGOs have played a major role in completing such evaluations of the anti-
corruption culture, rules, and enforcement systems in various jurisdictions. As described in
Chapter 1, Transparency International (TI), the world's largest anti-corruption NGO,
produces the annual Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) which, through a survey of experts
and businesses in jurisdictions around the world, attempts to measure the perceived level
of corruption in the public sector of each jurisdiction.54 The main criticism of the CPI is that
its sample of experts often does not include people on the front line of anti-corruption efforts
and that surveying business executives skew the results toward lowering the level of
perceived corruption. Executives are incentivized to rank a country as "clean" if their
business benefits from corrupt actions or weak enforcement. To its credit, in recent years
TI's CPI has highlighted cases demonstrating big businesses in "clean" countries bribing
governments of other countries55 and how governments in "clean" countries facilitate both
domestic and international corruption by failing to enact key anti-corruption measures.

TI also produces the Global Corruption Barometer (GCB) which is based on a survey of the
public's experience with, and perception of, corruption in their country.56 For example, the
2017 report, based on surveys of 162,316 people in 119 countries between 2014 and 2017,
found that one in four people had paid a bribe in order to obtain public services during the
previous year.57 However, comparing countries using the GCB is difficult because the full
survey was mainly conducted in developing countries and the questions asked were not
consistent between countries. For example, the bribery questions were not asked in Belgium,
France, Greenland, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK, and the USA due to
funding constraints.58

Some NGOs have developed other evaluation techniques to challenge the survey method of
measuring corruption. For example, Global Integrity developed an evaluation methodology
with 15 categories and more than 300 criteria for measuring the effectiveness of rules and
enforcement systems for ensuring government integrity in any jurisdiction. Global Integrity
evaluated more than 30 countries in 2010 and more than 100 countries from 2006 to 2010. An
expert researcher in each jurisdiction completed a peer-reviewed Integrity Scorecard and a
media representative produced a summary report of news and developments during that
year.59 The initiative ended in 2013, in part due to lack of funding and the difficulties of
maintaining consistency in evaluation standards and assessments across countries whose

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

political and legal systems vary greatly. However, the criteria still provide a fairly
comprehensive basis for evaluating the state of anti-corruption measures in any jurisdiction.
Since 2012, Global Integrity has continued using the same methodology in Africa through
the Africa Integrity Indicators project.60 Global Integrity also maintains the Anti-Corruption
Evidence Research Programme that gathers evidence for developing and implementing
effective anti-corruption initiatives.61

A different corruption related measure involves assessing the strength of the rule of law in
each country. For NGOs in many countries, anti-corruption efforts focus mainly on
establishing a rule of law system that will investigate, prosecute, and penalize corrupt acts
and give citizens and organizations the right to file complaints calling for investigations.
This reality is reflected in the World Justice Project's Rule of Law Index62 which is based on
several criteria, including constraints on government powers and the absence of
corruption.63

However, these international indices are only a starting point for a domestic NGO's anti-
corruption methods. As Chayes proposes, the research challenge continues with compiling
evidence of corruption, including tracking the assets and liabilities of politicians, political
staff, and government officials, to determine who may be living beyond the means of their
salaries due to acceptance of bribes, kickbacks, etc.

3.2 Public Education

In addition to their country-level and, in some cases, sub-national jurisdiction, monitoring,
measuring, and surveying activities, some international NGOs also provide support to
domestic NGOs' anti-corruption efforts through providing guidance and direct training in
these research efforts. For example, TI has several free online anti-corruption toolkits that
NGOs in any jurisdiction can use to research, reveal, and combat corruption. The National
Democratic Institute and the UN also have toolkits.64

Beyond this international "train the trainer" educational efforts aimed at other NGOs, some
NGOs like the UN, move beyond research and disclosure to undertaking formal education
campaigns. When UNCAC was adopted in 2003, the UN General Assembly designated
December 9th as the annual International Anti-Corruption Day.65 It also makes public
education materials available in several languages for use by NGOs, including posters and
social media graphics, and videos that local TV stations can broadcast.66

As set out in Article 13(1)(c)of UNCAC, governments are required to undertake "public
information activities that contribute to nontolerance of corruption, as well as public
education programmes, including school and university curricula."67 While the US
government has a public education program called the International Anticorruption
Champions Award to recognize anti-corruption leaders and innovators around the world,
it does not have a program to recognize and award anti-corruption champions in the US.68
The US government's self-assessment for its 2018 review by the UNODC of its compliance
with UNCAC requirements lists no activities under Article 13(1)(c).69

Though the UK developed an anti-corruption strategy after consultation with anti-
corruption NGOs, it also does not have a public education program to raise awareness of
corruption and to educate the public about how to file complaints.70 Canada has not yet been
reviewed by UNODC concerning its compliance with Article 13(1)(c) and other articles in
Chapter II of the UNCAC. Canada does not currently have such a public education program.
Chapter II is scheduled to be reviewed in 2021.71

Many governments educate their public about corruption in other countries but not in their
own. NGOs in many countries fill this gap by raising awareness of incidences of corruption
and how to file complaints by issuing reports and news releases, conducting surveys,
holding events, maintaining websites, and posting on social media sites.72 Media outlets not

only amplify the voices of NGOs but also conduct investigations, publish articles, and air
broadcasts revealing what they find, as well as provide whistleblowers with an outlet for
reporting wrongdoing, including corrupt activities.

As attacks on NGOs and other civil society organizations have escalated in the past decade,
they have also been essentially forced to respond with public education concerning the
legitimacy of their role in society. This has been a difficult challenge for high-level NGOs
that are mainly funded through aid grants from other countries. This highlights the
importance of having broad-based NGOs that represent the public and advocate their
concerns as a key component of any effort aimed at winning anti-corruption and other
democracy reforms.73

3.3 Advocacy for Stronger Rules, Enforcement, and Penalties

The research and disclosure and public education efforts of NGOs are often the initial steps
in an overall strategy of advocating for key changes to enact and implement stronger rules,
enforcements, and penalties to stop corruption. Research in several countries has shown that
the policy proposals developed by NGO think-tanks and advocacy groups often seed the
policy and election platforms of political parties that are looking to seize opportunity when
an opening presents itself, due to a crisis, scandal, or other reason, to either adapt as a
governing party in order to maintain power or to move from being an opposition party to
being the governing party.74 If NGOs are connected to a broad base or sector of the public,
they often seed not only the policies and platforms of opposition parties, but also the parties'
support base itself.75

The following are brief summaries of the main advocacy tactics used by NGOs.

                 Protests and Demonstrations

Protests and demonstrations can be an initial reaction to the disclosure of corruption in a
political system. Protests and demonstrations are often aimed at winning a short-term
concession or promise of reform from a government or business. They are sometimes, but
often not, successful. However, they can also be much more. A 2005 study found that over
the previous 33 years, nonviolent people-powered civic resistance (boycotts, mass protests,
blockades, strikes, and civil disobedience) was one of the most effective tactics for winning
a transition from a dictatorial, corrupt government to a more democratic good government,
as long as the civic resistance includes strong and cohesive nonviolent coalitions of NGOs

and other civil society actors (including political parties).76 Another study of the period 2013
to 2018 found that 10% of the world's countries had experienced government leadership
change due to corruption, but that broad-based NGOs connected to grassroots NGOs were
a key driver of the transition, again, through nonviolent civic resistance.77

As other studies have shown, national NGOs that are more technocratic and legal-based are
needed to translate popular demands into policy proposals for changes, but grassroots
NGOs are still vital. National NGOs may not pursue changes that will resonate with most
people nor have the political power needed to push a new government or ruling party to
adopt and implement the proposals, even in the face of resistance by the country's power
elite.78 Since national NGOs lack access to the public, they need the assistance of grassroots
NGOs that are involved in developing policy proposals and mobilizing people to push for
changes. These ingredients of successful systemic change have been seen in various areas of
reform, including for advancing essential rule of law measures.79

      3.3.2 International Appeals

This tactic is included despite the fact that international appeals and court cases can take a
significant amount of financial resources. However, while NGOs in developing countries
may lack the resources themselves to undertake this tactic, NGOs in jurisdictions with well-
developed human rights laws and enforcement systems and significant resources can help
attract international attention and put international pressure on their government to
implement anti-corruption measures. Such international appeals, and resulting media
coverage, can often be an early and effective first step towards reforms.

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

NGOs in jurisdictions with well-developed laws and enforcement can, and should, always
play a role in supporting NGOs in jurisdictions where fundamental human rights are not
recognized or enforced. Actions such as signing on to a letter calling for action from the UN,
OECD, World Bank or a regional inter-state body or informing media outlets of abuses are
relatively easy, low-cost actions that can assist by putting a spotlight on corruption in
developing countries.

As well, an extension of the research and disclosure tactic outlined above that involves
partnering of domestic and international NGOs is a joint effort to track bank accounts and
other assets in other countries that have been established or bought by government officials
from the proceeds of corruption. These efforts can help with the push for governments to
impose Magnitsky Act sanctions to freeze and seize those assets in the US, UK, Canada, and
other countries.80

However, as summarized in Section 2, the involvement of international NGOs in any
jurisdiction, actively or by supporting domestic NGOs, can easily be controversial because
it raises the question of whether the citizens of the jurisdiction actually support the activities
and aims of the NGOs involved. As well, while shining a spotlight on corrupt actions in any
country can lead to international pressure on the country's government, the pressure that
may lead to a change in government, usually domestic pressure of NGOs, opposition parties,
and citizens, must also continue over the long-term to result in the implementation and
enforcement of effective anti-corruption measures.

      3.3.3 Coalition Building

NGOs working in coalition, coherently and strongly advocating together, has proven to be
an effective tactic for winning key democratic reforms, including anti-corruption reforms. A
network involves several groups that all work on the same issue or problem. Groups in a
network usually meet with each other, or communicate with each other, regularly. However,
groups in a network do not usually work together on strategies, approaches, tactics, or
activities. In other words, the groups share a concern about an issue or problem but work
independently to try to solve the issue or problem.

While working as a network allows each group to work independently without agreement
from the other groups, uncoordinated activities can conflict with each other and make it
appear to a government or corporation that there is not broad support for proposed
solutions. Unlike a network, a coalition of groups works together on strategies, approaches,

tactics, or activities. The difficulty of coalitions is reaching agreement. This means that
networks are more common than coalitions. However, by working together, coalitions are
often more effective than networks because they clearly show broad support for proposed
solutions.81

      3.3.4 Lobbying and Campaigns

NGOs that can mobilize the public, through research and disclosure, public education, and
possibly international appeals, as well as build strong, unified coalitions, still have the
challenge of transferring all of that power into a long-term campaign and lobbying effort for
the key systemic changes that will stop corruption or other societal problems the NGOs are
tackling. Many of these efforts are ongoing strategies and tactics to overcome seven barriers
to social change, the "D" barriers:82

      The first is the density of government. Political landscape research effort can
          help overcome density to government by determining key actors and decision-
          makers and what processes governments use for making decisions.

      The second is that governments will often deny that there is a problem to be
          solved. Extensive research documenting and disclosing the problem is needed
          to overcome this barrier.

      The third is that governments will often delay changes, which is why it is a good
          idea for any campaign plan to take into account that key systemic changes often
          take five to ten years to be won, if not longer.

      The fourth is discredit, which occurs when governments begin to actively resist
          pressure for change as a movement gains strength. This can take the form of
          alleging that movement leaders are engaging in questionable activities and
          attempting to label NGOs as front groups for opposition political parties or
          foreign governments.

      The fifth is divide, which usually tests whether the coalitions that the NGOs
          have built are cohesive and strong. Often governments will seek to make a deal
          with one or more of the partner NGOs in a coalition, usually the groups that
          make the weakest demands, giving them some or most of what they want in
          exchange for applauding the government's actions, thereby undermining the
          coalition's more significant demands for systemic changes.

      The sixth is deceive, which is usually implemented by governments that are
          trying to spin small changes to be perceived as more significant changes that
          NGOs are seeking. In a country such as Canada, where only a small fraction of
          eligible voters read newspaper articles daily and the majority of readers only
          skim articles or scan headlines, if governments can win favourable headlines

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

          that set out such a spin, then they may deceive the public into believing that
          they have fully implemented the demanded changes.83

      The final "D" for NGOs to overcome in any campaign and lobbying effort for
          systemic changes is destroy. While this response by governments has not been
          frequently used in recent years in developed democracies such as the United
          States, the UK, and Canada, it has certainly been used, and continues to be used,
          to stop campaigns by NGOs representing visible minorities, Indigenous
          peoples, and other vulnerable sectors of society. It is also used by many
          autocratic, authoritarian governments worldwide through jailings, poisonings,
          and assassinations of leaders of NGOs, media outlets, and other civil society
          sectors who dare to challenge politicians' illegal and corrupt actions.

Overall, whether an NGO's lobbying and campaign efforts involve setting out policy
proposals,84 organizing a demonstration85 or boycott,86 holding events, undertaking public
education initiatives, writing letters,87 and holding lobby meetings with politicians and
government officials,88 they will almost always be met with resistance from at least some
institutions in any government. By campaigning over the long-term in multi-faceted ways,
building allies and coalitions, and addressing and neutralizing opposing arguments or
arguments to maintain the status quo along the way, sometimes all the barriers can be

estimate that of the approximately 27 million eligible voters, roughly one million read full newspaper

overcome and the systemic changes won to stop corruption or other undemocratic,
unaccountable government actions.

      3.3.5 Public Interest Litigation

Another NGO strategy is public interest litigation (PIL). The debate concerning the
effectiveness of PIL for winning social change is as long as the history of the use of the courts
for this purpose. In recent decades, some commentators, such as Gerald Rosenberg, have
concluded that the courts offer a "hollow hope" (at least for movements seeking change in
the US, where it took governments 20 years to desegregate schools after the US Supreme
Court ruled segregation in education unconstitutional).89 Other commentators argue that
PIL can help mobilize a movement and legitimize its claims or the personal claims of its
members and that strategic "impact" cases can destabilize institutions, increase
accountability, raise awareness, change public opinion, and threaten institutions with legal
costs.90

Scott Cummings and Deborah Rhode argue history shows that to be effective PIL must be:

      one part of a multi-pronged social change effort;

      adequately funded to ensure comprehensive litigation efforts are possible
          (especially in ensuring enforcement of court orders); and

      evaluated systematically and continuously to ensure strategic litigation decisions
          and efforts over the long-term.91

Orly Lobel posits that, when pursuing either legal reform or extralegal activism aimed at
transformative changes, one should be concerned about and monitor the possibility of
"cooptation" that can essentially neutralize efforts aimed at winning changes.92 Lobel's
review of the literature leads to conclude that the following six key causes of co-optation can
undermine PIL:

GLOBAL CORRUPTION

     1. Lack of the resources and energy needed to win the changes fully (echoing the
          concern of Cummings and Rhode);

     2. That filing one specific case in specific legal forums like courts can undermine
          comprehensive calls for change, and as a result fragment a social movement;

     3. That lawyers handling the PIL can control the agenda of the movement, not
          always in the movement's best interests;

     4. That the effects of court rulings are inherently limited because they do not enforce
          themselves, nor necessarily change public opinion or actions;

     5. That becoming involved in PIL, and the legal system generally, can undermine
          other social change tactics (in part because of the resources required for PIL); and

     6. That existing social arrangements can use legal rules set out in statutes,
          regulations, or court rulings (if a PIL case is lost), and also social and cultural
          norms, to resist, restrict, or reject change efforts.

No matter what, Lobel argues, political and market powers are always forces that can
undermine efforts to win changes.93

Another form of litigation involves NGOs in any jurisdiction, alone or in partnership with
international NGOs, filing or intervening in court cases aimed at freezing or seizing the
accounts and assets of government officials that are the proceeds of corruption. For further
discussion of freezing and seizing illegal assets see Chapter 5.

4. A CANADIAN STUDY: LONG-TERM RESISTANCE TO NGO
      ANTI-CORRUPTION PROPOSALS IN A SUPPOSED MATURE
      DEMOCRACY

Case studies of NGOs involved in anti-corruption efforts are readily available in many
online publications.94 This section focuses on one Canadian case study, specifically the
experiences of the Canadian NGO, Democracy Watch's advocacy for long-delayed federal
lobbying reform. As has been highlighted in the previous sections, this case study shows
that the struggle for anti-corruption reforms is almost always a multi-year effort, involving
many strategies and tactics, with many hurdles to overcome for the NGOs involved. This
case study demonstrates the multi-faceted resistance to NGO anti-corruption proposals that
is deeply rooted in a tradition of lobbyists and politicians trading favours even in a
jurisdiction like Canada that is often ranked as a mature, developed, and leading democracy.
This case study also shows how the struggle by NGOs for reforms can be resisted by the

power elite in several ways, including implementing measures that create a gloss of reform
while unethical practices continue largely unabated.

From 1994 to 2011, Democracy Watch, in partnership with other organizations, advocated
for federal restrictions on lobbyists supporting the politicians they are lobbying, through
political donations, fundraising, and other means. The case study documents the multi-year,
multi-pronged, active resistance by several actors in Canada's federal political system
following the enactment of those restrictions in 1997. This resistance effectively delayed the
enforcement of the restrictions until 2011, and after 2011 limited enforcement to only a small
percentage of cases.

The only legal restrictions on lobbyists at the federal government level in Canada before
1988 were provisions prohibiting the fundamentally illicit influence actions of bribery,
influence peddling, and extortion. These provisions were first enacted by the federal
Parliament in 1883 and incorporated into the Criminal Code of Canada when it was first
enacted in 1892.95 Very few people were charged with crimes, let alone convicted, in part
because donations were not considered bribes unless they could be directly connected to a
government decision (a difficult evidentiary hurdle).96

More than 20 private member bills (bills introduced by individual Members of Canada's
Parliament who are not a government Minister) aimed at regulating lobbyists were
introduced in Parliament between 1965 and 1985, mainly in response to scandals, but none
became law.97 Still, even though it took until 1988, Canada became one of the first countries
in the world to regulate lobbying in non-criminal ways when Parliament enacted the
Lobbyists Registration Act (LRA) that year (although the law came long after the laws in the
US (1946) and Germany (1951), and just behind Australia (1983)).98 The coming into force of
the LRA in 1989 began the slow process of lobbying disclosure. The first version of lobbying
disclosure was called the "business-card law" because it only required lobbyists to register
their name, work address, the subject matter(s) of their lobbying, and the government
institutions they lobbied. Four years later, the registry was still only available in print form

for review during office hours at the Office of the Registrar General in Hull, Quebec. As a
result, few reporters, and almost no members of the public, made the effort to look at the
registry.

Democracy Watch was not involved in the first round of legal restrictions on federal
lobbyists in Canada because the non-profit advocacy organization was not established until
September 1993. There is no evidence of a social movement (other than general concern by
the public and proposals by opposition political parties and their MPs) advocating for
restrictions on lobbyists before 1993 or involved in the enactment of the LRA.99 Leading up
to the 1993 federal election, the Liberal Party of Canada began to highlight the issue of
political ethics. The former Liberal leader Jean Chrétien gave a speech listing promises of
change that resulted in a chapter entitled "Governing with Integrity" in the Liberal's
campaign platform. Democracy Watch's first action was the release of a report card on the
main federal parties' election platforms, including their proposals to reform the political
finance system, to "restrict and require full disclosure of the activities of lobbyists," and to
"increase ethical standards in government."100

After the Liberals won a majority of seats in the House of Commons in November 1993, they
began the process of implementing their government integrity election promises. Through
1994, Democracy Watch issued news releases and reports on the issues and received
extensive media coverage.101 This set the basis for its campaign aimed at winning changes in
three areas: restrictions on third-party advertising spending, restrictions and disclosure of
donations, and restrictions on influence actions by lobbyists.

In their election platform, the Liberals had promised to "put an end to backroom deals" and
bring lobbyists "from the shadows out into the open."102 On June 14, 1994, the government
introduced Bill C-43, which proposed to amend the LRA essentially by requiring more
detailed disclosure of lobbying activities, including the specific bill, regulation, contract, etc.,

organizations that testified before the Committee, only Democracy Watch called for
requirements to ensure disclosure of all lobbying and the amounts spent on each lobbying
effort (including creating an electronic registry so people across Canada could easily see
lobbying details) and to restrict political donations and other activities by lobbyists. At the
time, the general position of citizen organizations was that they were "public interest"
groups with publicly known mandates and, therefore, should not be required to disclose
their lobbying. As a result, while Democracy Watch's proposals were reviewed and
responded to in the sub-committee's report, none were implemented. Only paid lobbyists,
and business lobbyists who lobbied more than 20% of their work time, were required to
register. Lobbying concerning the enforcement of a law did not have to be registered. As
well, the Liberal government added a new loophole to the LRA: a lobbyist no longer had to
register if they were invited by the public office holder to lobby them.104

The Liberals had also promised a new Ethics Counsellor position as a watchdog who "has
the teeth to investigate and take strong action."105 Instead, the Ethics Counsellor, Howard
Wilson, chosen by the Prime Minister, had no security of tenure, no independent decision-
making power, no investigative powers, and no power to penalize violators of ethics rules.106

As often happens, the media's interest in the issue decreased after the Liberals implemented
these changes, as many assumed that the key problems had been solved. From 1995 to 1998,
Democracy Watch continued to point out problems and issue regular report cards on the
government's record, but received scant media coverage.107 Funding received from
foundations also caused Democracy Watch to focus its resources and efforts on the issue of
bank accountability through these years.

The one positive development during this time was the establishment of the Lobbyists' Code
of Conduct (Lobbyists' Code) in March 1997, which included honesty, ethical, and
professionalism requirements on federal registered lobbyists. For more detail on lobbying
see Chapter 11.

In 1999, as the media reported that the Liberals were preparing some changes to political
finance rules, Democracy Watch began to focus on the issue again. It released a report setting

out comprehensive recommendations for changes in June 1999, organized a broad Money in
Politics Coalition of citizen groups supporting those recommendations, and organized a
separate Government Ethics Coalition to push for restrictions on lobbyists.108 The Liberal
government introduced Bill C-2 in June, which, among other mostly minor changes
requiring more disclosure of donations, limited third-party advertising spending during the
statutory election campaign period to CDN$150,000 nationally and CDN$3,000 in each
riding.109 Despite the efforts of the coalitions to win changes to Bill C-2 by labelling it "more
loophole than law," it came into force without changes in June 2000.

Democracy Watch continued to build its campaign and coalitions. Public attention to Liberal
fundraising scandals and the loopholes left by Bill C-2 caused the Liberals to introduce Bill
C-9 in 2001, which required riding associations to disclose the identity of their donors (before
only parties were required to disclose donors).110 Democracy Watch continued to issue news
releases and reports for the next few years.111

Democracy Watch explicitly questioned the ethics of large donations and fundraising by
lobbyists through filing several ethics complaints from 2000 to 2004. This marked the
beginning of Democracy Watch's decade-long attempt to require the Ethics Counsellor to
enforce the Lobbyists' Code. First, Democracy Watch filed 12 complaints from April 2000 to
October 2002 with Ethics Counsellor Wilson about lobbyists violating the Lobbyists' Code.
Then, in December 2002, Democracy Watch applied to the Federal Court of Canada for a
review of the Ethics Counsellor's structural bias (because the Counsellor was controlled by
the Prime Minister) and the delay in ruling on eight of the 12 complaints.112

In response to Democracy Watch's December 2002 court application, Ethics Counsellor
Wilson, in January 2003, issued an interpretation bulletin of a key rule in the Lobbyists' Code
that essentially said that lobbying was only unethical if a lobbyist forced a politician to make

a decision by extorting them. The Ethics Counsellor then used this interpretation to rule on
several of Democracy Watch's complaints.113 In April and May 2003, Democracy Watch
responded by filing for judicial review of the Ethics Counsellor's structural bias and rulings.
In January 2004, the federal Liberal government introduced Bill C-4, which proposed to
replace the Ethics Counsellor with a more independent Registrar of Lobbyists and Ethics
Commissioner.114 The government tried to stop Democracy Watch's court case on the basis
that the Ethics Counsellor position no longer existed, but the court not only rejected that
motion, but ruled in July 2004 that the Ethics Counsellor was "structurally biased,"
"specifically biased" against Democracy Watch, and that its complaints had to be re-ruled
on by the new Registrar.115

In early 2003, public attention to various fundraising and unethical lobbying scandals
prompted the Liberal government to introduce Bill C-24. Democracy Watch and its coalition
responded with a concerted push to finally win changes that would limit donations to a level
that would inhibit lobbyists from influencing politicians.116 Its intervention in the review of
the bill led the House Committee to make an amendment lowering the individual donation
limit from CDN$10,000 annually to CDN$5,000 as of January 1, 2004.117 The bill also
implemented Democracy Watch and the coalition's recommendations to restrict donations
by corporate, union, and other organizations to CDN$1,000 annually; to require quarterly
disclosure of donations to parties; and to require disclosure of donations to party leadership
race candidates (the Liberals had already imposed this on candidates in their 2003 leadership
race).118

Through this 2000 to 2004 period, Democracy Watch continued to advocate for closing the
loopholes in the LRA that allowed for secret lobbying or obscured key details about lobbying
activities. Scandals and public concern led to the government introducing Bill C-15 in fall
2002. The Bill closed the loophole in the LRA that Bill C-43 had created in 1995 allowing
lobbyists not to register if a public office holder invited the lobbyist to lobby them. It also
expanded the definition of lobbying so that more people communicating with public office
holders about their decisions would be required to register.119 Another win in 2005 was the

creation of a new House of Commons Committee, called the Standing Committee on Access,
Privacy and Ethics, which focused on the key accountability issues.120

Responding to ongoing scandals in November 2005, the Conservative Party of Canada, now
led by Stephen Harper, promised a Federal Accountability Act (FAA) that included further
restrictions on donations. When the Conservatives won the January 2006 election, they
introduced some of their promised FAA measures in Bill C-2. The bill banned corporate and
union donations; lowered the annual individual donation limit to CDN$1,000; changed the
LRA into the Lobbying Act; established a new five-year prohibition on individuals registering
as lobbyist after leaving public office (although a weak prohibition given that loopholes
allow for lobbying without having to be a registered lobbyist); increased penalties; and
increased the limitation period for prosecutions for violations.121

Democracy Watch won these changes due to the efforts of its coalitions and the unexpected
developments related to scandals and competition between parties. Further, all these efforts
ran parallel to Democracy Watch's coordinated campaign and the PIL strategy that
mobilized to restrict the other schemes designed by lobbyists to have undue influence over
politicians.

After being taken to court by Democracy Watch, the new Registrar Michael Nelson (a
position that the FAA was changing into a Commissioner of Lobbying) finally issued a ruling
in October 2006 on one of Democracy Watch's original eight complaints about unethical
lobbying. The complaint was filed in April 2000 against lobbyist Barry Campbell (a former
Liberal MP) lobbying the federal Liberal government's Minister of State (Financial
Institutions) Jim Peterson (brother of former Ontario Premier David Peterson) while
organizing an event that raised CDN$70,000 for Jim Peterson.122 Democracy Watch filed yet
another judicial review application challenging the Registrar's ruling because it used the
same interpretation used by Ethics Counsellor Wilson and found that Campbell had not
violated any Lobbyists' Code rule.123

In January 2007, Peterson and Campbell filed a libel lawsuit against Democracy Watch
concerning a new release it had issued about the application for judicial review.124 This was
a typical use of "Strategic Litigation Against Public Participation" lawsuit, a SLAPP suit as
they are known.125 The lawyer for Peterson and Campbell offered to withdraw the lawsuit

if Democracy Watch would withdraw its case challenging the Registrar's ruling. Democracy
Watch refused. Peterson and Campbell did not withdraw the libel lawsuit for the following
two years until the judicial review case was over.

Finally, on January 28, 2008, the case was heard in Federal Court in Toronto,126 and on
February 19 the court issued a ruling finding that the Registrar's ruling was reasonable.
Democracy Watch appealed that ruling to the Federal Court of Appeal.127 In the summer of
2008, Campbell filed a motion for security for costs, a motion usually filed when a defendant
in a case believes they will win the case, but does not believe that the plaintiff will be able to
pay a cost award. Democracy Watch tried to settle the motion, but Campbell's lawyer only
offered instead to drop the motion if Democracy Watch would drop its appeal. Democracy
Watch again refused, and soon after Federal Court of Appeal Justice Allen Linden, who
historically was deeply involved in the Liberal Party of Canada,128 issued an order giving
Democracy Watch 30 days to pay CDN$10,000 into court or forfeit the case.129 Democracy
Watch's board decided to pay the amount rather than delay the case further by appealing
the ruling.

There were no further attempts to stop the case. The Federal Court of Appeal heard the case
in January 2009.130 It ruled on March 12, 2009, that the Ethics Counsellor's and Registrar of
Lobbyists' interpretation was "deeply flawed"131 because it "mistakes conflict of interest for
corruption"132 and that the Lobbyists' Code rule clearly "prohibits lobbyists from placing
public office holders in a conflict of interest" because "[a]ny conflict of interest impairs
public confidence in government decision-making."133

While Democracy Watch finally won this case, it took until 2011 for the Commissioner of
Lobbying to rule on all eight of the complaints Democracy Watch had filed from 2000 to
2002.134 The Commissioner ruled that all of the lobbyists involved were "innocent" because

they had been operating under the old Ethics Counsellor's interpretation of Rule 8 and could
not retroactively be found guilty, and also because too much time had passed.

In September 2009, Democracy Watch filed a new complaint about a lobbyist assisting a
cabinet minister with a fundraising event while lobbying the minister. In February 2011, the
Commissioner of Lobbying (now Karen Shepherd) ruled on the complaint, finding the
lobbyist, and another lobbyist who had also assisted with the event, guilty of violating the
Lobbyists' Code.135 These were the first lobbyists found guilty of violating the Code since it
was enacted fourteen years earlier, in March 1997.

However, the ongoing loopholes in the Lobbying Act that excluded numerous lobbying
activities and weak enforcement by the Commissioner and Canada's national police force
(the RCMP), essentially made the Code meaningless. The chances of getting caught, let alone
penalized, for failing to register were still slim.

From 1990 to 2005, the Ethics Counsellor only published two reports concerning a lobbyist
failing to register lobbying as required by the LRA.136 Between the 2004-2005 and 2008-2009
fiscal years Registrar of Lobbyists Michael Nelson (and then Commissioner of Lobbying
Shepherd) along with RCMP and Crown prosecutors, decided not to prosecute 135 of the
136 lobbyists who were caught violating the LRA.137 No one was prosecuted for violating the
federal lobbying law from 1988 to the end of the 2009 fiscal year.

Along with ongoing weak enforcement, as of 2009, federal Canadian laws and codes still
allowed:

     1. donations that an average voter could not afford;
     2. spending on election ads at a level that an average voter could not afford;
     3. secret lobbying;

     4. lobbying the day after a public office holder leaves office; and
     5. politicians to accept the gift/favour of fundraising assistance from a lobbyist (as

          long as the lobbyist exploits one of the loopholes in Canada's lobbying law that
          allows lobbying without registering under the law).

As the OECD and other international organizations have articulated, the key to restricting
undemocratic and unethical influence by lobbyists is to prevent illicit actions through
establishing a "culture" of transparency, integrity, and compliance.138 The ongoing
loopholes in federal Canadian laws and codes and weak enforcement and penalties, point
to a conclusion that the changes to rules won by Democracy Watch and its coalitions,
combined with ongoing public expectations, were not enough to change the legal culture,
let alone the social culture, of unethical favour-trading in Canada's capital.

Though legal rules were changed in important ways, the federal government bureaucracy
(most specifically the Registrar of Lobbyists and Commissioner of Lobbyists) resisted
enforcing legal changes and delayed rulings for 14 years. This allowed wrongdoers to escape
accountability and a status quo of non-enforcement to persist through to 2009.

The overall lesson from the experience of Democracy Watch and the social movement it led
from 1994 to 2011 is that even if an NGO does nearly everything right in the short-term to
win anti-corruption changes to legal rules, it may not be enough. It will almost always still
face a long-term struggle to change the legal and social culture in ways that will entrench
the legal rules, make them effective, and, finally, close the gap between what is legal and
what is ethical in government and business.

5. CONCLUSION

NGOs play multiple critical roles in combatting corruption: researching and disclosing
loopholes and flaws in rules and enforcement, raising public awareness, organizing protests,
building coalitions for change, lobbying and campaigning, and filing petitions with
enforcement agencies, tribunals, and courts. NGOs face many challenges in their anti-
corruption work: from building a strong and broad base of public support; to partnering
with other organizations without compromising too much; to obtaining the resources for the
multi-faceted activities needed to win reforms; to ensuring they are proposing effective
reforms; to trying to maintain their independence, internal integrity, and legitimacy.

The record in many countries shows that, in part because of these many challenges, few
NGOs are strong enough on their own or in coalition to win effective anti-corruption
changes, even if they have the capacity to undertake long-term campaigns. As corruption is
a collective action problem,139 collective action by many sectors is needed to overcome the

barriers and create a culture of ethical government and business in any jurisdiction. NGOs
lead the way in many parts of this collective action, organizing and activating the grassroots,
brokering and negotiating the building of coalitions and partnerships to pressure the power
elite, and connecting the public's concerns with strategic advocacy in government policy-
making processes.

As they are not seeking power or the perks of power like opposition political parties are,
NGOs create continued pressure for effective anti-corruption measures through changes in
government over the long-term. While opposition parties may undertake research and play
"gotcha" politics, exposing corrupt activities of government officials and then promise
changes to try to win elections, the record in many countries shows this approach to be
ineffective on its own. When those parties win power, or a share of power, the ongoing
pressure from NGOs and other sectors of civil society is essential to ensuring those election
promises are kept.

In these ways, NGOs provide the force behind historical changes across jurisdictions. They
provide the fuel, the oxygen, the spark, and the engine to activate the public and push
government to combat corruption and address other problems in society.
