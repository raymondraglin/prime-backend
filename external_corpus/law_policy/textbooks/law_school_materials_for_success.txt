Preface

Dear Law Student,

The first year of law school is, for many people, one of the most
significant transitions of their adult life. Law school demands a lot as
it helps you make the transition from your prior identity as student
(or as some other occupational role) to your new identity as an
attorney. To meet the demands of law school, it is often helpful to
have the big picture before you begin - a sense of what it is you are
trying to do as you prepare for classes, participate in those classes,
review and prepare for exams, take exams, and then begin the cycle
once again.

Law School Materials for Success is designed to give you the
essentials of that process. It is purposefully brief - most law students
do not have the time for an extensive examination of the study of law
school. Rather, they need a source for some basic, critical advice and
some pointers on where to go for more if necessary. That is what this
book and the accompanying podcasts are designed to provide.

Each chapter of the book focuses on a different aspect of law school
learning. I have observed that many students who have not
performed as well as they would like in law school are missing some
key academic rung on the ladder of academic skills. For example, they
are preparing for and participating in class very well, but they haven't
learned how to effectively translate that learning into the review
necessary to perform well on exams. Or they do quite well in all the
stages of law school learning up to the crucial exams - where they are
missing some fundamental skill or understanding of what is being
asked of them. By working through each of these chapters and
comparing your approach to law school learning to the suggestions
presented here, you can master law school learning and achieve
success.

I hope that you find these materials helpful as an overview of law
school method before you begin your first year, or as a refresher
resource you can consult quickly and easily as you proceed through

                                      viii
law school. I am always interested in your ideas and feedback. My
email is glesnerb@umkc.edu.
Peace,

Chapter One: Assessing

your Resources

To succeed in law school, you must use all of your resources:
physical, psychological, emotional, social, financial, and educational.
Planning for law school requires a careful assessment of your
available resources and plans to use those resources most efficiently.
This chapter is designed to assist you in that planning. This chapter
covers four basic topics: Resource Priorities, Survival Resources,
Time Management, and The Non-cognitive Resources: Self-
knowledge and Self-esteem.

Resource Priorities
Some resources are more critical than others to success in law school.
One way of assessing the importance of a resource is by reference to
psychological theory. Listed below are five categories of need
identified by Abraham Maslow.1 Often, students who are dismissed
for academic deficiency reveal that they were unable to study well
because they lacked sufficient resources for the necessities of life.
Consider this need hierarchy and look for potential problems you
may face in law school

                        Maslow's Need Hierarchy

    I. Physiological Needs - Food, Water, Sex, Sleep, Rest, and
         Exercise

    II. Safety Needs - Shelter, Protection from immediate or future
         physical harm, and Protection from immediate or future
         threat to physical, psychological or economic well-being

    III. Social needs - Love and affection, Friendship, Association
         with others, Affiliation

    IV. Self-esteem needs - Self-confidence, Independence,
         Achievement, Competence, Knowledge, Status, Personal
         recognition, Respect, Influence with others

                                        1
    V. Self-actualization needs - Realization of one's own
         potential, Self-development activities, Creative behavior,
         Problem-centered orientation toward life, Identification with
         the problems of humanity, Acceptance of self and others

The Survival Resources

As the need hierarchy demonstrates, if one is to attend to the higher-
level need to realize one's own potential, the basic resources of
survival must not be threatened. Think about your timing as you
begin law school. I believe that a major reason many students do not
succeed in law school is that they started at the wrong time: Don't
start law school on the same day you are also beginning major
medical treatment, a divorce, or have just had a new baby. Don't start
law school without a decent plan for financial support. Do not -
unless you are in a part-time program - try to "work your way
through law school." There is little room for a second chance in law
school. Even if you do manage to get through in these extraordinary
circumstances, your education will not be the fulfilling, exciting, and
truly successful experience it could be if you would just wait one
more year and sort out your problems first.

Financial pressures, in particular, can play a critical role in law school
success. As you are painfully aware, law school is extraordinarily
expensive and many students arrive at law school with large debt
burdens from prior education. These financial pressures can interfere
with the ability to succeed in law school - diverting needed time and
energies. Some students do not plan sufficiently to avoid financial
emergencies. Every student needs to prepare a budget for their law
school year. (If you have never prepared a budget, you may benefit
from the resources available at a non-profit credit counseling service.)

If your budget reflects financial threats, identify sources of additional
assistance. One source of assistance some students look to is part-
time employment. However, unless you are in a part-time law
program, you should not be working during your first semester of
law school. Not only is this a violation of law school rules and
American Bar Association accreditation standards, it is a short-

                                        2
sighted solution. Why threaten your long-term learning and earning
by working during the first semester of law school?

Even if they do not interfere with your ability to succeed in law
school, financial issues can pose a threat to your bar admission as
well. If you have current debt problems, beware of simply ignoring
obligations while in law school. As part of the bar admission process,
you will need to disclose your debts and the bar examiners will
investigate your credit record. Large, unmanaged debt is a red flag on
bar applications. Address your debt problems before you come to law
school and do not ignore debt issues while in law school.

For assistance, you may wish to work with your local consumer credit
counseling service. The CCCS is a non-profit agency that counsels
people on debt managements, budgeting, and other principles of
personal finance. You can find your local member agency at the
website of the National Foundation for Credit Counseling, where you
can also find useful financial education resources.

Health and personal resources are the second set of resources you
need to address before coming to law school. Few of us are in the
kind of physical shape that we would like to be -- imagine the results
of a diet consisting heavily of coffees, donuts and Wednesday pizza,
and a workout program that consists entirely of carrying 100 pounds
of law books from locker to library. (It's not pretty.) The stress of law
school causes many students to neglect their health. However, saving
time by neglecting meals, rest, and exercise will not pay off in the
long run. Follow the advice your mother gave you (or should have
given you). Pack a nutritious lunch -- don't make breakfast three cups
of coffee and two chocolate doo-wahs out of the vending machines -
- eat your veggies. Get enough sleep -- especially during the times you
think you can least afford it. Get some exercise -- the Law Book
Bench Press is not enough. Take twenty minutes a day to go for a
walk at least.

Some students try to cope with the stress of law school through
chemistry: caffeine (or stronger) to keep them up; alcohol and other
substances to help them down. Not only is this strategy guaranteed to
interfere with your studies, but it is a sure-fire way to guarantee that

                                        3
the Board of Bar Examiners will refuse your application for
admission to the bar. Substance abuse and criminal records are major
red flags on any application -- and yes, that little DUI ticket counts,
even if you went through a diversion program and were told that
your record was "clean." You need more than a "clean" record to be
a lawyer -- you need a "clean" brain.

If you think you may have a problem with substance abuse already,
don't begin law school until you are in recovery. If you are in
recovery, set up a strong network of support to keep you there.
Every state has a lawyer's assistance program (LAP), which provides
confidential, professional assistance to law students and members of
the bar. Find the LAP program in your state at the website of the
ABA Commission on Lawyer Assistance Programs. ABA also runs a
listserv for law students in recovery that you can locate there, along
with useful resources on stress, depression, substance abuse, and
other mental health issues.

Equally important to your success in law school is your social support
system. Who is your "family"? What demands do they make upon
your resources? How do they feel about you going to law school? Are
there resources, supports, or limitations you need to address with
them? You will have less time and energy for your family and friends
-- but be sure not to neglect these important people in your life. They
are your buffer against stress -- your link to the rest of your life and
self. And for heaven's sake, when you are spending time with them,
don't "lawyer" them. Watching a football game with your friends is
not a good time to review your knowledge of the tort doctrine of
assumption of risk. Don't use a discussion with your spouse as an
opportunity to practice rephrasing the issue. Instead, keep track of
yourself and nurture the relationships that will nurture you.

The Most Limited Resource

Time is a most precious resource in the law. Lawyers charge for their
time, often billing clients in six-minute increments at rates averaging
over $100 an hour. In law school, as in the profession, you will need
to make every minute count. There is always more to do -- more

                                        4
than can possibly be done -- in learning to practice law. Thus,
effective time and study goal management is essential.

To complicate matters further, time management is a very
individualized process. Some people work best in the morning,
others in the evening. Some people can concentrate best on tasks by
shifting back and forth between tasks for variety; others require
sustained blocks of time to concentrate on one subject. Some of us
require more sleep than others; some have family or community
responsibilities. The bottom line is that you have to manage your
time according to your needs in a way that will allow you to
accomplish your goals.

You must be realistic about the intensive time demands of law
school. You must recognize that you simply will not have time for
many of the activities or responsibilities that you were able to carry
before law school. If you fail to recognize the time demands of law
school, you will set unrealistic goals and have unrealistic expectations
about what you can accomplish. You will end up being unhappy,
harried, sick, and you will not be able to reach your goals. Probably
one of the most common reasons for student dismissal from law
school is time: students who continued to work or continued to
engage in extensive outside activities during law school -- especially in
the first year. That is not to say that you will have no time for family,
community, or other important outside commitments. Indeed, these
outside commitments are important in reducing the overall stress
caused by the time demands of law school. But outside time
demands are a double-edged sword. It is not uncommon to feel as
though you are walking, talking, and thinking nothing but law during
the first year. If you are highly motivated to achieve academic
success, you will neglect "off time." The inevitable result for all but a
few students is burn out -- often just at the crucial exam time.
However, if you view law school as "off time" -- scheduling law
school around your outside activities rather than vice versa -- you are
unlikely to be using your most productive time for study and
learning.

                                        5
Obviously, then, the key is balance and planning. If you have never
spent any time thinking about how to manage your time, you should
do so now. There are hosts of self-help tools for time management,
but the essential principles are relatively simple. First, plan your time.
That means more than just making a to-do list or a schedule but
having a clear sense of priorities, a realistic sense of how much you
can accomplish, and the knowledge of what works for and against
your time management. If you have been plagued by procrastination
in the past, now is the time to address the circumstances that feed
that tendency: whether perfectionism, fear, or simply the thrill of
pulling off a last-minute save.

Time management is an integral part of effective law practice. Most
lawyers keep records of their time. Even for attorneys who do not
charge on an hourly basis, there are important reasons to keep track
of the time spent in representing clients. The practice of keeping time
records is an important management tool for monitoring efficiencies,
comparing productivity, and justifying fees determined on other
bases. Good timekeeping is a skill that must be mastered with
practice and can be an effective exercise in learning how to manage
your time in law school. The essentials of good timekeeping are:

Timekeeping--waiting until the end of the day and trying to
reconstruct the time spent on a particular matter will inevitably result
in inaccurate--and thus unethical--billing. You can keep time using
a simple paper-and-pencil method, an electronic notepad on your
computer, phone, or other electronic device, or timekeeping
software. Regardless of the method, the key task is the same--note
down the beginning and ending time for each task you perform.

"Billable time" --not every minute of every day of legal practice is
spent in work for a particular client; yet, it is important to know how
those additional hours are actually spent--whether it is attending a
CLE or other professional development activity, client development
and networking, or simply managing the practice. These hours are
part of your overhead, which go into the determination of your
hourly rate. You may not charge a particular client for these general
overhead tasks, but you should nonetheless record your time on

                                        6
these tasks. Getting into the habit of recording all your time allows
you to see why an eight-hour day gave you only five billable hours.

Itemized task records--Even if you spend an entire day working on
one case, you may have completed several different tasks--
investigating, consulting, researching, and writing for example. A
record that reads "7.2 hours--interviewed client, researched legal
issue, phoned records department, drafted motion" is simply no
longer acceptable to most courts and clients. Rather, you should
describe each separate task and the time spent on that task.

Billing increments--while you could simply charge on a per-minutes
basis, most attorneys keep their time in larger increments, with one-
tenth of an hour being the most common. In this approach, if you
spend three minutes on a phone call for a client, you would round
that time up to six minutes. Attorneys who use increments of larger
than one-tenth of an hour may be significantly overcharging their
clients.

To have a taste of how you will likely be required to manage your
time in practice, and to gain insights into your own time management
practices, try keeping your time spent on law school for one week.
Consider each class, office or activity, a separate "client" and record
your time for one week. At the end of the week, stop and reflect on
the experience. Did you find it difficult to keep track of your time?
Did the process of keeping time affect the way you worked? How?
Were you tempted to "cheat" and inflate or estimate your time?

In addition to time keeping, essential tools for time management in
practice that you will need to use in law school are a calendar with
due dates and a weekly schedule.

Obviously, then, the key is balance and planning. If you have never
spent any time thinking about how to manage your time, you may
find the following article useful in thinking about time management
and planning.

A Calendar

Fill in the calendar for the semester now. When do your classes begin
and end? When are exams? When are significant assignments due

                                        7
(mid-term exams, if any; legal writing papers, etc.) To get you started,
check the law school's master calendar and fill in the dates there.
Consider that the last three weeks of the semester are generally
extremely time pressured, as you struggle to maintain your class
preparation and also prepare for exams. Plan now for the most
intensive time demands during that period. If you have children or
other family responsibilities, plan for additional child-care or other
alternative arrangements now. Next, fill in significant dates of other
responsibilities. Is your cousin's wedding during the last week of
classes? Do you have medical appointments during the middle of the
semester? Is your child's school play during exams? Decide now how
to balance or rearrange these responsibilities.

                            A Weekly Schedule

Now that you have an overview of the entire semester, look at the
law school schedule. When are your classes and workshops? Block
out these inflexible times. Next consider your study times. Study time
should be allocated for three separate tasks: preparing for class,
reviewing class, and preparing for exams. You should set aside time
each week for each of these tasks for each of your classes. As a
general rule, you should plan on studying at a minimum three hours
for every class hour. THIS IS NOT AN EXAGGERATION. What
about outside responsibilities? Block out time for church,
community, or family commitments. What about yourself? Block out
time to sleep, to relax, and to play.

Consider that you will have fifteen hours of class time each week.
Add your four to one study time ratio. That's sixty hours a week.
How will you allocate that time? Consider that there are 24 hours in a
day; that most people need about 8 hours to sleep and another two
hours for eating, bathing, and other basic human functions. That
leaves 14 hours a day (98 hours a week) to allocate between law
school and life. What choices will you make? Can you work ten hours
a day, six days a week so that you can have a free day? Or would your
style be better served with seven days a week of eight hours? Or how
about fourteen hours a day Monday thru Thursday, and five hours on
Friday? These are not easy choices and perhaps you may be saying to
yourself that these are choices you can avoid. But you are risking a

                                        8
great deal if you proceed with any other than these assumptions
about the time required during the first year.

While you are at it, think about where you will study as well. The
library at school? The public library near your home? Your home?
Where will you honestly be the most efficient and the least subject to
distractions? Where will you have the resources at hand to study well?

The Non-cognitive Resources: Self-knowledge and
Self-esteem

One fundamental resource for success is what might be termed
"spirit." This resource is more than self-knowledge and self-
confidence; it also involves high motivation and the ability to act as
part of a community. Overall, one's attitude toward law school can be
as important in success as one's aptitude. What are the necessary
attitudes you need to instill in yourself and look for in your study
partners?

The successful law student is highly motivated to learn. The first
aspect of this "spirit of success" is self-knowledge and the ability to
maintain your motivation. To be effective in learning, you must be
motivated to learn and must have effective study habits. This is
especially so when, as in law school, the demands are so rigorous and
the feedback or reward so delayed. Sometimes students excel in law
school simply because of extraordinarily high motivation; others fail
because their motivation was lacking or insufficient to carry them
through the process.

There will be points in law school when you will lose your
motivation: either because you are bored, or tired or simply do not
see any reward for your efforts. You will need to have ready some
techniques to keep your motivation strong. What has worked for you
in the past can work for you here. How have you maintained your
motivation in other long-term, high-demand tasks? You might
challenge yourself: for example, volunteer to participate in class
discussions so that you will have an incentive to prepare more fully,
or set goals for outlining subject matters by certain dates. Break your
work down into small parts and give yourself rewards for completing

                                        9
each part. Make a visible reminder of your progress -- keep all your
briefs and class notes in one notebook and watch it grow, or make
lists of assignments and cross them off as you complete them.
Remind yourself of the importance of sustained effort to long-term
learning. Remind yourself of the importance of long-term learning to
your goals of completing law school and pursuing whatever career in
law or elsewhere you have set as a goal. Turn to your support system
for support and encouragement.

The successful law student is connected and cooperative. Ironically,
one of the least effective methods of motivation may be one that
seems most predominant in the law school environment: that is,
motivating yourself by measuring yourself against your peers.
Ironically, those students who are most motivated by the desire to
"come out on top" or "earn all A's" -- that is, students with a
competitive orientation toward study -- are less likely to "win" than
are those students whose motivation comes from the pursuit of more
intrinsic rewards, like the enjoyment of learning, accomplishment, or
improvement. This is true, in part, because motivating yourself by
focusing on grades tends to lead you to focus on strategies for short-
term learning, and on finding short cuts to success. Research
indicates that this approach to study is unlikely to be effective in
creating long-term learning.

Because law school success depends in large part on long-term
learning of skills that require daily practice and deep mastery, there
are no "short cuts" to success. Moreover, very competitive students
also tend to isolate themselves in their learning. Research into law
school success demonstrates that a feeling of social isolation is a
fundamental variable in predicting success in law school. Even if you
generally prefer to work alone, you should at least try to work with
study partners for purposes of review and exam preparation. One of
the skills that law schools develop is the skill of generating alternative
interpretations or solutions. For this skill, two (or more) heads are
definitely better than one. Study partners can be important sources
for insight into the process of law school learning and support for
flagging confidence. When choosing study partners and working with

                                       10
them, look for positive, directed people with a sense of humor and
beware the student who takes him or herself too seriously.

The successful law student is confident and positive Just as isolation
is a variable in law school success, so is self-confidence. As Maslow's
need hierarchy demonstrates, one cannot realize one's potential until
one has fulfilled the need for confidence. Self-confidence is a
complex amalgam of prior experience, personality, and setting. You
may come into law school with prior experiences of success and a
personality geared toward confidence. Unfortunately, the law school
setting can shake the confidence of all but the most secure.
Throughout a semester, you will receive very little specific, evaluative
feedback. Most faculty in the first year give mid-term exams, but few
(outside of perhaps your legal writing instructors) provide the type of
weekly, graded homework that you might have received in
undergraduate education. The classroom process, designed to
challenge and expand your learning, will not necessarily provide
positive feedback or bolster your confidence.

Some students are especially adept at trying to undermine the
confidence of their peers. The first grades you receive in law school
are very likely to be the lowest grades you have ever received in your
life. And those grades count for so much -- becoming a source of
considerable stress as you engage in a more competitive, explicit
ranking process than many of you have faced since junior high. Law
students are all highly talented and intelligent people, used to
achievement. But all law students cannot graduate with a 4.00 grade
point average. (You can all graduate, but 90% of you will not
graduate in the top 10% of the class). How can one maintain
confidence in the face of such a situation? Focus on the positive.
Remind yourself of the successes you have had. Re-frame your
disappointments in positive directions. If you get a poor grade on
your first legal writing assignment, for example, you might frame this
as "Better now than later - at least I have a chance to find out how to
improve." Be careful about re-framing in ways that undermine your
overall motivation (e.g., "The Professor must not like me -- there's
nothing I can do to improve). Many people find affirmations or
giving themselves pep talks to be effective in boosting confidence.

                                       11
Try using some of these techniques when you feel your confidence
flagging.

The successful law student is an active, independent learner.
Successful law students are enthusiastic about their learning rather
than viewing learning as an imposition. These students take personal
responsibility for their learning and do not expect to be "taught."
They are active in their reading and listening. To be an active learner,
you must create your own organization of the materials -- not rely on
the casebook, outlines, or syllabus to organize the materials for you.
Law school casebooks are rarely written in the style of most
undergraduate textbooks -- building from simple to complex,
containing all the materials needed to master the course, or explaining
concepts or organizing materials. The same can be said for many law
school classes. Students can become frustrated with questions that
have no answers, or no rhyme or reason for being posed. Or students
can take charge of their own learning and save the time wasted in
blaming the book, professor or law school.

The successful law student has a tolerance for ambiguity. Most
undergraduate learning is based on a dualistic mode of thinking.
There are "right" and "wrong" answers and the student's task is to
memorize as much materials as possible in order to be able to
recognize or provide the "right" answer. Having found and provided
that answer, no further explanation of the process is required. Law
schools are based on a multiplistic and relativistic mode of thinking.
Questions, interpretations, explanations and arguments are far more
important to most exam performance than providing the correct
conclusion. (For more insight into this aspect of law study, see the
section on "the right answer" in the next chapter.) If you expect that
you will be learning "THE LAW" during law school -- as a set of
formula into which you can plug some client facts and get an answer
-- you will not succeed. You need to recognize that attorneys are not
sought for their knowledge of the law nearly so much as their ability
to research, analyze, and use the law.

The successful law student knows how he or she learns best. Just as
everyone has different study habits and attitudes, everyone uses
different approaches to study. There are several ways that you can

                                       12
categorize your learning style. They key here is to use these tools, not
to label yourself or others, or to predict success or failure. These
assessments are simply ways of understanding your own preferences
and strengths, so you can devise the most effective methods of study.

For example, one useful way to assess learning style is to consider
your preferred mode of perception: how do you take in information
about the world? The way people perceive reality can be broken into
two categories -- sensing and intuition. Persons who prefer to take in
information about their world through sensing use sight, smell,
sound, touch and taste. They prefer concrete information and notice
what is. In comparison, persons who prefer intuition gather
information more often in terms of feelings, thoughts and emotions.
They prefer abstractions and notice what might be. The following
chart provides some key vocabularies preferred by each of these
types. Try to identify which approach to perception you prefer.
(Remember, there is no "better" preference).

Sensing (75% of Population)  Intuition (25% of Population)
            experience                     hunches
                past                         future
              realistic                   speculative
           perspiration                   inspiration
               actual                      possible
                fact                        fiction
               utility                      fantasy
            practicality                   ingenuity
              sensible
                                          imaginative

How do these preferences impact your learning? Each preference
brings strengths and weakness. For example, often persons with a
sensing preference are able to learn step by step, without the "big
picture"; whereas a person who prefers intuition learns better with a
global scheme in mind. Since law school rarely provides a "big
picture" up front, intuitive learners may have to work at finding that
model or develop greater patience. On the other hand, intuitive
learners are often much more tolerant of ambiguity and complicated
situations, qualities that abound in law, whereas sensing types will

                             13
need to become more patient with complicated details or problems
for which no standard solution exists.
Sensing types are better at learning applications -- they would learn
rules of law best by developing factual settings for those rules, for
example. Intuitive types are strong in developing theory -- they would
learn rules of law best by relating them to a conceptual model.
Sensing types often work more steadily, with a realistic idea of how
long things take. Intuitive types work in bursts of energy powered by
enthusiasm, with slack periods in between. Neither approach is
necessarily superior. Intuitive types do need to be aware of the
dangers of their preferences to procrastinate and flitter from project
to project. Likewise, however, sensing types need to be able to extend
themselves for flexibility in their schedules as the situation calls for.
For more information, try the taking the Solomon & Felder Index of
Learning Styles, or, for a resource specifically geared to law school
learning, read Don Peters & Martha Peters, JURIS TYPES: LEARNING
LAW THROUGH SELF-UNDERSTANDING (2007). The point here is to
be aware of what works best for you and to build on your strengths
and minimize your weaknesses.

Chapter Two: Preparing for

Class

Class preparation requires more than simply reading the material.
You will need to re-read and work with the materials -- writing notes,
re-writing notes, practicing applications and preparing outlines. In
this chapter, we will review the critical thinking, reading and writing
skills you will use as you prepare for class.

Critical, Active Reading Skills

Law school requires that you read large quantities of dense material.
You must have efficient reading habits to simply complete your
assignments. You must have critical, active reading habits to be
effective in learning from what you read. The following is a suggested
method for reading your assignments. It is an elaboration of the
classic SQ3R method developed by Professor Frank Robinson at The
Ohio State University in the 1940s.2 That method suggested that you
approach each assignment by

     Surveying

     Questioning

     Reading

     Reciting

     Reviewing
This text suggests three more "R"s - Reflecting, Writing, and
Research. The SQ3R method is sufficient if what you are trying to
learn is rote knowledge. But in law school, you are learning to
develop the skills of written and oral analysis. This requires a critical
engagement with the ideas you encounter when you read, not merely
memorization of those rules. Reflection is central to this critical
engagement - stopping and thinking about what you are learning, its
possible applications, and the limits of your learning.

                                       15
Writing makes your critical reflection very precise. Moreover, writing
is a key legal skill. The best way to improve your writing is to write a
lot. Thus, your note-taking and case-briefing are not only important
to your learning legal doctrine, but are important to mastering the
skills of written legal analysis. In addition, written summaries of your
learning enables your review. The review you must conduct in
learning law is an iterative review: that is, you review today's
assignment today; then you review this same material again at the end
of the chapter or unit, when you have learned more context that
deepens your understanding; then you review again at the end of the
course, when you must integrate all of your understanding of course
doctrine in a manner that you can apply to new problems. If you
have written notes to review, you will be able to improve this review
each iteration.

Finally, there is a role for research in your law study. At a minimum,
you will need to research vocabulary by regularly using a legal
dictionary to decipher the language of the law. At times, you may
wish to research concepts or cases to clarify or extend your
understanding. You will soon learn that there is rarely time for
elaborate research of each class assignment; however, you must not
overlook the essential research called for to engage your
understanding.

With this modified SQ6R method in mind, consider the following
guidelines for reading for class.

         1. Know your assignment and actually read it.

Before you can read efficiently or effectively, you have to know what
to read. Check the syllabus and listen in class for instructor guidance
on your reading assignment. If neither the syllabus nor the instructor
provides guidance, adopt a rule of thumb that reflects the pace at
which you actually cover materials in the class - 20 pages a class, for
example - and read at least that much, regardless of whether you are
expressly assigned materials or not.

Do read what is assigned. Even if the instructor doesn't cover the
material in class. Even if you won't get to the material in class for a
week. Be sure to read everything that you are assigned. If you are

                                       16
given an assignment to read pages 20-34 of your textbook, read those
pages of the textbook. Some students read a lot of material, but never
really read their assignments. They skim pages 20-34, or they read the
cases contained on pages 20-25 and 29-33 but skip the notes,
comments, problems, footnotes, or article excerpts in between. Other
students actually move their eyes over all the pages, but mostly for
the purposes of following their highlighter as they color their books.
Then there are the students who read other materials instead of the
assignment: canned briefs (the Cliff notes of law school) or outlines,
or hornbooks. Sometimes extra reading is a good idea (remember the
"Research" R); but first, read your assignment.

         2. Prepare to read.

Put yourself in the right place and time for reading. You know what
works for you. If reading in your easy chair is really a signal for a nap,
find less soporific surroundings. If reading in the library is really an
opportunity for socializing, find some isolation. Set aside a place and
time that works for you and stick to it.

Put yourself in the right frame of mind as well. Know that cases, in
particular, are not easy readers. There is much you will need to learn
in order to understand what you are reading and there is even more
you will need to infer or interpret. Judges are not necessarily selected
for the bench because they are clear writers. Even clear writers
sometimes may prefer to create some ambiguity in their opinion. So
be prepared.

         3. Prepare to learn as you read.

Most law students know that they need to have an outline for their
exams. Successful law students know that they need to start their
assignments with an outline for their reading. The best sources for
such an outline are the table of contents for the textbook or the
course syllabus. Before you read any particular assignment or case,
look over your reading outline, paying particular attention to the
overall topics and "themes." Identify where, in this organization, the
materials to be studied fit. Skim through the entire reading
assignment (This is the first of several reads). How many pages? How
many cases?

                                       17
Begin to wonder about what you will be reading. Ask yourself some
motivational questions about the material. For example, why might I
want to know this material? Have I ever had experiences with this
subject area? Ask some questions to help identify what you are
looking for. For example, read some of the questions in the notes
following cases or ask yourself what rules or concepts might you be
exploring and guess what they might mean.

         4. Read thoroughly.

Read the entire assignment, trying to get a sense of what's going on.
This will take a long time at the beginning because you will likely
have to stop often to look up unfamiliar words or to re-read
confusing passages. Do be sure to use references as you read. Look
up unfamiliar terms in the dictionary (standard and legal). Get
background on concepts from secondary sources. Re-read each
portion of the assignment (each case, for example) looking for key
ideas and reasoning.

         5. Reflect as you Read.

Engage your critical mind as you read. Be sure that you are not just
passively taking in the information, but are searching, questioning,
comparing and otherwise thinking as you read. Some students do this
by reading out loud if their mind wanders. Many students find it
useful to highlight, underline and annotate the text as they read.
Argue with the text as you read. Compare what you are reading to
what you already know. Whatever technique you use -- keep thinking.

and Re-read.

Once is rarely enough. On each subsequent read, have a different
purpose and read for that purpose. You might want to re-read to
understand simply what happened in the case, for example. Or you
might want to re-read in order to compare how what you have read
today fits with what you read yesterday.

         6. Write.

Briefing the cases assigned is only one aspect of writing as you read.
Take notes on other aspects of your reading. Keep a vocabulary list
and write out definitions for yourself. If you read statutes or rules,

                                       18
diagram them or write them in your own words. If there are articles
or commentary accompanying a case, be sure you summarize the
main points in your notes. If you have questions about your readings,
write them down and look for answers.

         7. Review.

Throughout the semester, you will need to review everything you
have read. Review your readings after you have completed your
notes, by comparing them with others or inventing and discussing
problems raised by the readings. Review with a purpose of
discovering what you know and -- perhaps even more important --
what you don't know. Generate more questions and then try to
answer them.

As part of your review, go back to materials that you have read for
prior classes and review those materials in comparison to the
materials that you have most recently read. Look for connections and
themes. Write these ideas down. Review all your notes immediately
before class, skimming through the textbook to be sure that you are
familiar with where to find important points.

Critical Writing Skills: An Introduction to Briefing

One of the most important aspects of writing as you read is
"briefing" the cases in your text. It is the process of preparing the
brief that provides the primary benefit, not the brief itself. The
process of briefing helps you concentrate on key ideas, compare one
case with another, organize your analysis, and review your materials.
Remember that your purpose in reading cases is NOT TO LEARN
ABOUT THE CASE -- the case is simply one fact situation to which
one court has responded. MUCH OF WHAT YOU NEED TO
GET OUT OF A CASE IS NOT TO BE FOUND IN THE
EXPRESS WORDS OF THE CASE.

You study cases because they provide:

RULES & DOCTRINES -- You must learn to identify the legal
concepts and rules that are applied in cases. Learning the rules is the
easy part. Interpreting the rules is the difficulty. Remember that
RULES ARE TOOLS to solve problems --they are not formulae to

                                       19
provide answers. So identify and memorize the language of the rules,
yes, but also work on identifying all the different uses that could be
made of the rule.
ARGUMENTS -- Cases provide examples of techniques of
argumentation that can be applied to all kinds of situations. They also
provide fact situations to which you can apply your own
argumentation skills, creating arguments that are different from or
more carefully crafted than those provided by the court.
POLICIES -- Cases implicate public policy considerations that the
judges may or may not expressly discuss but which you need to
explore.
STRATEGIES AND OUTCOMES -- Cases provide examples of
choices and outcomes that affect clients. You need to think about
whether the choices made were wise and about what options were
available. These are matters rarely discussed explicitly in the case.
Especially during the first month of classes, you will need to read the
cases several times before you can produce a final brief. The "policy
analysis" and "personal analysis" sections may be rather thin as you
concentrate on describing opinion itself. After several weeks, you will
be able to brief the cases with less effort and fewer readings. Now,
the time saved should be spent thinking about analysis. The focus of
your study will shift from the top sections of the briefing format to
the bottom.

A Sample Briefing Format

Citation: Name of the case, date decided, court
Statement of the Case: "Who is suing whom for what remedy on
what basis?" (from viewpoint of trial court)
Statement of Facts: Chronological summary of all relevant facts
(sometimes drawing a diagram helps)
Procedure Below: What happened in the lower court? Who won?
Result on Appeal: Was the trial court reversed or affirmed?

                                       20
What is the issue? There are usually two kinds of issues: "what is
the law? (e.g., which rule should the court apply? or which
interpretation of the rule should the court adopt?)" or "how does the
law apply to these facts? (e.g., should these facts be characterized in
such a way as to fit within the rule or outside the rule?)". A third
issue: "what are the facts" is equally important in practice, but we will
not usually be addressing those issues in this course. Note that one
case may contain several issues.

Arguments and Analysis of Appellant: Why is the trial court
wrong and what legal theory or interpretation should have been
applied?

Arguments and Analysis of Appellee: What is the trial court's legal
theory or application and why is that correct?

What is the Holding? One way to think of a holding is: "Under this
doctrine of law, if these facts occur, then this condition of the law
has been fulfilled."

Policy Analysis: What public policies or goals are furthered by the
court's choice? What would be the effect if the court has chosen an
alternative rule or application of the rule? How does this opinion fit
in with others you have read on the same topic? How does the law
applied in this case fit into the overall scheme?

Personal Analysis: Do you agree with the holding? How far do you
think the next court would be willing to extend the holding? Do you
agree with the results? Is it fair? Do you agree with the analysis? Is it
logical and consistent? What's likely to happen now to the people and
the property involved? What would you have done differently if you
had represented one of the parties or had been the judge? Why is this
case in the book? Why did the professor assign it? How might it be
tested?

         Holdings and "What's the Answer"

Students often have the most difficulty in arriving at a 'holding' in
their brief. This is often the point at which students approach their
professors and ask "Did I get the holding right?" or "What's the
answer?" The "answer" to all legal questions is the same: IT

                                       21
DEPENDS. What the holding of a case is depends on how you
interpret the result of the case in light of the facts and the court's
reasoning. Students must understand that a holding is not the same as
a 'rule', which is the law the court applies to the facts in the case to
reach the holding. It is also different than the court's 'rationale' for
why it chose to apply the rule in the way it did. Over time, a series of
'holdings' in related cases, crystallize into 'rules'. Even when the court
says "We hold..." the statement they make may not be what develops
into the "holding" of the case as other courts apply that case.

So, there is no "right or wrong" holding -- only interpretations of
cases that are more strongly supported and better reasoned that
others -- and when is a particular interpretation "better reasoned"? IT
DEPENDS on the use you wish to make of the holding. If you are
defending someone for whom the interpretation of a holding will be
favorable precedent and you can make a good argument that that
interpretation is correct, then that is the better holding. If you are
trying to predict how a future court will apply a case, the
interpretation that results in a holding that best predicts the future is
the "better" holding -- at least until the future changes.

Here is one way of looking at a holding that can help to reflect the
complexity of this concept.

              Suppose a court has a case in which A discovers
              that B has a son who requires a special
              operation. Out of the goodness of A's heart, A
              pays for the operation. B discovers A's
              generosity and then promises to pay for A's
              education. B later reneges on the promise, just
              as A is about to finish the degree program and
              begin a teaching job. The court finds that B has
              no legal obligation to pay for A's education (the
              result). The holding might be phrased as
              follows:

Functional Result:

The Court will not grant restitution to a Plaintiff who performs a
Defendant's obligation...

Facts Tending to Lead to Result

                                       22
AT LEAST IF:
    1) Defendant has not requested Plaintiff to perform the
         obligation
    2) Plaintiff and Defendant have not entered into a contract
         under which Defendant agreed to reimburse Plaintiff
    3) There existed an alternative remedy through which someone
         could have required Defendant to perform its obligation itself

Facts Tending to Lead to Opposite Result
EVEN THOUGH:

    1) Defendant did have the obligation
    2) Performance of the obligation was of great public importance
    3) Plaintiff performed Defendant's obligation
    4) Plaintiff's performance of the obligation conferred a benefit

         on Defendant.
    5) Plaintiff had an obligation (e.g. teaching contract) which

         could not be performed unless Defendant's obligation was
         performed
Facts Tending to Mitigate the Effect of the "Even Though" Facts
AT LEAST SO LONG AS:
    1) Plaintiff was not an intended beneficiary of the statute or
         contract (or other source) creating Defendant's obligation
    2) Plaintiff has some other remedy for any damage Plaintiff
         suffered by reason of his inability to perform his obligation
         (e.g. teaching contract)

The Importance of Vocabulary

It is tempting for students to gloss over words that they don't
understand. Many professional schools' students have developed
their vocabulary to the point that, when faced with unfamiliar words,
they simply guess their meanings from context and let it go at that.
They have gotten out of the dictionary habit. In law school, while

                                       23
guessing meaning from context is not a bad first step, the dictionary
habit is critical. Every word that you pass over (whether legal or not)
creates a hole in your understanding that has a cumulative effect on
your ability to master the material.

The study of law revolves around the learning of a whole new
language. Some legal words are foreign looking and sounding (for
example, "res judicata" "mens rea"); others look like words that you
think you know (judgment, reasonableness, intent) but have peculiar
and complex legal meaning. Often, the meaning of these terms is the
key issue in interpreting cases and statutes. Having the vocabulary of
the law at hand is essential to being able to research the law. The fact
that separate (very voluminous) dictionaries exist for legal terms
should indicate to you the importance of acquiring and mastering a
legal vocabulary.

Thus, part of your daily class preparation should include looking up
and striving to understand the definitions for every unfamiliar word.
At first, this will mean that you will be stopping to look up words
nearly every other sentence. Take heart. As the semester progresses
and your legal vocabulary expands, however, you will be find fewer
and fewer unfamiliar words. You can use a classic legal dictionary
such as Black's or Ballentine's, which courts cite as authoritative
sources of legal definitions; however, if you find online legal
dictionaries more convenient, these are fine for class preparation. Just
be sure that your online sources are from a reliable source - learning
your vocabulary from the notes of another 1L student posted to the
web is not necessarily the best route to accurate understanding.

The task of becoming skillful in case analysis is indeed difficult and
time consuming. It may take hours to comprehend a single opinion.
If you apply yourself diligently, however, and if you have a realistic
outlook of what must be done, you will find that the time needed to
handle opinions will tend to decrease. What will increase from this
approach will be your satisfaction in being able to use case law
effectively in the resolution of legal problems and effectively research
law in order to learn more.

Guided Reading of a Case

Let's try applying the SQ6R principles with a simple case involving a
lost animal. On the left side of the page is an opinion in an actual

getting out of the case as you read it. Remember, it may take more
than one reading.

Case #2

Here is a more typical law school case. Footnotes point out how you
should be reading this case.

                 Thomas and wife v. Winchester3

    Court of Appeals of New York 4

    Decided July 1852 5

    6 NY 397

    RUGGLES, Ch. J.6 delivered the opinion of the court.

    This is an action brought to recover damages from the
    defendant for negligently7 putting up, labeling and selling as and
    for the extract of dandelion, which is a simple and harmless
    medicine, a jar of the extract of belladonna8, which is a deadly
    poison; by means of which the plaintiff Mary Ann Thomas, to
    whom, being sick, a dose of dandelion was prescribed by a

                                        32
physician, and a portion of the contents of the jar, was
administered as and for the extract of dandelion, was greatly
injured.

The facts proved were briefly these: Mrs. Thomas being in ill
health, her physician prescribed for her a dose of dandelion. Her
husband purchased what was believed to be the medicine
prescribed, at the store of Dr. Foord, a physician and druggist in
Cazenovia, Madison county, where the plaintiffs reside.

A small quantity of the medicine thus purchased was
administered to Mrs. Thomas, on whom it produced very
alarming effects; such as coldness of the surface and extremities,
feebleness of circulation, spasms of the muscles, giddiness of
the head, dilation of the pupils of the eyes, and derangement of
mind. She recovered however, after some time, from its effects,
although for a short time her life was thought to be in great
danger. The medicine administered was belladonna, and not
dandelion. The jar from which it was taken was labeled "1/2 lb.
dandelion, prepared by A. Gilbert, No. 108, John-street, N. Y.
Jar 8 oz." It was sold for and believed by Dr. Foord to be the
extract of dandelion as labeled. Dr. Foord purchased the article
as the extract of dandelion from Jas. S. Aspinwall, a druggist at
New-York. Aspinwall bought it of the defendant as extract of
dandelion, believing it to be such. The defendant was engaged at
No. 108 John-street, New-York, in the manufacture and sale of
certain vegetable extracts for medicinal purposes, and in the
purchase and sale of others. The extracts manufactured by him
were put up in jars for sale, and those which he purchased were
put up by him in like manner. The jars containing extracts
manufactured by himself and those containing extracts
purchased by him from others, were labeled alike. Both were
labeled like the jar in question, as "prepared by A. Gilbert."
Gilbert was a person employed by the defendant at a salary, as
an assistant in his business. The jars were labeled in Gilbert's
name because he had been previously engaged in the same
business on his own account at No. 108 John-street, and
probably because Gilbert's labels rendered the articles more
salable. The extract contained in the jar sold to Aspinwall, and
by him to Foord, was not manufactured by the defendant, but

                                  33
was purchased by him from another manufacturer or dealer.
The extract of dandelion and the extract of belladonna resemble
each other in color, consistence, smell and taste; but may on
careful examination be distinguished the one from the other by
those who are well acquainted with these articles. Gilbert's labels
were paid for by Winchester and used in his business with his
knowledge and assent. 9

The defendants' counsel moved for a nonsuit10 on the following
grounds:

That the action could not be sustained, as the defendant was the
remote vendor of the article in question: and there was no
connection, transaction or privity11 between him and the
plaintiffs, or either of them.

* * * *12

The judge overruled the motion for a nonsuit, and the
defendant's counsel excepted.

The case depends on the first point taken by the defendant on
his motion for a nonsuit; and the question is, whether the
defendant, being a remote vendor of the medicine, and there
being no privity or connection between him and the plaintiffs,
the action can be maintained.13

If, in labeling a poisonous drug with the name of a harmless
medicine, for public market, no duty was violated by the
defendant, excepting that which he owed to Aspinwall, his
immediate vendee, in virtue of his contract of sale, this action
cannot be maintained.14 If A build a wagon and sell it to B, who
sells it to C, and C hires it to D, who in consequence of the
gross negligence of A in building the wagon is overturned and
injured, D cannot recover damages against A, the builder. A's
obligation to build the wagon faithfully, arises solely out of his
contract with B. The public have nothing to do with it.
Misfortune to third persons, not parties to the contract, would
not be a natural and necessary consequence of the builder's
negligence; and such negligence is not an act imminently
dangerous to human life.

                                  34
So, for the same reason, if a horse be defectively shod by a
smith, and a person hiring the horse from the owner is thrown
and injured in consequence of the smith's negligence in shoeing;
the smith is not liable for the injury. The smith's duty in such
case grows exclusively out of his contract with the owner of the
horse; it was a duty which the smith owed to him alone, and to
no one else. And although the injury to the rider may have
happened in consequence of the negligence of the smith, the
latter was not bound, either by his contract or by any
considerations of public policy or safety, to respond for his
breach of duty to any one except the person he contracted with.

This was the ground on which the case of Winterbottom v. Wright,
(10 Mees. & Welsb. 109,) was decided. A contracted with the
postmaster general to provide a coach to convey the mail bags
along a certain line of road, and B. and others, also contracted to
horse the coach along the same line. B and his co-contractors
hired C, who was the plaintiff, to drive the coach. The coach, in
consequence of some latent defect, broke down; the plaintiff
was thrown from his seat and lamed. It was held that C could
not maintain an action against A for the injury thus sustained.
The reason of the decision is best stated by Baron Rolfe. A's
duty to keep the coach in good condition, was a duty to the
postmaster general, with whom he made his contract, and not a
duty to the driver employed by the owners of the horses. 15

But the case in hand stands on a different ground. The
defendant was a dealer in poisonous drugs. Gilbert was his agent
in preparing them for market. The death or great bodily harm of
some person was the natural and almost inevitable consequence
of the sale of belladonna by means of the false label. 16

Gilbert, the defendant's agent17, would have been punishable for
manslaughter18 if Mrs. Thomas had died in consequence of
taking the falsely labeled medicine. Every man who, by his
culpable negligence, causes the death of another, although
without intent to kill, is guilty of manslaughter. (2 R. S. 662, §
19.) A chemist who negligently sells laudanum in a phial labeled
as paregoric, and thereby causes the death of a person to whom
it is administered, is guilty of manslaughter. (Tessymond's case,

                                  35
1 Lewin's Crown Cases, 169.) "So highly does the law value
human life, that it admits of no justification wherever life has
been lost and the carelessness or negligence of one person has
contributed to the death of another. (Regina v. Swindall, 2 Car. &
Kir. 232-3.) And this rule applies not only where the death of
one is occasioned by the negligent act of another, but where it is
caused by the negligent omission of a duty of that other. (2 Car.
& Kir. 368, 371.) Although the defendant Winchester may not
be answerable criminally for the negligence of his agent, there
can be no doubt of his liability in a civil action, in which the act
of the agent is to be regarded as the act of the principal.

In respect to the wrongful and criminal character of the
negligence complained of, this case differs widely from those
put by the defendant's counsel. No such imminent danger
existed in those cases. In the present case the sale of the
poisonous article was made to a dealer in drugs, and not to a
consumer. The injury therefore was not likely to fall on him, or
on his vendee who was also a dealer; but much more likely to be
visited on a remote purchaser, as actually happened.19 The
defendant's negligence put human life in imminent danger. Can
it be said that there was no duty on the part of the defendant, to
avoid the creation of that danger by the exercise of greater
caution?20 or that the exercise of that caution was a duty only to
his immediate vendee, whose life was not endangered? The
defendant's duty arose out of the nature of his business and the
danger to others incident to its mismanagement. Nothing but
mischief like that which actually happened could have been
expected from sending the poison falsely labeled into the
market; and the defendant is justly responsible for the probable
consequences of the act. The duty of exercising caution in this
respect did not arise out of the defendant's contract of sale to
Aspinwall. The wrong done by the defendant was in putting the
poison, mislabeled, into the hands of Aspinwall as an article of
merchandise to be sold and afterwards used as the extract of
dandelion, by some person then unknown. The owner of a
horse and cart who leaves them unattended in the street is liable
for any damage which may result from his negligence. (Lynch v.
Nurdin, 1 Ad. & Ellis, N. S. 29; Illidge v. Goodwin, 5 Car. & Payne,

                                  36
    190.) The owner of a loaded gun who puts it into the hands of a
    child by whose indiscretion it is discharged, is liable for the
    damage occasioned by the discharge. (5 Maule & Sel. 198.)21 The
    defendant's contract of sale to Aspinwall does not excuse the
    wrong done to the plaintiffs. It was a part of the means by
    which the wrong was effected. The plaintiffs' injury and their
    remedy would have stood on the same principle, if the
    defendant had given the belladonna to Dr. Foord without price,
    or if he had put it in his shop without his knowledge, under
    circumstances which would probably have led to its sale on the
    faith of the label.

    In Longmeid v. Holliday, (6 Law and Eq. Rep. 562,) the distinction
    is recognized between an act of negligence imminently
    dangerous to the lives of others, and one that is not so. In the
    former case, the party guilty of the negligence is liable to the
    party injured, whether there be a contract between them or not;
    22in the latter, the negligent party is liable only to the party with
    whom he contracted, and on the ground that negligence is a
    breach of the contract.

    Judgment affirmed.

Reading the Law from a Series of Cases

Not only do you need to be able to "brief" each case, you must be
able to read the cases together. Sometimes casebooks provide two
cases with very similar facts but opposite outcomes. Your task in
preparing for class is to explain ("distinguish" or "reconcile") why
each case came out the way it did. Sometimes, the two cases simply
represent majority and minority approaches to the same rule. Other
times, one case represents the general rule and subsequent cases
represent extensions, modifications, exceptions, or reversals. You
need to be able to read these cases together to identify what the law
has become.

For example, assume that you have read two cases on products
liability, similar to Thomas v. Winchester, in your torts class: Adams v.
Burns involving a gun and Appleton v. Butler involving a kerosene lamp.
The plaintiff won in one case and lost in the other. You have now

                                       37
been presented with a hypothetical and asked to predict or argue for
a result. One way to learn to identify rules and analogize cases is to
create a chart of the relevant cases and generalize the facts broadly or
narrowly to fit your case. Complete the chart below to practice this
skill.
Assume that you have a client, Alberts, who is suing Berg for injuries
that resulted when he ate some rat poison labeled aspirin. There are
two cases in your jurisdiction that you think might apply as
precedent. As you read those cases, you will be:

     choosing facts that are important to the outcome
     characterizing those facts in a generic way that allows ...
     comparing the facts of those cases to the facts of your case to

         either
             o making analogies from the case (argue that your facts
                  are the same) to your facts if the outcome is the same
                  as the outcome you desire OR
             o distinguishing the case (your facts are different) from
                  your facts if the outcome is not favorable

     explaining WHY the similarities or differences you have
         identified are important (this requires some rule and theory
         building).

How do you decide what facts are important to compare or what
explanations can be used to justify your comparisons? The opinions
themselves may provide some clues, but you need to learn to read
beyond what the court says and look to what it does. By examining
facts, and asking "So what" repeatedly about each difference and
similarity in facts, you will soon discover several possible reasons
beyond the court's reasons. This is the route to true understanding.

Chapter Three: Getting the

Most from Class

While class time actually is a very small percentage of the time you
spend on learning in law school, it is critical time nonetheless.
Research establishes that class attendance is one of the most
influential performance factors in predicting law school performance.
(Kimball, Farmer & Monson, Ability, Effort, and Performance Among
First-Year Law Students at Brigham Young University, 1981 AM. B.
FOUND. RES. J. 671, 689-92). For class time to extend your learning,
however, you must be deliberate about making the most of that time.

Most law school classes are very different from traditional
undergraduate classes. They are not passive exercises, and are not
intended to tie the material into a neat package. Instead, many law
school classes (and certainly those in the first year) are designed to
build on the basic understandings obtained from your careful
preparation, answer some of your questions, and raise many new
questions. The materials in this chapter are designed to help you get
the most from those classes.

What to Expect in Class (and Why)

Instruction in first-year law school classes around the country is
remarkably similar, regardless of the subject, professor, students,
location or school "rank." (Steven I. Friedland, How We Teach: A
Survey of Teaching Techniques in American Law Schools, 20 SEATTLE U. L.
REV. 1, 28 (1996)). In most law school classes, your professor will ask
questions and students will answer. This has been characterized the
"Socratic" method. Some professors are masters of the method. For
others, you may need to work harder to understand their questioning
method.

Professors differ in the methods used to select students for
participation in this exchange. Some professors call on students
randomly, others will ask for volunteers. In some classes, only two or
three students will be "on the hot seat" during class; in others, a

                                       40
larger number of students will be asked to speak. The most important
thing for you to remember is, even if you are "off the hook" for
answering a question, stay as attentive and focused as if the questions
were being directed to you.

Students often dread the moment at which they are asked to speak in
class. For some, any public speaking is difficult, not to mention the
stress of debate with the professor in the classroom. Other students
seem to thrive on the opportunity to contribute to class discussion or
challenge ideas presented. Why do we have this interaction in the
classroom in the first place? What is the point of all this grilling by
the professors? Professors have many goals in their questioning
methods. Questions might be used simply as a method of keeping
students honest in their class preparation. They may serve the
purpose of assessing student understanding of basic rules and
doctrines before moving to more advanced analysis of those rules.
Primarily though, questions in the law school classroom go beyond
recitation of rules, doctrines and theory, but also to develop skills of
critical, independent reading and thinking, and confident articulation
of ideas, arguments and analysis. The "Socratic" method can help you
develop these skills if you prepare and participate. You can better
prepare yourself for the moment when you are called upon (or
volunteer) to speak by recognizing the kinds of questions your
professor typically asks.

Often professors merely ask students to "state the case": which
basically consists of reciting the key elements of your case brief. Fine
tuning your brief to meet the format expected by each professor can
make responding to these questions quite straightforward. Other
forms of questions are a bit more daunting. For example, the
professor may ask you to speculate about the facts ("Why do you
think the plaintiff rejected the goods rather than accept and sue for
the difference in value?" "Why didn't the attorney raise that issue?").
You may be asked to respond to or analyze the arguments and
reasoning in a case or to provide your own arguments and analysis.
("What do you think of the X rule?" "Why was the court so
concerned about Y?" "How could plaintiff have strengthened that
argument?" "What is the response to that position?"). A classic of law

                                       41
school Socratic dialogue requires you to reconcile a series of cases.
You may be asked to do that directly. ("How would you distinguish
this case from the Roe decision?" )

Or, the professor may invent a hypothetical in which the facts fall
squarely between two cases that you have read and your task is to
analyze the boundaries of each case by predicting or arguing for the
outcome in the hypothetical. Sometimes these hypotheticals are
designed to point out the individual injustice that can result from
strict, formal rules. Sometimes they are designed to point out the lack
of predictability in very open-textured rules. Sometimes they are
simply designed to test your ability to apply the rules in a
straightforward fashion.

Whatever the variation on these questioning themes, don't be afraid
to pause and think before you respond. When you are thinking, be
sure you are thinking about the question, rather than trying to figure
out what the professor would view as the correct answer. Many
students preface their response with "I'm not sure if this is what you
are looking for, but..." If you truly do not understand the question,
you can ask for clarification. Rather than simply say "I don't
understand" indicate how it is you understand the question ("Did you
want the rationale Justice X goes through, or my own rationale"?)
Don't waste your time trying to figure out what the professor thinks
is the answer though. In the vast majority of cases, the professor
wants a well-reasoned, well-supported answer -- ANY well-reasoned,
well-supported answer.

The key to participating successfully in class is thinking as much as
possible about the assigned material before entering the classroom
and taking notes that allow you to efficiently and effectively recall and
extend your thinking when called upon. Whether you choose to
volunteer to answer questions or not, always choose to ask questions.
If you are confused about a subject, you are likely not alone. You will
quickly get a clear sense if you are the only one asking for
clarification.

For most students, participating in class is beneficial because it forces
them to pay closer attention, listen more attentively, and receive

                                       42
some feedback on their thinking. A few students, however, use the
opportunity to speak or ask questions in ways that interfere with
learning. You know that you are talking too much if your
contributions generally begin with "I knew this person who... "
"What would happen if..." Leave the story telling and hypothetical
construction to the professor in class, and share your stories with
your classmates or the professor outside of class.

Making and Using Class Notes

For most students, it takes a long time to learn how to take good
notes. Do not simply write down what the professor says. The
question and answer dialogue between the professor and class is
designed to open the way to deeper understanding (and further
questions). Listen carefully to the discussion; the comments of your
fellow students will often be important and worth writing down.

Many law students find it difficult to take concise, organized relevant
notes during class. Note taking is an important skill because it helps
you get the most out of class and gives you a critical resource in
preparing for exams. Use a note book with relatively fixed pages --
one for each class -- with space to include handouts. Wide margined
(legal ruled) paper is especially helpful for using a key and summary
method based on the Cornell Note Taking Method (Record, Reduce,
Recite, Reflect, Review).

Note Taking Skills, Problems and Solutions

What do you need in order to take good notes in class?

1. You must listen. Problems that can block listening are:

    a. Can't hear the teacher. Solution: move your seat or ask the
         professor to speak up.

    b. Can't understand the teacher's speech. Solution: tape the class
         and listen more slowly; share notes with others; ask the
         professor to enunciate.

    c. Become bored; daydream; fall asleep. Solution: maintain body
         posture of attentiveness -- sit up, look at the teacher, give
         non-verbal feedback to the teacher. Get enough sleep at

                                       43
         night. Write down five questions to which you want the
         answers and listen for the answers. Be sure to listen to your
         classmates and note their analysis, arguments and questions as
         well as the teachers.
2. You must think about what you hear. Problems involved that
    block thinking are:
    a. You are expecting "answers." Solution: listen critically --
         consider questions posed as equally important as answers
         given.

    b. What the teacher says is confusing. Solution: change your
         class preparation, do more background reading, be sure you
         understand the vocabulary being used, ask for further
         clarification after class.

3. You must be able to write. Problems here are:
    a. Can't read your notes. Solution: slow down, use a lap top
         computer.
    b. Can't write fast enough. Solution: ask teacher to repeat or
         slow down; use abbreviations; do more note preparation
         before class; consider that you may be trying to write too
         much.

4. You must be organized. Problems here are:

    a. Teacher is disorganized. Solutions: organize the materials
         before coming to class and fit the professor's analysis into
         your own organization; ask questions for connections that
         seem vague.

    b. Papers get disorganized. Solutions: use tabs, cross references,
         and relatively fixed page notebooks for notes. Be sure to
         number pages of notes or indicate dates on each page so if
         pages fall out, you can put them back in order.

    c. Can't see the organization. Solution: more class preparation --
         especially use of table of contents of text; professor's syllabus;
         or course outlines to provide a structure.

                                       44
Tips for Active Listening

1. Be prepared! Prepare good case briefs and notes for class with
    room for making comments and notes during class. Review your
    text readings and your notes just before going to class.

2. Concentrate on the ideas, not the delivery. Don't allow yourself
    to be distracted by mannerisms or delivery of the professor or of
    other students. Concentrate on the WHAT, not the HOW. Close
    your eyes now and then if you must (but don't fall asleep), or
    move your seat.

3. Listen with an open mind. Don't come to class with firm
    expectations of what the materials mean or how they will be
    approached.

4. Keep physically alert. Sit up straight. Look at the teacher. Sit in a
    spot in the classroom that keeps you alert and in the instructor's
    view.

5. Keep mentally alert. Talk. Listen critically. Keep trying to guess
    how the material might be tested (or used in law practice).

6. Use a listen-think-write process. Don't be a scrivener, trying to
    write down everything that is said. Train yourself to listen
    attentively to what is said, evaluate its relevance and importance,
    and the select what is important and write it in your own words.

7. Note the questions. Be especially careful to write down questions,
    hypotheticals, and theories noted by the professor and by other
    students. These are the seeds from which understanding (and
    exam questions) grow in your after class review.

8. Note your next steps: Write down any assignments noted.
    Compare to your syllabus and ask about discrepancies. Keep a list
    of questions you have so that, immediately after class, you can ask
    the instructor, do your research, or compare with your study
    partners.

9. If the instructor writes it, you should too. Even in today's
    technology-rich environment, most professors do not use many
    audio-visual devices in their teaching. Those that do, most

                                       45
    commonly use the chalk board. Never fail to copy anything the
    professor writes on the board, even drawings or symbols can give
    important insights into a formulation of a rule or method of
    analysis. For faculty who use overhead projectors or
    computerized presentations, the same rule applies, unless you
    find yourself mindlessly transcribing from wall to notes without
    thinking. Many professors now post or photocopy their
    computer presentation slides so that students can listen, think,
    and discuss during class without fear of losing important points.

10. Review your notes within twenty-four hours of class. Highlight
    key terms with colored pens or by summarizing key terms in the
    margins. This helps you retain what you are learning (we forget
    about 60% of what we learn within the first 24 hours if we do not
    review it).

The Relationship Between Classes and Exams

Students are understandably upset that the questions that they have
been asked in class all semester will not appear on the final exam in
most classes. As one commentator observed: "Most importantly, as
many authors report, it has become apparent on several levels that
professors do not test what they teach, as often during the first year
curriculum they "teach by the case method and actually test by the
problem method." Typically, first-year law students are greeted in the
first weeks of school with massive reading assignments of appellate
court opinions (the standard Case Method) followed by class periods
which engage in some form of Socratic dialogue regarding those
cases. At the end of the semester, although taught by the Case
Method system, typically they are presented with the standard three-
hour exam with loaded fact patterns providing complicated legal
problems for which they have received little or no explicit training."

Does this mean that attending class is worthless? On the contrary,
class attendance and participation can be excellent preparation for the
final exam. What this observation does mean, however, is that you
need to understand what it is that you are trying to get out of class.
You are trying to understand the rules of law in the cases -- not the
cases themselves-- and learn how you might use these rules. (Think

                                       46
"tools of law" not "rules of law" and you will be further ahead).
Organize your class notes and your thinking around these rules,
doctrines, elements, issues and arguments rather than around the
cases. Look for connections among the cases to discover further
doctrines, policies, exceptions and the like. Think of each case as a
sample exam question. The facts of the case are like the hypotheticals
you will receive on a final exam question. The rules developed in the
case are the rules you will be applying on a final exam. Critically
observe the court's "answer" to the "question." Beware: some
opinions would not earn high grades as exam answers.

While you can do all of this analysis in class without ever speaking a
word, I do encourage you - and urge you to encourage each other - to
actively participate. Participating in class forces you to listen more
closely, improving your comprehension. It is also crucial job training.
As a lawyer, you must frequently speak before other people and you
will always need to be able to listen to others. Now is the time to
develop and refine these skills. If you make mistakes now, only your
ego suffers; errors later may cost you clients, cases, or your job.

Thinking like a Lawyer -- Applying the Law to Facts

Much of what you are asked to do in class is present an analysis of
the law -- its application to new factual hypotheticals. Practice this
skill, particularly in writing, as often as possible. It is critical to your
success.

Identifying Issues

STEP ONE: Read the facts. This is the DESCRIPTIVE phase of
your analysis. Be sure you know your client's case (the facts of the
problem). Read closely and carefully. Draw inferences from the facts
(most matters of motivation, causation, or alternative choices are
inferential). Think about alternative inferences that can be drawn. Be
aware that vague, conflicting and incomplete facts are normal in the
real world. Identify your client's goals. Be sure you have asked the six
basic questions about the facts presented: What? Where? When?
How? Why? Who?

                                       47
STEP TWO: Next comes the critical questions for identifying issues:
So what? Survey your checklist of rules that might possibly apply to
resolving your client's problem consistent with his or her goals.
Brainstorm as to all possibly applicable rules... Don't eliminate
potential rules too quickly.

STEP THREE: Analyze how the applicable rules apply to your
client's facts. Identify those rules or aspects of rules that provide a
clear outcome or solution and note these briefly but do not spend
time engaging in extensive analysis of "givens." Identify those rule or
aspects that are, after analysis, irrelevant because they will not affect
the outcome significantly.

STEP FOUR: Identify those rules or aspects of rules that create
issues when applied to your client's facts. AN ISSUE IS
SOMETHING TO ARGUE ABOUT. Recall from case briefing that
there are three kinds of issues: "what are the facts", "what is the law?"
and "how does the law apply to these facts?" To find these issues,
look for gaps or conflicts in the law.

A. Sometimes more than one rule might apply. For example, in
    determining the specificity with which to require pleading a
    statutory action for securities fraud, does one apply rule 9 of the
    Federal Rules of Civil Procedure ("fraud must be pled with
    particularity") or only the general standards of rule 8 ("pleadings
    shall contain a short and plain statement of the case")?

B. Sometimes there may not be a rule. For example, there is no
    guidance in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure regarding
    whether a complaint must be typewritten. (There may be local
    rules on this, however.)

C. Sometimes the rule provides only general guidance. Many rules in
    the law are stated in general terms such as "reasonable" or
    "timely" -- interpretation of these terms is left to individual cases.

D. Sometimes there are conflicting judicial interpretations of the
    same rule.

STEP FIVE: Separate issues and sub-issues and organize them in a
logical progression. For example, you may determine that there are

                                       48
two main issues. The first question is which rule applies. Having
resolved that issue, however, you still may have an issue about how
one or the other of those rules applies to the facts.

STEP SIX: Create arguments about what the rule means and how it
should be applied to these facts.

    A. Purposive Interpretation vs. Formalist Interpretation

         1. Formalist: Define the term at issue without reference to
             context or purpose. Some sources for definition of a
             word include: grammatical arguments about the meaning
             in context; dictionaries ("plain meaning"); legal
             dictionaries; the statutes or rules; the legislative history of
             drafter's advisory notes; the use of the word in other rules
             or other areas of law. When the source of law is common
             law, a formalist interpretation of a case looks at the legally
             significant facts of the precedential cases and compares
             the client's facts to identify differences or similarities.

         2. Purposive: Conceive the purposes behind a rule and
             define your term in light of those purpose(s) (There are
             ordinarily several, often conflicting, purposes that one can
             conceive for any given rule). Some sources for deriving
             purposes include: the rule or statute; the legislative history
             (advisory committee notes); judicial statements of the
             purpose; or your own imagination.

    B. B. Broad Rule vs. Narrow Rule

         1. Narrow rule: If a rule, read the language of the rule to
             apply to as narrow a fact situation as possible (using one
             of the interpretation techniques in A), then argue that
             your facts fall outside that narrow interpretation. If a
             judicial precedent interprets the rule, read the
             interpretation of the rule as necessarily and narrowly
             connected to the facts of that precedent.

         2. Broad rule: If a rule, read the language of the rule to apply
             to as broad a fact situation as possible (using one of the
             interpretation techniques in A), then argue that your facts

                                       49
             fall squarely within that broad interpretation. If a judicial
             precedent interprets the rule, generalize each of the facts
             in the case as broadly or generally as possible.

STEP SEVEN: Create arguments about how the rule should be
applied in this case.

    A. Five Types of "Policy" Argument

         1. Arguments about judicial administration: Categorize the
             interpretation that you are advancing as one that is firm
             and predictable or flexible and open-ended. Then create
             arguments as to why the firm or the flexible rule is
             needed for the purposes of future application of the rule
             (often stated in terms of predictability or fairness)

         2. Arguments about institutional competence: Argue that
             the application or interpretation of the rule at issue is or is
             not best decided by a particular institution (e.g., courts,
             the legislature, the executive, etc.). A good example of
             this argument is Chief Justice Rehnquist's opinion in the
             Leatherman case. Courts are not competent institutions to
             create new categories of specificity requirements. That
             task is best left to the Congress because they have the
             greater (ability, legal or political authority, resources, etc.)
             to address this task. An equally powerful argument could
             have been made that courts are especially well suited to
             the task of interpreting the applicability of Rule 9. For
             example, courts see the cases that are most often brought
             for improper purposes, in vague general language, that
             have especially detrimental impacts merely by the filing of
             the complaint. Congress has allocated rule making
             authority to the courts (the Rules Enabling Act) thus
             recognizing this superior competence and authority.

         3. Moral arguments: These are the arguments we often make
             in everyday argument or in political discussions. Morality
             can encompass a broad variety of value-based judgments,
             whose sources can vary from religion, culture, history, etc.
             One example: Form v. Substance Making moral decisions

                                       50
    on the "formal" classification of the dispute (two
    "disputing parties") vs. Making moral decisions on the
    "substantive" relative social power of the "people"
    involved (a pro se, civil rights plaintiff and the
    government). For example, in Conley v. Gibson, the United
    States Supreme Court said that the pro se prisoner
    bringing the civil rights claim should not have his
    complaint dismissed unless it could not state a legally
    enforceable claim, regardless of the clarity or simplicity of
    the complaint.

    Morality as Form: Why should a pro se litigant be given a
    special rule regarding the interpretation of his or her
    complaint under rule 12(b)(6)? Pro se litigants can choose
    to have attorneys assist them (pro bono or contingent fee
    attorneys are available for those who cannot afford
    representation). If they choose to clog up the legal system
    by forgoing this representation, they should not be given
    any greater advantages than others.

    Morality as Substance: Why should a pro se litigant suing
    the government (who may view attorneys as part of the
    "system" and thus not trust them, even if they could
    afford them) be held to the same standards of pleading as
    those who have the benefit of expensive, well trained
    lawyers. Especially in actions against the government,
    individuals should have the right to address their
    grievances individually and not be foreclosed by strict
    procedural rules.

4. Deterrence or social utility arguments: These arguments
    are based on the effect of the rule on behavior.

5. Economic arguments: Phrase the argument for
    application of the rule in terms of a cost - benefit analysis
    (factoring in whatever you wish to characterize as a "cost"
    or a "benefit") and argue that the rule to be applied
    should be one that in its application over the course of
    time should mirror the same decisions that individuals or

                              51
institutions would make were they to engage in this
analysis. If you find this listing of forms of argumentation
useful to your understanding of law, you may want to
read Richard Michael Fischl & Jeremy Paul, GETTING TO
MAYBE: HOW TO EXCEL ON LAW SCHOOL EXAMS
(Carolina Academic Press, 1999).

Chapter Four: After Class

Review

After class review is perhaps the most important, and often
overlooked, aspect of study. If you take time to synthesize each day's
material with the rest of the course, you will have a much easier time
studying for finals. Immediately after class, most faculty members
remain in the classroom to continue discussions begun during the
class hour, to hear where students are confused so they can clarify the
next day, and to answer questions on side issues. It is an extra
opportunity for you to get to know the professor informally, and
often sparks interesting debates. Join in (especially those of you who
are initially reluctant to talk in class). In the hours and days after class
you should try to synthesize the material, and put it all into
perspective with what was previously studied. Go over your class
notes, try to fill in gaps or clarify issues by talking with classmates and
continuing debates or discussions.

Why review?

Information learned can be recalled most effectively 10 minutes after
that learning has stopped. After this, information is lost rapidly, so
that after a few months only a tiny percentage can be recalled. By
spending a few minutes reviewing material after the learning session,
you can quickly refresh your memory, and significantly reduce the
time needed to relearn the knowledge when you need it, ensure that
you have a reasonable basis of knowledge all the time, and allow you
to improve the quality of future learning, by building on a well-
remembered foundation. This allows you to make connections that
you would not otherwise make.

The aim of frequently reviewing information is to end up storing it in
memory for the long term.

     Review immediately after class: This can take the form of re-
         reading or re-writing your notes

                                       53
     Review after one day - take a few minutes to jot down
         everything remembered and compare this with your notes.

     Review each week to synthesize the materials

     Review at the end of each section to outline the materials

By reviewing frequently, information should be fresh in your mind,
should be clearly structured, and easily accessible when you need it.

Group Study

Study groups are invaluable learning experiences and support
systems. The structured study group program in particular can help
you learn efficient and effective techniques for mastering law school
study. There are many useful activities a study group can pursue -- for
example, sharing case briefs, reviewing class notes, or preparing
group outlines -- however, group problem solving is perhaps the
most useful activity.

Group problem solving is an activity that provides a practical element
to the study of law. Oftentimes, lawyers use other lawyers as aides in
solving many legal problems. In fact, it is rare that any one lawyer has
the ability or resources to address all the legal issues in any given case.
Therefore, the strategy of group problem solving attempts to emulate
the legal environment by allowing students to bounce issues, ideas
and solutions with other students in an organized fashion.

The main objective in group problem solving is communication
between the students. It is essential that all students, as would all
lawyers, communicate their ideas to each other, no matter how trivial.
Even the "silliest" of ideas can sometimes contribute to, at a
minimum, the outer limits of a problem. Another goal is to use all of
the information uncovered to arrive at a group answer. The group
answer should consist of a synthesis of "possible answers" derived
from the session and reflect a solution that most plausibly meets the
objective. Included in the group answer should also be reasons why
other arguments were not chosen. This is an important step, since it
is by revealing what is not the "right answer" that we can more
readily see what is the right answer.

                                       54
Procedure

    1. Someone introduces a specific problem or issue. It may come
         from class discussion, the students' textbook, or a self-made
         hypothetical. Problems that deal with multiple issues are ideal
         since your group can then work together to synthesize the
         many concepts that you have learned.

    2. Appoint a scrivener to write down all of the ideas and
         solutions, and a leader to help keep everyone participating
         and focused.

    3. Start the group problem solving session by identifying
         possible issues relating to the particular problem that you are
         trying to solve. Before any solutions are discussed, make sure
         everyone has the problem and sees the issues.

    4. After you have identified the issues (or problems) begin
         formulating possible answers/arguments/analysis and
         allowing the scrivener to record them in an organized manner
         on a sheet of paper.

    5. Use the resources available to you -- your text and class notes,
         supplementary material, your professor -- to develop your
         analysis as completely as possible and to resolve
         disagreements.

    6. Organize and summarize what you have learned. Predict how
         and when it might be tested.

Supplementary Resources

Your after-class efforts to clarify questions and increase the level of
understanding may often lead to outside reading. Most students find,
at some point during law school, that some supplemental resources
are helpful in studying for a particular course. Your text books often
cite relevant supplemental materials following the cases. Some of
these citations are to law review articles or additional cases on the
course topics. Others are drawn from the treatises (hornbooks)
described below. Additionally, your intellectual curiosity may lead you

                                       55
to consult the Index to Legal Periodicals for additional articles on the
class subject matter.

Hornbooks (single or multiple-volume treatises on areas of law) are
the best overall resources for reference and study for your law school
classes. Ask your professor for suggestions as to which treatises are
the most useful for the subject matter that you are studying.

Besides these scholarly resources, you will quickly discover an
abundance of commercial study aids (in hard copy or on the web)
intended to make digestion of "the law" as fast, painless, and easy as
possible. Though these resources may be useful in "checking up" on
understanding gained through your original analysis, or for pre-exam
review, or merely for a "security blanket", reliance on these materials
is dangerous.

First, the materials necessarily provide only a superficial view of legal
concepts. Many of the "course outline" resources, such as Legalines
or Casenotes legal Briefs, are written by publishing company
employees: neither practicing attorneys nor scholars.

Second, it is far too easy to fall into relying on these materials to do
your analysis for you -- superficial, often misleading, analysis at that --
when the entire purpose of your studies is to develop these analytical
skills for yourself. In the short term, empirical studies have
demonstrated that reliance on these commercial study aids is
associated with decreased performance on law school examinations,
while use of scholarly treatises as study references is associated with
increased performance. So if you hear upper-level students gloating
that they relied on a study aid to pass a course, that may be true;
chances are, however, they would have done even better by doing the
coursework (and of course you simply won't hear any gloating by
those who relied on study aids and didn't pass).

Finally, in the long term, relying on "canned analysis" is a bad habit
to develop for your future practice. As an attorney, you will be
generating your own, creative analysis based on the original sources
as well as evaluating the analysis provided by your opponents, or by
journal articles on the subject matter of your cases. You will need to
have firmly established by that time the habits of thorough analysis,

                                       56
and, equally importantly, confidence in your analysis. You won't have
time to develop those habits then: your clients and society will pay
for your incompetence or vacillation -- and eventually you will lose
clients, lawsuits, or your license to practice law.
That is not to say that commercial study guides do not have a role in
successful study. Reliable, commercial study guides can be used as a
source for comparative organization, as a "check" on your own study,
even as a background resource to help you understand areas that you
are struggling with (as long as you have really struggled first). The key
here is to select reliable study guides. Check the author. If the study
guide was written by your casebook author or a law professor, you
can have greater confidence than if written by a publishing company
employee or law student contractor. Be especially wary of the
outlines available on the internet. Would you take advice from a
complete stranger on the street about how to succeed in law school?
Why would the fact that the advice comes in electronic form lead you
to give it greater credence?

                                       57
Chapter Five: Outlining
and Exam Preparation

Whether writing an examination answer, counseling a client, or
presenting an argument to a judge or jury, an attorney's first goal is to
communicate effectively. The key to effective communication is
preparation. What should you prepare? Regardless of the setting,
effective communication requires that you know your goals, know
your subject, and know your audience.

Knowing your goals

Your goal on most law school exams is to demonstrate your ability to
use the law in analyzing hypothetical problems. The New York Bar
Exam directions for essay answers are instructive in understanding
what a good answer should include:
An answer should demonstrate your ability to analyze the facts
presented by the question, to select the material from the immaterial
facts, and to discern the points upon which the case turns. It should
show your knowledge and understanding of the pertinent principles
and theories of law, their relationship to each other, and their
qualifications and limitations. It should evidence your ability to apply
the law to the facts given and to reason logically in a lawyer-like
manner to a sound conclusion from the premises adopted. Try to
demonstrate your proficiency in using and applying legal principles
rather than mere memory of them.
An answer containing only a statement of your conclusions will
receive little credit. State fully the reasons that support them. All
points should be thoroughly discussed. Although your answer should
be complete, you should not volunteer information or discuss legal
doctrines that are not necessary or pertinent to the solution of the
problem.

                                       58
You can see, then, that your goal on a law school exam is to
demonstrate a variety of skills, only one of which is knowledge of the
legal rules.

Knowing your subject

Given that demonstrating your skill is as important as demonstrating
knowledge, part of your subject includes those legal skills. How do
you learn those skills? By daily class preparation and class attendance,
in which you regard each case not as a subject to be "learned", but as
an exercise in problem solving with at least one suggested solution
included.

But class is not the only place in which to hone your analytical skills.
Practice analyzing hypotheticals with your study partners: invent
hypotheticals and then test them out on one another. More
importantly, practice writing out your analysis. Where can you find
hypotheticals on which to practice?

Use the old exams on file in the library, look through your casebook
for hypotheticals in the notes following cases, some commercial
study guides provide hypotheticals with suggested answers, the
restatements have illustrations following most principles that you can
analyze for yourself, there are exams available on line, or you can ask
your professor for guidance.

A second important aspect to knowing your subject is, of course,
knowing the law. You must know the black-letter law that is covered
in your courses. This means knowing the rules, the elements of these
rules, the variations in the rules, and the policies underlying those
rules. Part of your task throughout the semester is to study and learn
this "law". You should know the rules thoroughly by semester's end.
Making and reviewing flash cards is a tried-and-true method of
memorized learning that may be useful in your studying.

Besides studying the course materials and your notes from class, you
can get further help in learning the rules through (in order of
reliability....) hornbooks, the restatements of the law, commercial
study guides, outlines from other students and many other sources.
Increasingly, you can access an entire library of student outlines on

                                       59
line (though you have little perspective on their reliability). Your
professor would be happy to suggest additional reading for course
subjects.

If your school is a member of CALI, you can use computer assisted
legal instruction programs to help you learn the law. These lessons
are written by law professors, reviewed by an editorial board of
experts, and keyed to the subject matter of your courses. Because
they are interactive, they can provide important feedback and extend
your learning. Additionally, you must synthesize these legal rules &
policies into a comprehensive whole. During class we break down the
cases, discuss possible interpretations and policies explaining the
results, and project the scope of those interpretations and policies.
We spend very little time on review. Yet review and synthesis is
essential if your understanding is to move beyond the level of your
day-to-day reading of discrete cases.

The best way to bring the class into a whole is to outline. And the
most important thing to remember about outlines is that preparing an
outline is just as important as having an outline. How do you go about
outlining? It depends on how you learn best. Some people need to
force their thoughts into a rigid organization (IA1a outlines); others
need a visual outline (charts); still others need to write and re-write
(essay outlines). It doesn't matter whether you type a grammatically
correct, perfectly structured traditional outline or whether you make a
massive multi-colored poster on your study wall. What matters is that
you force the materials into some structure, so that you understand
the elements of the law, the policies and theories necessary to identify
facts relevant to those elements, and the relationship between areas
of the law. Your focus should be on these elements, policies and
relationships, rather than on the cases you have studied as examples.

The third aspect to knowing your subject is structuring your
knowledge into a useable form. Now you may think that the outline
serves that purpose. However, outlining is for the purpose of
achieving a complete understanding. A review outline is rarely useful
in preparing to use that knowledge. Rather, you need to take the
additional step of condensing your outline into a list of the issues that
you will be looking for in a hypothetical.

                                       60
Once you have thoroughly and comprehensively reviewed your
subject through some process of outlining, go back and make a
"checklist": an outline of the outline. Try to limit this checklist to one
page, containing only the major categories of the course (e.g., in
property: ways of acquiring property, estates, etc.; in torts: battery,
assault, negligence, etc.) and the elements of each of those categories.
This "checklist" is a failsafe mechanism of sorts. It insures that you
haven't overlooked crucial areas of the law that might present issues
in a fact situation. If the exam is open-book, you want this checklist
on the top of your outline or inside cover of your book. If the exam
is closed book, you want to memorize the checklist, perhaps through
some mnemonic devices. Be sure to "test drive" your checklist:
project the type of exam and the subject matter that you expect for
each class (you may be able to rely on past exams for the course) and
practice using your checklist in writing a time-pressured answer to
that exam. Review the results with your colleagues and with the
professor. Revise your outline and checklist appropriately.

Knowing your audience

Each professor may stress one aspect of the law or one approach to
legal analysis more than others. You should know that professors
differ in their use of the classroom: some professors emphasize your
ability to analyze a case to determine how and why a new legal rule
was developed; others (using the same materials) will focus on the
application of that rule to fact situations. Very often, the professor's
approach to class will give you some clue to his or her likely approach
to the exam as well. However, you should not rely on the professor's
class approach to project how they are likely to test. You need to also
practice taking exams used by that professor in the past. Another
aspect to knowing the professor's preferences is reading the
instructions on the exam. At least two or three people every year
receive substantially lower grades than they might have, simply
because they did not read and pay attention to instructions. Finally,
ask the professor and your fellow upper-class students what skills,
subjects or approaches to emphasize in a particular course's exam.

Chapter Six: Taking an

Exam

The day has arrived. Your final exam sits on the desk in front of you.
What do you do with it?

Remember your goals

The primary tasks in writing an exam answer are:

Analysis. Analysis includes spotting issues and creating arguments,
alternatives and applications of the law to those issues. For many
examinations, issue spotting constitutes the most important aspect of
the test. You must be able to efficiently and accurately identify as
many issues as time permits. Just as in identifying issues in preparing
a case brief, spotting issues on an exam requires understanding what
an issue is and knowing the course materials well enough to
recognize the issues in a fact pattern. Some students readily identify
issues of law, requiring a choice between different rules or different
interpretations of a rule, but miss the issues requiring application of
the rule to the facts.

Some students do poorly on examinations because they are too
"bottom line" oriented. They will ignore possible issues because they
simply identify what they see as the "most important" issue. Or they
will see areas of conflict (issues) but perceive that one or the other
side has a much stronger position and so will simply conclude that
the issue is not worth extended discussion. Be sure to ask yourself,
"but if that's doesn't resolve the issue, the next argument/issue is..."

Knowledge and Understanding. You must be able to demonstrate that you
know not just the rule, but why it applies to the specific facts before
you. This means that you must be able to work with the relationship
between legal rules. For example, many hypotheticals ask about
wrongs that can be characterized a number of different ways --
murder & manslaughter, for example. With these questions you
should be able to demonstrate your understanding that the facts

                                       62
present a number of possible "causes of action", using an
organizational technique that demonstrates your understanding of the
relationship between these wrongs (e.g., "at least -- at most" or "first
claim -- fallback). Where several causes of action have an element in
common, (intent, for example) deal with that element only once and
simply refer back to that initial analysis for each subsequent claim
(Note: use this internal reference only within a single
question/hypothetical -- do not refer back to prior questions because
many professors grade each question separately).

Applying the law to the facts. Students need to apply the rule(s) to as
many of the facts as are legally relevant (which, on most exams, is just
about all of them). Some common errors in fact application include:
failure to use the facts (mere statements of the law are not enough);
restatement of the facts (repeating the facts without drawing
inferences from them in legal terms is not using the facts); mere
juxtaposition of the facts without explaining analysis. Probably the
most common error is making statements of conclusions only. Point
out even painfully obvious steps in your analysis. It is equally
important to make legal principles clear. Be sure to define all legal
terms and list all elements of a claim. Do not assume that your reader
will know either what A or B is or how you got from A to B. Be
explicit, complete and clear.

Exam-taking techniques

Come prepared. Being prepared means, first, academic preparation. You
need well-organized materials that reflect mastery of the subject, clear
expectations of what is expected of you and a checklist of
issues/subjects to look for on the exam. Beyond this obvious
preparation, however, you need to be physically prepared. Be well
rested. Cramming the night before the exam can never give you the
edge that a clear, well-rested mind can. Have supplies in hand:
enough pens, pencils, clock or watch, food, exam number, etc. Be
sure to bring your textbooks, class notes and outline if the exam is
open book. (Although you should never expect you will have time to
use them). Finally, prepare yourself psychologically. Focus on the
now. Try to focus on this exam only without thinking about how you

                                       63
have performed in any other test-taking situation. Focus on you. Do
not worry about how friends and other students are doing. Wear
blinders and earplugs if need be. Be confident. Assume that you will
do well and do not worry about the negative consequences of failure.

When you begin the exam, read the instructions on the exam
carefully. Note how many questions there are and how much time
you should allot to each one. STICK TO THAT SCHEDULE! Keep
in mind that in a 20 point question, the first 5 points are a lot easier
to get than the last 5. An extra 5 minutes spent on a question may not
pay off, while unanswered questions will most certainly receive zero
points.

Next, read the question. On your first read: read the question quickly,
to identify: Who are the parties? What kind of question is this?
(Analyze, argue, identify -- open ended or guided). Read the call of
the question carefully. Read the exam a second time to extract the
pertinent facts (some professors include only relevant facts, others
include many irrelevancies to test your discernment) as you read each
fact, ask yourself: "does this fact raise a legal issue?" Some facts will
be relevant to several legal issues.

Identify the relevant law. Jot down the claims and defenses that will be
made for each party. If the exam is open-book, simply rip out the
relevant pages from your outline and note "A v. B" or "first sale" on
the top to indicate which general facts apply. Refresh your memory
of the elements of each cause of action (mentally or on your outline).

Read through the exam question one more time carefully. By color,
number or brief note, indicate the legal relevance of each fact to the
outline of issues you have constructed. Be sure to keep one eye on
the clock. Relax and breathe deeply, because this step is the most
important and you need a clear mind. You are not writing an answer
here, only identifying the material that will go into your answer.

Organize and write your answer. Decide upon the logical relationships
between the controversies and block out the controversies to deal
with one at a time (you can organize according to parties -- A v. B, B
v. C, C v. A -- or according to transactions -- first offer, written
response, second offer. Use an organization scheme that identifies

                                       64
the issue or controversy or position that you will focus on and then
identifies that portion of the law relevant to that issue. Next analyze,
argue, and generate alternatives for that rule's application to the facts
creating the issue. Finally, draw a conclusion. This is sometimes
called the IRAC (issue-rule-application-conclusion) formula, but it is
really simply good organization and logical development of an
argument. The key here is the "A" part -- providing lots of logical
analysis and reasoning and "but if" "even so" "on the other hand"
arguments. As one law school teacher has noted; "Analysis is key -
give an A; get an A." Each paragraph of your answer should serve a
purpose. Most answers should look like this:

A would argue that B's actions constituted (claim). (claim) is
(defined). In order to prove (claim), A must show that (elements).

The first issue, then, is whether (element 1) exists. (Element 1)
requires proof that (explanation of element 1). A would argue that
(fact 1) is (element 1) because (explanation of reasoning). Another
fact indicating that (element 1) is (fact 2) because (explanation of
reasoning). B would counter that (facts 1 and 2) are irrelevant
because (alternative analysis of element 1's requirements). Also B
would argue that even if (element 1 is as A says), (facts 1 and 2) do
not prove that element because (explanation of alternative inferences
from facts). Finally, B would argue that applying (element 1) as
suggested by A would undermine the purpose of (claim or element).
That purpose is (policy or goal of law). By accepting A's analysis
(explanation of reasoning of why policy wouldn't be served). Because
(what you consider to be the most important factor in the analysis of
this issue), (party) will likely prevail of this issue.

The second element that must be proved is... etc.

As you complete each section of the answer, quickly review the
question to see if you left out any important facts, and review your
outline to see if you covered all the legal elements. Does your answer
make sense? Does it answer the question asked? Finally, proofread.
Always leave at least two minutes. Proofread the last part of your
answer first.

                                       65
What do you do if you get stuck? First, RELAX! Do not let difficult
questions or time pressure shake your confidence -- tell yourself "If
this question is difficult for me, it is going to be difficult for everyone
else." Take a deep breath, sigh, think a happy thought and smile, roll
your shoulders and relax your jaw, say a little prayer, and dig back
into your analysis. If you're not sure what's going on in the problem,
try...

     Reading again, more carefully.
     Using a different part of the brain. Drawing a picture or

         diagram is often a good way to get going.
     Using some common sense. Try anything that makes sense to

         you. On occasion, professors may ask a question to test your
         general problem solving/ common sense solutions. Any
         analysis is generally better than a blank sheet of paper
     Rests (briefly--1-2 minutes) after you've been trying a while.
         Get up and stretch. Then try again.

Some General Tips

    1. Use labels to organize your discussion. This can also help you
         double-check to make sure you've covered everything. For
         the same reason, you may want to underline key elements.

    2. Unless you are told otherwise, write on only one side of the
         paper, reserving the left-hand side for issues or arguments
         that you think of later.

    3. Watch your language use. Although no professor expects
         perfect writing on an exam, you should be careful to avoid
         slang terms and colloquialisms as well as unnecessary lawyer
         jargon. In particular, avoid too many abstractions - use
         concrete, specific language.

                                       66
4. Avoid the interrogative trap - rhetorical questions that tend to
    be conclusory are dangerous on an exam. They often pose
    questions which introduce extraneous issues and invite
    unwanted responses from the reader. They never substitute
    for analysis -- which is how they are often used.

5. Avoid excessive abbreviation - define all abbreviations use,
    don't overuse.

6. Think before you write. Don't continue to write when you're
    befuddled. Stop, breathe, think, write.

7. Don't be funny. Don't try. Ever. Others will give you
    contrary advice. They are better wits and prefer more risk
    than I do.

8. Be legible. If your handwriting is poor, at least write large and
    in ink. Better yet, print or type.

9. Allocate your time.

                                  67
Chapter Seven: The Next

Semester

It's a brand new semester. Your grades are in. You are devastated,
exhilarated, relieved, puzzled, or angry... or maybe all of these
feelings and more. How do you continue to improve your
performance in law school each semester? Few students take
advantage of the awesome power of reflection on the past as a
learning tool.

Of course, immediately after a semester's exams, you are best to
simply try to forget the entire experience. The costs in anxiety,
competition, and lost confidence from post-exam comparisons with
others are rarely worth the gains. However, after the exams are
graded, be sure to continue to learn from the process. Students often
neglect to use this outstanding tool for improving their exam
performance -- a review of their prior semester's work and exam
performance.

Reviewing your past semester's learning

Look back over your past semester's work and inventory your
learning. Don't automatically assume that your grades tell you what
you've learned (they are a clue, but there's many a person who has
gotten a bad grade on an exam in a subject they learned well and
others who have gotten good grades on subjects they have retained
only long enough to get the grade). Since one of your purposes in law
school is to acquire the skills and knowledge necessary for a
successful lifetime of lawyering, stop and reflect on what you have
learned. Consider your past semester's study approaches in light of
that reflection. Some questions to consider:

     Which subject matter do you feel you have retained the best?
         What factors contributed to that retention? Did you study
         harder, longer? Were you more interested in the subject
         matter? Were the learning materials you used different or
         better for that subject? How can you take those learning

                                       68
         advantages for that subject and apply them to this semester's
         study?

     How did you capitalize on your learning style strengths when
         studying for a subject? Do you want to reconsider some
         approaches (e.g., listening to taped lectures was a waste,
         typing all my notes really nailed the subject for me)?

     How about your study schedule? If you "burned out" at some
         point during last semester, when and why? Can you plan your
         semester to avoid (or at least accommodate) that need to
         catch your breath?

     How did you outline? Be sure to save your outlines so that
         you can compare them to your final exams and see what you
         had and what you didn't.

     Overall, how much time did you spend preparing for classes,
         in post exam review, in preparing for the final exam? Do you
         think it would be productive to reallocate some of that time
         this semester?

     Did you at any time study with anyone else? Will you
         reconsider that arrangement this semester or do you want to
         replicate it?

     Look forward to this semester's courses. How do they look as
         though they will be the same as last semester's classes (e.g.,
         code courses require the same kind of close reading and
         "book juggling" regardless of the subject matter; courses with
         lots of history or theory as emphasis require another kind of
         attention)? Compare classes and make decisions about
         approaches to studying each of this semester's classes.

Reviewing your past semester's grades

Now, consider your exam performance. Get a copy of your final
exam, if permitted, and read over the questions and your answer
carefully. If the professor has a grading rubric or answer key for the
exam, you should ask if you can review that as well. To the extent
you can, answer these questions about your exam answer:

                                       69
 What was your goal for the exam? Were you satisfied with
    your results?

 Did you spot all the issues? What types did you miss? (For
    example, are there issues that you saw, but considered
    unnecessary or superfluous because other issues "answered
    the question"?) For issues that you simply didn't see, why do
    you think you didn't see them (didn't read facts carefully
    enough? didn't understand the issue? didn't remember the
    issue?)

 Did you waste time? Look for places where you wrote a lot,
    but earned no points because you were restating facts;
    copying excessive quotes; reciting history, background or
    general policies of the law -- apart from using this to analyze
    an issue.

 Did you answer the question asked?

 Did you accurately state the law?

 Did you read the facts accurately?

 Did you make unwarranted assumptions?

 Did you organize your answer well?

 Did you analyze the application of the rule to the facts
    thoroughly?

 Did you analyze both sides of the issue?

 Did you complete the exam? Did you manage your time?

 Where did you miss most of your points? If you missed issues
    or stated the law inaccurately, was this because the material
    was inaccurate or omitted from your notes or because you
    had not sufficiently reviewed? (compare your exam with your
    outline and study materials) If you missed analysis, was this
    because you ran out of time, didn't see the need for the
    analysis, or didn't understand the material well enough to
    provide the analysis?

                                  70
     What is your goal for the next exam?

Meeting with your professor

Make an appointment with all of your professors to talk about your
exam performance (regardless of your grades). Prepare yourself for
this meeting to get the most out of it. First, prepare your attitude.
This is your opportunity to get some very specific feedback on your
exam performance. You should approach this meeting with an
attitude of detached curiosity. Think of yourself as an anthropologist,
trying to understand some curious native ritual. This is NOT an
opportunity to try to get your grade changed (it won't happen and if
it does it won't be because you tried to make it happen). Nor is this a
time to apologize for or defend your performance - the professor is
not judging you as a person based on your exam. Professors know all
too well that an exam is one brief period of time. They know people
have good days and bad. They will not suddenly consider you brilliant
or brainless depending on the grade that you got on the exam.

Second, decide what you need to learn. What kinds of questions
might you ask that will help you improve your exam performance in
the future? If the professor does not have a grading rubric nor has
any written clues as to where you did well and where you did poorly,
you will need to start by simply going through the exam and having
the professor highlight the exam's hits and misses. If you have a
pretty good idea from having reviewed the exam and any grading
feedback the professor provided, you may still have questions about
what more you could have done. If your preliminary review doesn't
tell you what issues or analysis you missed, ask about the kinds of
arguments that you could have made but didn't. Ask the professor to
point out any areas where you wasted your time on the exam. If you
are concerned that your writing or organization of an answer could
be improved, try doing that. Re-write one question and ask the
professor whether you have improved it. Be sure to let the professor
know that you are not doing this to try to secure a grade change!

                                       71
Meet with your colleagues

Perhaps one of the most powerful ways to learn from your past exam
performance is to compare your exam answers with others. If you
were disappointed in your exam performance, ask a colleague who
did well whether you can compare your answer with theirs (assuming
the professor allows this use of past exams). If you did well, be open
to sharing your answer with your peers.

Plan your new semester

Don't assume that the learning tasks that you were presented with in
the prior semester will be the same each semester. Each professor is
different and each semester of law school presents new challenges.
With each semester your professors are likely to expect your skills of
judgment and precision to increase. A first semester exam might
score very well by generating numerous arguments on either side of
an issue - no matter how unlikely or impractical those arguments
might be in practice. The same answer to the same question in an
advanced course in your third year will be unlikely to be as successful.
Your workloads will often increase each semester as well. Professors
will assume more prior knowledge that you may or may not actually
have. They will assume greater skill in reading and analyzing the law.
They will have new skills and knowledge that may require new
approaches to study. Even if the classes do not change one iota from
the first semester, your own schedules will fill more - with the social
life of the law school, with job searches or work, with bar
preparation, with extracurricular learning activities, etc. Take these
new and additional demands into account as you consider your study
methods.

If you feel like you've failed

The experience of failure (real or perceived) is one that requires some
separate attention. You may be feeling ashamed and hurt that your
grades were not what you wanted. If your grades have placed you in
academic jeopardy, you are likely feeling fearful or hopeless. Needless
to say, these emotions will provide sufficient distraction to your
learning that you must find a way to move past the last semester and

                                       72
turn the experience in your favor. Here are a few thoughts to help
you with that process.

First, remember that all is not lost. Some students take longer to
"catch on" than others. It is not uncommon for a student's first
semester to be their worst semester in law school. Have confidence
that you can improve. Think of it this way. The law school has little
incentive to retain students who will not be able to graduate and pass
the bar examination. A faculty has a choice about the grade point at
which it dismisses students and the number of semesters they will
allow students to remedy deficient grades. If we did not believe that a
student could raise their grades after falling below the required grade
point, we would not give you that extra time. We would simply
dismiss you and admit a transfer student to take your place. Our
experience tells us that students can and do recover from a bad
semester's grades. Some of us had a bad semester's grades.

Second, you don't have to change much to get ahead. Don't presume
that your grades have accurately predicted your ability. Maybe you
just had crummy luck this time. Maybe you had crummy teachers.
Very likely, you just missed one piece of the puzzle that may be
obvious to you when you take the time to look through your exams
and work with your professors to find the problem. Often the
difference between a C- and a B is really quite small. Sometimes all
you have to do is learn to argue the other side of every issue and
BINGO! You're in the game! For first semester students, a number
simply didn't "get it" until they experienced exams. You might be
one of those. Now that you know what you are preparing for because
you've experienced it, you are in a position to better assess what
works and what doesn't in your study habits. It's not uncommon, for
example, for students to spend all semester thinking about the "big
picture" of doctrines - what is intent? Why does the law favor
predictability in this area? Etc. - and fail to memorize and master the
details of the black-letter law. Sometimes students are so focused on
the details (the individual cases they've read) that they don't pull back
and learn the generalized doctrine. Well, you need the big picture and
you need the cases, but you need the law too. On the other hand,
sometimes students become so intent on memorizing the black-letter

                                       73
law that they don't look for the grey areas and learn to make
arguments in the grey areas. Exams in which all you do is recite the
law are not passing exams (or just barely pass). So it may be some
really basic part of the law school exam picture that you've simply
missed to this point. Look for it. It's there. Once you find it, you're
back in the game. Perhaps you had something happen in one or more
exams that could explain your performance. Exam anxiety hit? Go to
the counseling center and get tested and learn how to deal with this
common but significant cause of poor grades.
Sometimes you've simply had a bad semester for non-academic
reasons and you haven't really taken stock of the other pressures that
are getting in your way. Maybe you are quite ambivalent about law
school - it's what your family wants for you, but you really aren't sure
it's what you want. (That doesn't mean you need to know what you
want to do with the degree, but you do have to want to degree itself!)
Address your issues outside of law school and you're back in the
game!
Third, get some help. I don't know any student who has ever
successfully completed law school alone. Get some effective study
help through the academic support program and by finding effective
study partners. If you suspect the study partners or social circle that
you've been relying on up until now is part of the problem, move on.
Of equal importance is getting some help with your confidence and
motivation. That might require a couple of visits to the counseling
center. No shame here - half of the clientele of any University's
counseling center is likely to be law students (the other half is med
students). Enlist all the cheerleaders in your life. Revisit your prior
successes. They weren't flukes. This experience of academic failure
was the fluke. Get some help to get past it, and you will once again
experience success.

1 Abraham Harold Maslow (1908-1970) was an American humanistic
psychologist who developed a theory of motivation. The need hierarchy is
a central premise of that theory. His writings include: TOWARD A
PSYCHOLOGY OF BEING (1962) and FARTHER REACHES OF
HUMAN NATURE (1971). They are arranged in terms of the priority of
our needs (i.e., you can't effectively fulfill your need for knowledge if you
are hungry).

Harper & Row.

3 This case could appear in a basic torts casebook, a products liability text,
or even in a contracts or civil procedure text. How you would read the
case would depend on the course and topic for which you are studying the
case. We will presume here that you are studying this case in a basic torts
class, as part of your study of negligence.

4 This case is from the New York Court of Appeals. In almost every other
state, a "court of appeals" is an intermediate court of appeal, with the
highest court being the supreme court. In New York, the Court of
Appeals is the highest court in the state. These are the little tidbits about
legal systems you pick up along the way in law school.

5 Notice that this is a very old case. There are several reasons you may be
reading a case from two centuries ago. One is that the case may represent
a historically significant perspective: either as a representative of how the
law used to be or as a representative of how the current law came to be. A
second reason for very old cases to appear in your casebook is that old
cases may still be very good law, especially in an area of law that may not
have changed much over time (for example, notice the year of the cases
cited in Conti v. ASPCA).

6 Be curious. Did you know that Ch. J. stands for Chief Justice?

7 Even words that you think you know the meaning of may have very
distinct legal meanings. Look them up.

8 Sometimes you might want to look up information about the facts in a
case. If you don't know what belladonna is or how it might have been
used, this might be useful to your understanding of the case.

9 This is a very complicated transaction. You will be able to understand it
much better if you find a way to translate it into a series of clear steps that
you can restate without reference to the case.

                                       75
10 Procedural facts are often hard to master at first. You must be able to
not only define nonsuit, but understand how these procedural facts affect
the way this case was decided.

11 This is a key term. Be sure you have looked it up and worked to
understand it.

12 Often your casebook cases will be heavily edited versions of the actual
case. If the case doesn't make any sense to you, sometimes reading the
original full-length version can help. Beware, however, often what is cut
from the case can be distracting issues your professor does not want you
to consider for the purposes of the course in which you reading this case.

13 Is this a disagreement about what the law provides or how it should
apply to this case? This is always an essential question in any case.

14 This is slow-going. You will need to translate this into modern English
before you can begin to understand it. This is an instance where working
with another person can help. Avoid the temptation to simply give up and
read a third-party description of the case (such as a commercial study
guide or online case briefing service). Part of the skill you are learning is
the ability to translate this kind of arcane language.

15 Stop here and try to state the law as it existed before this case. When, if
ever, would a remote seller be liable to a consumer for a defective
product? Why was this the rule? Notice that you may have to come up
with those reasons yourself rather than find them in the opinion.

16 What is the "difference" that makes the difference here? Review the
prior examples. Do they seem so clearly different to you?

17 Another vocabulary word!

18 Notice that would be under the criminal law. If you are studying torts, it
is not important that you know what the law of manslaughter is. What is
important is that you understand how the court draws by analogy to the
criminal law in its reasoning.

19 Isn't that true in many cases? Rarely does a manufacturer sell directly to
a consumer. How important is this factor to the court's outcome?

20 Here is a good example of reasoning that you don't want to mimic in
your own legal writing. Rhetorical questions are rarely excellent methods
for convincing a skeptical audience.

                                       76
21 Here is a perfect example to practice your ability to draw express
analogies. How is a gun and a horse like a bottle of drugs.
22 As you are trying to draw the holding out of this case remember the
categories of IF X THEN Y, IF ..., EVEN THOUGH... AT LEAST SO
LONG AS.... Which of these categories does this paragraph seem to be
filling in?
