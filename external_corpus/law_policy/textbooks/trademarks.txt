                         SUBCHAPTER I--THE PRINCIPAL REGISTER

§1051. Application for registration; verification

(a) Application for use of trademark
   (1) The owner of a trademark used in commerce may request registration of its trademark on the

principal register hereby established by paying the prescribed fee and filing in the Patent and
Trademark Office an application and a verified statement, in such form as may be prescribed by the
Director, and such number of specimens or facsimiles of the mark as used as may be required by the
Director.

   (2) The application shall include specification of the applicant's domicile and citizenship, the date
of the applicant's first use of the mark, the date of the applicant's first use of the mark in commerce,
the goods in connection with which the mark is used, and a drawing of the mark.

   (3) The statement shall be verified by the applicant and specify that--
      (A) the person making the verification believes that he or she, or the juristic person in whose

   behalf he or she makes the verification, to be the owner of the mark sought to be registered;
      (B) to the best of the verifier's knowledge and belief, the facts recited in the application are

   accurate;
      (C) the mark is in use in commerce; and
      (D) to the best of the verifier's knowledge and belief, no other person has the right to use such

   mark in commerce either in the identical form thereof or in such near resemblance thereto as to be
   likely, when used on or in connection with the goods of such other person, to cause confusion, or
   to cause mistake, or to deceive, except that, in the case of every application claiming concurrent
   use, the applicant shall--

         (i) state exceptions to the claim of exclusive use; and
         (ii) shall 1 specify, to the extent of the verifier's knowledge--

            (I) any concurrent use by others;
            (II) the goods on or in connection with which and the areas in which each concurrent use
         exists;
            (III) the periods of each use; and
            (IV) the goods and area for which the applicant desires registration.

   (4) The applicant shall comply with such rules or regulations as may be prescribed by the Director.
The Director shall promulgate rules prescribing the requirements for the application and for
obtaining a filing date herein.

(b) Application for bona fide intention to use trademark

   (1) A person who has a bona fide intention, under circumstances showing the good faith of such
person, to use a trademark in commerce may request registration of its trademark on the principal
register hereby established by paying the prescribed fee and filing in the Patent and Trademark
Office an application and a verified statement, in such form as may be prescribed by the Director.

   (2) The application shall include specification of the applicant's domicile and citizenship, the
goods in connection with which the applicant has a bona fide intention to use the mark, and a
drawing of the mark.

   (3) The statement shall be verified by the applicant and specify--
      (A) that the person making the verification believes that he or she, or the juristic person in

   whose behalf he or she makes the verification, to be entitled to use the mark in commerce;
      (B) the applicant's bona fide intention to use the mark in commerce;
      (C) that, to the best of the verifier's knowledge and belief, the facts recited in the application are

   accurate; and
      (D) that, to the best of the verifier's knowledge and belief, no other person has the right to use

   such mark in commerce either in the identical form thereof or in such near resemblance thereto as
   to be likely, when used on or in connection with the goods of such other person, to cause
   confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive.

   Except for applications filed pursuant to section 1126 of this title, no mark shall be registered until
the applicant has met the requirements of subsections (c) and (d) of this section.

   (4) The applicant shall comply with such rules or regulations as may be prescribed by the Director.
The Director shall promulgate rules prescribing the requirements for the application and for
obtaining a filing date herein.

(c) Amendment of application under subsection (b) to conform to requirements of subsection
   (a)

   At any time during examination of an application filed under subsection (b) of this section, an
applicant who has made use of the mark in commerce may claim the benefits of such use for
purposes of this chapter, by amending his or her application to bring it into conformity with the
requirements of subsection (a) of this section.

(d) Verified statement that trademark is used in commerce

   (1) Within six months after the date on which the notice of allowance with respect to a mark is
issued under section 1063(b)(2) of this title to an applicant under subsection (b) of this section, the
applicant shall file in the Patent and Trademark Office, together with such number of specimens or
facsimiles of the mark as used in commerce as may be required by the Director and payment of the
prescribed fee, a verified statement that the mark is in use in commerce and specifying the date of the
applicant's first use of the mark in commerce and those goods or services specified in the notice of
allowance on or in connection with which the mark is used in commerce. Subject to examination and
acceptance of the statement of use, the mark shall be registered in the Patent and Trademark Office, a
certificate of registration shall be issued for those goods or services recited in the statement of use for
which the mark is entitled to registration, and notice of registration shall be published in the Official
Gazette of the Patent and Trademark Office. Such examination may include an examination of the
factors set forth in subsections (a) through (e) of section 1052 of this title. The notice of registration
shall specify the goods or services for which the mark is registered.

   (2) The Director shall extend, for one additional 6-month period, the time for filing the statement
of use under paragraph (1), upon written request of the applicant before the expiration of the 6-month
period provided in paragraph (1). In addition to an extension under the preceding sentence, the
Director may, upon a showing of good cause by the applicant, further extend the time for filing the
statement of use under paragraph (1) for periods aggregating not more than 24 months, pursuant to
written request of the applicant made before the expiration of the last extension granted under this
paragraph. Any request for an extension under this paragraph shall be accompanied by a verified
statement that the applicant has a continued bona fide intention to use the mark in commerce and
specifying those goods or services identified in the notice of allowance on or in connection with
which the applicant has a continued bona fide intention to use the mark in commerce. Any request
for an extension under this paragraph shall be accompanied by payment of the prescribed fee. The
Director shall issue regulations setting forth guidelines for determining what constitutes good cause
for purposes of this paragraph.

   (3) The Director shall notify any applicant who files a statement of use of the acceptance or refusal
thereof and, if the statement of use is refused, the reasons for the refusal. An applicant may amend
the statement of use.

   (4) The failure to timely file a verified statement of use under paragraph (1) or an extension
request under paragraph (2) shall result in abandonment of the application, unless it can be shown to
the satisfaction of the Director that the delay in responding was unintentional, in which case the time
for filing may be extended, but for a period not to exceed the period specified in paragraphs (1) and
(2) for filing a statement of use.

(e) Designation of resident for service of process and notices

   If the applicant is not domiciled in the United States the applicant may designate, by a document
filed in the United States Patent and Trademark Office, the name and address of a person resident in
the United States on whom may be served notices or process in proceedings affecting the mark. Such
notices or process may be served upon the person so designated by leaving with that person or
mailing to that person a copy thereof at the address specified in the last designation so filed. If the
person so designated cannot be found at the address given in the last designation, or if the registrant
does not designate by a document filed in the United States Patent and Trademark Office the name
and address of a person resident in the United States on whom may be served notices or process in
proceedings affecting the mark, such notices or process may be served on the Director.

   Act July 5, 1946, ch. 540, title XI, §§46(b), 47, 60 Stat. 445, provided:
   "(b) Registrations now existing under the Act of March 3, 1881, or the Act of February 20, 1905 [sections
81 to 109 of this title], shall continue in full force and effect for the unexpired terms thereof and may be
renewed under the provisions of section 9 of this Act [section 1059 of this title]. Such registrations and the
renewals thereof shall be subject to and shall be entitled to the benefits of the provisions of this Act [this
chapter] to the same extent and with the same force and effect as though registered on the principal register
established by this Act [this chapter] except as limited in sections 8, 12, 14, and 15 of this Act [sections 1058,
1062, 1064, 1065, of this title]. Marks registered under the 'ten-year proviso' of section 5 of the Act of

the registrant's goods in commerce under paragraph (f) of section 2 of this Act [section 1052 of this title] and

expire six months after the effective date of this Act [July 5, 1947], or twenty years from the dates of their
registrations, whichever date is later. Such registrations shall be subject to and entitled to the benefits of the

that event renewal may be effected on the supplemental register under the provisions of section 9 of this Act
[section 1059 of this title].

[July 5, 1947] may be amended, if practicable, to bring them under the provisions of this Act [this chapter].
The prosecution of such applications so amended and the grant of registrations thereon shall be proceeded
with in accordance with the provisions of this Act [this chapter]. If such amendments are not made, the
prosecution of said applications shall be proceeded with and registrations thereon granted in accordance with
the Acts under which said applications were filed, and said Acts are hereby continued in force to this extent
and for this purpose only, notwithstanding the foregoing general repeal thereof.

Appeals or any United States Circuit Court of Appeals or the United States Court of Appeals for the District
of Columbia or the United States Supreme Court at the effective date of this Act [July 5, 1947], the court, if it
be of the opinion that the provisions of this Act [this chapter] are applicable to the subject matter of the
appeal, may apply such provision or may remand the case to the Commissioner [now Director] or to the
district court for the taking of additional evidence or a new trial or for reconsideration of the decision on the
record as made, as the appellate court may deem proper."

out under section 111 of Title 35, Patents.

      1 So in original. The word "shall" probably should not appear.

§1052. Trademarks registrable on principal register; concurrent registration

   No trademark by which the goods of the applicant may be distinguished from the goods of others
shall be refused registration on the principal register on account of its nature unless it--

   (a) Consists of or comprises immoral, deceptive, or scandalous matter; or matter which may
disparage or falsely suggest a connection with persons, living or dead, institutions, beliefs, or
national symbols, or bring them into contempt, or disrepute; or a geographical indication which,
when used on or in connection with wines or spirits, identifies a place other than the origin of the
goods and is first used on or in connection with wines or spirits by the applicant on or after one year
after the date on which the WTO Agreement (as defined in section 3501(9) of title 19) enters into
force with respect to the United States.

   (b) Consists of or comprises the flag or coat of arms or other insignia of the United States, or of
any State or municipality, or of any foreign nation, or any simulation thereof.

   (c) Consists of or comprises a name, portrait, or signature identifying a particular living individual
except by his written consent, or the name, signature, or portrait of a deceased President of the
United States during the life of his widow, if any, except by the written consent of the widow.
   (d) Consists of or comprises a mark which so resembles a mark registered in the Patent and
Trademark Office, or a mark or trade name previously used in the United States by another and not
abandoned, as to be likely, when used on or in connection with the goods of the applicant, to cause
confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive: Provided, That if the Director determines that
confusion, mistake, or deception is not likely to result from the continued use by more than one
person of the same or similar marks under conditions and limitations as to the mode or place of use
of the marks or the goods on or in connection with which such marks are used, concurrent
registrations may be issued to such persons when they have become entitled to use such marks as a
result of their concurrent lawful use in commerce prior to (1) the earliest of the filing dates of the
applications pending or of any registration issued under this chapter; (2) July 5, 1947, in the case of
registrations previously issued under the Act of March 3, 1881, or February 20, 1905, and continuing
in full force and effect on that date; or (3) July 5, 1947, in the case of applications filed under the Act
of February 20, 1905, and registered after July 5, 1947. Use prior to the filing date of any pending
application or a registration shall not be required when the owner of such application or registration
consents to the grant of a concurrent registration to the applicant. Concurrent registrations may also
be issued by the Director when a court of competent jurisdiction has finally determined that more
than one person is entitled to use the same or similar marks in commerce. In issuing concurrent
registrations, the Director shall prescribe conditions and limitations as to the mode or place of use of
the mark or the goods on or in connection with which such mark is registered to the respective
persons.

   (e) Consists of a mark which (1) when used on or in connection with the goods of the applicant is
merely descriptive or deceptively misdescriptive of them, (2) when used on or in connection with the
goods of the applicant is primarily geographically descriptive of them, except as indications of
regional origin may be registrable under section 1054 of this title, (3) when used on or in connection
with the goods of the applicant is primarily geographically deceptively misdescriptive of them, (4) is
primarily merely a surname, or (5) comprises any matter that, as a whole, is functional.

   (f) Except as expressly excluded in subsections (a), (b), (c), (d), (e)(3), and (e)(5) of this section,
nothing in this chapter shall prevent the registration of a mark used by the applicant which has
become distinctive of the applicant's goods in commerce. The Director may accept as prima facie
evidence that the mark has become distinctive, as used on or in connection with the applicant's goods
in commerce, proof of substantially exclusive and continuous use thereof as a mark by the applicant
in commerce for the five years before the date on which the claim of distinctiveness is made.
Nothing in this section shall prevent the registration of a mark which, when used on or in connection
with the goods of the applicant, is primarily geographically deceptively misdescriptive of them, and
which became distinctive of the applicant's goods in commerce before December 8, 1993.

   A mark which would be likely to cause dilution by blurring or dilution by tarnishment under
section 1125(c) of this title, may be refused registration only pursuant to a proceeding brought under
section 1063 of this title. A registration for a mark which would be likely to cause dilution by
blurring or dilution by tarnishment under section 1125(c) of this title, may be canceled pursuant to a
proceeding brought under either section 1064 of this title or section 1092 of this title.

shall be kept in the United States Patent and Trademark Office. The registration shall reproduce the
mark, and state that the mark is registered on the principal register under this chapter, the date of the
first use of the mark, the date of the first use of the mark in commerce, the particular goods or
services for which it is registered, the number and date of the registration, the term thereof, the date
on which the application for registration was received in the United States Patent and Trademark
Office, and any conditions and limitations that may be imposed in the registration.

(b) Certificate as prima facie evidence

   A certificate of registration of a mark upon the principal register provided by this chapter shall be
prima facie evidence of the validity of the registered mark and of the registration of the mark, of the
owner's ownership of the mark, and of the owner's exclusive right to use the registered mark in
commerce on or in connection with the goods or services specified in the certificate, subject to any
conditions or limitations stated in the certificate.

(c) Application to register mark considered constructive use

   Contingent on the registration of a mark on the principal register provided by this chapter, the
filing of the application to register such mark shall constitute constructive use of the mark,
conferring a right of priority, nationwide in effect, on or in connection with the goods or services
specified in the registration against any other person except for a person whose mark has not been
abandoned and who, prior to such filing--

      (1) has used the mark;
      (2) has filed an application to register the mark which is pending or has resulted in registration
   of the mark; or
      (3) has filed a foreign application to register the mark on the basis of which he or she has
   acquired a right of priority, and timely files an application under section 1126(d) of this title to
   register the mark which is pending or has resulted in registration of the mark.

(d) Issuance to assignee

   A certificate of registration of a mark may be issued to the assignee of the applicant, but the

change of ownership the Director shall, at the request of the owner and upon a proper showing and
the payment of the prescribed fee, issue to such assignee a new certificate of registration of the said
mark in the name of such assignee, and for the unexpired part of the original period.

(e) Surrender, cancellation, or amendment by owner

   Upon application of the owner the Director may permit any registration to be surrendered for
cancellation, and upon cancellation appropriate entry shall be made in the records of the United
States Patent and Trademark Office. Upon application of the owner and payment of the prescribed
fee, the Director for good cause may permit any registration to be amended or to be disclaimed in
part: Provided, That the amendment or disclaimer does not alter materially the character of the mark.
Appropriate entry shall be made in the records of the United States Patent and Trademark Office and
upon the certificate of registration.

(f) Copies of United States Patent and Trademark Office records as evidence

   Copies of any records, books, papers, or drawings belonging to the United States Patent and
Trademark Office relating to marks, and copies of registrations, when authenticated by the seal of the
United States Patent and Trademark Office and certified by the Director, or in his name by an
employee of the Office duly designated by the Director, shall be evidence in all cases wherein the
originals would be evidence; and any person making application therefor and paying the prescribed
fee shall have such copies.

(g) Correction of United States Patent and Trademark Office mistake

   Whenever a material mistake in a registration, incurred through the fault of the United States
Patent and Trademark Office, is clearly disclosed by the records of the Office a certificate stating the
fact and nature of such mistake shall be issued without charge and recorded and a printed copy
thereof shall be attached to each printed copy of the registration and such corrected registration shall
thereafter have the same effect as if the same had been originally issued in such corrected form, or in
the discretion of the Director a new certificate of registration may be issued without charge. All
certificates of correction heretofore issued in accordance with the rules of the United States Patent
and Trademark Office and the registrations to which they are attached shall have the same force and
effect as if such certificates and their issue had been specifically authorized by statute.

(h) Correction of applicant's mistake

   Whenever a mistake has been made in a registration and a showing has been made that such
mistake occurred in good faith through the fault of the applicant, the Director is authorized to issue a
certificate of correction or, in his discretion, a new certificate upon the payment of the prescribed
fee: Provided, That the correction does not involve such changes in the registration as to require
republication of the mark.

§1060. Assignment

   (a)(1) A registered mark or a mark for which an application to register has been filed shall be
assignable with the good will of the business in which the mark is used, or with that part of the good
will of the business connected with the use of and symbolized by the mark. Notwithstanding the
preceding sentence, no application to register a mark under section 1051(b) of this title shall be
assignable prior to the filing of an amendment under section 1051(c) of this title to bring the
application into conformity with section 1051(a) of this title or the filing of the verified statement of
use under section 1051(d) of this title, except for an assignment to a successor to the business of the
applicant, or portion thereof, to which the mark pertains, if that business is ongoing and existing.

   (2) In any assignment authorized by this section, it shall not be necessary to include the good will
of the business connected with the use of and symbolized by any other mark used in the business or
by the name or style under which the business is conducted.

   (3) Assignments shall be by instruments in writing duly executed. Acknowledgment shall be
prima facie evidence of the execution of an assignment, and when the prescribed information
reporting the assignment is recorded in the United States Patent and Trademark Office, the record
shall be prima facie evidence of execution.

   (4) An assignment shall be void against any subsequent purchaser for valuable consideration
without notice, unless the prescribed information reporting the assignment is recorded in the United
States Patent and Trademark Office within 3 months after the date of the assignment or prior to the
subsequent purchase.

   (5) The United States Patent and Trademark Office shall maintain a record of information on
assignments, in such form as may be prescribed by the Director.

   (b) An assignee not domiciled in the United States may designate by a document filed in the
United States Patent and Trademark Office the name and address of a person resident in the United
States on whom may be served notices or process in proceedings affecting the mark. Such notices or
process may be served upon the person so designated by leaving with that person or mailing to that
person a copy thereof at the address specified in the last designation so filed. If the person so
designated cannot be found at the address given in the last designation, or if the assignee does not
designate by a document filed in the United States Patent and Trademark Office the name and
address of a person resident in the United States on whom may be served notices or process in
proceedings affecting the mark, such notices or process may be served upon the Director.

   2002--Subsecs. (a), (b). Pub. L. 107-273 amended subsecs. (a) and (b) generally, in subsec. (a) substituting
pars. (1) to (5) for substantially identical undesignated provisions, and in subsec. (b) adding provisions
relating to service on Director if assignee does not designate name and address of a person resident in the
United States on whom may be served notices or process.

   1999--Pub. L. 106-43, §6(a)(2), (3), which directed the amendment of this section by substituting "mark."
for "mark," in the first sentence and striking out a second period at the end of the third sentence, could not be
executed because "mark," and the second period did not appear subsequent to amendment by Pub. L.
105-330. See 1998 Amendment note below.
   Subsec. (a). Pub. L. 106-113, §1000(a)(9) [title IV, §4732(b)(1)(B)], substituted "Director" for
"Commissioner" in last sentence.

   Pub. L. 106-43, §6(a)(1), which directed the amendment of the penultimate sentence of this section by
substituting "assignment" for "subsequent purchase", was executed by making the substitution for "subsequent
purchase" in two places in the penultimate sentence of subsec. (a), after "date of the" and "prior to the", to
reflect the probable intent of Congress.

   Subsec. (b). Pub. L. 106-113, §1000(a)(9) [title IV, §4732(b)(1)(B)], substituted "Director" for
"Commissioner" in last sentence.

   1998--Pub. L. 105-330 amended section catchline and text generally. Prior to amendment, text read as
follows:

   "A registered mark or a mark for which application to register has been filed shall be assignable with the
goodwill of the business in which the mark is used, or with that part of the goodwill of the business connected
with the use of and symbolized by the mark,. However, no application to register a mark under section
1051(b) of this title shall be assignable prior to the filing of the verified statement of use under section 1051(d)
of this title, except to a successor to the business of the applicant, or portion thereof, to which the mark
pertains, if that business is ongoing and existing. In any assignment authorized by this section it shall not be
necessary to include the goodwill of the business connected with the use of and symbolized by any other mark
used in the business or by the name or style under which the business is conducted. Assignments shall be by
instruments in writing duly executed. Acknowledgment shall be prima facie evidence of the execution of an
assignment and when recorded in the Patent and Trademark Office the record shall be prima facie evidence of
execution. An assignment shall be void as against any subsequent purchaser for a valuable consideration
without notice, unless it is recorded in the Patent and Trademark Office within three months after the date
thereof or prior to such subsequent purchase. A separate record of assignments submitted for recording
hereunder shall be maintained in the Patent and Trademark Office.

   "An assignee not domiciled in the United States shall be subject to and comply with the provisions of
section 1051(e) of this title."

   1988--Pub. L. 100-667 substituted ". However, no application to register a mark under section 1051(b) of
this title shall be assignable prior to the filing of the verified statement of use under section 1051(d) of this
title, except to a successor to the business of the applicant, or portion thereof, to which the mark pertains, if
that business is ongoing and existing. In any assignment authorized by this section" for "and in any such
assignment" in first par., and "1051(e)" for "1051(d)" in last par.

   1975--Pub. L. 93-596 substituted "Patent and Trademark Office" for "Patent Office".
   1962--Pub. L. 87-772 substituted provisions which require a separate record of assignments to be kept in
the Patent Office, for provisions which required the Commissioner to keep such record, and eliminated
provisions permitting the cancellation of any assigned registration at any time if the registered mark is being
used by, or with the permission of, the assignee so as to misrepresent the source of the goods or services in
connection with which the mark is used.

§1062. Publication

(a) Examination and publication
   Upon the filing of an application for registration and payment of the prescribed fee, the Director

shall refer the application to the examiner in charge of the registration of marks, who shall cause an
examination to be made and, if on such examination it shall appear that the applicant is entitled to
registration, or would be entitled to registration upon the acceptance of the statement of use required
by section 1051(d) of this title, the Director shall cause the mark to be published in the Official
Gazette of the Patent and Trademark Office: Provided, That in the case of an applicant claiming
concurrent use, or in the case of an application to be placed in an interference as provided for in
section 1066 of this title the mark, if otherwise registrable, may be published subject to the
determination of the rights of the parties to such proceedings.

(b) Refusal of registration; amendment of application; abandonment
   If the applicant is found not entitled to registration, the examiner shall advise the applicant thereof

and of the reasons therefor. The applicant shall have a period of six months in which to reply or
amend his application, which shall then be reexamined. This procedure may be repeated until (1) the
examiner finally refuses registration of the mark or (2) the applicant fails for a period of six months
to reply or amend or appeal, whereupon the application shall be deemed to have been abandoned,
unless it can be shown to the satisfaction of the Director that the delay in responding was
unintentional, whereupon such time may be extended.
(c) Republication of marks registered under prior acts
   A registrant of a mark registered under the provisions of the Act of March 3, 1881, or the Act of

February 20, 1905, may, at any time prior to the expiration of the registration thereof, upon the
payment of the prescribed fee file with the Director an affidavit setting forth those goods stated in the
registration on which said mark is in use in commerce and that the registrant claims the benefits of
this chapter for said mark. The Director shall publish notice thereof with a reproduction of said mark
in the Official Gazette, and notify the registrant of such publication and of the requirement for the
affidavit of use or nonuse as provided for in subsection (b) of section 1058 of this title. Marks
published under this subsection shall not be subject to the provisions of section 1063 of this title.

§1064. Cancellation of registration

   A petition to cancel a registration of a mark, stating the grounds relied upon, may, upon payment
of the prescribed fee, be filed as follows by any person who believes that he is or will be damaged,
including as a result of a likelihood of dilution by blurring or dilution by tarnishment under section
1125(c) of this title, by the registration of a mark on the principal register established by this chapter,
or under the Act of March 3, 1881, or the Act of February 20, 1905:

      (1) Within five years from the date of the registration of the mark under this chapter.
      (2) Within five years from the date of publication under section 1062(c) of this title of a mark
   registered under the Act of March 3, 1881, or the Act of February 20, 1905.
      (3) At any time if the registered mark becomes the generic name for the goods or services, or a
   portion thereof, for which it is registered, or is functional, or has been abandoned, or its
   registration was obtained fraudulently or contrary to the provisions of section 1054 of this title or
   of subsection (a), (b), or (c) of section 1052 of this title for a registration under this chapter, or
   contrary to similar prohibitory provisions of such prior Acts for a registration under such Acts, or
   if the registered mark is being used by, or with the permission of, the registrant so as to
   misrepresent the source of the goods or services on or in connection with which the mark is used.
   If the registered mark becomes the generic name for less than all of the goods or services for
   which it is registered, a petition to cancel the registration for only those goods or services may be
   filed. A registered mark shall not be deemed to be the generic name of goods or services solely
   because such mark is also used as a name of or to identify a unique product or service. The
   primary significance of the registered mark to the relevant public rather than purchaser motivation
   shall be the test for determining whether the registered mark has become the generic name of
   goods or services on or in connection with which it has been used.
      (4) At any time if the mark is registered under the Act of March 3, 1881, or the Act of February
   20, 1905, and has not been published under the provisions of subsection (c) of section 1062 of this
   title.

      (5) At any time in the case of a certification mark on the ground that the registrant (A) does not
   control, or is not able legitimately to exercise control over, the use of such mark, or (B) engages in
   the production or marketing of any goods or services to which the certification mark is applied, or
   (C) permits the use of the certification mark for purposes other than to certify, or (D)
   discriminately refuses to certify or to continue to certify the goods or services of any person who
   maintains the standards or conditions which such mark certifies:

   Provided, That the Federal Trade Commission may apply to cancel on the grounds specified in
paragraphs (3) and (5) of this section any mark registered on the principal register established by this
chapter, and the prescribed fee shall not be required. Nothing in paragraph (5) shall be deemed to
prohibit the registrant from using its certification mark in advertising or promoting recognition of the
certification program or of the goods or services meeting the certification standards of the registrant.
Such uses of the certification mark shall not be grounds for cancellation under paragraph (5), so long
as the registrant does not itself produce, manufacture, or sell any of the certified goods or services to
which its identical certification mark is applied.

§1071. Appeal to courts

(a) Persons entitled to appeal; United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit; waiver
   of civil action; election of civil action by adverse party; procedure
   (1) An applicant for registration of a mark, party to an interference proceeding, party to an

opposition proceeding, party to an application to register as a lawful concurrent user, party to a
cancellation proceeding, a registrant who has filed an affidavit as provided in section 1058 of this
title or section 1141k of this title, or an applicant for renewal, who is dissatisfied with the decision of
the Director or Trademark Trial and Appeal Board, may appeal to the United States Court of Appeals
for the Federal Circuit thereby waiving his right to proceed under subsection (b) of this section:
Provided, That such appeal shall be dismissed if any adverse party to the proceeding, other than the
Director, shall, within twenty days after the appellant has filed notice of appeal according to
paragraph (2) of this subsection, files notice with the Director that he elects to have all further
proceedings conducted as provided in subsection (b) of this section. Thereupon the appellant shall
have thirty days thereafter within which to file a civil action under subsection (b) of this section, in
default of which the decision appealed from shall govern the further proceedings in the case.

   (2) When an appeal is taken to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, the
appellant shall file in the United States Patent and Trademark Office a written notice of appeal
directed to the Director, within such time after the date of the decision from which the appeal is
taken as the Director prescribes, but in no case less than 60 days after that date.

   (3) The Director shall transmit to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit a
certified list of the documents comprising the record in the United States Patent and Trademark
Office. The court may request that the Director forward the original or certified copies of such
documents during pendency of the appeal. In an ex parte case, the Director shall submit to that court
a brief explaining the grounds for the decision of the United States Patent and Trademark Office,
addressing all the issues involved in the appeal. The court shall, before hearing an appeal, give notice
of the time and place of the hearing to the Director and the parties in the appeal.

   (4) The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit shall review the decision from
which the appeal is taken on the record before the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Upon
its determination the court shall issue its mandate and opinion to the Director, which shall be entered
of record in the United States Patent and Trademark Office and shall govern the further proceedings
in the case. However, no final judgment shall be entered in favor of an applicant under section
1051(b) of this title before the mark is registered, if such applicant cannot prevail without
establishing constructive use pursuant to section 1057(c) of this title.

(b) Civil action; persons entitled to; jurisdiction of court; status of Director; procedure

   (1) Whenever a person authorized by subsection (a) of this section to appeal to the United States
Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit is dissatisfied with the decision of the Director or
Trademark Trial and Appeal Board, said person may, unless appeal has been taken to said United
States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, have remedy by a civil action if commenced within
such time after such decision, not less than sixty days, as the Director appoints or as provided in
subsection (a) of this section. The court may adjudge that an applicant is entitled to a registration
upon the application involved, that a registration involved should be canceled, or such other matter
as the issues in the proceeding require, as the facts in the case may appear. Such adjudication shall
authorize the Director to take any necessary action, upon compliance with the requirements of law.
However, no final judgment shall be entered in favor of an applicant under section 1051(b) of this
title before the mark is registered, if such applicant cannot prevail without establishing constructive
use pursuant to section 1057(c) of this title.

   (2) The Director shall not be made a party to an inter partes proceeding under this subsection, but
he shall be notified of the filing of the complaint by the clerk of the court in which it is filed and
shall have the right to intervene in the action.

   (3) In any case where there is no adverse party, a copy of the complaint shall be served on the
Director, and, unless the court finds the expenses to be unreasonable, all the expenses of the
proceeding shall be paid by the party bringing the case, whether the final decision is in favor of such
party or not. In suits brought hereunder, the record in the United States Patent and Trademark Office
shall be admitted on motion of any party, upon such terms and conditions as to costs, expenses, and
the further cross-examination of the witnesses as the court imposes, without prejudice to the right of
any party to take further testimony. The testimony and exhibits of the record in the United States
Patent and Trademark Office, when admitted, shall have the same effect as if originally taken and
produced in the suit.

   (4) Where there is an adverse party, such suit may be instituted against the party in interest as
shown by the records of the United States Patent and Trademark Office at the time of the decision
complained of, but any party in interest may become a party to the action. If there are adverse parties
residing in a plurality of districts not embraced within the same State, or an adverse party residing in
a foreign country, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia shall have
jurisdiction and may issue summons against the adverse parties directed to the marshal of any district
in which any adverse party resides. Summons against adverse parties residing in foreign countries
may be served by publication or otherwise as the court directs.

compliance with the provisions of subsections (a) and (e) of section 1051 of this title so far as they

such mark has been in lawful use in commerce by the owner thereof, on or in connection with any

prescribed fee the Director shall refer the application to the examiner in charge of the registration of
marks, who shall cause an examination to be made and if on such examination it shall appear that the
applicant is entitled to registration, the registration shall be granted. If the applicant is found not
entitled to registration the provisions of subsection (b) of section 1062 of this title shall apply.

   For the purposes of registration on the supplemental register, a mark may consist of any

trademark, symbol, label, package, configuration of goods, name, word, slogan, phrase, surname,
geographical name, numeral, device, any matter that as a whole is not functional, or any combination
of any of the foregoing, but such mark must be capable of distinguishing the applicant's goods or
services.

any person believes that such person is or will be damaged by the registration of a mark on the
supplemental register--

§1114. Remedies; infringement; innocent infringement by printers and
      publishers

   (1) Any person who shall, without the consent of the registrant--
      (a) use in commerce any reproduction, counterfeit, copy, or colorable imitation of a registered

   mark in connection with the sale, offering for sale, distribution, or advertising of any goods or
   services on or in connection with which such use is likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake,
   or to deceive; or

      (b) reproduce, counterfeit, copy, or colorably imitate a registered mark and apply such
   reproduction, counterfeit, copy, or colorable imitation to labels, signs, prints, packages, wrappers,
   receptacles or advertisements intended to be used in commerce upon or in connection with the
   sale, offering for sale, distribution, or advertising of goods or services on or in connection with
   which such use is likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive,

   shall be liable in a civil action by the registrant for the remedies hereinafter provided. Under
subsection (b) hereof, the registrant shall not be entitled to recover profits or damages unless the acts
have been committed with knowledge that such imitation is intended to be used to cause confusion,
or to cause mistake, or to deceive.

   As used in this paragraph, the term "any person" includes the United States, all agencies and
instrumentalities thereof, and all individuals, firms, corporations, or other persons acting for the
United States and with the authorization and consent of the United States, and any State, any
instrumentality of a State, and any officer or employee of a State or instrumentality of a State acting
in his or her official capacity. The United States, all agencies and instrumentalities thereof, and all
individuals, firms, corporations, other persons acting for the United States and with the authorization
and consent of the United States, and any State, and any such instrumentality, officer, or employee,
shall be subject to the provisions of this chapter in the same manner and to the same extent as any
nongovernmental entity.

   (2) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the remedies given to the owner of a right
infringed under this chapter or to a person bringing an action under section 1125(a) or (d) of this title
shall be limited as follows:

      (A) Where an infringer or violator is engaged solely in the business of printing the mark or
   violating matter for others and establishes that he or she was an innocent infringer or innocent
   violator, the owner of the right infringed or person bringing the action under section 1125(a) of
   this title shall be entitled as against such infringer or violator only to an injunction against future
   printing.

      (B) Where the infringement or violation complained of is contained in or is part of paid
   advertising matter in a newspaper, magazine, or other similar periodical or in an electronic
   communication as defined in section 2510(12) of title 18, the remedies of the owner of the right
   infringed or person bringing the action under section 1125(a) of this title as against the publisher
   or distributor of such newspaper, magazine, or other similar periodical or electronic
   communication shall be limited to an injunction against the presentation of such advertising matter
   in future issues of such newspapers, magazines, or other similar periodicals or in future
   transmissions of such electronic communications. The limitations of this subparagraph shall apply
   only to innocent infringers and innocent violators.

      (C) Injunctive relief shall not be available to the owner of the right infringed or person bringing
   the action under section 1125(a) of this title with respect to an issue of a newspaper, magazine, or
other similar periodical or an electronic communication containing infringing matter or violating
matter where restraining the dissemination of such infringing matter or violating matter in any
particular issue of such periodical or in an electronic communication would delay the delivery of
such issue or transmission of such electronic communication after the regular time for such
delivery or transmission, and such delay would be due to the method by which publication and
distribution of such periodical or transmission of such electronic communication is customarily
conducted in accordance with sound business practice, and not due to any method or device
adopted to evade this section or to prevent or delay the issuance of an injunction or restraining
order with respect to such infringing matter or violating matter.

   (D)(i)(I) A domain name registrar, a domain name registry, or other domain name registration
authority that takes any action described under clause (ii) affecting a domain name shall not be
liable for monetary relief or, except as provided in subclause (II), for injunctive relief, to any
person for such action, regardless of whether the domain name is finally determined to infringe or
dilute the mark.

   (II) A domain name registrar, domain name registry, or other domain name registration
authority described in subclause (I) may be subject to injunctive relief only if such registrar,
registry, or other registration authority has--

      (aa) not expeditiously deposited with a court, in which an action has been filed regarding the
   disposition of the domain name, documents sufficient for the court to establish the court's
   control and authority regarding the disposition of the registration and use of the domain name;

      (bb) transferred, suspended, or otherwise modified the domain name during the pendency of
   the action, except upon order of the court; or

      (cc) willfully failed to comply with any such court order.

   (ii) An action referred to under clause (i)(I) is any action of refusing to register, removing from
registration, transferring, temporarily disabling, or permanently canceling a domain name--

      (I) in compliance with a court order under section 1125(d) of this title; or
      (II) in the implementation of a reasonable policy by such registrar, registry, or authority
   prohibiting the registration of a domain name that is identical to, confusingly similar to, or
   dilutive of another's mark.

   (iii) A domain name registrar, a domain name registry, or other domain name registration
authority shall not be liable for damages under this section for the registration or maintenance of a
domain name for another absent a showing of bad faith intent to profit from such registration or
maintenance of the domain name.

   (iv) If a registrar, registry, or other registration authority takes an action described under clause
(ii) based on a knowing and material misrepresentation by any other person that a domain name is
identical to, confusingly similar to, or dilutive of a mark, the person making the knowing and
material misrepresentation shall be liable for any damages, including costs and attorney's fees,
incurred by the domain name registrant as a result of such action. The court may also grant
injunctive relief to the domain name registrant, including the reactivation of the domain name or
the transfer of the domain name to the domain name registrant.

   (v) A domain name registrant whose domain name has been suspended, disabled, or transferred
under a policy described under clause (ii)(II) may, upon notice to the mark owner, file a civil
action to establish that the registration or use of the domain name by such registrant is not
unlawful under this chapter. The court may grant injunctive relief to the domain name registrant,
including the reactivation of the domain name or transfer of the domain name to the domain name
registrant.

   (E) As used in this paragraph--
      (i) the term "violator" means a person who violates section 1125(a) of this title; and
      (ii) the term "violating matter" means matter that is the subject of a violation under section

   1125(a) of this title.
   (3)(A) Any person who engages in the conduct described in paragraph (11) of section 110 of title
17 and who complies with the requirements set forth in that paragraph is not liable on account of
such conduct for a violation of any right under this chapter. This subparagraph does not preclude
liability, nor shall it be construed to restrict the defenses or limitations on rights granted under this
chapter, of a person for conduct not described in paragraph (11) of section 110 of title 17, even if that
person also engages in conduct described in paragraph (11) of section 110 of such title.

   (B) A manufacturer, licensee, or licensor of technology that enables the making of limited portions
of audio or video content of a motion picture imperceptible as described in subparagraph (A) is not
liable on account of such manufacture or license for a violation of any right under this chapter, if
such manufacturer, licensee, or licensor ensures that the technology provides a clear and conspicuous
notice at the beginning of each performance that the performance of the motion picture is altered
from the performance intended by the director or copyright holder of the motion picture. The
limitations on liability in subparagraph (A) and this subparagraph shall not apply to a manufacturer,
licensee, or licensor of technology that fails to comply with this paragraph.

   (C) The requirement under subparagraph (B) to provide notice shall apply only with respect to
technology manufactured after the end of the 180-day period beginning on April 27, 2005.

   (D) Any failure by a manufacturer, licensee, or licensor of technology to qualify for the exemption
under subparagraphs (A) and (B) shall not be construed to create an inference that any such party
that engages in conduct described in paragraph (11) of section 110 of title 17 is liable for trademark
infringement by reason of such conduct.

§1115. Registration on principal register as evidence of exclusive right to use
      mark; defenses

(a) Evidentiary value; defenses
   Any registration issued under the Act of March 3, 1881, or the Act of February 20, 1905, or of a

mark registered on the principal register provided by this chapter and owned by a party to an action
shall be admissible in evidence and shall be prima facie evidence of the validity of the registered
mark and of the registration of the mark, of the registrant's ownership of the mark, and of the
registrant's exclusive right to use the registered mark in commerce on or in connection with the
goods or services specified in the registration subject to any conditions or limitations stated therein,
but shall not preclude another person from proving any legal or equitable defense or defect,
including those set forth in subsection (b) of this section, which might have been asserted if such
mark had not been registered.

(b) Incontestability; defenses
   To the extent that the right to use the registered mark has become incontestable under section 1065
of this title, the registration shall be conclusive evidence of the validity of the registered mark and of
the registration of the mark, of the registrant's ownership of the mark, and of the registrant's
exclusive right to use the registered mark in commerce. Such conclusive evidence shall relate to the
exclusive right to use the mark on or in connection with the goods or services specified in the
affidavit filed under the provisions of section 1065 of this title, or in the renewal application filed
under the provisions of section 1059 of this title if the goods or services specified in the renewal are
fewer in number, subject to any conditions or limitations in the registration or in such affidavit or
renewal application. Such conclusive evidence of the right to use the registered mark shall be subject
to proof of infringement as defined in section 1114 of this title, and shall be subject to the following
defenses or defects:

      (1) That the registration or the incontestable right to use the mark was obtained fraudulently; or
      (2) That the mark has been abandoned by the registrant; or
      (3) That the registered mark is being used by or with the permission of the registrant or a person
   in privity with the registrant, so as to misrepresent the source of the goods or services on or in
   connection with which the mark is used; or
      (4) That the use of the name, term, or device charged to be an infringement is a use, otherwise
   than as a mark, of the party's individual name in his own business, or of the individual name of
   anyone in privity with such party, or of a term or device which is descriptive of and used fairly
   and in good faith only to describe the goods or services of such party, or their geographic origin;
   or
      (5) That the mark whose use by a party is charged as an infringement was adopted without
   knowledge of the registrant's prior use and has been continuously used by such party or those in
   privity with him from a date prior to (A) the date of constructive use of the mark established
   pursuant to section 1057(c) of this title, (B) the registration of the mark under this chapter if the

§1116. Injunctive relief

(a) Jurisdiction; service

   The several courts vested with jurisdiction of civil actions arising under this chapter shall have
power to grant injunctions, according to the principles of equity and upon such terms as the court
may deem reasonable, to prevent the violation of any right of the registrant of a mark registered in
the Patent and Trademark Office or to prevent a violation under subsection (a), (c), or (d) of section
1125 of this title. Any such injunction may include a provision directing the defendant to file with
the court and serve on the plaintiff within thirty days after the service on the defendant of such
injunction, or such extended period as the court may direct, a report in writing under oath setting
forth in detail the manner and form in which the defendant has complied with the injunction. Any
such injunction granted upon hearing, after notice to the defendant, by any district court of the
United States, may be served on the parties against whom such injunction is granted anywhere in the
United States where they may be found, and shall be operative and may be enforced by proceedings
to punish for contempt, or otherwise, by the court by which such injunction was granted, or by any
other United States district court in whose jurisdiction the defendant may be found.

(b) Transfer of certified copies of court papers

   The said courts shall have jurisdiction to enforce said injunction, as provided in this chapter, as
fully as if the injunction had been granted by the district court in which it is sought to be enforced.
The clerk of the court or judge granting the injunction shall, when required to do so by the court
before which application to enforce said injunction is made, transfer without delay to said court a
certified copy of all papers on file in his office upon which said injunction was granted.

(c) Notice to Director

   It shall be the duty of the clerks of such courts within one month after the filing of any action, suit,
or proceeding involving a mark registered under the provisions of this chapter to give notice thereof
in writing to the Director setting forth in order so far as known the names and addresses of the
litigants and the designating number or numbers of the registration or registrations upon which the
action, suit, or proceeding has been brought, and in the event any other registration be subsequently
included in the action, suit, or proceeding by amendment, answer, or other pleading, the clerk shall
give like notice thereof to the Director, and within one month after the judgment is entered or an
appeal is taken the clerk of the court shall give notice thereof to the Director, and it shall be the duty
of the Director on receipt of such notice forthwith to endorse the same upon the file wrapper of the
said registration or registrations and to incorporate the same as a part of the contents of said file
wrapper.

(d) Civil actions arising out of use of counterfeit marks

   (1)(A) In the case of a civil action arising under section 1114(1)(a) of this title or section 220506
of title 36 with respect to a violation that consists of using a counterfeit mark in connection with the
sale, offering for sale, or distribution of goods or services, the court may, upon ex parte application,
grant an order under subsection (a) of this section pursuant to this subsection providing for the
seizure of goods and counterfeit marks involved in such violation and the means of making such
marks, and records documenting the manufacture, sale, or receipt of things involved in such
violation.

   (B) As used in this subsection the term "counterfeit mark" means--
      (i) a counterfeit of a mark that is registered on the principal register in the United States Patent

   and Trademark Office for such goods or services sold, offered for sale, or distributed and that is in
   use, whether or not the person against whom relief is sought knew such mark was so registered; or

      (ii) a spurious designation that is identical with, or substantially indistinguishable from, a
   designation as to which the remedies of this chapter are made available by reason of section
   220506 of title 36;

   but such term does not include any mark or designation used on or in connection with goods or
services of which the manufacture 1 or producer was, at the time of the manufacture or production in
question authorized to use the mark or designation for the type of goods or services so manufactured
or produced, by the holder of the right to use such mark or designation.

   (2) The court shall not receive an application under this subsection unless the applicant has given
such notice of the application as is reasonable under the circumstances to the United States attorney
for the judicial district in which such order is sought. Such attorney may participate in the
proceedings arising under such application if such proceedings may affect evidence of an offense
against the United States. The court may deny such application if the court determines that the public
interest in a potential prosecution so requires.

   (3) The application for an order under this subsection shall--
      (A) be based on an affidavit or the verified complaint establishing facts sufficient to support the

   findings of fact and conclusions of law required for such order; and
      (B) contain the additional information required by paragraph (5) of this subsection to be set
   forth in such order.

   (4) The court shall not grant such an application unless--
      (A) the person obtaining an order under this subsection provides the security determined

   adequate by the court for the payment of such damages as any person may be entitled to recover as
   a result of a wrongful seizure or wrongful attempted seizure under this subsection; and

      (B) the court finds that it clearly appears from specific facts that--
         (i) an order other than an ex parte seizure order is not adequate to achieve the purposes of

      section 1114 of this title;
         (ii) the applicant has not publicized the requested seizure;
         (iii) the applicant is likely to succeed in showing that the person against whom seizure would

      be ordered used a counterfeit mark in connection with the sale, offering for sale, or distribution
      of goods or services;

         (iv) an immediate and irreparable injury will occur if such seizure is not ordered;
         (v) the matter to be seized will be located at the place identified in the application;
         (vi) the harm to the applicant of denying the application outweighs the harm to the legitimate
      interests of the person against whom seizure would be ordered of granting the application; and
         (vii) the person against whom seizure would be ordered, or persons acting in concert with
      such person, would destroy, move, hide, or otherwise make such matter inaccessible to the
      court, if the applicant were to proceed on notice to such person.

   (5) An order under this subsection shall set forth--
      (A) the findings of fact and conclusions of law required for the order;
      (B) a particular description of the matter to be seized, and a description of each place at which

   such matter is to be seized;
      (C) the time period, which shall end not later than seven days after the date on which such order

   is issued, during which the seizure is to be made;
      (D) the amount of security required to be provided under this subsection; and
      (E) a date for the hearing required under paragraph (10) of this subsection.

   (6) The court shall take appropriate action to protect the person against whom an order under this
subsection is directed from publicity, by or at the behest of the plaintiff, about such order and any
seizure under such order.

   (7) Any materials seized under this subsection shall be taken into the custody of the court. For
seizures made under this section, the court shall enter an appropriate protective order with respect to
discovery and use of any records or information that has been seized. The protective order shall
provide for appropriate procedures to ensure that confidential, private, proprietary, or privileged
information contained in such records is not improperly disclosed or used.

   (8) An order under this subsection, together with the supporting documents, shall be sealed until
the person against whom the order is directed has an opportunity to contest such order, except that
any person against whom such order is issued shall have access to such order and supporting
documents after the seizure has been carried out.

   (9) The court shall order that service of a copy of the order under this subsection shall be made by
a Federal law enforcement officer (such as a United States marshal or an officer or agent of the
United States Customs Service, Secret Service, Federal Bureau of Investigation, or Post Office) or
may be made by a State or local law enforcement officer, who, upon making service, shall carry out
the seizure under the order. The court shall issue orders, when appropriate, to protect the defendant
from undue damage from the disclosure of trade secrets or other confidential information during the
course of the seizure, including, when appropriate, orders restricting the access of the applicant (or
any agent or employee of the applicant) to such secrets or information.

   (10)(A) The court shall hold a hearing, unless waived by all the parties, on the date set by the court
in the order of seizure. That date shall be not sooner than ten days after the order is issued and not
later than fifteen days after the order is issued, unless the applicant for the order shows good cause
for another date or unless the party against whom such order is directed consents to another date for
such hearing. At such hearing the party obtaining the order shall have the burden to prove that the
facts supporting findings of fact and conclusions of law necessary to support such order are still in
effect. If that party fails to meet that burden, the seizure order shall be dissolved or modified
appropriately.

   (B) In connection with a hearing under this paragraph, the court may make such orders modifying
the time limits for discovery under the Rules of Civil Procedure as may be necessary to prevent the
frustration of the purposes of such hearing.

   (11) A person who suffers damage by reason of a wrongful seizure under this subsection has a
cause of action against the applicant for the order under which such seizure was made, and shall be
entitled to recover such relief as may be appropriate, including damages for lost profits, cost of
materials, loss of good will, and punitive damages in instances where the seizure was sought in bad
faith, and, unless the court finds extenuating circumstances, to recover a reasonable attorney's fee.
The court in its discretion may award prejudgment interest on relief recovered under this paragraph,
at an annual interest rate established under section 6621(a)(2) of title 26, commencing on the date of
service of the claimant's pleading setting forth the claim under this paragraph and ending on the date
such recovery is granted, or for such shorter time as the court deems appropriate.

§1117. Recovery for violation of rights

(a) Profits; damages and costs; attorney fees
   When a violation of any right of the registrant of a mark registered in the Patent and Trademark

Office, a violation under section 1125(a) or (d) of this title, or a willful violation under section
1125(c) of this title, shall have been established in any civil action arising under this chapter, the
plaintiff shall be entitled, subject to the provisions of sections 1111 and 1114 of this title, and subject
to the principles of equity, to recover (1) defendant's profits, (2) any damages sustained by the
plaintiff, and (3) the costs of the action. The court shall assess such profits and damages or cause the
same to be assessed under its direction. In assessing profits the plaintiff shall be required to prove
defendant's sales only; defendant must prove all elements of cost or deduction claimed. In assessing
damages the court may enter judgment, according to the circumstances of the case, for any sum
above the amount found as actual damages, not exceeding three times such amount. If the court shall
find that the amount of the recovery based on profits is either inadequate or excessive the court may
in its discretion enter judgment for such sum as the court shall find to be just, according to the
circumstances of the case. Such sum in either of the above circumstances shall constitute
compensation and not a penalty. The court in exceptional cases may award reasonable attorney fees
to the prevailing party.

(b) Treble damages for use of counterfeit mark

   In assessing damages under subsection (a) for any violation of section 1114(1)(a) of this title or

section 1116(d) of this title), the court shall, unless the court finds extenuating circumstances, enter
judgment for three times such profits or damages, whichever amount is greater, together with a
reasonable attorney's fee, if the violation consists of--

      (1) intentionally using a mark or designation, knowing such mark or designation is a counterfeit
   mark (as defined in section 1116(d) of this title), in connection with the sale, offering for sale, or
   distribution of goods or services; or

      (2) providing goods or services necessary to the commission of a violation specified in
   paragraph (1), with the intent that the recipient of the goods or services would put the goods or
   services to use in committing the violation.

   In such a case, the court may award prejudgment interest on such amount at an annual interest rate
established under section 6621(a)(2) of title 26, beginning on the date of the service of the claimant's
pleadings setting forth the claim for such entry of judgment and ending on the date such entry is
made, or for such shorter time as the court considers appropriate.

(c) Statutory damages for use of counterfeit marks

   In a case involving the use of a counterfeit mark (as defined in section 1116(d) of this title) in
connection with the sale, offering for sale, or distribution of goods or services, the plaintiff may
elect, at any time before final judgment is rendered by the trial court, to recover, instead of actual
damages and profits under subsection (a) of this section, an award of statutory damages for any such
use in connection with the sale, offering for sale, or distribution of goods or services in the amount
of--

      (1) not less than $1,000 or more than $200,000 per counterfeit mark per type of goods or
   services sold, offered for sale, or distributed, as the court considers just; or

      (2) if the court finds that the use of the counterfeit mark was willful, not more than $2,000,000
   per counterfeit mark per type of goods or services sold, offered for sale, or distributed, as the court
   considers just.

(d) Statutory damages for violation of section 1125(d)(1)

   In a case involving a violation of section 1125(d)(1) of this title, the plaintiff may elect, at any
time before final judgment is rendered by the trial court, to recover, instead of actual damages and
profits, an award of statutory damages in the amount of not less than $1,000 and not more than
$100,000 per domain name, as the court considers just.

(e) Rebuttable presumption of willful violation

   In the case of a violation referred to in this section, it shall be a rebuttable presumption that the
violation is willful for purposes of determining relief if the violator, or a person acting in concert
with the violator, knowingly provided or knowingly caused to be provided materially false contact
information to a domain name registrar, domain name registry, or other domain name registration
authority in registering, maintaining, or renewing a domain name used in connection with the
violation. Nothing in this subsection limits what may be considered a willful violation under this
section.

§1125. False designations of origin, false descriptions, and dilution forbidden

(a) Civil action
   (1) Any person who, on or in connection with any goods or services, or any container for goods,

uses in commerce any word, term, name, symbol, or device, or any combination thereof, or any false
designation of origin, false or misleading description of fact, or false or misleading representation of
fact, which--

      (A) is likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive as to the affiliation,
   connection, or association of such person with another person, or as to the origin, sponsorship, or
   approval of his or her goods, services, or commercial activities by another person, or

      (B) in commercial advertising or promotion, misrepresents the nature, characteristics, qualities,
   or geographic origin of his or her or another person's goods, services, or commercial activities,

   shall be liable in a civil action by any person who believes that he or she is or is likely to be
damaged by such act.

   (2) As used in this subsection, the term "any person" includes any State, instrumentality of a State
or employee of a State or instrumentality of a State acting in his or her official capacity. Any State,
and any such instrumentality, officer, or employee, shall be subject to the provisions of this chapter
in the same manner and to the same extent as any nongovernmental entity.

   (3) In a civil action for trade dress infringement under this chapter for trade dress not registered on
the principal register, the person who asserts trade dress protection has the burden of proving that the
matter sought to be protected is not functional.

(b) Importation
   Any goods marked or labeled in contravention of the provisions of this section shall not be

imported into the United States or admitted to entry at any customhouse of the United States. The
owner, importer, or consignee of goods refused entry at any customhouse under this section may
have any recourse by protest or appeal that is given under the customs revenue laws or may have the
remedy given by this chapter in cases involving goods refused entry or seized.

(c) Dilution by blurring; dilution by tarnishment

   (1) Injunctive relief
      Subject to the principles of equity, the owner of a famous mark that is distinctive, inherently or

   through acquired distinctiveness, shall be entitled to an injunction against another person who, at
any time after the owner's mark has become famous, commences use of a mark or trade name in
commerce that is likely to cause dilution by blurring or dilution by tarnishment of the famous
mark, regardless of the presence or absence of actual or likely confusion, of competition, or of
actual economic injury.

(2) Definitions
   (A) For purposes of paragraph (1), a mark is famous if it is widely recognized by the general

consuming public of the United States as a designation of source of the goods or services of the
mark's owner. In determining whether a mark possesses the requisite degree of recognition, the
court may consider all relevant factors, including the following:

      (i) The duration, extent, and geographic reach of advertising and publicity of the mark,
   whether advertised or publicized by the owner or third parties.

      (ii) The amount, volume, and geographic extent of sales of goods or services offered under
   the mark.

      (iii) The extent of actual recognition of the mark.
      (iv) Whether the mark was registered under the Act of March 3, 1881, or the Act of February
   20, 1905, or on the principal register.

   (B) For purposes of paragraph (1), "dilution by blurring" is association arising from the
similarity between a mark or trade name and a famous mark that impairs the distinctiveness of the
famous mark. In determining whether a mark or trade name is likely to cause dilution by blurring,
the court may consider all relevant factors, including the following:

      (i) The degree of similarity between the mark or trade name and the famous mark.
      (ii) The degree of inherent or acquired distinctiveness of the famous mark.
      (iii) The extent to which the owner of the famous mark is engaging in substantially exclusive
   use of the mark.
      (iv) The degree of recognition of the famous mark.
      (v) Whether the user of the mark or trade name intended to create an association with the
   famous mark.
      (vi) Any actual association between the mark or trade name and the famous mark.

   (C) For purposes of paragraph (1), "dilution by tarnishment" is association arising from the
similarity between a mark or trade name and a famous mark that harms the reputation of the
famous mark.

(3) Exclusions
   The following shall not be actionable as dilution by blurring or dilution by tarnishment under

this subsection:
      (A) Any fair use, including a nominative or descriptive fair use, or facilitation of such fair

   use, of a famous mark by another person other than as a designation of source for the person's
   own goods or services, including use in connection with--

         (i) advertising or promotion that permits consumers to compare goods or services; or
         (ii) identifying and parodying, criticizing, or commenting upon the famous mark owner or
      the goods or services of the famous mark owner.

      (B) All forms of news reporting and news commentary.
      (C) Any noncommercial use of a mark.

(4) Burden of proof
   In a civil action for trade dress dilution under this chapter for trade dress not registered on the

principal register, the person who asserts trade dress protection has the burden of proving that--
      (A) the claimed trade dress, taken as a whole, is not functional and is famous; and
      (B) if the claimed trade dress includes any mark or marks registered on the principal register,

   the unregistered matter, taken as a whole, is famous separate and apart from any fame of such
      registered marks.

   (5) Additional remedies

      In an action brought under this subsection, the owner of the famous mark shall be entitled to
   injunctive relief as set forth in section 1116 of this title. The owner of the famous mark shall also
   be entitled to the remedies set forth in sections 1117(a) and 1118 of this title, subject to the
   discretion of the court and the principles of equity if--

         (A) the mark or trade name that is likely to cause dilution by blurring or dilution by
      tarnishment was first used in commerce by the person against whom the injunction is sought
      after October 6, 2006; and

         (B) in a claim arising under this subsection--
            (i) by reason of dilution by blurring, the person against whom the injunction is sought

         willfully intended to trade on the recognition of the famous mark; or
            (ii) by reason of dilution by tarnishment, the person against whom the injunction is sought

         willfully intended to harm the reputation of the famous mark.

   (6) Ownership of valid registration a complete bar to action

      The ownership by a person of a valid registration under the Act of March 3, 1881, or the Act of
   February 20, 1905, or on the principal register under this chapter shall be a complete bar to an
   action against that person, with respect to that mark, that--

         (A) is brought by another person under the common law or a statute of a State; and
         (B)(i) seeks to prevent dilution by blurring or dilution by tarnishment; or
         (ii) asserts any claim of actual or likely damage or harm to the distinctiveness or reputation of
      a mark, label, or form of advertisement.

   (7) Savings clause

      Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to impair, modify, or supersede the applicability of
   the patent laws of the United States.

(d) Cyberpiracy prevention

   (1)(A) A person shall be liable in a civil action by the owner of a mark, including a personal name
which is protected as a mark under this section, if, without regard to the goods or services of the
parties, that person--

      (i) has a bad faith intent to profit from that mark, including a personal name which is protected
   as a mark under this section; and

      (ii) registers, traffics in, or uses a domain name that--
         (I) in the case of a mark that is distinctive at the time of registration of the domain name, is

      identical or confusingly similar to that mark;
         (II) in the case of a famous mark that is famous at the time of registration of the domain

      name, is identical or confusingly similar to or dilutive of that mark; or
         (III) is a trademark, word, or name protected by reason of section 706 of title 18 or section

      220506 of title 36.

   (B)(i) In determining whether a person has a bad faith intent described under subparagraph (A), a
court may consider factors such as, but not limited to--

      (I) the trademark or other intellectual property rights of the person, if any, in the domain name;
      (II) the extent to which the domain name consists of the legal name of the person or a name that
   is otherwise commonly used to identify that person;
      (III) the person's prior use, if any, of the domain name in connection with the bona fide offering
   of any goods or services;
      (IV) the person's bona fide noncommercial or fair use of the mark in a site accessible under the
   domain name;
      (V) the person's intent to divert consumers from the mark owner's online location to a site
   accessible under the domain name that could harm the goodwill represented by the mark, either
   for commercial gain or with the intent to tarnish or disparage the mark, by creating a likelihood of
   confusion as to the source, sponsorship, affiliation, or endorsement of the site;
      (VI) the person's offer to transfer, sell, or otherwise assign the domain name to the mark owner

   or any third party for financial gain without having used, or having an intent to use, the domain
   name in the bona fide offering of any goods or services, or the person's prior conduct indicating a
   pattern of such conduct;

      (VII) the person's provision of material and misleading false contact information when applying
   for the registration of the domain name, the person's intentional failure to maintain accurate
   contact information, or the person's prior conduct indicating a pattern of such conduct;

      (VIII) the person's registration or acquisition of multiple domain names which the person knows
   are identical or confusingly similar to marks of others that are distinctive at the time of registration
   of such domain names, or dilutive of famous marks of others that are famous at the time of
   registration of such domain names, without regard to the goods or services of the parties; and

      (IX) the extent to which the mark incorporated in the person's domain name registration is or is
   not distinctive and famous within the meaning of subsection (c).

   (ii) Bad faith intent described under subparagraph (A) shall not be found in any case in which the
court determines that the person believed and had reasonable grounds to believe that the use of the
domain name was a fair use or otherwise lawful.

   (C) In any civil action involving the registration, trafficking, or use of a domain name under this

   Trademark Office, or protected under subsection (a) or (c) of this section; and

      (ii) the court finds that the owner--
         (I) is not able to obtain in personam jurisdiction over a person who would have been a

   in the second level domain in manners which are intended or are likely to confuse or deceive the public as
   to the affiliation, connection, or association of the domain name registrant, or a site accessible under the
   domain name, with such other person, or as to the origin, sponsorship, or approval of the goods, services, or

§1126. International conventions

(a) Register of marks communicated by international bureaus
   The Director shall keep a register of all marks communicated to him by the international bureaus

provided for by the conventions for the protection of industrial property, trademarks, trade and
commercial names, and the repression of unfair competition to which the United States is or may
become a party, and upon the payment of the fees required by such conventions and the fees required
in this chapter may place the marks so communicated upon such register. This register shall show a
facsimile of the mark or trade or commercial name; the name, citizenship, and address of the
registrant; the number, date, and place of the first registration of the mark, including the dates on
which application for such registration was filed and granted and the term of such registration; a list
of goods or services to which the mark is applied as shown by the registration in the country of
origin, and such other data as may be useful concerning the mark. This register shall be a
continuation of the register provided in section 1(a) of the Act of March 19, 1920.

(b) Benefits of section to persons whose country of origin is party to convention or treaty
   Any person whose country of origin is a party to any convention or treaty relating to trademarks,

trade or commercial names, or the repression of unfair competition, to which the United States is
also a party, or extends reciprocal rights to nationals of the United States by law, shall be entitled to
the benefits of this section under the conditions expressed herein to the extent necessary to give
effect to any provision of such convention, treaty or reciprocal law, in addition to the rights to which
any owner of a mark is otherwise entitled by this chapter.

(c) Prior registration in country of origin; country of origin defined

   No registration of a mark in the United States by a person described in subsection (b) of this
section shall be granted until such mark has been registered in the country of origin of the applicant,
unless the applicant alleges use in commerce.

   For the purposes of this section, the country of origin of the applicant is the country in which he
has a bona fide and effective industrial or commercial establishment, or if he has not such an
establishment the country in which he is domiciled, or if he has not a domicile in any of the countries
described in subsection (b) of this section, the country of which he is a national.

(d) Right of priority
   An application for registration of a mark under section 1051, 1053, 1054, or 1091 of this title or

under subsection (e) of this section, filed by a person described in subsection (b) of this section who
has previously duly filed an application for registration of the same mark in one of the countries
described in subsection (b) of this section shall be accorded the same force and effect as would be
accorded to the same application if filed in the United States on the same date on which the
application was first filed in such foreign country: Provided, That--

      (1) the application in the United States is filed within six months from the date on which the
   application was first filed in the foreign country;

      (2) the application conforms as nearly as practicable to the requirements of this chapter,
   including a statement that the applicant has a bona fide intention to use the mark in commerce;

      (3) the rights acquired by third parties before the date of the filing of the first application in the
   foreign country shall in no way be affected by a registration obtained on an application filed under
   this subsection;

      (4) nothing in this subsection shall entitle the owner of a registration granted under this section
   to sue for acts committed prior to the date on which his mark was registered in this country unless
   the registration is based on use in commerce.

   In like manner and subject to the same conditions and requirements, the right provided in this
section may be based upon a subsequent regularly filed application in the same foreign country,
instead of the first filed foreign application: Provided, That any foreign application filed prior to
such subsequent application has been withdrawn, abandoned, or otherwise disposed of, without
having been laid open to public inspection and without leaving any rights outstanding, and has not
served, nor thereafter shall serve, as a basis for claiming a right of priority.

(e) Registration on principal or supplemental register; copy of foreign registration
   A mark duly registered in the country of origin of the foreign applicant may be registered on the

principal register if eligible, otherwise on the supplemental register in this chapter provided. Such
applicant shall submit, within such time period as may be prescribed by the Director, a true copy, a
photocopy, a certification, or a certified copy of the registration in the country of origin of the
applicant. The application must state the applicant's bona fide intention to use the mark in commerce,
but use in commerce shall not be required prior to registration.

(f) Domestic registration independent of foreign registration
   The registration of a mark under the provisions of subsections (c), (d), and (e) of this section by a

person described in subsection (b) of this section shall be independent of the registration in the
country of origin and the duration, validity, or transfer in the United States of such registration shall
be governed by the provisions of this chapter.

(g) Trade or commercial names of foreign nationals protected without registration
   Trade names or commercial names of persons described in subsection (b) of this section shall be

protected without the obligation of filing or registration whether or not they form parts of marks.

(h) Protection of foreign nationals against unfair competition
   Any person designated in subsection (b) of this section as entitled to the benefits and subject to the

provisions of this chapter shall be entitled to effective protection against unfair competition, and the
remedies provided in this chapter for infringement of marks shall be available so far as they may be
appropriate in repressing acts of unfair competition.

(i) Citizens or residents of United States entitled to benefits of section
   Citizens or residents of the United States shall have the same benefits as are granted by this

section to persons described in subsection (b) of this section.

or her business or vocation.
   The term "trademark" includes any word, name, symbol, or device, or any combination thereof--

      (1) used by a person, or

or sold by others and to indicate the source of the goods, even if that source is unknown.

   The term "service mark" means any word, name, symbol, or device, or any combination thereof--

   The term "mark" includes any trademark, service mark, collective mark, or certification mark.
   The term "use in commerce" means the bona fide use of a mark in the ordinary course of trade,
and not made merely to reserve a right in a mark. For purposes of this chapter, a mark shall be
deemed to be in use in commerce--

      (1) on goods when--
         (A) it is placed in any manner on the goods or their containers or the displays associated

      therewith or on the tags or labels affixed thereto, or if the nature of the goods makes such
      placement impracticable, then on documents associated with the goods or their sale, and

         (B) the goods are sold or transported in commerce, and

      (2) on services when it is used or displayed in the sale or advertising of services and the services
   are rendered in commerce, or the services are rendered in more than one State or in the United
   States and a foreign country and the person rendering the services is engaged in commerce in
   connection with the services.

   A mark shall be deemed to be "abandoned" if either of the following occurs:
      (1) When its use has been discontinued with intent not to resume such use. Intent not to resume

   may be inferred from circumstances. Nonuse for 3 consecutive years shall be prima facie evidence
   of abandonment. "Use" of a mark means the bona fide use of such mark made in the ordinary
   course of trade, and not made merely to reserve a right in a mark.

      (2) When any course of conduct of the owner, including acts of omission as well as
   commission, causes the mark to become the generic name for the goods or services on or in
   connection with which it is used or otherwise to lose its significance as a mark. Purchaser
   motivation shall not be a test for determining abandonment under this paragraph.

   The term "colorable imitation" includes any mark which so resembles a registered mark as to be
likely to cause confusion or mistake or to deceive.

   The term "registered mark" means a mark registered in the United States Patent and Trademark
Office under this chapter or under the Act of March 3, 1881, or the Act of February 20, 1905, or the
Act of March 19, 1920. The phrase "marks registered in the Patent and Trademark Office" means
registered marks.

   The term "Act of March 3, 1881", "Act of February 20, 1905", or "Act of March 19, 1920", means
the respective Act as amended.

   A "counterfeit" is a spurious mark which is identical with, or substantially indistinguishable from,
a registered mark.

   The term "domain name" means any alphanumeric designation which is registered with or
assigned by any domain name registrar, domain name registry, or other domain name registration
authority as part of an electronic address on the Internet.

   The term "Internet" has the meaning given that term in section 230(f)(1) of title 47.
   Words used in the singular include the plural and vice versa.
   The intent of this chapter is to regulate commerce within the control of Congress by making
actionable the deceptive and misleading use of marks in such commerce; to protect registered marks
used in such commerce from interference by State, or territorial legislation; to protect persons
engaged in such commerce against unfair competition; to prevent fraud and deception in such
commerce by the use of reproductions, copies, counterfeits, or colorable imitations of registered
marks; and to provide rights and remedies stipulated by treaties and conventions respecting
trademarks, trade names, and unfair competition entered into between the United States and foreign
nations.
