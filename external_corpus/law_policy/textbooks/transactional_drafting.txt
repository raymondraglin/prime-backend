                  PREFACE

       Every law school in the country requires its students to take a first
semester first year course that teaches them how to write a research
memorandum and introduces them to the type of work that is done by a
young associate at a law firm. And all of those law schools also require
their students to take a second semester first year course that teaches them
how to write a trial brief (or an appeal brief) and introduces them to
litigation practice (or appellate practice). About half of the lawyers in the
U.S. are litigators. The other half are transactional attorneys. Yet there are
only a handful of law schools that require their students to take a third
course that teaches them how to draft a contract and introduces them to
transactional practice. That is the subject of this book.

       One way to describe what contract drafting and transactional practice
entails is to compare it to what is involved in the other types of writing
lawyers do. For example, when a young lawyer is assigned to write a
research memo or a trial memo (or appeal brief), they usually start by
obtaining the facts from an older associate or a partner in the firm, or a
document filed in the litigation. The facts describe an event or a series of
events that happened in the past. The lawyer's primary concern in
describing the facts in a research memo is to make sure the description is
accurate and complete. If the lawyer is writing an appeal brief, their
primary concern is to ensure the description of the facts is also persuasive.

       When a lawyer writes a research memo or a trial memo (or appeal
brief), the core of the document is the attorney's analysis of some legal
issue. In the document, the attorney states the facts, applies the law
(statutes and cases) to the facts, and comes to a conclusion. The facts are
important but the analysis is what the attorney devotes their primary
attention to.

       In addition, legal memos, trial memos and appeal briefs are usually
written from scratch (i.e. starting with a blank page). And legal writing is
usually done by one lawyer working alone. For example, in litigation, the

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
lawyer representing one party writes a memo for their client, and the lawyer
for the other party writes a separate memo for their client.

       When a transactional attorney drafts a contract the situation is
entirely different. They usually obtain the facts (the terms of the deal)
directly from the client. Some of those facts may involve past events, but
most of them describe things that will happen in the future. Part of the
attorney's job is to translate that information into the language and
organization customarily used for legal agreements. But the attorney also
contributes to the substance by brainstorming for mechanisms to effectuate
the client's intent and provisions to protect the client in the event various
contingencies occur.

       When a lawyer drafts a contract, the core of the contract is the
description of facts (the deal terms). There are circumstances where the
attorney is also called upon to apply the law to certain contract provisions.
That aspect of contract drafting is important, but it is not the primary thing
an attorney is involved in when they draft a contract for a client.

       In addition, contracts are not typically drafted from scratch. The
lawyer usually starts with a precedent or sample document. And contracts
are not typically drafted by one person alone. Both lawyers, each
representing their own client, usually collaborate in drafting a contract with
terms both sides are agreeable to. So the process of drafting a contract is
very different than the process of writing a research memo, trial memo or
appeal brief.

       In one respect, however, legal writing and contract drafting are
similar. Both topics involve more than just writing well. Before a law
student learns to write a research memo they learn about the sources of law
in the American legal system, and they learn how to research issues within
those sources. Legal research is an ancillary skill that is usually taught in
connection with a first semester legal writing class.

       After a litigator learns to write a trial memo or an appeal brief, they
also learn how to represent a client in oral argument. A significant portion
of a second semester class on persuasive writing is usually devoted to
arguing a trial memo or an appeal brief at a hearing before the applicable

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
court. Oral argument is another example of an ancillary skill taught in a
writing class.

       Contract drafting is similar. After a contract is drafted it is usually
also necessary to get deal closed: oversee the signing of the documents,
arrange for the perfection of any security interests and handle the
disbursement of any proceeds of the transaction. Conducting a closing is an
example of an ancillary skill involved in contract drafting.

       As any text on legal writing, the coverage of this book on contract
drafting goes beyond writing well. In the same way that a first semester
legal writing class prepares students to work as an associate in a law firm
and a second semester class gives them the skills they need to practice
litigation, this book includes everything students need to know to "hit the
ground running" as a transactional attorney.

             INTRODUCTION

       This book will teach you how to draft a contract from scratch and
using precedents; and it will also introduce you to each of the other skills
required for transactional practice. The book starts with a chapter on
getting up to speed and properly conducting a client intake because the
information obtained in that initial client meeting is what determines the
substance of the agreement. And the substance of the agreement is more
important than the form.

       The following chapters explain how to consistently draft obligations,
rights, prohibitions and descriptive statements that are clear and
unambiguous. Also, the organization of the various sections of an
agreement is discussed, with plenty of examples of the two most basic types
of agreements (an agreement that involves a due diligence period and a
closing, and a term agreement).

       Then the book covers "brainstorming." By thinking about how to
structure provisions so they best accomplish the client's intent, worrying
about how things could go wrong, and making sure the client is protected
should that occur, lawyers generate the additional substance they are
expected to contribute to an agreement.

       The next chapters explain how to draft with precedent documents
(forms and samples) because in practice lawyers spend most of their time
working with precedents. There is no need for an attorney in practice to
draft a promissory note or a mortgage from scratch every time they are
asked to handle a commercial loan. Rather, the job of a transactional
lawyer is usually to tailor a set of existing forms to the terms of each deal;
and there is more to that process than just filling in the blanks in an existing
document.

       The process of drafting a contract also doesn't end when the
document is completed. Contract language is almost always negotiated in
commercial deals. When the negotiations are completed, counsel is usually

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
required to get the documents signed. Sometimes that involves conducting
a formal closing, other times the lawyer need only confirm the authority of
the signer to sign for an entity. Often ethical issues arise in connection with
that process that need to analyzed and resolved. And sometimes computers
are used to draft the documents and record the signatures of the parties.
Each of those topics is also discussed in the final chapters of the book.

       As you read each chapter develop a checklist of your own that you
can refer to when you draft contracts from scratch, revise complex forms or
do any of the other things taught in this book. Drafting a contract is not like
writing a memorandum. The conventions for drafting contracts are far more
in number. You don't have to memorize them all but you do need to keep
track of them, and keep what you learn in a form you can refer back to
when you draft.

       You also need to collect samples of the contract provisions you study
in this book and the sample documents provided here. You learned in a
class on legal writing how different drafting a legal memorandum is than
writing an essay. The process of writing enforceable obligations is even
more different than the type of writing you learned in your first year of law
school. Again, you don't have to memorize what you learn here, but you
should keep copies of well drafted provisions and documents you
encounter. That is what transactional lawyers do in practice. You should
start getting in the habit of doing that now.

       More than anything else however you need to practice. A course on
contract drafting is not a substantive course; a contract drafting course is a
skills course. And you learn a legal skill the same way you learn any other
skill: by practicing. You need an introduction to the relevant conventions,
and you need to see examples of how those conventions are applied in
varying contexts. But ultimately you learn to draft contracts by drafting
contracts.

       Develop a checklist, collect samples of contract provisions, and
practice as much as you can. Do all that you will be ready for transactional
practice by the end of this book.

1. GETTING UP TO SPEED
(PREPARING TO DRAFT)

T he first step in contract drafting is getting up to speed. Before you
          even meet with the client to find out what the agreement is, you
          must prepare. And that means becoming familiar with the client's
business and the nature of the goods or services involved, doing a little
research to find out what the applicable law is, taking a look at some sample
agreements to see what the issues are and what information you will need,
and then conferencing with the client and flushing out the terms of the deal.

A. Find Out What Type of Agreement You Will be Drafting

If a client tells you he wants to hire you to draft an agreement, or a senior
partner tells you they have a client who wants the firm to draft an
agreement, the first thing you need to do is find out what type of agreement
you will be drafting. Don't just put the time and date of that initial meeting
in your calendar and then show up unprepared. You need to get up to speed
before you do anything and, to do that, you need to know what type of
agreement you will be drafting. Is the client a bank that wants to retain the
firm to close a commercial loan? Or is the client a wealthy young person
who wants you to draft an antenuptual agreement before their upcoming
marriage. You can't prepare if you have no idea what type of contract you
will be drafting, so step one is to find out as much as you can before that
initial client meeting takes place. Don't try to conduct a client intake for a
business agreement on the fly. You need to set up a meeting, in person,

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
over the phone or on line, and then you need to use the time before the
meeting to get ready.

B. Learn About the Client's Business and the Goods or Services
Involved

Suppose the client is hiring you to draft an agreement to construct a
building. Do you know anything about the construction business?
Probably not. Why would you? You're a lawyer not a general contractor.
But if you have a contractor for a client, you need to develop some
familiarity with the construction business before you represent them. You
need to have some idea what is involved in constructing a building before
you can draft a construction agreement.

Usually there is a set of "plans and specifications" that describe the
structure. The plans, which are actually called "drawings," show the
dimensions and location of each room; the specifications detail the
materials to be used and the identity of things like appliances and
furnishings. Then there is a budget itemizing how much everything will
cost, and a schedule for when things will be done. Construction is not done
by one person or entity; there is usually a "general contractor" who works
with various "subcontractors" to get the work done. The people who pour
the foundation are different than the people who do the framing. The
electricians do the wiring and the plumbers do the piping. HVAC (heating,
ventilation, and air conditioning) is handled by one group, and drywall is
handled by another. And the coordination and payment of all these parties
is critical to the timely completion of the project.

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
If there are changes (and there usually are), there is a "change order"
procedure that has to be gone through. If subcontractors don't get paid,
there are "material men's liens" that have to be dealt with. And that process
is usually governed by a state statute. If there is financing, the lender will
constantly be verifying that the loan is "in balance" (i.e. there is enough
money left to complete the project). If there is insurance, the insurer will
also want to monitor construction progress, so that the amount of coverage
can be adjusted as the building is constructed. At a minimum, you have to
be familiar with all of these things before you meet with the client to learn
the deal. If you don't do that preparation, communication with the client
may be hampered. You may not be able to draft the contract well, and you
may also cause the client to lose confidence in you. For a lawyer, that is the
beginning of the end. You can't risk letting that happen.

Learn as much as you can about the client and the client's business before
you meet. If you are not familiar with the product or service that will be
involved in the agreement, take the time to get up to speed. Learn the lingo
so you can understand what the client is telling you. The client will be
expecting you to have that familiarity. If you can at least give the
impression that you know what you are doing, the client will have
confidence in you, and the process will be facilitated.

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
C. Do Some Research and Make Sure You are Familiar with the
Applicable Law

Depending on the type of transaction you are working on there are a variety
of different laws that may apply. It would be impossible to list them all.
What you have to do is think about the type of transaction, the subject
matter involved, and the business the parties are in; and then do some
research to see what law applies. The client will expect you to be familiar
with the law. If you aren't, you risk starting the relationship on the wrong
foot.

For example, if you are planning to draft a contract for the sale of goods,
you need to take a look at Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code. Do
that and you will see the requirements for excluding implied warranties in §
2-316, limiting consequential damages in § 2-719, providing for liquidated
damages in § 2-718, and shortening the statute of limitations in a sales
agreement, § 2-725. Those are all things you may want to add to an
agreement if you are drafting it on behalf of a seller. If you do want to add
one or more of those provisions, you will have to check the statute to see
what requirements there are for how the provision must be drafted.

If what your client is buying or selling is real estate, there are likely state
laws applicable to the transaction. For example, Florida sellers of real
estate are required to disclose the potential effect of the sale on ad valorem
taxes, § 689.261, Fla. Stat., the dangers associated with radon gas, §
404.056(5), Fla. Stat., the potential for erosion of coastal properties, §
161.57, Fla. Stat., and information about homeowner's associations and
condo associations, §§ 720.401 & 718.503, Fla. Stat. If you are drafting a
purchase and sale agreement on behalf of a seller, you may want to include
those disclosures in the agreement, so it is clear the applicable laws have
been complied with.

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
Article 2A of the Uniform Commercial Code applies to the lease of goods.
The statute contains many of the same provisions that are included in
Article 2, plus some additional sections only applicable to leases. For
example, limitations on choice of law and choice of forum provisions are
contained in § 2A-106. Choice of law and choice of forum provisions are
typically included in a commercial lease, so you will need to know what
those limitations are.

If the lease applies to residential real estate, then, again, there are likely a
series of state statutes that will apply to the agreement. For example,
Florida law requires a variety of disclosures be made and procedures be
followed whenever money is deposited or advanced by a tenant in
connection with a rental agreement, § 83.49, Fla. Stat. If the lease you are
drafting includes a security deposit, it would "behoove" you (as my old boss
used to say), to make sure whatever provisions you are including comply
with the statute.

Mortgages conveying a security interest in real property are also governed
by state statutes. In some states, mortgages actually convey title to the
lender ("title theory" states); in others mortgages convey a security interest
("lien theory" states). I think every state requires a mortgage to be recorded
to have priority over other subsequent creditors, but the place of recording
differs from state to state. Also, in some state non-judicial foreclosures can
be conducted under a "power of sale;" in other states, judicial approval of
the foreclosure process is required. So before you start drafting (or looking
for sample documents you might use), you will need to know what the
applicable law is.

State laws also regulate various types of consumer transactions and service
providers. For example, in Florida, there is a state statute regulating the
form and substance of membership campground agreements. §§ 509.501-
509.512, Fla. Stat. And there is another statute governing talent agencies
and the contracts they enter into. §§ 468.401-468.415, Fla. Stat. If you
draft a membership campground agreement or a talent agency contract in

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
Florida without first researching the applicable statute, you risk producing a
document that violates state law.

Those are just a few examples. After you have familiarized yourself with
the client and the client's business, do some research to familiarize yourself
with the applicable law. You need that information to understand the
client's concerns and fulfill your role as counselor and draftsperson.

D. Review Sample Documents and Create a List of Questions

The next step is to take a look at some sample documents. One way to do
that is to do an internet search for the type of agreement you are interested
in. The problem is, if you do it that way, you are likely to find links to
websites selling agreement forms to consumers, like Rocket Lawyer and
Legal Zoom. But you don't want those types of documents. You want to
look at sample commercial agreements used by lawyers. So you need to go
to a law library (assuming libraries still exist after you graduate and start
practicing) or go to a website for attorneys. Westlaw has a service called
"Practical Law" that is a good source for sample agreements. The
Securities and Exchange Commission service called EDGAR (Electronic
Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval) is free a source that can be used to
search for sample business documents. Also, there are free websites like
onecle.com and lawinsider.com that are additional sources for sample
agreements and contract provisions.

Note however the purpose of gathering sample documents at this stage is
not to find a form you can use. Rather it is to find out what issues are
typically dealt with in the type of agreement you will be drafting and what
pieces of information will be needed to complete the document. For
example, if you are drafting a commercial lease and you look at a typical
form, you will see that you will need the name and addresses of the parties,
the amount and payment terms for the rent, a detailed description of the
premises, and the amount and terms for any advance rent or security
deposits. Knowing that you can begin to make a list of questions you will

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
need to ask the client. And making that list will ensure the initial client
meeting is efficient and productive.

So, in addition to learning the clients business and becoming familiar with
the applicable law, also take the time to search for some sample documents
and develop a list of questions and issues for your meeting with the client.

E. Meet with the Client and Flush out the Terms of the Deal

The last step is to meet with the client and find out the terms of the
agreement. And the first thing to know about that step is that most people
don't like meeting with lawyers. I know it's hard to imagine, but for the
average person, going to see a lawyer is like going to the dentist. You know
you have to do it, but you don't want to, and you hope to get it over with as
soon as possible. For lawyers that means it isn't always easy to get the
client to sit down and go through all the facts of the deal with you. So,
make the process as painless as possible. Explain why you need to go
through this process and then do it efficiently. Have a list of questions or an
outline ready. Ask open ended questions, like you would in a deposition
(i.e. questions that begin with who, what, where, when, why, and how).
Listen carefully and take good notes.

If you are a litigator meeting with a client for the first time, you want to ask
open ended questions, listen carefully to the answers, and learn as much as
you can about what happened. But you also want the client to know you
empathize with their position. That is critical to establish in the first client
meeting. Similarly, if you are a transactional attorney doing an initial client
intake, you ask open ended questions, listen carefully to the answers and
learn as much as you can about the transaction you will be documenting.
But you also want to demonstrate to the client that you fully understand the
terms of the deal. That is what is critical to establish when you are hired to
draft a contract.

What you want is to get to the point where you know everything the client
knows. Who agreed to what? What did the other guy agree to in

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
exchange? What else was agreed upon? What representations were made?
You may be surprised to find there are a lot of things that weren't discussed
but should have been. Keep track of what those things were. And keep
asking questions until you have completely flushed out all the elements of
the deal, and all the details of each element.
There will come a time when you actually know the deal better than the
client. But for now, just make sure you know everything the client knows.
All the information in the client's head has to be transferred to your head for
you to transcribe that information in a contract. Plus you need to
understand the client's interests and concerns. You need to understand what
is important to them and what they are looking for your to contribute. Also,
try to establish a rapport with the client; and leave the door open when you
are done. After the next step you will need to talk to them again.
Those are the four steps to getting up to speed. Make yourself familiar with
the goods or services involved. Make sure you are on top of the applicable
law. Review some sample agreements and make an outline of questions to
ask. And then meet with the client to flush out the terms of the deal. Once
you have done those four things, you should have everything you need to
start drafting.

                                 Practice Exercises

1. A client is retaining us to draft a purchase agreement for beer
brewing equipment. When I talked to her on the phone she said the
agreement should be contingent on the inspection of the "mash tun" and
the "hot liquor tank." Also, the seller has a "CIP" system and should be
required to use it to clean out the "wort" before the inspection happens. I
am not familiar with that terminology. Please do some quick research on
line and send me an e-mail memo explaining what she meant so I can
prepare for the initial client conference.

2. A firm client has hired is to draft a promissory note for a finance
transaction. When I talked to him on the phone he said this would be a
little different than a conventional lending arrangement. The loan would
have a 20 year term but a 30 year "amortization." The lender isn't
worried about the structure because rates are going down and there should
be no problem doing a "refi" when the "balloon" is due. I am not familiar
with these terms. Please do some quick research on line and send me an
e-mail memo explaining what he meant so I can get up to speed before I
discuss the details of the loan with the client.

3. A client contacts you to draft a commercial lease for office space.
She says the lease should be "triple net." The rent is $1,500 per month
plus "CAM" charges. The landlord will provide everything up to the
"rough plumbing" and the tenant will do responsible for any build out
from there. Likely you are familiar with a lease agreement, having signed
one for the apartment you live in now. If you are not familiar with this
terminology, please do some quick research on line and send me an e-mail
memo explaining what she meant so you will be prepared for an initial
meeting with the client to discuss deal terms.

4. Your next project will be to draft a residential lease for property in
the state you live in. To prepare, you need to do some legal research on
the statutory requirements for a residential lease. The landlord will be
collecting the last month's rent, as well as a security deposit, as part of the
deal. Are there any disclosures or notices that have to be included in the
agreement? Are there any restrictions on provisions that may or may not
be included?

5. You need to prepare for a client conference for a real estate
purchase. Go on line and collect some real estate purchase and sale
agreements. Make sure the samples were drafted for a small real estate
transaction in the state in which you live. Also, try to find forms drafted
for a seller, not a buyer. Then read through the forms to find out the
information you will need to produce a final draft; and outline that
information to create a list of questions for a client conference.

2. DRAFTING OBLIGATIONS,
RIGHTS, PROHIBITIONS AND
DESCRIPTIVE STATEMENTS

C ontracts typically contain four types of provisions: obligations,
           rights, prohibitions, and descriptive statements. To draft contract
           provisions clearly you have to first be able to determine what type
of provision is involved. You have to take what the client tells you and
figure out if what they are describing is an obligation, prohibition, right or
descriptive statement.

Obligations are provisions that require a party to do something in the future
they are not already required to do. If the client tells you they have a buyer
who has agreed to buy property they are selling, and the client wants you to
memorialize that agreement in a written contract, the provision you need to
draft is an example of an obligation. The buyer will not be legally obligated
to follow through with the purchase until you create that obligation in the
contract, and the buyer agrees to it by signing on the bottom line.

Rights are provisions that enable a party to do something in the future they
don't already have the ability to do. If the client also tells you they have
agreed that the buyer can inspect the property before the sale, the provision
you need to draft is an example of a right. A buyer doesn't normally have
the ability to inspect something they don't own. To enable them to do that
you need to draft a contract provision giving them the legal right to do the
inspection.

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
Prohibitions prohibit a party from doing something they would otherwise be
able to do. The client may have further agreed not to market the property
once the agreement is signed. That is an example of a prohibition. A seller
normally has the ability to market property they are offering for sale. To
prevent a seller from doing that, you need to draft a prohibition.

Obligations, rights and prohibitions concern things that happen in the
future. By drafting those provisions in a contract you create enforceable
rules for the future relations of the parties.

Descriptive statements are the fourth type of contract provision. Unlike
obligations, rights and prohibitions, descriptive statements usually refer to
things that happened in the past or are happening in the present (i.e. when
the contract is signed). The background section of a contract (sometimes
called the recitals) is comprised of descriptive statements. If the client tells
you the property is 2,000 square feet, and you want to add that information
to the contract, what you need to draft is an example of a descriptive
statement. Unlike obligations, rights and prohibitions, descriptive
statements usually do not create enforceable rules.

The cardinal rule for the court's enforcement of obligations, rights and
prohibitions according to their plain meaning and intent is that the language
of the provision must be "clear and unambiguous." E.g., M & G Polymers
USA, LLC v. Tackett, 135 S. Ct. 926, 190 L. Ed. 2d 809 (2015) (If the words
of a contract are clear and unambiguous, their meaning is to be ascertained
in accordance with the contract's plainly expressed intent), Lyme Land
Conservation Trust, Inc. v. Platner, 325 Conn. 737, 159 A.3d 666
(2017) (When the intent of the parties is clear and unambiguous, contractual
terms are to be given their ordinary meaning and there is no room for
construction), Bathla v. 913 Market, LLC, 200 A.3d 754 (Del. 2018)(Clear
and unambiguous contractual terms will be interpreted according to their
ordinary meaning), Sky Canyon Properties, LLC v. Golf Club at Black Rock,
LLC, 155 Idaho 604, 315 P.3d 792 (2013) (If the contract is clear and
unambiguous, the contract's meaning and legal effect is to be determined
from the plain meaning of its words), Haegert v. University of Evansville,
977 N.E.2d 924, 286 Ed. Law Rep. 660 (Ind. 2012) (If the contract terms

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
are drafted in clear and unambiguous language, the court will enforce the
contract according to those terms), Littleton Const. Ltd. v. Huber Const.,
Inc., 27 N.Y.3d 1081, 35 N.Y.S.3d 681, 55 N.E.3d 441 (2016) (If the
contract is clear and unambiguous, it must be enforced according to its plain
meaning), Hexagon Holdings, Inc. v. Carlisle Syntec Incorporated, 199
A.3d 1034 (R.I. 2019) (When the language of the contract is clear and
unambiguous, the words will be given their usual and ordinary meaning),
Harleysville Group Insurance v. Heritage Communities, Inc., 420 S.C. 321,
803 S.E.2d 288 (2017) (The language alone determines the contract's force
and effect, as long as it is clear and unambiguous), Parsons v. Associated
Banc-Corp, 2017 WI 37, 374 Wis. 2d 513, 893 N.W.2d 212 (2017) (The
court construes the contract according to its literal terms, as long as the
terms are clear and unambiguous), Pennaco Energy, Inc. v. Sorenson, 2016
WY 34, 371 P.3d 120 (Wyo. 2016) (When the language of a contract is
clear and unambiguous, a court's inquiry is limited to the four corners of the
document).

Clarity is typically achieved in three ways. First, use simple active voice
sentences (i.e. subject, verb, object). Start with the one of the parties as the
subject of the sentence and just say what it is you are obligating them to do,
giving them the right to do or prohibiting them from doing.

Second, be consistent with the language you use to describe obligations,
rights and prohibitions. In practice you will see lawyers using the words
"agrees," "promises," "shall," "must," and "will" for obligations.
Regardless of which word they use, they will use it consistently.

Think of the Ten Commandments in the Bible. When Moses came down
from the mountain, he didn't say "Thou shalt not kill." "Thou may not
commit adultery." "Thou must not steal." "Thou will not bear false witness
against thy neighbor." "Coveting thy neighbor's goods shall not be done
either." He didn't mix it up. He used the phrase "shalt not" over and over
again. When you draft obligations, rights and prohibitions, you should do
the same thing. You should be consistent with the language you use.

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
Believe it or not, there is much scholarly debate in the literature about
whether "shall" or "will" is the "correct" word to use for obligations. E.g.,
Chadwick C. Busk, Using Shall or Will to Create Obligations in Business
Contracts, Mich. Bar J. (2017). Some of the leading scholars in this area
argue "shall" is correct, "will" is wrong. E.g., Kenneth A. Adams, A
Manual of Style for Contract Drafting (4th ed. 2017), Tina L. Stark,
Drafting Contracts: How and Why Lawyers Do What They Do (2d ed.
2007). Others argue "will" is correct, "shall" is wrong. Brian A. Garner,
Guidelines for Drafting and Editing Contracts (1st ed. 2019). My position
is either is fine as long as you are consistent. I personally think "shall"
sounds old fashioned. It's not a word I would otherwise use in my writing,
so I don't use it in contracts either. In this book, I use "will" for obligations,
"will not" for prohibitions and "may" for rights.
Third, make sure your provisions are complete. To do that, ask what a
colleague of mine used to refer to as the "w" questions: "who," "what," "to
whom," "when," "where" and "how" ("how" ends with a "w" so that's a
"w" question too). Not all of those questions will apply to every obligation,
right or prohibition you draft but you should have answers to as many of
them as do apply.

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
Be consistent with your descriptive statements too. If you write in the
agreement the contractor will provide their own "tools, materials, and
supplies," then you should use that phrase and only that phrase every time
you describe what the contractor is required to provide.

Also, when you transcribe information the client gave you, make sure you
are specific and your transcription is accurate. If the client gives you a
detailed description of the subject matter of an agreement, your description
in the contract should be at least as detailed, and it should be accurate. It is
usually not appropriate to paraphrase or summarize in a contract. Your
document should typically be at least as detailed as the information you get
from the client.

Those are the basic principles you need to follow when drafting obligations,
rights, prohibitions and descriptions. Here are some more specific
examples of how to draft each of those types of provisions.

A. Draft Obligations Using "Will"

A tenant's agreement to pay rent to a landlord is an example of a
obligation. To make it clear an obligation is intended, start with the name
of the party you are assigning the obligation to, use a word like "will" or
"shall" as a helping verb (Again, I will use the word "will"), and just state
what the person agreed to do, like this:

 The Tenant will pay the rent.

To make the provision complete, ask yourself to whom will the rent be
paid? How much is the rent? When is the rent due? And how is the rent to
be paid? Then add the answers to those questions to your original
provision, like this:

 On or before the first day of each month, the Tenant will pay rent to
 the Landlord in the amount of five hundred dollars ($500) by check

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
 or money order.

Assuming the rent actually is $500 per month, you have now drafted a clear,
complete, and accurate obligation requiring the tenant to pay the rent.

One thing to avoid when drafting obligations is obligating the parties to
come to an agreement in the future, like this:

 The Landlord and the Tenant will agree on an appropriate late charge.

An agreement to agree is generally not enforceable. Plus, the whole idea of
drafting a contract is to help the parties to come to an agreement now, and
then put that agreement in writing. So don't draft provisions indicating the
parties "will agree" to things after the contract is signed.

B. Draft Rights Using "May"

A landlord's right to conduct periodic inspections of the property is an
example of a contract right. To draft a right, start with the party's name, use
the word "may" as a helping verb, and then state what the person "may"
do. Don't mix it up and use "may" for some rights and "can" or "has the
right to" for others. Be consistent. Also, make sure each provision is
complete by asking myself "who," "what," "to whom," "when," and "how,"
as applicable.

For example, to draft a right to inspect an apartment, start with a simple
active voice sentence, using the word "may" before the verb, like this:

 The Landlord may inspect the Unit.

Then ask yourself when the inspection will occur and how it must be done?
Is notice required? To whom will it be given? And when will it be given?

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
And add the answers to those questions to what you initially drafted, like
this:

 The Landlord may inspect the Unit on any weekday between the
 hours of 9:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. The Landlord will give notice to the
 Tenant at least twenty-four hours before the proposed inspection.

That is an example of a clear, complete and accurate provision granting a
landlord the right to inspect a unit, and obligating the landlord to give
notice before doing so.

If the provision gets lengthy, you can break it up, as I did in that example.
Every provision in a contract does not have to be a single sentence. But if
you do break it up, continue to follow the same conventions. Don't say
"Notice will be given to the Tenant...." Obligate someone to give the notice,
even if it is implicit who that party is. Say instead "The Landlord will give
notice to the Tenant...."

Also, there are a couple things to avoid when using the word "may." The
first is to avoid giving someone the right to do something they already have
the right to do, like this:

 The Tenant may request that the term of the Lease be extended.

The Tenant can request whatever the Tenant wants to request. It is not
necessary to give the Tenant the right to do something he already has the
right to do.

The second is to avoid characterizing an obligation as a right. If you want
the Tenant to return the keys to the property, do it like this:

 The Tenant will return the keys to the Property to the Landlord.

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
Not like this:

 The Landlord may receive the keys to the Property from the Tenant.

Among other things, if the Tenant doesn't return the keys, you want to be
able to enforce a provision of the Lease obligating the Tenant to return
them. A Lease provision saying the Landlord has the right to receive the
keys will be of little use to you.

C. Draft Prohibitions Using "Will Not"

A provision taking away the tenant's right to have pets in the unit is an
example of a prohibition. Since I am using the word "will" for obligations,
I will use the phrase "will not" for prohibitions. I will not use any other
phrase like "may not" or "cannot."

To draft a prohibition, start with the same simple active voice sentence
structure you have been using for obligations and rights:

 The Tenant will not have pets.

The only "w" questions that apply here are where and when. So, finish by
adding the answers to those questions, like this:

 The Tenant will not have pets in the Unit at any time during the
 Term.

And you are done. Easy peasy.
The primary thing to avoid when using "will not" is using that phrase for
something that should be a descriptive statement, not a prohibition. If the

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
agreement is for the tenant to have free access to the exercise room, don't
draft the applicable provision like this:

 The Tenant will not pay for access to the exercise room.

You don't need to prohibit the tenant from paying for that access. You just
need to make clear they don't have to pay for that access. Saying a party
doesn't have the obligation to do something is not the same as saying the
party is prohibited from doing it. The former is a descriptive statement; the
latter is a prohibition. What you want here is a descriptive statement, like
this:

 The Tenant's access to the exercise room is provided free of charge.

D. Draft Descriptions Using Past or Present Tense Statements

The other type of provision you will find in contracts is a descriptive
statement. Descriptive statements are past or present tense statements
describing factual information in an agreement. Examples of descriptive
statements include the provisions of the background section and
representations and warranties.

To draft a descriptive statement, use the same simple active voice sentence
structure you would use for other contract provisions. Make sure the
factual information you include is accurate and complete. And even though
there is no one word or phrase you can use to signal a descriptive statement,
still be consistent with the wording you do use.

For example, to describe a landlord's business in the background section of
a lease, simply state what that business is, like this:

 The Landlord owns and manages over 1,000 rental units in northern
 central Florida.

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
Also, since you initially refer to the rental properties as "units," don't refer
to them elsewhere in the agreement as "apartments." Consistently use the
word "units" every time you refer to them in the agreement.

Another example of a descriptive statement is a representation and
warranty. If you want to include that type of statement in a contract, it is
important to state who is making the statement and to whom it is being
made, like this:

 The Borrower represents and warrants to the Lender that it is a duly
 organized and existing New York corporation.

Representations and warranties actually serve two functions. One is to
create a default if it turns out the information isn't true. If the borrower in
the above example isn't duly organized and existing, and the lender finds
out, the borrower will be in default, and the lender will be able to call the
loan. The other is sometimes called an "audit function." When a party asks
a corporation to represent that it is duly organized and existing, what the
party really want is for the corporation's lawyer to check and make sure the
corporation has been following all the required corporate formalities. In
other words, you add the representation so the other party will check and
make sure it's true before the document is signed.

The differences between a representation and warranty and any other
descriptive statement are the following: (1) a representation and warranty is
a statement that is relied on by the other party to enter into the agreement;
and (2) the other party has the right to end the relationship or otherwise
back out of the deal if it turns out the representation and warranty is not
true. So, for example, if one party is paying substantially more money for
a small house because they were told the house was the boyhood home of
former president George Washington, and, if it turns out that is not true, the
party does not want to go through with the purchase, then that statement
should be a representation and warranty.

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
When you are drafting descriptive statements beware of future tense
statements. Often a future tense descriptive statement is more appropriately
drafted as an obligation or a past or present tense statement. For example, a
provision stating "the Equipment will be clean and ready for use by the
Closing" is likely inappropriate. If you want to make sure Equipment is
clean, you need to obligate a party to the agreement to clean it. A
descriptive statement won't accomplish that result. Similarly, a provision
stating "the Equipment will include batteries" is also likely inappropriate. If
the Equipment includes batteries then make that part of the definition for
the term Equipment. Alternatively, if you haven't defined the term
Equipment include the batteries in your description of what the equipment
is.

The hard part for a novice draftsperson is not so much drafting the
provision correctly, it is recognizing when something the client tells you is
an obligation, when it is a right, when it is a prohibition, and when it is a
descriptive statement. Whenever one party wants to obligate another party
to do something in the future, whether they use the words "agrees to," or "is
responsible for," or "promises," what they are describing is an obligation.
If I were drafting the applicable provision, I would use the word "will" in
that situation.

Whenever one party gives another party the right to do something in the
future, whether they use the words "can" or "has discretion to," that is an
example of a right. In that situation, I would use the word "may" to draft
the clause.

And when one party wants to prohibit another party from doing something,
whether they use the words "can't," "may not," or "prohibit," they are
describing a prohibition. If you are using "shall" for obligations, use "shall
not" for prohibitions. As for me, I prefer to use "will not." What is
important is not so much which word you choose, but that you use it
consistently. To draft clearly and without ambiguity, you must distinguish

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
among obligations, rights, prohibitions and descriptive statements, and draft
each type of provision the same way every time.

                                  Practice Exercises
             In the Appendix to this book there are instructions (either a
 memorandum from a senior attorney or a transcript of an initial client
 intake) for drafting the following contracts:
         1. Associate Employment Agreement
         2. Laptop Purchase Agreement
         3. Residential Lease Agreement
         4. Sale of Assets Agreement and
         5. Consulting Services Agreement.
         Before drafting one or more of those agreements, take each piece
 of information in the instructions and determine whether it should

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
properly be drafted as an obligation, a right, a prohibition or a descriptive
statement. To complete this exercise, use the following chart:

3. AVOIDING POTENTIALLY
AMBIGUOUS WORDS AND
PHRASES

I n addition to clearly, consistently and completely drafting obligations,
      rights, prohibitions, and descriptive statements, there are a number of
      potentially ambiguous words and phrases you need to avoid. Using
"months" or the word "within" in deadlines can make them unclear.
Misplacing time periods and dates in conditions can create ambiguity; and
making an indefinite pronoun reference also makes a sentence unclear. It is
important to avoid the mistakes of leaving the party out of obligations and
attempting to obligate a non-party. Don't use phrases like and/or and etc. in
an agreement. And avoid excessive legalese and redundancy in the contract
provisions you draft.

A. Make Clear the Trigger Date, Duration, and End Date for Time
Deadlines

Time deadlines are primary source of ambiguity in contracts. You may not
have thought about it, but a statement like "the Contractor will pay the
Subcontractor within one (1) month" is rife with ambiguity. One month
from when? The statement doesn't say when the clock starts ticking.
Which month? Not all months are 30 days long. February has twenty-eight
days; January has thirty-one days. Is one month from February 15th, March
15th (the same day a month later) or March 17th (30 days later)? Also, can

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
the Subcontractor pay on the last day or do they have to pay before the last
day? Does "within" mean "on or before" or "before"? There is no clear
answer to any of those questions.

To avoid these ambiguities, there are three things you need to address when
you draft a time deadline. First, use language that clearly indicates whether
payment can happen on the last day or if it must be received before the last
day, like "on or before," "before," "on or after," "after," "no later than," or
"at least." Don't use words like "within" or "by." So, you would start like
this:

 The Contractor will pay the Subcontractor on or before

Rather than use months to describe the time period (or even weeks), it is
preferable to use days. Why? Because every day is twenty-four hours long,
no matter which day it is. So, draft it like this:

 The Contractor will pay the Subcontractor on or before the thirtieth
 (30th) day

And don't forget to include the date the period starts to run. Some
practitioners refer to that as the "trigger date."

 The Contractor will pay the Subcontractor on or before the thirtieth
 (30th) day after the Project is completed.

Also, ask yourself what should happen if the last day of the time period is a
Saturday or Sunday or a legal holiday. Likely, it is not the parties intent to
require performance on a weekend or a holiday. The way to remedy that is
to add an interpretive statement, like this:

 "Business Day" means Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or
 Friday, but does not include any federal holiday. If any deadline or

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
 time period in this Agreement ends on a day other than a Business
 Day, then performance is due on the next Business Day.
Now that is much clearer than "The Contractor will pay the Subcontractor
within one (1) month."

B. Don't "Sandwich" the Time Period in Conditions
Conditions are another potential source of ambiguity in agreements.
Drafting them is no different than the way you would do it normally (use
"if" and "then," "unless" or "except"). An obligation can be subject to a
condition, a grant of rights can be subject to a condition, and a prohibition
can be subject to a condition. For example, failing to pay timely is usually
the condition to incurring a late fee:
 If the Contractor fails to timely pay the Subcontractor, then the
 Contractor will pay the Subcontractor a late fee in the amount of
 $25.00.
When you draft a provision like this be careful not to "sandwich" a time
period in the middle of the condition. If you do that your condition will be
ambiguous. Here is an example:

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
 If the Contractor fails to timely pay the Subcontractor on or before the
 thirtieth (30th) day after the Project is completed the Contractor will pay
 the Subcontractor a late fee in the amount of $25.00.

Does the Contractor have to pay the Subcontractor on or before the thirtieth
day after the Project is completed? Or does the Contractor have to pay the
late fee on or before the thirtieth day after the Project is completed? The
provision is ambiguous because the time deadline is "sandwiched" right in
between the two phrases. It could apply to the first phrase or it could apply
to the second phrase. To resolve this ambiguity, make sure you put the time
deadline within the phrase to which it applies, like this:

 If the Contractor fails to timely pay the Subcontractor, the
 Contractor will pay the Subcontractor a late fee in the amount of
 $25.00 on or before the thirtieth (30th) day after the Project is
 completed .

This principle applies to modifiers generally. A modifier is a word or
phrase in a sentence that modifies another word or phrase. If you misplace
a modifier, the result is an ambiguous sentence. To rectify that issue,
remember to always place the modifier as close as possible to the word or
phrase it modifies.

C. Avoid Gender Pronouns

I would also recommend that you avoid gender specific pronouns like "he,"
"she," "his," and "hers" in your contracts. If you use them in a provision in
a form document, like this: "the Broker will perform his duties to the
satisfaction of the Seller," you are going to have to remember to change
"his" to "her" every time the gender of the broker changes. Or you could
have one set of forms for men and another set for women. But the preferred
method would be to get into the habit of not using the pronouns at all, like
this: "the Broker will perform the Broker's duties to the satisfaction of the

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
Seller." Do that and you won't have to worry about checking all your
pronouns every time you draft a document.

Another reason to omit pronouns is because they can be a source of
ambiguity if not used properly. If you write a sentence like this: "The
Contractor will arrange for delivery of the Equipment to the Subcontractor,
at his sole cost and expense" it is unclear whether "his" refers to the
Contractor or the Subcontractor. That is called an indefinite pronoun
reference; and it also makes a sentence ambiguous. To fix it, omit the
pronoun, like this: "The Contractor will arrange for the delivery of the
Equipment to the Subcontractor, at the Contractor's sole cost and expense."

You should also note that using the words "they" or "their" as a substitute
for gender pronouns does not solve the potential ambiguity in the previous
sentence. If you had written "The Contractor will arrange for delivery of
the Equipment to the Subcontractor, at their sole cost and expense" the
sentence would have still been ambiguous. So I would also recommend
you avoid gender neutral pronouns, unless it is clear who the pronoun refers
to.

D. Don't Omit the Party from Obligations, Rights and Prohibitions

Make sure you don't leave the party out of your obligations, rights and
prohibitions. In other words, don't write: "The house will have a concrete
foundation." If you are drafting an obligation, you need to say who you are
obligating to do the work. If you don't, you have created what's called a
"false obligation." The obligation is there but it isn't given to anyone. To
rectify that issue, you would instead say "the Builder will construct the
house with a concrete foundation." Again, if you are drafting an obligation,
right, or prohibition, start with the name of the party you are obligating,
empowering, or prohibiting. And then, you won't have to worry about
creating false obligations.

E. Don't Obligate, Prohibit, or Empower People Who Are Not Parties to
the Contract

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
Also make sure you don't include non-parties in your obligations, rights,
and prohibitions. For example, if your contract is between a Contractor and
a Subcontractor, don't draft an obligation that purports to obligate
employees of the Subcontractor to do something. The employees are not
parties to the contract. Rather, obligate the Subcontractor to instruct its
employees to do something or obligate the Subcontractor to ensure that they
do it. So, don't write "Employees of the Subcontractor will obtain adequate
training before operating the Equipment." Write something like "the
Subcontractor will adequately train the Subcontractor's employees before
permitting them to use the Equipment."

F. Avoid Using "And/Or" and "Etc."

The phrase "and/or" is yet another source of ambiguity. The word "or"
means one, the other (either), or both, so just write "or", not "and/or". In a
famous Florida case the court admonished against the use of "and/or",
stating:

    ...we take our position with that distinguished company of lawyers
    who have condemned its use. It is one of those inexcusable
    barbarisms which were sired by indolence and damned by
    indifference, and has no more place in legal terminology than the
    vernacular of Uncle Remus has in Holy Writ. I am unable to divine
    how such senseless jargon becomes current. The coiner of it
    certainly had no appreciation for terse and concise law English.

Cochrane v. Fla. E. Coast Rwy. Co., 145 So. 217, 218-219 (Fla. 1932).
Instead of writing "The Tenant may use the patio and/or the lanai attached
to the Unit," revise the language to read "The Tenant may use the patio
attached to the Unit or the lanai attached to the Unit" or, if it is appropriate
to make crystal clear the use of both is also permitted, then write "The
Tenant may use the patio attached to the Unit or the lanai attached to the
Unit or both."

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
It should go without saying that the abbreviation "etc." is not appropriate to
use in a written contract; and writing it out as "et cetera" is not appropriate
either. The abbreviation and the word mean "the rest." If you want to
include "the rest" in a contact, you need to say what the rest is. Instead of
writing, "the Unit is comprised of one bedroom, one bathroom, etc." say
"the Unit is comprised of one bedroom, one bathroom, one living room, a
galley kitchen, a covered patio and a single parking space."

G. Avoid Excessive Legalese

Avoid using excessive legalese in a modern business agreement. We don't
wear powdered wigs anymore. We don't go to work on horseback. And no
one still has wooden teeth. The 1800's have come and gone. We should
use the language of the age in which we practice. We shouldn't use phrases
like "witnesseth," "whereas," "hereinafter," "now therefore," or
"hereinbefore" in contracts because no one talks that way anymore.

I know many lawyers would argue that adding just a little legalese here and
there doesn't hurt anything and it makes the document look more
"official." In other words, it's a matter of style. So, to be clear, if you are
revising someone else's document that has legalese in it, I would not
recommend that you go through the document and delete all the archaic
expressions. But if you are drafting from scratch, my personal preference is
to avoid using legalese altogether.

However, I also recognize the real problem is with overusing those types of
archaic legal expressions. Consider the following example of an indentured
servant agreement from the 1700's. This contract is very simple and short,

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
but the legalese is so intense it is hard to decipher the intent. If you want to
understand why educators rail against legalese, try reading this document:

    Indentured Servant Contract

    This Indenture, Made the Fourth Day of August in the Twenty-ninth
    Year of the Reign of our Sovereign Lord George the Second King of
    Great Britain, And in the Year of our Lord, One Thousand Seven
    Hundred and fifty five Between William Buckland of Baford
    Carpenter & Joiner of the one Part, and Thomson Mason of
    London, Esq. of the other Part, Witnesseth, That the said William
    Buckland for the Consideration herein after-mentioned, hath, and
    by these Presents doth Covenant, Grant, and Agree to, and with the
    said Thomas Mason Executors and assigns, That He the said
    William Buckland shall and will, as a faithful Covenant Servant,
    well and truly serve the said Thomas Mason his Executors and
    assigns in the Plantation of Virginia beyond the Seas, for the Space
    of Four Years, next ensuing his Arrival in the said Plantation in the
    Employment of a Carpenter and Joiner. And the said William
    Buckland doth hereby Covenant and Declare himself, now to be the
    Age of Twenty two Years Single and no Covenant or contracted
    Servant to any other Person or Persons, And the said Thomas
    Mason for himself his Executors Or Assigns, in Consideration
    thereof, doth hereby Covenant, Promise And Agree to and with the
    said William Buckland his Executors, and Assigns, that He the said
    Thomas Mason his Executors or Assigns, shall and will at his or
    their own proper Costs and Charges, with what convenient Speed
    they may, carry and convey, or cause to be carried and conveyed
    over unto the said Plantation, the said William Buckland and from
    henceforth, and during the said Voyage, and also during the said
    Term, shall and will at the like Costs and Charges, provide for and
    allow the said William Buckland all necessary Meat, Drink,
    Washing, and Lodging, fit and convenient for William as Covenant
    Servants in such Cases are usually provided for and allowed and

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
    pay and allow William Buckland Wages on Salary at the Rate of
    Twenty Pounds Sterling per Annum Payable Quarterly And for the
    true Performance of the Premises, the said Parties, the these
    Presents bind themselves, their Executors and Administrators, the
    either to the other, in the Penal Sum of Forty Pounds Sterling,
    firmly by these Presents. In witness whereof, they have hereunto
    interchanged by set their Hands and Seals, the Day and Year above-
    written.

Here is the same agreement without the legalese and applying the protocols
I discussed in Chapters Two and Three:

    Indentured Servant Contract

    On August 4, 1755, William Buckland (Buckland) and Thomson
    Mason (Mason) agree as follows:

    1. Buckland will serve Mason in the Plantation of Virginia for the
    term of four years as a carpenter and joiner.

    2. Buckland represents to Mason that Buckland is twenty-two years
    old, single, and not contracted to serve any other person.

    3. Mason will, at Mason's own cost, carry and convey Buckland to
    the Plantation.

    4. Mason will, at Mason's own cost, provide necessary meat, drink,
    washing, and lodging for Buckland.

    5. Mason will pay Buckland wages at the rate of twenty pounds
    sterling per annum payable quarterly.

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
    Executed as of the date above.

That is much clearer than it was, isn't it? It turns out the agreement was
very simple and straight forward. But the legalese was so excessive it
obscured the substance of the agreement. To avoid that happening to the
documents you draft, stick with modern English. Use the language people
use today, not the language people used 300 years ago.

H. Avoid Excessive Redundancy

Another thing to watch out for is excessively redundant phrases in contract
drafting. One place you will commonly see them is in a Release of Claims.
Instead of just describing the releasing party as, for example, the
"Corporation" the document will add "on its own behalf and on behalf of its
subsidiaries and other affiliates, and its and their respective representatives
and the respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns
of each of the foregoing." And instead of just saying the Corporation
releases the other party of whatever "claims" it may have, the document
will say the Corporation releases the other party from "past, present or
future claims, rights, orders, causes of action, suits, liabilities, debts, dues,
sums of money, accounts, actions, reckonings, bonds, bills, specialties,
covenants, contracts, controversies, counterclaims, cross-claims, defenses,
obligations, promises, costs, damages, judgments, extents, executions,
losses and demands of any kind, nature or description in any forum
whatsoever."

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
Lawyers draft that way when they are more concerned with being thorough
than being clear. They want to make sure they have covered every
conceivable situation so that their client is fully and completely protected.
But sometimes they go too far and end up creating a provision that is
wordy, awkward and ambiguous. Contrary to popular belief, lawyers don't
get paid by the word. So also try to avoid excessively redundant phrases
like these whenever practicable.

I. Avoid Passive Voice

Avoid passive voice when drafting contract provisions. If you write "the
house will be painted red by the Seller," you are putting the focus on the
house. But that's not what you want to do. You want to put the focus on
the Seller, not the house. You are assigning the obligation to a person not a
thing. And you do that by using active voice. In other words, you do that
by writing it this way: "the Seller will paint the house red." Drafting an
obligation, right, or prohibition, by starting with the name of the party you
are obligating, empowering, or prohibiting ensures you don't run afoul of
any this rule or the preceding two rules.

The only exception I can think of is for the exordium and the testimonium.
When drafting either of those descriptive statements, it is acceptable to put
the focus on the document, not the parties, since both of those statements
describe the execution of the document itself, not the provisions of the
agreement between the parties.

J. Write Numbers Consistently

There are three common ways to write a number in a contract. You can
write the number numerically. You can write the number in words. Or you
can write the number in words and also numerically in parenthesis, like this:

                                            30
                                          Thirty

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
                                       Thirty (30)

You have probably noticed I have been writing numbers out in words, then
putting the numeral in parenthesis in this book. There is a simple reason I
got into the habit of doing it that way, and that is because I have found it is
harder to make a mistake when you write a number out. Writing
$1,917,432 instead of $1,197,432 seems like a relatively minor typo. I just
transposed the 9 and the 1. But that little typo could result in a $720,000
malpractice claim, if it isn't corrected before the document is signed.

Spelling plaintiff with three (3) f's in an appellate brief, might cause a little
damage to your reputation, but doing that will not likely cause any
monetary harm. In contrast, typos involving numbers in contracts,
especially big dollar numbers, can have a direct adverse monetary impact
on the drafter. That is why I prefer to spell numbers out, especially when I
am referring to large dollar amounts.

Also, in practice I primarily handled finance transactions, and dollar
amounts in promissory notes are always written out (like they are written in
checks). So, instead of writing $100,000, I would write the number out,
like this:

 One hundred thousand and 00/100 dollars ($100,000.00).

But I also recognize, no one way of writing numbers is any more or less
clear than any other. In other words, how you choose to write numbers in
an agreement is another matter of style. So just be consistent with how you
chose to do it.

In summary, pay a extra attention to time periods to make sure you
articulate them clearly. Be clear what the trigger date is, how long the
duration is in days, and whether the last day is included. Make sure
modifiers are as close as possible to the words or phrases they modify,

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
especially when you articulate a condition. Solve the indefinite pronoun
reference problem by not using them at all. Don't leave the party out of
obligations, rights, and prohibitions; and don't put nonparties in obligations,
rights, and prohibitions. Avoid ambiguous phrases like and/or and etc.
Watch out for excessive legalese and redundancy in contract provisions.
Draft in active voice and write numbers consistently. Also, pay extra
attention to large dollar amounts. Lawyers are trained to pay close attention
to language, but it is the numbers that can really get you into trouble.

Now that we have covered how to clearly and unambiguously draft
obligations, right, prohibitions and descriptive statements, and what
potentially ambiguous words and phrases to avoid, we will next talk about
how to organize the provisions of a contract. Sentences are made clear by
keeping them simple, accurately and precisely describing factual
information, and drafting the same provisions the same way. A contract is
made clear by grouping and ordering the contract's provisions in an
organized way. That is the subject of the next few chapters.

                                  Practice Exercises
             Correct the errors in the following contract provisions:
 1. The Buyer will pay the Seller $100,000 (one hundred thousand
 dollars) within a week after the completion aforementioned Project.
 2. If the Buyer desires to inspect the Property, they will use their
 inspector. Notice of the approval of said inspection will be provided by
 the Buyer prior to Closing.
 3. Whereas, notice will be provided by document, paper, writing, hard
 copy and/or physical form, etc., no other communication, signal, utterance
 or notification shall be herewith required.
 4. After approval the Seller's employees will construct the Project. Only
 materials listed in the Specifications will be used, unless the Buyer

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
notifies the Seller of her waiver of any particular specification and her
approval of any substitute material.
5. If the Buyer fails to pay the Seller by a month the Buyer will pay the
Seller a late fee of in the amount of $25.00.

4. ORGANIZING A
CONTRACT'S BEGINNING
SECTIONS

A greements typically start with a title, then an introductory
            paragraph that identifies the parties, the document, and the date.
            There is no requirement to include a background section, but it is
often helpful to include one. In a short document, definitions are usually

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
created in context; but in a longer document, when you have a lot of
definitions, it is often advisable to include a definitions section. The same
is true of representations and warranties. If you have a lot, it would be best
to create a section for them and put the section near the beginning of the
agreement. Those are the beginning sections of a contract. In this chapter I
will discuss how to draft each section clearly and unambiguously.

A. Identify the Type of Agreement in the Title

Contracts typically start with a title describing the type of agreement
involved. If you are drafting a lease agreement for the rental of a residential
apartment, don't just title it "Agreement." That doesn't distinguish it from
any other agreement. And don't write a title that goes too far in the other
direction, like this: "Agreement between Landlord Corp. and Tammy
Tenant Concerning the Rental of the Apartment at 123 Main Street in
Gainesville, Florida." That's too much information. Most of it belongs in
the body of the agreement, not the title. Just identify the type of agreement,
like this:

                               APARTMENT LEASE

I capitalized, centered, and underlined the title to make it stand out. You
can also use bold to make a title (or a heading) stand out in an agreement
(or some other combination of one or more of those four techniques). But
don't do things like italicizing letters, making the font bigger, or using any
type of graphics. That will just make the agreement look tacky. Keep it
professional!

B. Start with an Exordium (Preamble or Introduction)

After the title there should be an introductory section called the
"exordium." ("Exordium" is Latin for "a beginning" or "commencement."
Lewis & Short, Latin Dictionary.) The exordium is a description of what
the parties are doing (entering into a contract). It contains the date of the

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
agreement, the identity of the parties, and the title of the document, as well
as short-hand references for the parties and the document. There are two
ways to do it. One is passive voice and puts the emphasis on the document,
like this:

 This Apartment Lease (Lease) is entered into on this___ day of
 ____________, 20__, by and between Landlord Corp., a Florida
 corporation, having an office at 57 West Street, Gainesville, Florida
 (Landlord) and Tammy Tenant of 75 First Street, Gainesville, Florida
 (Tenant).

The other is active voice and puts the emphasis on the parties, like this:

 On ___________ ___, 20__, Landlord Corp., a Florida corporation,
 having an office at 57 West Street, Gainesville, Florida (Landlord)
 and Tammy Tenant of 75 First Street, Gainesville, Florida (Tenant)
 enter into this Apartment Lease (Lease).

I personally prefer the active voice form, but many attorneys also use the
other one. What is important in drafting an exordium is not so much the
form you use, but the information you include and the way you express that
information. To identify a person, you need the person's full name and
address. To identify an entity like a corporation, you need the entity's name
and address, but you also need to know the state in which the entity was
organized. This information is important for a number of reasons.

First and foremost, a contract entered into with the wrong party or
something that is not an actual party, is worthless. If you start a real estate
purchase agreement by stating "Lancaster Williams" is the seller, but title to
the property is actually held by "Lancaster Family Trust," you have made a
serious mistake. If you are drafting an agreement for the purchase of
business assets and you state the seller is "Frannie's Pizza," your contract is
no good. "Frannie's Pizza" may be the name of the business but it is not a

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
person or entity. You must state the name of the owner, Frannie Salpietro,
and then you can add "d/b/a Frannie's Pizza."

Second, you must include addresses to further identify the parties and
enable them to provide notice to each other. A loan agreement may require
a lender to give a borrower notice of default, so it is helpful if the
agreement says where the borrower is located. If the same agreement is
breached and the lender wants to sue the borrower, it will, again, be helpful
to know where the borrower can be served with the summons and
complaint.

When you draft the exordium, you must express this information
accurately. Make sure you have the party names correct. Also, when you
refer to the document the parties are entering into, make sure you describe it
accurately. Don't say the parties "enter into this rental agreement" if you
have titled the contract "apartment lease." State the parties "enter into this
apartment lease."

Finally, if the date of the agreement is different than the date it is signed,
date the agreement "as of" the effective date in the exordium, or define the
"Effective Date" in the body of the agreement.

After the exordium, you need to insert what are called "words of
agreement." In older agreements, you would do that by saying something
like "Now, therefore, in consideration of the mutual covenants herein
contained, the parties agree as follows" or "Now, therefore, for good and
valuable consideration the sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged,
the parties agree to the following." But today the preferred practice is to
leave out the legalese and the recitation of consideration and just add the
following sentence to the end of the exordium: "The parties mutually agree
as follows." Alternatively, If a background section is included (discussed
below), it is common to add "Accordingly, the parties agree as follows"
after the background section. Either way is fine.

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
C. Consider Including a Background Section

After the exordium you may want to include a background section. A
contract does not have to have a background section, but it is often helpful
to include one. For example, you may want to explain the events that led
up to the creation of the contract or the context within which the contract is
signed. For example, if you are drafting an employment agreement, you
could do something like this:

 I. Background of Agreement

 A. Search for Employees. The Employer conducted a nationwide
 search for qualified trial attorneys by posting an advertisement in the
 journal of the American Bar Association.

 B. Submission of Resume. The Employee responded to the
 advertisement by submitting a current resume listing the Employee's
 education, employment and outside affiliations (Resume), a true and
 accurate copy of which is attached to this Agreement as Exhibit A.

 C. Offer of Employment. The Employer interviewed the Employee
 and offered the Employee employment; and the Employee accepted
 the offer.

I also used this section to authenticate the employee's resume, and I created
a short-hand term for that document. I did that so I would have a simple but
accurate way to refer to the resume in the body of the agreement. For
example, I might want the employee to represent to the employer that the
statements in the Resume are truthful. If it turns out the employee was
lying, that would constitute a breach, enabling the employer to end the
relationship.

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
Another reason you may want to do a background section is to describe the
parties and the subject matter of the agreement. For example, if you were
drafting an equipment lease, you might do something like this:

 I. Background of Agreement

 A. Business of Food Service Corp. Food Service Corp. is in the
 business of operating food service kiosks in shopping malls in
 Northern Central Florida.

 B. Equipment for Kiosks. Food Service Corp. has determined that
 it is in its best interests to lease, rather than purchase the kitchen
 equipment for its food kiosks.

 C. Business of Supply Corp. Supply Corp. is in the business of
 leasing commercial kitchen equipment to restaurants and other food
 service providers in Florida.

 D. Equipment for Lease. This Agreement concerns the following
 pieces of equipment: one Vulcan VC44GD - Double Deck Gas
 Convection Oven, Mfg Part#: VC44GD, one Anets SLG100 -
 Commercial Gas Fryer, 70 to 100 Lb. Oil Capacity, Mfg Part#:
 SLG100, one True T-49F - Commercial Freezer - Two Door - Reach-
 In - 49 Cu. Ft., Mfg Part#: T-49F-HC and three Kratos TT-244 -
 Stainless Steel Work Tables with Galvanized Undershelf,
 48"Wx24"D, Mfg Part#: KRA-4824 (collectively, the Equipment).

I used this background section primarily to describe the subject matter of
the contract, which is the kitchen equipment, and create a short-hand
reference for the Equipment. What is most important in this section is that
the description is accurate and complete. Later in the agreement I will have
an obligation stating something like: "Supply Corp. will lease the

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
Equipment to Food Service Corp. for $_________." If the definition is not
accurate and complete, that obligation will not work, and neither will any of
the other obs and provisions involving the Equipment.

I was also very specific when I described the Equipment. If I had said the
Equipment consisted of "an oven, a fryer, a freezer and three (3)
worktables," the description would have been ambiguous. So, another way
to achieve clarity is by being specific when you describe something,
especially something important like the subject matter of the contract.

D. Use Short-Hand References (Definitions)

After the background section you may also want to include a section listing
all the defined terms in the agreement. The phrase "defined terms" is a
misnomer. What we are really talking about is short-hand references; but
they are commonly referred to as definitions. To this point, I have been
defining terms within each sentence as they came up. Doing it that way, the
convention is to describe the item in detail then put a short-hand reference
in parenthesis, capitalizing the first letter of each word (you can also put
quotation marks before and after the reference, but it is not necessary to do
that). So, if you had a statement describing a car in a purchase and sale
contract, it might look like this:

 The subject matter of this Agreement is a 1963 Ferrari 250 GTO
 having the chassis number 4153 GT (the Car).

Again, you could put the definition in quotes, like this: (the "Car"). Either
way is fine; just be consistent. But don't put the definition before the
description, put it after. So, in the example above, don't say "the subject
matter of this Agreement (the Car) is a 1963 Ferrari 250 GTO with chassis
number 4153 GT." Put the definition, (the Car), at the end of the
description.

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
The reason for doing this is to be absolutely clear you are referring to the
most expensive car ever sold: the 1963 Ferrari 250 GTO, with the chassis
number 4153 GT (the car that won the Tour de France), whenever you refer
to the Car in the agreement. You don't want to have to repeat all that
information every time you refer to the Car, but you still want to make sure
your references to it are clear, accurate, and complete. And the definition
accomplishes that result.

When you are drafting definitions, avoid including rights, obligations and
prohibitions in your definitions. They should all just be descriptive
statements. And avoid unnecessary definitions. For example, it is
appropriate to define something like this:

 This Contract concerns the sale of the land with the building thereon
 located at 51 West Street in Miami, Florida consisting of 3 acres and a
 3,000 square foot 3 bedroom, 2 bathroom home with attached 2 car
 garage (the Property) .

But it is unnecessary and inappropriate to define things like this:

 The Company is in the business of selling greeting cards (Greeting Cards)
 to customers in central Florida (Customers) at retail establishments
 (Establishments) in local shopping malls (Malls).

In fact, if you are drafting a simple contract, it is often only appropriate to
define the parties, the subject matter and the agreement itself. So be careful
not to over do it with definitions!

If you have multiple terms in an agreement, it is sometimes better to put all
the definitions in one place, usually at the beginning of the agreement, right
after the background section. The convention is to alphabetize the list of
terms, put each term in quotes instead of parenthesis, capitalize the first
letter, use the word "means," and then state a detailed description. Here is
an example from a loan agreement:

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
 II. Definitions of Terms

 The following terms have the following meanings:

 "Loan" means the loan of $100,000.00 to the Borrower by the Lender
 pursuant to this Agreement.

 "Loan Documents" means i) the Note; (ii) the Mortgage; and (iii) this
 Agreement.

 "Mortgage" means the Mortgage of even date from the Borrower to
 the Lender granting the Lender a mortgage on the Mortgaged
 Property.

 "Mortgaged Property" means the land, together with all the buildings
 and improvements on the land, situated at 123 Main Street in
 Gainesville, Florida.

 "Note" means the Promissory Note of even date made by the
 Borrower in the amount of One Hundred Thousand Dollars
 ($100,000.00), payable to the order of the Lender.

I didn't define the terms Lender, Borrower or Agreement in the list because
those terms would have already been defined in the exordium.

The important thing is that the presentation is clear, accurate, and complete.
If the actual loan amount is $1,000,000 not $100,000 then it doesn't matter
what form is used. The document has a problem. If there is a security
agreement in addition to the mortgage, then the definition of the Loan
Documents, and all the references to it in the loan agreement, will not

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
accomplish their intended purpose. The same thing is true if there is a typo
in the property address. It is important to learn the forms that are typically
used for drafting contracts, but not at the expense of substance. Ultimately,
it is the substance that matters most.

E. List Representations and Warranties, if Applicable

After the definitions section, if there is one, you will on occasion want to
include one more section; and that is a statement of the representations and
warranties a party relied on in entering into the contract. Like definitions,
representations and warranties can just be included within each provision as
they come up. For example, in the background section of the employment
agreement mentioned earlier, you might add a representation, like this:

*  *  *

C. Submission of Resume. The Employee responded to the
advertisement by submitting a current resume listing his education,
employment, and outside affiliations (Resume), a true and accurate
copy of which is attached to this Agreement as Exhibit A.

D. Accuracy of Information. The Employee represents and
warrants to the Employer that the information in the Resume is
truthful and accurate.

However, if you have multiple representations and warranties you want to
include in an agreement, it is usually better to put them all in one place,
right after the background and definitions sections. Just make it clear who
is making the representations and to whom they are being made. And since
these are descriptive statements, use present or past tense. Here is an
example from a purchase and sale agreement:

   Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
 III. Representations and Warranties of Seller

 The Seller makes the following representations and warranties to the
 Buyer:

 1. Pumping of Septic. The Seller arranged for the pumping of the
 septic on the Property once per year for every year the Seller has
 owned the Property.

 2. Potability of Water. The water from the well on the Property is
 potable.

 3. Permits for Improvements. The Seller obtained a permit for all
 improvements done to the Property.

 4. Storage or Disposal of Waste. The Seller did not store or
 dispose of any hazardous wastes on the Property.

You need to be careful not to over do representations and warranties by
including what should be background statements (e.g. descriptions of the
subject matter of the agreement), obligations, rights and prohibitions. Here
are examples statements incorrectly listed as representations and warranties:

 III. Representations and Warranties of Seller

 The Seller makes the following representations and warranties to the
 Buyer:

 1. Features of Car. The Car is a black four dour sedan with a six
 cylinder engine, and four wheel disc brakes.

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
2. Sale of Car. The Seller will sell the car to the Buyer.

3. Inspection of Car. The Buyer may inspect the car before the
Closing.

4. Use of Car by Seller. After this Agreement is signed the Seller
will not use drive the car for any distance, except in connection with
the inspection.

After the performance of a purchase agreement (i.e. after the closing
occurs) the substantive rights and obligations of the parties end. If the
purpose of the representations is to give the party receiving them the right
to cancel the agreement if it turns out they are not true, then they are fine
the way they are. But if you want the party receiving the representation to
be able to take legal action if that party discovers the representation is false
after the transaction closes, then you need to state in the agreement that the
representation "survives" the closing, like this:

*  *  *

2. Potability of Water. The water from the well on the Property is
potable. This representation and warranty survives the closing of
title under this Agreement.

*  *  *

F. Add Headings to Sections and Subsections

As you can see, I started each of these sections with a heading describing
the content. When you change to a new topic, you should add a heading

Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
before you start. And when you draft the heading, consider the same issues
discussed at the beginning of this chapter on titles. Try to avoid one-word
headings, like "Payment." Ask yourself "who," "what," "when," "where,"
or "how," depending upon which applies. So, in this case, ask, payment for
what? And use the heading "Payment for Rent." Instead of "Restrictions,"
use "Restrictions on Use." Instead of "Termination," use "Termination of
Services."

Also, if you have multiple subsections under the heading, number them (or
use letters). As long as the subsections are not just an itemized list, add
headings to the subsections as well. Headings are like pepperoni slices on
pizza; there is no such thing as too many. The only exception is if you just
have one subsection. In that case, don't number or letter it, or give it a
separate heading. Only add headings to subsections if you have two or
more subsections.

You will also notice I broke the text up in each of these sections instead of
grouping it all into one paragraph. These sections are short enough that
either way would have probably been fine. On the one hand, you shouldn't
feel like every sentence in an agreement has to be in a separate section.
Grouping like provisions is a good practice to get into. On the other hand,
if your section is getting bigger than about half a page, it is probably time to
break it up.

To recap, a contract typically starts out with a title and an exordium. To
complete the exordium, you will need the name, address, and state of
organization of the parties. Next is a background section, which you can
use to describe the events leading up to the contract, or the parties and the
subject matter. If it is a sale of goods contract, describe the goods
involved. If it is a services contract, describe the services.

A short agreement will not need a definitions section, but a lengthy
document containing a lot of defined terms may need one. Representations
and warranties can also be included in the background section or in the
body of the agreement if there are only a few of them. But in a longer,

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
more complex document, involving a long list of representations, the better
practice is to include a representations and warranties section. Those are
the sections you will typically find in the beginning of contracts. Follow
the advice in this chapter to draft each section clearly and without
ambiguity.

5. DRAFTING THE CORE
OBLIGATIONS AND
ORGANIZING DEAL
PROVISIONS

ow that we have gone through title, exordium, background, definitions and
representations, and warranties sections, we can finally get into the meat of

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
Nthe agreement: the core obligations and duration, if applicable. Then the
            details of the deal, organized by substance or chronologically,
            whichever is clearer.

A. Start with the Core of the Agreement

Agreements typically consist of an exchange of bilateral promises. For an
agreement to work, the drafter needs to obligate both sides to do what they
agreed to do. Usually, the best practice is to start broad and then get more
specific. That means the agreement should start with the core obligations: a
statement of the basic exchange between the parties.

I will go over three types of agreements; each involves a different core
exchange. The first type is a term agreement that governs the relationship
of the parties over time. An example of that is an apartment lease or
employment agreement. An agreement like that will need a statement of
duration or term in addition to the core obligations.

The second type is a purchase and sale agreement, like a real estate
purchase and sale agreement, or an agreement for the purchase of a business
or equipment. A purchase and sale agreement will usually describe a due
diligence period, and then a closing when the real estate or goods is
exchanged for the purchase price.

And the third type of agreement is one that involves a transfer of rights, like
a mortgage, an assignment of leases and rents, or a software license
agreement. I'll give you examples of all three types of core provisions.

The core obligations for a lease might look like this:

 IV. Lease of Property
 The Landlord will lease the Property to the Tenant; and the Tenant
 will lease the Property from the Landlord.

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
Or this:

 IV. Lease of Property
 The Landlord will lease the Property to the Tenant; and the Tenant
 will pay the Landlord rent as provided in this Agreement.

The first example obligates the tenant to lease the property but doesn't
mention rent, while the second example does. If you do it the first way, you
will have an additional obligation requiring the tenant to pay rent. After
both versions you will want to subsequently state things like what the rent
amount is, when it is due, and how it is to be paid. You can put some of
those details into the core obligations, as long as it doesn't get unwieldy.
But again, the idea is to state the basic exchange first, and then get into the
details later.

Here is an example of the core obligations for a purchase and sale
agreement, which is an agreement that involves a transaction or exchange
after a due diligence period:

 IV. Sale of Condominium
 The Seller will sell the Condominium to the Buyer; and the Buyer will
 purchase the Condominium from the Seller for the Purchase Price on
 the Closing Date.

I was able to draft these obligations very concisely because I used a few
defined terms. As long as the definitions are also accurate and clear, the
obligations should work to bind both sides to do what they agreed to do.

And here is one more example. This one is from a mortgage and security
agreement. In that type of agreement, there usually is no core exchange of
obligations. Rather, the core of the agreement is simply a transfer of rights,
like this:

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
 IV. Grant of Mortgage
 The Borrower mortgages, grants, and conveys the Property to the
 Lender as security for the Loan.

I didn't use the word "will" here because this is not an obligation. The
Borrower is not going to mortgage the Property sometime in the future.
The mortgage is granted when the agreement is signed. The core of a this
type of agreement is actually a descriptive statement, describing what the
party is doing (e.g., transferring ownership, granting rights, releasing
liability).

B. Describe the Duration or Term, if Applicable

If you are drafting a term agreement, you will have to describe the term
(how long the relationship will last). Also, since the term may not start
right when the contract is signed, it is advisable to state the beginning and
ending dates. Here is an example of a duration provision in an agreement:

 V. Term of Rental
 The rental period is for three (3) years, beginning on September 1,
 2020 and ending on August 30, 2020 (the Term).

If the term renews, then you would add a statement to that effect, like "the
Term renews automatically unless either party sends the other party a notice
of non-renewal at least thirty (30) days before the end of the Term."

C. Then Draft the Specifics of the Deal

Once you have drafted the core obligations, and a duration provision, if
applicable, spell out in detail the specific terms of the deal with a series of
additional obligations, rights and prohibitions, as applicable. Obviously, the
sections of the agreement will differ depending on whether the agreement is
for a purchase and sale, like an agreement to buy real estate, or a

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
relationship over time, like a lease, or if the agreement involves a transfer of
rights, like a mortgage.

       (1) Purchase and Sale Agreement

If the document is a contract for the purchase and sale of a condominium,
for example, the seller would be required to produce the condo docs,
provide the buyer with a title insurance commitment, and draft a settlement
statement before the closing date. As a result, the provisions following the
core obligations might look like this:

 V. Organizational Documents for Condominium

 On or before the seventh (7th) day after this Agreement is signed, the
 Seller will provide the Buyer with the condominium documents for
 the Property, including the master deed, declaration of trust, and
 bylaws.

 IV. Insurance Policy for Title

 No later than fourteen (14) days before the Closing Date, the Seller
 will provide the Buyer with a title insurance commitment issued by a
 Florida licensed title insurer, with legible copies of instruments listed
 as exceptions.

 VI. Statement of Closing Costs

 At least twenty-four (24) hours before the Closing Date, the Seller will
 provide the Buyer with a completed Settlement Statement for the
 closing, detailing all costs and charges to be incurred by the Buyer
 and the Seller in connection with the sale of the Property.

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
Similarly, the buyer might be obligated to apply for financing for the
purchase, have the right to inspect the property, and have the right to a final
"walk through" before the closing occurs. As a result, a series of additional
provisions might look like this:

 VII. Inspection of Property

 On or before the fifteenth (15th) day after this Agreement is signed,
 the Buyer may inspect the Property. If the Buyer determines that the
 Property is not acceptable to the Buyer, the Buyer may terminate this
 Agreement by delivering written notice of such termination to the
 Seller prior to the expiration of this inspection period.

 VIII. Application for Financing

 On or before the thirtieth (30th) day after this Agreement is signed,
 the Buyer will apply for financing for the purchase of the Property,
 and use diligent efforts to obtain approval for such financing, in the
 amount of no more than $___________ at an initial interest rate of no
 less than %____ for a term of no more than _____ years. If the Buyer
 is unable to obtain such approval after the exercise of diligent effort,
 then the Buyer may terminate this Agreement by delivering written
 notice of such termination to the Seller prior to the expiration of this
 financing period.

 IX. Walk Through Before Closing

 On the day prior to the Closing Date, the Buyer may perform a walk-
 through inspection of the Property to confirm all items of personal
 property purchased by the Buyer have remained on the Property and
 Seller has maintained the Property as required in this Agreement.

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
       (2) Term Agreement

If the agreement is for a relationship over time, like an equipment lease,
then the core obligations might be followed by provisions relating to
shipment, use, maintenance, and access, like this:

 I. Shipment of Equipment

 The Retailer will arrange for the shipment of the Landscaping
 Equipment to the Office Complex on the first day of the Term, and
 the shipment of the Landscaping Equipment back to the Retailer on
 the last day of the Term. 

 II. Use of Equipment

 The Office Complex will use the Equipment in a safe and appropriate
 manner at all times. The Office Complex may permit its employees to
 use the Landscaping Equipment, if the employees have received
 appropriate training.

 III. Maintenance of Equipment

 The Office Complex will perform routine maintenance of the
 Landscaping Equipment, in accordance with the owner's manual for
 each piece of the Landscaping Equipment, during the Term of this
 Agreement.

 IV. Access to Equipment

 The Retailer may inspect the Landscaping Equipment at the Office
 Complex any time from 8:00 a.m. through 5:00 p.m., Monday
 through Friday.

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
       (3) Agreement for Transfer of Rights

If the agreement involves a transfer of rights, like a mortgage, then the core
transfer may be followed by requirements for the payment of indebtedness
and taxes, maintaining the property and repairing damage, and complying
with leases, like this:

 1.1 Compliance with Loan Documents

 The Borrower will perform and observe all of the terms and
 conditions of the Loan Documents, including the obligation to make
 any payments as required in the Loan Documents.

 1.2 Payment of Taxes

 The Borrower will pay or cause to be paid all taxes, water, sewer and
 other utility charges, and all other charges or assessments relating to
 the Property or the materials stored on or in the Property and other
 charges and encumbrances which are or may become a lien on the
 Property, prior to the time when interest or penalties would accrue on
 such amounts.

 1.3 Maintenance of Property

 The Borrower will keep the Property in good order, repair and
 condition, reasonable wear and tear excepted, and will not permit,
 commit or suffer any waste, impairment, deterioration or
 environmental contamination of the Property.

 1.4 Repair of Damage

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
 The Borrower will promptly repair, restore, rebuild, replace, or alter
 as necessary any portion of the Property which may be damaged or
 destroyed by fire or other casualty, as nearly as possible to the
 condition such improvements were in prior to such damage or
 destruction. The Borrower will give the Lender notice of any damage
 to the Property no later than five (5) business days after any such
 damage occurs.

 1.5 Compliance with Leases

 The Borrower will comply with and observe its obligations as
 landlord under leases affecting the Property.

Depending upon the circumstances, it may be best to organize the
provisions of the contract by substance. For example, you may organize an
agreement with all the payment provisions in one section, and additional
rights and obligations with respect to the services in another section.

But there may also be situations where it works best to organize provisions
chronologically. For example, in the condominium purchase and sale
agreement mentioned earlier, the seller produces the condominium
documents first, and then the buyer inspects the property. After that, the
buyer applies for financing. If it is approved, the seller generates a
settlement statement and the Buyer does a final walkthrough, and then the
final closing is held.

Start with a general statement of the core exchange and then fill in the
details as you work your way through the document. If a chronological
organization makes sense, then organize the supplemental provisions
chronologically. If something else works better, do something else. Clarity
is the goal so whatever expresses the specifics of the deal in the clearest
way is the structure you should use.

 information is properly included in the core obligations, duration, if
 applicable, and deal provisions, and then drafting each of those
 provisions.

6. ORGANIZING A
CONTRACT'S ENDING
SECTIONS

T he ending sections of a contract usually deal with the end of the
          relationship. If the contract has a term, you should think about
          whether it is appropriate to include a termination provision or a
cancellation provision. If the contract involves a closing, you will want to

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
describe the logistics for making that happen, as well as dealing with the
situation where the closing falls through. If the document is something like
a security agreement, you may just need to provide for the termination of
the security interest at the end of the relationship. A list of administrative
provisions (a/k/a "boilerplate") is usually included next, then a final
concluding statement (a "testimonium") and signature blocks.

A. If the Contract is a Term Agreement, Draft Provisions for Ending it
Early

If the contract has a term or duration, then you will likely want to draft
provisions for ending the relationship voluntarily by either cancelling or
terminating it. Many attorneys use those terms interchangeably but there is
a distinction between the two you should be aware of in the Uniform
Commercial Code. Here is the relevant provision in the Florida version of
the Code:

*  *  *

(3)"Termination" occurs when either party pursuant to a power
created by agreement or law puts an end to the contract otherwise than
for its breach. On termination, all obligations which are still executory on
both sides are discharged but any right based on prior breach or
performance survives.

 (4)"Cancellation" occurs when either party puts an end to the contract
 for breach by the other and its effect is the same as that of "termination"
 except that the canceling party also retains any remedy for breach of the
 whole contract or any unperformed balance.
 Fla. Stat. § 672.106.

Cancellation is ending the contract because the other party breached;
termination is ending the contract for any other reason. Both cancellation

   Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
and termination are grants of rights. So, if you were giving the lessor in an
equipment lease the right to cancel, you would do it like this:

 V. Cancellation by Lessor

 If the Lessee breaches any of the provisions of the Lease, the Lessor
 may cancel.
Like any other provision, you want to make sure it is complete. In this
case, what is missing is how the lessor would go about cancelling the lease.

 V. Cancellation by Lessor

 If the Lessee breaches any of the provisions of the Lease, the Lessor
 may cancel by giving the Lessee written notice.

Termination is similar. If you wanted to give the lessee the right to
terminate, you might draft something like this:
 VI. Termination by Lessee

 The Lessee may terminate the Lease for any reason.

But again, you would need to say how termination is accomplished. And
since termination can happen at any time for any reason, you would likely
want to add a time deadline.
 VI. Termination by Lessee

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
 The Lessee may terminate the Lease for any reason by giving written
 notice to the Lessor no later than thirty (30) days before the proposed
 termination date.

B. If a Security Deposit was Required, Provide for its Return

In a term agreement, like an apartment rental agreement, there may be a
security deposit involved. If there is, then in addition to ending the
relationship, the contract will also have to deal with the ultimate disposition
of deposited funds. For a security deposit, you will at least need an
obligation requiring the tenant to pay the deposit at the beginning of the
agreement, then a provision at the end giving the landlord the right to
deduct amounts for damages, and then requiring the landlord to return the
balance, like this:

 VI. Disposition of Security Deposit

 The Landlord may deduct from the Security Deposit costs and
 expenses incurred by the Landlord to repair damage to the Unit
 caused by the Tenant during the Term. The Landlord will send the
 Tenant the balance of the Security Deposit no later than thirty (30)
 days after the end of the Term.

C. If the Contract is a Purchase and Sale Agreement, Draft Provisions
for Closing Logistics

If you are drafting an agreement for a purchase of real estate or goods, you
will need to describe the time and place of closing, as well as all the things
each party is required to bring to the closing for the transaction to happen.
Those things are sometimes called "closing deliveries." Here is a short
example:

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
 V. Closing of Sale

 A. The closing is to occur at 10:00 a.m. at the offices of Dewey,
 Cheatham, and Howe, 999 Court Street, Alachua, Florida (the
 "Closing").

 B. At the Closing, the Seller will execute and deliver to the Buyer the
 following documents:

     (i) a quitclaim deed for the Property;
     (ii) keys to all doors on the Property and the post office box for
 the Property;
     (iii) access information for smart locks, garage doors, gates and
 fences on the Property;
     (iv) remote control devices for appliances and other systems on
 the Property; and
     (v) operating manuals and warranties for all appliances on the
 Property.

 C. At the Closing, the Buyer will deliver to the Seller, by wire
 transfer to the Seller's account, One Hundred Twenty-Five Thousand
 Dollars ($125,000.00) in immediately available funds.

D. If the Security Deposit Serves as Liquidated Damages in the Event of
a Breach, Provide for its Disposition in That Situation as Well.

An agreement for a sale often involves a deposit which serves as liquidated
damages for one of the parties if the other fails to complete the transaction.
If it does, the agreement should also provide for the ultimate disposition of
the deposit if the transaction falls through. For example, a purchase and
sale agreement for real estate will often provide as follows:

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
 VI. Retention of Deposit

 If the Buyer fails to fulfill the Buyer's obligations in this Agreement,
 the Seller may retain all deposits made by the Buyer under this
 Agreement as liquidated damages.

E. If the Contract Involves a Transfer of Rights, There May be Nothing
to Do

An agreement involving a transfer of rights is performed when it is signed,
so there may be no need to provide for the end of the relationship. Still,
something like a mortgage might have a provision obligating the mortgagee
to execute and record a discharge when the underlying loan is paid. Also, it
is possible for this type of agreement to have a term. For example, a
software license agreement could be for a limited period of time. If that
were the case, you would consider adding termination and/or cancellation
provisions, if appropriate. Otherwise, you may not have to deal with how
the relationship ends.

F. End with Descriptions of Administrative Policies

The administrative policy statements that are usually included at the end of
all types of agreements are often called "boilerplate" provisions. It is
unfortunate they have that nickname because it understates their
importance. Administrative provisions can have a dramatic effect on the
rights and obligations of the parties. The most basic of these are merger,
modification, choice of law, and choice of forum or venue.

A merger or integration provision states that the contract is complete; and
any prior agreements not included in the agreement are unenforceable. A

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
merger provision is a descriptive statement, not an obligation, grant of
rights, or prohibition. Here is an example:

 XIII. Integration of Agreement

 This Agreement is the complete and final agreement between the
 parties regarding the sale of the Business. All prior statements,
 understandings, and agreements are merged into this Agreement.

A merger clause in a contract simply states the parties' intent with regard to
integration. 11 Williston on Contracts § 33:23 (4th ed.). If the agreement
actually is integrated, the parol evidence rule renders inoperative prior
written or oral agreements. Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 213
(1981).

I think of a "modification" provision as the corollary to a merger provision.
A merger provision deals with statements and agreements made before the
contract is signed. A modification provision deals with agreements made
after the contract is signed. A modification provision is not a grant of rights;
the parties already have the right to modify the contract. It could be drafted
as a condition to an obligation. "If the parties want to modify, they will
only modify in writing." Or, it could be a prohibition. "The parties will not
modify orally." But drafting it that way does not really accomplish the
desired effect. You don't want to sue the other party for breach; you want
the modification to be invalid. For that reason, I would draft the provision
as another policy statement, like this:

 XIV. Modification of Agreement

 Any amendment of this Agreement is invalid unless it is in writing,
 signed by both parties, and states the nature of the modification, and
 the provision to which it applies.

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
An agreement for the sale of goods cannot be modified orally if it contains
a modification provision. Uniform Commercial Code § 2-209(2) (2002) ("A
signed agreement which excludes modification or rescission except by a
signed writing cannot be otherwise modified or rescinded"). However, any
other type of written contract can likely be orally modified, even if it
contains such a provision, if it is proven that the provision was orally
waived. 10 Williston on Contracts § 29:42 (4th ed.).

Choice of law is another provision that can only be done as a descriptive
statement. It is not an obligation; you can't obligate the judge to apply a
specific state's law. And it is not a grant of rights or a prohibition. Often a
choice of law provision is drafted just to make clear what law applies to
breach of contract claims. But it can also be drafted more broadly to
include tort claims arising out of whatever subject matter the contract deals
with. Here is an example that incorporates both of those issues:

 XV. Choice of Law

 Florida law governs the interpretation of this Agreement, including
 tort claims arising out of the provision of the Services.

Courts will enforce the law chosen by the parties in the contract unless
either "(a) the chosen state has no substantial relationship to the parties or
the transaction and there is no other reasonable basis for the parties' choice,
or (b) application of the law of the chosen state would be contrary to a
fundamental policy of a state which has a materially greater interest than
the chosen state in the determination of the particular issue and which . . .
would be the state of the applicable law in the absence of an effective
choice of law by the parties." Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws §
187 (1971) (emphasis added).

The chosen state has a substantial relationship to the parties or the
transaction when the state is that "where performance by one of the parties

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
is to take place or where one of the parties is domiciled or has his principal
place of business." Id. at comment f. Important considerations in
determining whether a fundamental public policy of the state of the
otherwise applicable law exists are "the extent to which the significant
contacts are grouped in [the] state" and "the extent to which the significant
contacts are grouped in the state of the chosen law." Id.

If the parties to a contract are located in one state, and performance is to
take place in the same state, then choosing another state's law is likely not
an option. But if one or both parties is located in another state, or
performance is to take place in another state, then a choice of law clause
naming that other state's law as the law applicable to the contract may be
enforceable.

As for choice of forum, it wouldn't make sense to draft it as a grant of
rights (the parties already have the right to sue in the applicable forum). It
could be drafted as a condition to an obligation. "If either party sues, they
will do so only in the chosen forum." Or a prohibition: "if either party sues,
they will not do so in any forum other than the chosen forum." But again,
you don't want to sue the party for breach if they bring an action in the
wrong forum. You are describing a choice the parties have made, and you
want the court to respect that choice. So, I would recommend drafting a
choice of forum provision as a statement of policy too. Also, remember to
make clear that the forum is mandatory and exclusive, and applicable only
to litigation, like this:

 XVI. Choice of Forum

 The mandatory and exclusive venue for any litigation arising out of
 this Agreement lies in Jefferson County, Florida.

A majority of courts will enforce a contract clause limiting judicial
jurisdiction, as long as the clause is not unfair or unreasonable. 7 Williston
on Contracts § 15:15 (4th ed.). For example, such a clause would likely not

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
be enforced if it was "obtained by fraud, duress, the abuse of economic
power or other unconscionable means . . . the chosen state would be closed
to the suit or would not handle it effectively or fairly. . . there is good
reason to believe that the plaintiff would be dealt with unfairly in the
chosen state . . . [or] the chosen state would be so seriously an inconvenient
forum that to require the plaintiff to bring suit there would be unjust." Id.

There are multiple additional administrative provisions in contracts, and I
would draft them all in a similar fashion (i.e as descriptive statements).
Here are some examples:

 10. Severability of Agreement

 This Agreement is severable. If any provision is unenforceable, that
 provision is severed, and the remaining provisions continue in effect.

 11. Non-Assignability of Agreement

 This Agreement is not assignable. Any purported assignment of this
 Agreement by either party is invalid.

 12. Binding Nature of Agreement

 This Agreement inures to the benefit of and is binding on all
 permitted successors and assigns.

 13. Headings of Agreement

 The headings in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and
 are not intended to affect the meaning or interpretation of this
 Agreement in any way.

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
 14. Counterparts of Agreement

 If the parties execute this Agreement in one or more counterparts,
 then all of such counterparts constitute only one Agreement.

 15. Cumulative Nature of Remedies

 All rights and remedies provided in this Agreement are cumulative
 and not exclusive of any other rights or remedies that are to be
 available to the parties.

G. Draft a Testimonium (Closing Statement) Before the Signature
Blocks

After the administrative provisions of a contract comes something called
the "testimonium." (Testimonium is Latin for "witness" or "attestation."
Lewis & Short, Latin Dictionary.) In the old days, the testimonium would
contain lots of legalese. For example, one style was to end the contract
with a statement like this: "Witness our hands and seals this ___ day of
__________, 20__." Today we leave the legalese out and just recite in
plain English that the parties are signing as of the date in the exordium.
That way the document doesn't have multiple different dates, and it is clear
what the correct date is. Here is a sample testimonium:

 Executed by the parties as of the date above.

H. Draft Appropriate Signature Blocks for Each Party

After the testimonium there is just one more thing needed to make the
contract complete and that is a set of signature blocks, one for each party.
What is most important when doing the signature blocks is distinguishing

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
between a person who is signing as an individual and a person who is
signing on behalf of an entity. If the former, the person will be personally
liable for damages resulting from any contract breach. If the latter, the
entity, not the person, will bear that liability.

Here is an example of a signature block for an individual:

 ________________________
 [Name of Signer]

And here is an example of a signature block for an entity (a corporation):

 ______________________
 [Name of Corporation]
 By: [Name of Signer] [Title]

If the party is an entity containing another entity, like a limited partnership
with a corporation as its general partner, you would do the signature block
like this:

 Realty Associates L.P.,
 By its General Partner,

 __________________________
 [Name of Corporation]
 By: [Name of Signer] [Title]

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
To finish a contract, think about how the relationship will end and whether
any funds need to be accounted for, including any money held on deposit.
Then draft appropriate policy provisions. Most of the time they should be
done as descriptive statements. Add a testimonium but leave out the
legalese. And draft appropriate signature blocks, depending upon whether
each party is a person or an entity.
Those are the basic elements of a contract. Now that you have learned the
basics of how to draft and organize contract provisions, you should be able
to draft a simple contract. You may be at a closing and the parties may need
someone to draft an escrow agreement right then and there. You may also
be a litigator handling a case that settles on the courthouse steps, and you
may have to draft the settlement agreement before everyone goes home. In
either case, you should be able to draft a simple contract based on what
you've learned so far.

7. BRAINSTORMING FOR
FUTURE CONTINGENCIES

T here is more to drafting contracts than transcribing what the client
          tells you and writing it in a clear and organized way. Part of the
          lawyer's job is to document whatever the client says the deal is.
But part of the lawyer's job is also to think into the future about all the
different things that could happen after the agreement is signed; and make
sure the client's interests are protected should any of those contingencies
occur. I call that "brainstorming." The client tells you what the agreement
is, and then you try to think of what additional issues should be addressed,
and what provisions you might add to better protect the client or advance
the client's interests. Also, you sometimes need to do a little research to
make sure whatever you add will be enforced by a court.

A. Address Possible Future Contingencies

Suppose the seller agrees to sell a commercial building to the buyer and
hires you to draft a purchase and sale agreement. Likely the parties talked
about the features of the building, the price and what would have to happen
for the closing to occur. They may have even put together a timeline and
scheduled a date for completion. But they probably did not talk about what
would happen if the building burned to the ground before the closing took
place. That's the type of thing the lawyer needs to think about and address
in the agreement in addition to everything else.

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
As another example, suppose two partners agree to start a law firm together
and hire you to draft a partnership agreement. They probably talked about
what their practice would consist of, where their office would be, and how
they would share profits and divide expenses. But they probably didn't
discuss what would happen if at some time in the future one of them died or
decided to leave the partnership. Again, that is an issue the lawyer will
have to raise, resolve between the parties, and then make part of the
agreement. Once you know the terms of the deal, brainstorm for issues that
were left out and contingencies that may happen in the future. Then follow
up with the client, resolve the issues and add the additional language to the
agreement.

B. Examples of Common Issues

There are some contingencies that you will likely want to address in
virtually every contract you draft. For example, if you represent a provider
of goods or services, how can you protect the client from the possibility the
client will have trouble getting paid at some point in the future? What if
you are on the other side, representing a client who may, for innocent
reasons, be late making a payment after the agreement is signed? What can
you do to help both parties to avoid the cost and expense of any future

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
litigation? What if the client gets sued by the other side or some third
party? What can you do to limit the client's exposure to liability? Because
these issues are so common, you should be aware of how they are typically
addressed.

       1) Give Payment Provisions "Teeth"

Most contracts involve an exchange of good or services for money. As a
result, there is usually a risk that, if you represent the payee, your client will
have difficulty getting the other side to pay on time. What can you do then
to make the payment provisions in the agreement more effective?

One thing you can do is impose a late fee if payments are late:
 A. On or before _______ ___, 20__, the Buyer will pay the Seller
 $_____.

 B. If the Buyer pays late, the Buyer will also pay the Seller a late
 fee of $_____.

If that's not enough, have the fee accrue with time, so the later the payment,
the bigger the fee.
 A. On or before _______ ___, 20__, the Buyer will pay the Seller
 $_____.

 B. If the Buyer pays late, the Buyer will also pay the Seller a late
 fee of %____ of the payment amount for every day that the payment
 is late.

When determining the amount of the late fee also keep in mind the purpose
of the fee is to compensate the other party for the untimely performance. If
the purpose or effect is to impose a penalty (e.g. if the amount of the fee is

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
unreasonably large), the requirement to pay the fee may be unenforceable as
against public policy. See Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 356 (1981).

Another thing you can do is draft a clause making clear that timeliness is
material to the agreement, so that lateness is a material breach. This is
typically done by stating that "time is of the essence."
 16. Time of Essence

 Time is of the essence with respect to the Tenant's obligation to pay
 rent in this Agreement.

When you draft a time is of the essence clause be clear what obligation(s)
the clause applies to. See 3A Corbin, Contracts § 715 (1960) ("It is not
desirable to try to achieve this result by merely putting into the contract the
words "time is of the essence of this contract."").

You can also add that if it is necessary to sue to collect amounts unpaid, the
losing party will pay the costs of doing so. But, again, unless you draft the
language to apply only to just the other party, which the other party is
unlikely to agree to, this type of provision also works both ways.
 17. Costs of Collection

 The losing party will pay all reasonable attorneys' fees and costs
 incurred by the prevailing party in enforcing this Agreement.

You should always be thinking not just about the form, but also about the
substance of what you are drafting. You need to make sure what you are
doing accurately represents the terms the parties agreed to. But you should
also be trying to think of ways to better protect your clients' interests. You
should always be looking for opportunities to add value to the deal.

       2) Avoid Disputes Between the Parties

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
If you are on the other side of the transaction, and you represent the person
making the payments, you should consider the possibility that your client
may - for reasons that are not the client's fault - find himself or herself in
breach of the agreement. If that occurs, what can you do to help the client
avoid getting sued? What can you do to give the client the opportunity to
fix the situation, so that the contract is not cancelled, and the relationship
can continue?

One thing you could do is add a grace period to the payment provisions. To
do that, you leave the due date the same, but change the late fee so that it
doesn't start until the end of the grace period, like this:

 C. On or before _______ ___, 20__, the Buyer will pay the Seller
 $_____.

 D. If the Buyer pays more than five (5) days late, the Buyer will
 also pay the Seller a late fee of $_____.

Another way to avoid litigation is for one party to give the other party
notice and an opportunity to cure before commencing litigation.

18. Notice and Opportunity to Cure

Buyer and Seller each agree to provide the other party with written
notice of any default by the other party under this Agreement, and a
period of five (5) business days following the other party's receipt of
such notice to cure such default.

       3) Handle Disputes Outside of Litigation

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
Often it is in the interests of both parties to resolve any disputes without
resorting to litigation. This is particularly true for disputes over a relatively
small amount, like the amount of deposits routinely collected in connection
with residential purchase and sale contracts and residential leases. What
can you do in a situation like that to help the parties avoid litigation?

This issue is most commonly addressed by having the parties agree up front
to resolve any disputes through mediation or arbitration. Here is an
example of an obligation to mediate disputes.

 19. Mediation of Disputes

 Before resorting to litigation, the Buyer and Seller will attempt to
 settle any disputes arising out of this Agreement in an amicable
 manner through mediation with a Florida certified or court
 appointed mediator pursuant to the Florida Rules for Certified and
 Court-Appointed Mediators.

If the client wants the mechanism to be binding on the parties, and the
client's concern with avoiding disputes is not so much with the cost of
litigation but rather with the technical nature of the contract and likely
unfamiliarity of any civil judge or jury with the issues dealt with in the
contract, arbitration may be another option. Unlike mediation, arbitration is
binding, and you can arbitrate a dispute with an arbitrator who has expertise
in a specific area. For example, you could draft a provision requiring the
parties to submit disputes to an arbitrator having expertise with technology,
like this:

 20. Arbitration of Disputes

 The parties will submit any controversy or claim arising out of or
 relating to this Contract, or any breach of this Contract, to be
 resolved and determined by binding arbitration administered by a

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
 member of the Florida Circuit Civil Mediator Society having case
 experience with technology pursuant to the Florida Arbitration Code,
 §§ 682.01 through 682.25, Fla. Stat.

Other issues which can also be dealt with in a mediation or arbitration
clause include who will pay for the mediator or arbitrator and how that
person will be selected, where and when the mediation or arbitration will
take place, what law will apply, and whether attorney's fees are recoverable.
When you are drafting a mediation provision or an arbitration provision it
is important that you include all essential terms, so that the agreement is
specific enough to be enforced by a court.

       4) Limit the Liability of a Party to the Other

If the client does get sued, how can the client limit its liability to the other
side? If the contract is for the sale of goods, you can use your knowledge of
the Uniform Commercial Code to better protect the client's interests. For
example, Section 2-316(2) of the Code gives a seller the right to exclude or
modify implied warranties:

        [T]o exclude or modify the implied warranty of merchantability or
 any part of it the language must mention merchantability and in case of a
 writing must be conspicuous, and to exclude or modify any implied
 warranty of fitness the exclusion must be by a writing and conspicuous.
 Language to exclude all implied warranties of fitness is sufficient if it
 states, for example, that "There are no warranties which extend beyond
 the description on the face hereof."

As you can see, the exclusion has to be conspicuous. Section 1-201 of the
Code defines conspicuous as follows:

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
    (10)"Conspicuous," with reference to a term, means so written,
 displayed, or presented that a reasonable person against which it is to
 operate ought to have noticed it. Whether a term is "conspicuous" is a
 decision for the court. Conspicuous terms include the following:

 (a)A heading in capitals equal to or greater in size than the
 surrounding text, or in contrasting type, font, or color to the surrounding
 text of the same or lesser size; and
 (b)Language in the body of a record or display in larger type than the
 surrounding text or set off from surrounding text of the same size by
 symbols or other marks that call attention to the language.

The statute also says merchantability must be mentioned. To exclude both
implied warranties, you might draft something like this:

 21. EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES

 THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY AND
 FITNESS FOR USE ARE EXCLUDED FROM THIS
 AGREEMENT.

This form would be preferable to using phrases like "as is," and "with all
faults" if the contract contains explicit warranties but excludes implied
warranties.
Section 2-719(3) of the Code gives a seller the right to limit or exclude
consequential damages, as long as the limitation or exclusion is not
"unconscionable":

       Consequential damages may be limited or excluded unless the
limitation or exclusion is unconscionable. Limitation of consequential

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
damages for injury to the person in the case of consumer goods is prima
facie unconscionable but limitation of damages where the loss is
commercial is not.

A contract provision is "unconscionable" if there is "an absence of
meaningful choice on the part of one of the parties together with contract
terms which are unreasonably favorable to the other party." E.g., Bynum v.
Maplebear Inc., 2016 WL 552058 (E.D. N.Y. 2016) (citing text).
Unconscionability may also exist if parties are not represented by counsel,
are unsophisticated or have unequal bargaining power. E.g., Maslowski v.
Prospect Funding Partners LLC, 944 N.W.2d 235 (Minn. 2020). In other
words, an unconscionable contract is a contract of adhesion "drafted and
imposed by a party of superior strength that leaves the subscribing party
little or no opportunity to alter the substantive terms, and only the
opportunity to adhere to the contract or reject it." McKenzie Law Firm, P.A.
v. Ruby Receptionists, Inc., 108 Fed. R. Serv. 3d 312 (D. Or. 2020). To
show that a provision is not unconscionable, it may be appropriate to draft
the provision so that it demonstrates it was "voluntarily" assented to.

For example, if you were adding the exclusion of consequential damages
clause to a contract drafted solely by counsel for one party having superior
bargaining strength over the other unrepresented party, and you wanted to
ensure the enforceability of that clause under those circumstances, you
would likely do more than just make clear the clause only applies to
commercial losses. To attempt to demonstrate the other party had a
meaningful choice to accept or reject the clause, you might consider giving
that other party the option in the contract to either accept the exclusion or
reject it and pay a higher price for the goods. Also, it might make sense to
include in the recitals that the other unrepresented party was a sophisticated
business person who was given ample opportunity to retain counsel prior to
signing the agreement. Here are two an examples of a clause excluding
consequential damages. Both are drafted as descriptive statements, but the
second version is expanded to address issues raised in the caselaw on
unconscionability.

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
 22. Exclusion of Consequential Damages

 Consequential damages for commercial loss are excluded from this
 Agreement.

 22. Exclusion of Consequential Damages

 Consequential damages for commercial loss are excluded from this
 Agreement, unless the Buyer elects to pay the Seller two (2) times the
 Purchase Price for the Goods by initialing below and making such
 payment.

 Buyer acknowledges that the Buyer is a sophisticated business
 person, familiar with these types of agreements and has had a
 reasonable opportunity to consult with counsel concerning the legal
 effect of this provision.

 ______ Buyer rejects the exclusion of consequential damages, and
 elects that such damages are included. Buyer will pay two (2) times
 the Purchase Price for the Goods.

Section 2-725 of the Code also gives the parties the right to shorten the
statute of limitations for claims arising out of the agreement:

        An action for breach of any contract for sale must be commenced
 within four years after the cause of action has accrued. By the original
 agreement the parties may reduce the period of limitation to not less than
 one year but may not extend it.

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
To shorten the statute of limitations, you might draft something like this:

 23. Period of Limitation

        The period of limitation for any action for breach of this
 Agreement is two (2) years after the cause of action accrued.

       5) Protect Against Third Party Claims

The client may also have the risk of being sued by a third party. The classic
case is where the services are provided to a property owner. If someone
gets hurt, the service provider will get sued, and the owner will likely be
sued as well. Under these circumstances, protecting the client from liability
can be achieved by making sure the client will be indemnified for any
losses the client incurs (i.e. the other party to the contract will pay if the
client is sued by a third party). An indemnity provision is an obligation
running from the "indemnitor" to the "indemnitee." Typically, the language
used is "[the indemnitor] will indemnify and hold harmless [the indemnitee]
from and against _________." Also, an indemnification provision should
mention negligence claims and claims seeking attorney's fees, if they are
included; and it should be limited to claims arising out of the applicable
transaction or relationship, so that it is not overbroad. Here is a sample
provision:

 24. Indemnification of Claims

 The Subcontractor will indemnify and hold harmless the Owner, its
 officers, directors, agents, and employees, from and against all third-
 party claims, causes of action, lawsuits and proceedings, including
 claims for negligence, requesting damages, including personal

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
 injuries, property damages and economic losses, and reasonable
 attorney's fees, arising out of the lease of the Equipment.

The client is less likely to have to pay a judgment if the person or entity
providing the services has enough money to pay for the loss. As a result, it
is also appropriate to make sure the other side has insurance for the types of
claims that might arise from the performance of services (or any damage to
property or equipment rented). Like an indemnity clause, an insurance
provision is also an obligation. In addition to requiring the party to obtain
insurance, it should require the party to "maintain" the insurance (i.e. not let
the insurance lapse). Also, it is important to mention the type of insurance
required and the policy amounts, as well as add language requiring the party
to add the other side as an additional insured or loss payee and produce
proof of insurance upon request, like this:

 25. Insurance for Equipment

 The Subcontractor will maintain insurance covering liability for
 personal injury in the amount of at least $____________, loss and
 damage to the Equipment for not less than full replacement value of
 the Equipment, which is $__________, and property damage
 insurance in the amount of at least $___________.

 The Subcontractor will name the Owner as a beneficiary or
 additional insured under the applicable policies. The Subcontractor
 will also provide the Owner with copies of certificates evidencing all
 such insurance.

       6) Releasing a Party from Future Claims

You obviously can't draft a provision in a contract releasing a party from
future claims for breach of contract. If you did, the contract would be

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
illusory. But you can draft a clause releasing a party from future negligence
claims, and in many jurisdictions the clause would be enforceable as long as
it is freely and knowingly assented to and the language "clearly,
unambiguously, and unmistakably inform[s] the party relinquishing its
rights of exactly what is being waived." 8 Williston on Contracts § 19:21
(4th ed.). Here is an example of a contractor's release of future negligence
claims against the owner of the property that attempts to inform the signer
of the rights they are relinquishing:

     The Contractor releases the Owner from and against all claims,
 causes of action and lawsuits, including negligence claims, the
 Contract now has now or at any time in the future arising out of the
 construction of the Property. The Contractor assumes the risk of
 accident and injury to the Contractor as a result of providing the
 Services, including the risks of using power tools and other
 construction equipment, and the risks of working alone and with
 others in and around an unfinished building and a partially
 excavated lot.

Those are some examples of the types of provisions you might use to
protect a client from future contingencies. Contract drafting is not just
writing. You need to think of all the things that could happen in the future,
and all the ways a deal could go wrong. Then draft language that will
protect your client should any of those contingencies occur. Brainstorming
is where you really have the opportunity to provide valuable advice and
draft an effective agreement.

Get up to speed first, then draft clear, consistent provisions and organize
them in into a contract. After you do that, brainstorm. Think into the future
about all the different things that could happen after the agreement is signed
and make sure the client's interests are protected should any of those
contingencies occur.

the previous chapters (the Associate Employment Agreement, Laptop

the client's interests, and then draft the applicable provisions.

8. DRAFTING WITH
PRECEDENT DOCUMENTS

M ost of the contracts you will be hired to draft have already been
               done before. Whether you are asked to draft a lease, a real
               estate purchase agreement, a promissory note, a mortgage, a
deed, a contract for the sale of goods, a services contract, or an employment
agreement, it's been done before, various examples and forms are widely
available, and there is usually no need to reinvent the wheel. Law students
are prohibited from copying language drafted by someone else, but lawyers
do that all the time. Your law professor is testing you on how well you can
draft on your own. But your client doesn't care if you copied the language
you are using, as long as it works. You can't violate anyone's copyright,
but otherwise you can collect well drafted provisions and documents and
use them to draft whatever type of contracts you need. Still, there is much
more to drafting with precedents than just copying what someone else has
already done.

To be clear, when I say "draft" in this context, what I am referring to is
creating the form of agreement you need from one or more precedents (i.e.
documents someone else wrote). So you are not starting from scratch, like
you were in chapters one through seven. And the precedent is either a form
(it has blanks in in) or a sample (it contains factual information from a prior
transaction).

When you are working with precedents, the drafting process is usually
divided into creating the form you need (the subject of this chapter) and

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
then tailoring the form for the deal you are involved in (the subject of the
next chapter). And there are two ways to create the form you need from
one or more precedents.

The first method for drafting with precedents is to find a sample agreement
that is close to what you are trying to do, and then revise it to create exactly
the document you want. The second method, which applies when you can't
find a sample that is close to what you are trying to do, is to find sample
provisions from documents that are not what you looking for, and use those
sample provisions to piece together the document you want.

I handled a lot of lending transactions in my practice. Whenever I had to
draft something like a promissory note or a mortgage, I had no problem
finding sample documents to use. By using a precedent instead of drafting
from scratch, I was able to save a lot of time, and I could charge the client
less money to get the transaction closed. That is an example of the first
method.

As another example, I also had a client who hired me to draft an option to
purchase air rights to construct residences over commercial real estate in an
urban area. I couldn't find a sample document that was anything close to
what I needed. But I was able to draft an appropriate agreement by looking
at analogous situations and using sample language from a number of
different documents. That is an example of the second method.

Regardless of whether you are able to find a precedent that is close to what
you want or you have to piece a document together using multiple
precedents, there are three steps to the process. Start with a good source for
sample documents. Review any document you find to determine if it is
appropriate for the client and the transaction you are involved in. Revise
the document, if appropriate, to create the form you need; and make sure
the language in the resulting form is consistent throughout.

A. Find a Good Source for Precedent Documents

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
The first step is to find a good source for forms and sample agreements. A
law library is usually a good place to start. Secondary source texts covering
transactional topics like real estate, leasing, lending and finance often have
sample forms. Also, most libraries have continuing legal education
materials containing precedent documents. Often the forms and samples
are in a CD-ROM included with the text, so you can copy the documents
you are interested in without having to re-type each form.
The internet is a good source of sample documents as well. Westlaw has a
service called "Practical Law" that is a good source for form documents.
Westlaw can be costly to use, but there are also plenty of free sites on line.
The Securities and Exchange Commission service called EDGAR
(Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval) is free a source that
can be used to search for sample business documents. Also, there is a free
website called ONECLE (www.onecle.com) that is a potential source for
sample agreements.

But I would recommend that you stay away from internet sites like
Rocketlawyer and LegalZoom. You can't give a client a document they
could have obtained themselves by visiting a website for consumers. Also,
because sites like that are widely available, as a practical matter, you have
to produce a better document than what those sites sell. No reasonable

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
savvy client is going to pay you to draft a contract if they can get something
just as good by going on line.

Finally, if you work for a law firm, the firm will probably also have a
collection of forms and sample documents you can use. Even if they don't,
the other transactional attorneys you work with will likely have their own
stash of forms and sample documents. So law firms and other lawyers are a
good repository for precedent documents too.

B. Determine if the Precedent is Appropriate for the Client and the
Transaction

Once you have found a precedent to work with the second step is to
determine who it was drafted for (i.e. a seller or a buyer, a lender or a
borrower, a landlord or a tenant, etc.) and under what circumstances (i.e. a
consumer transaction or a commercial transaction, in the state where you
are practicing or somewhere else, for a very large deal or a very small deal,
etc.).

If the document was drafted for a client with interests like those of your
client, and it was intended for a transaction similar to the one you are
involved in, then it may be a good sample to use. If it wasn't then you
should probably keep looking.

For example, you likely wouldn't want to use form language from a lease
written on behalf of a landlord in a contract you are drafting for a tenant.
And it likely wouldn't be appropriate to use provisions from a residential
lease to use for a lease of commercial space.

By the way, this is also the primary reason you should always volunteer to
draft the documents when you represent a client in a transaction. Don't
think you are going to save your client time and money by letting the other
lawyer produce the first draft. It is a lot more efficient to find a document
that reflects your client's interests and fits the circumstances you are dealing
with, and start with that. Revising a document that works for the other side

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
and isn't really appropriate for what you are doing is a much more difficult
and time consuming task.

C. Make Sure the Language in the Document is
Consistent

After you have confirmed the precedent was drafted for a client whose
interests are the same as your client, and it was used in the type of
transaction you are involved in, step three is to decide whether you need or
want to change the style, revise what's there or add anything more. And
then make the changes so that the language is consistent throughout.

If you found a sample that is close to what you were looking for, but the
document uses "shall" for obligations and you want to use "will," then make
that change throughout and make sure you also use "will" in any provisions
you add to the document. If don't want to make that change then leave the
document alone, and make sure you also use "shall" when you add anything
to the document.

If you had to piece the agreement together from precedent language in
different documents, make sure the end result is internally consistent. If
you took a provision from one document that referred to your client as
"Buyer" and another document that used the term "Purchaser," pick one or
the other and use that term consistently throughout the document. In other
words, when you go to revise and finalize the document you have pieced
together, make sure the language in the end result is consistent.

I started this book with a discussion of how to draft from scratch without
using precedent language and documents because you really have to know
that to use precedents well. There is nothing worse than a contract
produced by an attorney that is a collection of provisions drafted in different
styles for different clients in different circumstances, and has never been
revised to make it consistent and appropriate for the transaction it is used
in. When you see documents like that you will know the drafter has no idea
what he is doing. If you do it right, there is more to drafting with precedent
language and documents than just copying someone else's work.

                                 Practice Exercises
            Research on line sources and find sample agreements and/or
forms documents for the following type(s) of contract(s) you drafted for
the previous practice exercises: Employment Agreement, Purchase
Agreement for Personal Property, Residential Lease Agreement, Sale of
Assets Agreement and/or Consulting Agreement.
        Compare the sample documents to the contact(s) you drafted in the
exercises. Are there provisions that are missing from the samples or
sections you could add to the document(s) you drafted from scratch? Are
common sections drafted similarly or differently? What are the pros and
cons using the language of the different provisions instead of the language
you drafted?

9. TAILORING PRECEDENT
DOCUMENTS FOR A DEAL

W hen you are practicing as a transactional lawyer and
                representing the same client in multiple similar transactions,
                like doing the leases for a client who manages shopping malls,
you will already have the forms you need most of the time, so you won't
have to go looking for precedents. Instead, your job will be to tailor the
forms you have for use in specific deals. So that is the subject of this
chapter: tailoring form documents for a deal (i.e. adding to the document
the factual information for the transaction and making appropriate revisions
for the transaction).

For example, if you're working at a firm in the commercial lending
department, you'll probably be working with a set of complex form
documents the bank uses for all its commercial loans, or the firm uses
whenever it represents a bank in a commercial loan. You won't have to
draft the documents from scratch. Instead, you'll need to tailor the forms to
reflect the facts of a particular deal, and then close the transaction. And
there is more too that than just filling in the blanks in the documents.

Working with complex form documents is very different than drafting
agreements from scratch. If you aren't familiar with the form, you need to
study it first so you understand what it says and how it was put together.
Draft the revisions the same way the rest of the document is drafted. Then
read the document again to see if any other provisions are affected by the
changes you made. And keep track of all the revised drafts you create.

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
A. Read the Form to Familiarize Yourself with the
Substance and Structure

A lengthy business contract can be intimidating if you are not familiar with
it. You may not know the subject matter; and the terminology may be alien
to you. The type may be small and the paragraphs densely packed. Most
people avoid reading contracts like that. But someone has to read them to
figure out what they say. And that someone is you. So just take your time
and go through the document section by section. If there are terms you
don't recognize, look them up. If the applicable law is something you are
not familiar with, you may have to do a little research. Take breaks if you
lose your concentration. The ability to scour a lengthy business document
is a skill you will develop with time.

Depending upon the circumstances, you will likely want to take notes as
you read; and it may help you to create an outline of the contract's terms.
The situation is analogous to reading a long, complex statute for the first
time. You really need to study the language to fully understand how the
document works and how it was put together. You can't revise one section
and then be oblivious to what is contained in the rest of the form. So do
what you have to do to familiarize yourself with the document before you
start revising it.

B. Draft any Revisions the Same Way the Document was Drafted

When you are ready to start filling in the blanks and making revisions, there
are three rules I would recommend you follow. First, draft the revisions the
same way the rest of the document was drafted, even if it was drafted
differently than what you learned in the first few chapters of this book. In
other words, make whatever changes you have fit in with the rest of the
document.

If you are adding a background provision, and the form starts each
background provision with the word "whereas," then you should start your
background provision the same way, even though "whereas" is legalese. If

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
the form uses "shall" for obligations, you should use "shall" for obligations,
even if you agree with me that "will" is plainer English than "shall." Also,
use the document's definitions in the provisions you draft.

As a practical matter, you can't revamp every document from beginning to
end to conform to what you learned in this book, and then send the client a
bill for the time you spent doing something you weren't asked to do. You
still need to be concerned with clarity, completion, and accuracy; but you
also need to follow the same rules the original drafter followed when they
drafted the document. Everyone drafts a little differently; when you are
working on someone else's documents, you need to respect the decisions
the drafter made and the style they felt was appropriate. So draft the
revisions the same way the document was drafted, even if it was drafted
differently than what you learned so far.

C. Read Closely the Rest of the Document to See if Other Provisions are
Affected

After you have revised a provision in a form document, read closely the
rest of the provisions to see if they are affected. If they are, either confirm
the provisions still work as intended with the new language or revise the
provisions as well. The documents used in large commercial deals are often
complicated; you have to appreciate that complexity and make sure your
revisions don't screw up the rest of the form. So closely read the rest of the
document whenever you add to, delete, or change the language that is
already there.

If the document is set up for a corporation, for example, you are filling in
the blanks, and it turns out the borrower is a sole proprietorship, then check
to see if there are other provisions of the document that have to be changed
as well. For example, the representation and warranty that "the Borrower is
a duly organized and existing Florida corporation" will need to be revised.
The obligation that "the Borrower will file annual reports with the Secretary
of State" will have to be revised. And the prohibition that "the Borrower
will not amend its articles of organization without the Lender's consent"

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
will also need to be changed. None of that language applies if you change
the borrower from a corporation to a sole proprietorship.

Don't rely only on the "search" command in the word processing software
you use. If you search for "Massachussetts" that will help you find the
references to that word in the document. But if there are places where the
document uses the abbreviation "Mass." you will miss them if you just
search for "Massachusetts." If the word is misspelled somewhere in the
document, you will miss the misspelled word. Also, if there are references
to the "Commonwealth" that need to be changed to the "State" (e.g. if you
ware changing the form to refer to a state instead of a commonwealth), you
will miss those as well.

Any time you delete a defined term you will need to search through the
document for every time that term was used and (1) confirm deleting the
term is appropriate (it may have been used for something you didn't
anticipate); (2) delete the term; and (3) make sure the remaining language
still works properly (e.g. if the only reason for the provision is to say
something about the term, then you would delete the whole thing).

When you delete an entire subsection in an agreement, realize that doing
that will throw off the numbering of subsequent subsections. When you do
that, either replace the deleted language with the statement "intentionally
omitted" or renumber the entire section.

Also, if you renumber the entire section, make sure references to the
renumbered paragraphs elsewhere in the document are also changed. You
might have a provision that says a party can exercise its rights in "paragraph
seven." If you deleted a paragraph, and paragraph seven is now paragraph
six, you need to change the reference to paragraph seven as well.

Needless to say, it is difficult to pour through a long document over and
over, every time you do a new deal, to make sure the substance matches
what the client actually agreed to do, all the factual information is correct,
and the language in the document is internally consistent. To make it easier,
some practitioners print out the document and read it with pen in hand,

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
rather than on a computer screen. Others read the contract slowly out loud
to help them spot issues. I find it helps to look at one subject at a time, so I
check all the paragraph numbering in one pass through, double check all the
dates and dollar amounts in another pass through, check for name and
address spelling, and then check for proper usage of defined terms.
Another good habit to get into is going back to the notes of your original
client conference to make sure you addressed all the issues (that's also a
good practice for completing a final exam in a contract drafting class).
Complex documents tend to involve high dollar amounts. When a client
entrusts you with handling a large transaction, there is really no such thing
as being too careful.

D. Example of How to Revise a Complex Form Document

Let me give you an example to further demonstrate and explain what is
involved in tailoring a complex agreement form for a specific type of deal.
Take a look at the Construction Loan Agreement in the Appendix to this
book. Let's walk through what is involved in making two simple changes
to that document. The first change is to delete the "Commercial Lease."
The form is written for the development of a property that has been leased
to the borrower under a long term commercial lease. To make the form
work for a deal in which the borrower actually owns the property, we will
need to delete the Commercial Lease from the form. Also, the form is
drafted for a project in Massachusetts involving borrowers and guarantors
organized under Massachusetts law. The second change is to make the
document work for a project in Florida involving borrowers and guarantors
organized under Florida law. What is involved in making those two simple
changes to this complex agreement?

The first step is to find any reference to the "Commercial Lease" in the
agreement. As it turns out, that term only appears once, in the definition of
a "Leasehold Interest" in Section 1.3 of the Agreement:

 "Leasehold Interest" means the leasehold interest of ____________in that
 portion of the Mortgaged Premises leased to ____________pursuant to
 the terms of that certain Commercial Lease, dated _____________,

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
 between ____________and ________________, as amended by that
 certain Amendment to Lease dated ____________, and by that certain
 Restated Amendment to Lease dated effective as of ______________.

Of course, if you delete the reference to a Commercial Lease, then there is
no longer any Leasehold Interest. So if you delete the Commercial Lease,
then you also need to delete the definition of a Leasehold Interest. And
then, since the agreement no longer involves any Leasehold Interest, you
also have to search through the document to find provisions referring to that
term and modify them as appropriate.

If you start at the beginning of the document, the first time you will find the
term Leasehold Interest used is in the list of instruments securing the loan in
Section 1.6 where the "Leasehold Mortgage" is referred to.

 (b) The Leasehold Mortgage, Security Agreement and Assignment of
 Leases and Rents (the "Leasehold Mortgage"), from the Borrower to the
 Bank dated of even date herewith, encumbering ____________'s
 Leasehold Interest, and the personal property located thereon and used in
 connection therewith;

Of course, if you delete the reference to the Leasehold Interest, then there is
no longer any Leasehold Mortgage, so this paragraph referring to and
defining the Leasehold Mortgage also needs be deleted in its entirety. And
since it is numbered, the deleted language should be referred to as
"intentionally omitted," like this:

 (b) [Intentionally omitted.]

Having deleted these two terms from the agreement, the next step would be
to search the document for references to either or both of them, and modify
the applicable provisions as appropriate. For example, at the end of Section
1.6 there is a reference to the Loan Documents as including, among other
things, the Leasehold Mortgage. That reference should be deleted.

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
 This Agreement, the Note, the Fee Mortgage, the Leasehold Mortgage,
 the Assignment of Leases, the Assignment of Permits, the five Site
 Professional Consents, the Guaranties, the Financing Statements, the
 Environmental Indemnity Agreement, the Security Agreement and
 Assignment of Earnout Advance, the Blocked Account Agreement, and
 all other documents, instruments and agreements relating to and executed
 in connection with the Loan, as the same may be amended, restated,
 replaced, supplemented, extended, substituted, consolidated or otherwise
 modified from time to time, are collectively referred to as the "Loan
 Documents."

Similarly, references to the Leasehold Mortgage in Sections 3(g), 6.1(c), 10
and 19 should be deleted. And reference to the Leasehold Interest in
Section 6.1(m) should be deleted as well.

The second step is to find and revise any references to the project being in
Massachusetts and involving borrowers and guarantors organized under
Massachusetts law. And that step is a little more difficult. Start by revising
Massachusetts to Florida in the preamble:

 THIS CONSTRUCTION LOAN AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is
 dated as of the ____ day of ___________, by and among
 _________________________, a Massachusetts Florida limited liability
 company ("________"), and _____________________________, a
 Massachusetts Florida limited liability company ("___________"), both
 having a usual place of business at _______________________,
 ___________, ______________ _____ (collectively with their respective
 successors and assigns, the "Borrower"), ____________, in his individual
 capacity, _____________________________________, a Massachusetts
 Florida limited liability company and _________, a Massachusetts
 Florida limited liability company all having an address at
 _____________________________, __________, ______ _____
 (collectively with their respective successors and assigns, the individual
 guarantor is hereinafter referred to as the "Individual Guarantor" and the
 remaining guarantors, the "LLC Guarantors"; together, the Individual
 Guarantor and the LLC Guarantors are hereinafter referred to collectively

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
 as the "Guarantors") and _______________________, having a usual
 place of business at ____________________, ________, _____________
 _____ (together with its successors and/or assigns, the "Bank").

Make the same substitution in Sections 5(o) and 6.1(r).

That is easy enough but in Sections like 3(a), you need to go a little further.
References to the "Commonwealth of Massachusetts" need to be changed
to the "State of Florida," since Massachusetts is a commonwealth and
Florida is a state.

 (a) Each Borrower is a limited liability company duly organized and
     validly existing under the laws of the Commonwealth of
     Massachusetts State of Florida. Each of the LLC Guarantors is a
     limited liability company duly organized and validly existing under
     the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts State of Florida

Sections 6.1(u) and 20need to be revised similarly.

But then when you get to a section like 5(q) you need to go even further.

 (q) Borrower agrees not to suffer any attachment (except for Notices
 of Contract under Mass. Gen. Laws Chapter 254 or Statements of
 Account thereunder, provided that (i) with respect to any such Notices of
 Contract or Statements of Account, the Borrower informs the Bank of the
 filing of the same upon Borrower's acquiring knowledge of same and (ii)
 with respect to any Statements of Account only, the Borrower bonds over
 such lien, provides an endorsement to the Title Policy issued by the Title
 Company insuring the priority of the Mortgage over such lien, or
 otherwise addresses the lien established thereby to the reasonable
 satisfaction of the Bank prior to the earlier of (a) twenty (20) days of
 Borrower's acquiring knowledge of the same, and (b) the date on which
 the lien attains priority over the lien of the Mortgage), whether by trustee
 process or otherwise, to be made against Borrower's interest in this
 Agreement or any payment hereunder. In addition, the Borrower further

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
 agrees not to assign or transfer this Agreement or any interest herein or
 right to payment hereunder (except for a Permitted Transfer as defined
 below) without the prior written consent of Bank, which Bank may give
 or withhold in its absolute discretion. Any such assignment or transfer
 made without Bank's consent shall be void and of no force or effect and
 shall at Bank's election be an immediate Event of Default hereunder.

The parenthetical after the reference to attachments refers to "Notices of
Contract" under Massachusetts statute Mass. Gen. Laws Chapter 254. To
revise that section, you need to do a little research. If Florida has a similar
statute, then revise the language to track the statute and provide the
appropriate citation to Florida statutes. If it doesn't, then it may be
appropriate to either delete the parenthetical entirely or revise it in some
other way to protect the client's interests.

Section 6.1(v) involves a similar issue:

 (v) For the LLC Guarantors, (i) a certified copy of the Certificate of
 Organization for each LLC Guarantor issued by the Secretary of the
 Commonwealth of Massachusetts Florida, dated no more than thirty (30)
 days prior to the date hereof, and (ii) a Certificate of Legal Existence and
 Good Standing for each LLC Guarantor issued by the Secretary of the
 Commonwealth of Massachusetts Florida dated no more than thirty (30)
 days prior to the date hereof, and (iii) a Member's Certificate issued by
 the sole Member of each LLC Guarantor indicating the due authorization
 of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Again, you need to do a little research. Are Certificates of Organization
and Certificates of Legal Existence issued by the Secretary of the state of
Florida or some other government official? Also, are they properly referred
to in Florida as Certificates of Organization and Certificates of Legal
Existence or is some other terminology used in Florida? To revise this
section, you have to find the answers to those questions first, and then you
will be able to change the language as appropriate.

These issues also arise in Section 20.

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
 20. GOVERNING LAW. Each of the parties hereto agrees that this
 Agreement and all the Loan Documents were executed in Massachusetts
 Florida, and are governed by and construed according to the laws of The
 Commonwealth of Massachusetts State of Florida. Borrower hereby
 consents to the personal jurisdiction of The Commonwealth of
 Massachusetts State of Florida in connection with any action arising out
 of or in connection with the Loan, this Agreement and/or the other Loan
 Documents. The Bank's obligations under this Agreement and its
 obligations to make any advance or to make any future commitment is
 subject to Statutory Loan Limitations as set forth in Massachusetts
 General Laws Chapter 167E, Section 14. Consistent with said Statutory
 Loan Limitations, the Bank may refuse to fund the Loan or any advance,
 may require a principal reduction in an existing balance, and may sell
 participations, in any instance where a loan limit violation could occur.

As you can see, just making those two changes cannot be accomplished
with two quick edits, and it is not as simple as just replacing those two
terms throughout the document. Every time you change something in a
complex form document like this you have to read closely the rest of the
document to see if other provisions are affected, and then modify those
provisions as appropriate.

D. Keep Track of Any Changes You Make

After you are done revising the document you are using, make sure to keep
track of the changes you made. Always start with a copy of the original
document and keep the original unedited document in your files. The
changes you make for one deal may not be appropriate to use in another
deal you work on in the future. If they aren't, it may make a lot more sense
to go back to the original document and change that, than change the
revised version again.

Once you have a set of documents drafted, and before you send them to the
other side, send a set of drafts to your client to review. Make sure the
changes are highlighted and the client can see what you did, especially the

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
factual information you entered, and confirm it is accurate. You may have
misheard something the client said, or the client may have misspoken.
Regardless of the reason, it is important to fix any mistakes before the
documents go out the door.

Some clients will just skim what you send them, and then send it back with
a thank you note (in fact some clients may think of the drafting as your job
and not understand why you are seeking their input). Other clients will go
through your edits with a fine-tooth comb and give you a lot of feedback.
In my opinion the latter type is far preferable to work with. Just don't get
defensive if you get a lot of comments. Better to incorporate those
suggestions and make the agreement perfectly match what the client wants,
than to go without them and have a document signed that doesn't accurately
conform to the deal.

Once all the proofreading is done, provide the documents to the attorney on
the other side of the transaction. In a commercial transaction, the attorney
representing the other side will likely have additional proposed revisions.
You will have responses to those revisions. And there may be other parties
in the transaction who also want to revise the documents. As a result, it is
important to keep track of all these changes, who made them, and when
they were made. In the old days, that was done by keeping paper copies of
each set of revisions in manila files. Today, it is more common to just keep
copies of the computer files, labeled appropriately. For example, a file
containing the borrower's first set of revisions to a loan agreement might
have a filename like this: "loanagre.rev1.borr.2.28.2019.doc"

As for the proposed changes, they are usually done by marking up the
original document. When paper was popular, an attorney would handwrite
comments on a "hard copy" of the agreement and send it to the other side
by "fax." Today, it is more common to use the "track changes" feature in a
program like Word (You could also use comment bubbles or even
footnotes), and then send the comments to the other side by e-mail.

If you are the original producer of the document at issue, you have an
interest in making sure all the requested revisions work together, and the

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
document is still clear and coherent after it is revised. Sometimes when
there are too many "cooks in the kitchen," the revisions can get out of hand,
and the document suffers. If you are the original drafter, it is part of your
job not to let that happen. After all the changes are in, you will likely have
to go back through the document to make everything hang together more
uniformly, and then circulate a revised draft.

Once you have the document in final form, save it in some way that it
cannot be changed. If you are handling a closing, the other parties are
relying on you to produce the final version of the document at the closing.
As a practical matter there isn't enough time for every attorney to proofread
every page of every document while everyone else is at the closing waiting
to sign. So, everyone has to rely on you. And if you let them down by
unintentionally substituting the wrong draft, your reputation will be
irreparably harmed. So always keep careful track of which document is the
final version!

Remember, completing a form document for a deal is not just an exercise in
filling in the blanks. If it was, the client wouldn't be asking you to do it.
Your job is to tailor the document to the deal. That involves closely reading
the document and revising it with an appreciation of its complexity and how
it was originally put together. So, use your brain, and think about whether
the facts fit the substantive provisions. If they don't, make appropriate
revisions to the language. And make the changes fit by following the same
protocols the original drafter followed. That is how you complete a set of
form documents for a deal.

                                   Practice Exercise

         Complete the Construction Loan Agreement in the Appendix of
 this book for the following deal:

         The borrower is an individual named Alberto Salvatori. He lives
 at 333 South Street in Micanopy, Florida. The lender is Archer Bank,
 which has a branch office in Micanopy at 4 Sunrise Terrace. There are no
 guarantors.

        The project will be a single-family home in Macintosh, Florida.
The address is 7 Palm Court, Macintosh. The borrower plans to occupy
the property after the closing.

        The loan is for $150,000. There will be no retainage.
        There are no junior lenders.
        The lender approved Homes, Inc. as the contractor for the project.
There is no architect. When the project is done, the contractor will certify
compliance with applicable laws.
        The borrower will be using part of the loan to acquire the property.

10. REVISING THE OTHER
SIDE'S COMPLETED
DOCUMENTS

T he other situation you are often involved if you have a
          transactional practice is proposing revisions to a completed
          document when you represent the other side in a deal (i.e. you are
not the one who created the form or tailored the document for the deal).
That usually involves qualifying the contract language, imposing
conditions, and narrowing the scope of the original provisions. If your
client is asked to sign a document you didn't draft, chances are very good
you will need to go through this aspect of dealing with complex
documents. And that is true even if the other side claims they are using a
"standard" form and presents it to you like it's written in stone. (The one
exception to this rule I am aware of is for the loan documents used by
Fannie Mae. Those loans are securitized and sold in the secondary market.
For that and other reasons, there is really nothing you can do to revise the
language on behalf of a borrower. It is still important to explain to the
borrower what the substance of those documents is. But this discussion on
revising a document to protect a client's interests really doesn't apply in that
context.)

A. Qualify the Language in the Agreement

The primary way you protect the client's interests in documents you have
not drafted yourself is by qualifying the language in the documents. For

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
example, suppose there is an obligation in the document that says this:
 The Manager will remove all lead paint from the interior of the
 Premises.

If you represent the owner of the premises, you could make that obligation
stronger by changing it to this:
 The Manager will remove all lead paint from the interior of the
 Premises to the satisfaction of the Owner.

If the owner drafted the language and you represented the manager, you
could make the language weaker by revising it to this:
 The Manager will use reasonable efforts to remove all lead paint from
 the interior of the Premises.

And if both parties were negotiating the language, they might agree on an
objective standard that is somewhere in between those two extremes by
revising it to say this:
 The Manager will remove all lead paint from the interior of the
 Premises in a good and workmanlike manner.

Depending on who you represent, you can qualify the language to better
serve your client's interests. By qualifying the language, you are changing
the level of risk that each party has to bear. The first example puts all the
risk on the manager. In the second example, the owner is taking more risk.

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
Another example might be the language used in representations and
warranties. A seller in a real estate transaction might not be comfortable
representing that "there are no hazardous wastes on the Property." The
seller would know whether or not the seller dumped any hazardous wastes
on the property. But the seller would have no way of knowing what
happened before the seller owned the property. So, to better protect the
seller's interests, the representation could be modified to say, "to the best of
the Seller's knowledge, there are no hazardous wastes on the Property." By
making that qualification, you transfer some of the risk from the seller to
the buyer.

B. Impose Conditions on Rights, Obligations and Prohibitions

You can also change the allocation of risk in a document by imposing
conditions on the exercise of rights by the other side, the imposition of
obligations on your client, and the applicability of prohibitions that affect
your client. Suppose, for example, an employer has the right to test an
employee's blood for the presence of illegal drugs. The applicable
provision might simply say this:

 The Employer may obtain and test a sample of the Employee's blood
 to look for the presence of illegal drugs; and the Employee will
 submit to such tests when requested.

You could limit the employer's rights by imposing conditions on the
language, like this:

 After first giving the Employee written notice at least thirty (30) days
 before the proposed test date, the Employer may obtain and test a
 sample of the Employee's blood to look for the presence of illegal
 drugs; and the Employee will submit to such tests, unless the
 Employee has a valid medical reason for refusing to do so.

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
By imposing these conditions, you transfer some of the risk from the
employee to the employer.

C. Narrow the Scope of Language in Rights, Obligations and
Prohibitions

Yet another option is to narrow the scope of the language whenever the
other side is given a right or your client is subject to an obligation or
prohibition. This is particularly helpful when dealing with exculpatory
provisions, which are often drafted in an unreasonably broad way. For
example, here is a release from an apartment lease:

 The Tenant releases, remises and forever discharges the Landlord,
 and the Landlord's employees and agents, from any claims, causes of
 action or lawsuits the Tenant has now or may have in the future.

Ideally, you would just delete that provision, if you represent a tenant. But
at the very least you can revise it to make the language narrower, like this:

 The Tenant releases, remises and forever discharges the Landlord
 from any claims, causes of action or lawsuits arising out of the use of
 the Property the Tenant has now and is currently aware of.

When you are proposing changes like this, you should do the changes in a
manner that shows the other attorney what you're proposing to revise; and
makes it easy for the other attorney to accept your changes, if they are
agreeable to making them. Don't just ask the attorney to revise a provision
to address an issue you are concerned about. Make the revisions for her, so
that they can just accept the change if they are agreeable. For example, if I

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
were requesting a revision to the release provision above, I would do it like
this:

 The Tenant releases, remises and forever discharges the Landlord, and the
 Landlord's employees and agents, from any claims, causes of action or
 lawsuits arising out of the use of the Property the Tenant has now or may
 have in the future and is currently aware of.

D. Change the Numbers; Ask to Receive More and Pay Less

Another way you can advance your client's interests in a document is to
look for the numbers in the agreement, and determine whether it would be
in your client's interest to propose changes in the amounts. But distinguish
between the core consideration for the deal, which the client has already
agreed to, and all the other numbers that the other party's lawyer added
when he drafted the contract you are seeking to revise.

For example, if the client agreed to pay $1,000,000 for the property, that
amount is probably not something you can revise. But if the attorney added
a late fee of 12% per annum to any late payments, and that issue had not
previously been discussed, then that is definitely something you should
negotiate on your client's behalf.

If the agreement provides for other payments to be made by your client,
then it is obviously in your client's interest to pay less. If you client is the
one receiving the payments, then the opposite is true. If payments are to be
made within some time period, then more time is better if you client is the
one making the payments. Less time is better if your client is the one
receiving the payments. If there is an interest rate applicable to past due
amounts, the situation is analogous. Negotiate for a lower rate if your client
will be obligated to pay it, and a higher rate if your client will be receiving
the payments.

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
Also, if your client is agreeing to pay an undetermined amount, like
expenses incurred by the other party, define those expenses narrowly to
limit that liability. Also consider adding a cap or limit on what your client
is agreeing to pay.

Those are just a few examples of the types of dollar amounts, time periods
and other numbers you may find in an agreement and can revise to better
protect your client's interests. Put yourself in the client's shoes and imagine
you are the one who is being requested to sign what the other lawyer
drafted. If you wouldn't sign because the numbers are excessive or unfair,
then raise those issues on your client's behalf.

E. Don't Think Industry Forms Are Written in Stone

There are times when documents are presented in a format that makes it
look like they cannot be edited, but the reality is there is no reason why you
can't change them. Examples of those types of documents are the listing
agreement forms and real estate purchase and sale agreement forms that are
drafted by trade associations in the real estate industry for use in residential
real estate transactions. Those forms may be popular but there is nothing
"standard" about them; they were drafted for the people the trade
represents. Brokers represent sellers so most realtor generated forms are
drafted primarily to represent sellers. If you represent a buyer, there will
likely be some changes you will want to make.

So, if you get something like a listing agreement for a residential property
in a computerized format that cannot easily be revised, one option you have
is to print the document out and then hand write or type the edits on the
hard copy before the document is signed. That would be very "old
school." If the signing is being done online, another option is to add the
changes as an addendum to the document, make sure the document
incorporates the addendum by reference, and have the parties also sign the
addendum. Here is an example:

                   Addendum to Limited Listing Agreement

When the attorney representing the other side is responsible for drafting the
documents, your job is not to just read through what the other attorney
drafted and tell the client it is o.k. to sign. Your job is to participate in the
drafting process by revising the documents to protect and/or advance your
client's interests. Qualify the language, impose conditions, and limit the
scope of provisions as appropriate. Follow the protocols in the agreement;
and make it easy for the other side to see what you are asking for and make
the requested change. If there is a disagreement over the language, then
talk to the other lawyer and work it out. I have some advice on contract
negotiations in the next chapter.

11. NEGOTIATING
CONTRACT PROVISIONS

N egotiating contract provisions is very different than negotiating
            something like the settlement of a case. For one thing, there are
            no dollar amounts to deal with. Also, the process is less
adversarial. In litigation, if the settlement falls through, you just go back to
fighting it out in court. If you are trying to document a transaction and the
negotiations fall through, the transaction doesn't happen. That not only
means both sides are upset at you and the other lawyer; it also likely means
neither of you get paid. Clients like deal makers, not deal killers. Plus,
transactional lawyers often collect their fee from the proceeds of the
transaction. So, you never want to let the deal fall through because you and

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
the other lawyer couldn't figure out a reasonable way to document the
terms. You need to be a good negotiator. Do what you need to get prepared
before you start negotiating. Adopt a strategy for getting what you really
want. And then resolve the issues and get the agreement done.

A. Meet with the Client

Before you start the negotiating make sure you are prepared. Meet with the
client before you meet with the other attorney and find out two things.
First, go through the terms of the deal and find out what is important to the
client. What are the items the client must have for the deal to proceed; and
what are the things the client can do without? In other words, what terms
are not negotiable and what terms are flexible? As to the latter, what
options are there? Is there a backup position the client could live with?
What other options do you have if you can't get the client's first choice?

Second, find out how much bargaining power the client has. Who needs
this deal more: your client or the other side? Who has a more substantial
interest in the deal? If the deal is a finance transaction and your client is
lending much less money than the other banks, then your client likely has
much less leverage. What is the market like for the goods or services your
client is providing? Is it a buyer's market or a seller's market? If your client
is an employee and you are negotiating an employment agreement, is your
client very valuable to the firm? Or is he lucky he got the job?

Meet with your client and at least find out those two things before you start
negotiating. Don't make the mistake of accomplishing something your
client really doesn't need, while failing to get something your client must
have. And don't go into a negotiation making a lot of demands and
embarrass yourself by having to give in on everything because your client
has no bargaining power. Iron those issues out before the process begins.

B. Develop a Strategy

After you have met with the client, take the time to come up with a strategy
for the negotiations. Have a plan for how you want to proceed. Do you

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
want to put some "throwaways" on the table, and then try to get what you
want by giving up the "throwaways" in exchange for what you really want?
Do you want to get the client involved and play "god cop; bad cop" with
one of you as the good cop and the other as the bad cop? How about testing
the water with some relatively unimportant provisions to find out how the
other side negotiates, then move on to more important provisions? He may
be a haggler, someone who likes to cut to the chase or someone who is
obstinate in negotiations and refuses to change anything. Better to know
which before you get to the important issues.

Also, make sure you have an explanation for each change you are
requesting and a good argument for why it should be made. It may not be
enough to just mark up a document, send it to the other side, and wait for a
response. The other attorney may want to go through each revision and
understand why you are requesting it. Regardless you will also want to be
ready with one or more back up requests if you can't get your first choice.
As an example, you might want to change the language to say the work will
be done "to the satisfaction of" your client. But, as a backup, you might
also be willing to agree to having the work done to meet certain specific
performance standards.

And find out who you will be dealing with before you start. Google the
lawyer on the other side and see what their background is. Maybe ask some
associates who might know them what their style is. And do the same thing
for the client on the other side. Anything you can find out about the parties
could be helpful to you in negotiations. If you are going to deal with a
bully, it is better to know that going in. If the lawyer has a reputation for
being difficult but the client is a reasonable business person, suggest the
lawyers and the clients meet together. Any information you can get about
the participants may be helpful to ensure the negotiations are productive.

C. Negotiate with the Other Side

Once you are ready, try to do the negotiations on your own terms. Ideally,
you would have the other attorney come to your office to talk about the
revisions. But that may not be practicable. Likely, the other attorney wants

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
you to come to their office. They don't want to drive all the way to the
other side of town, and neither do you. Plus, both sides want to get through
the process as efficiently as possible, so most negotiations end up
happening over the phone.

If the negotiations are going to happen by telephone, make sure you are the
one making the call. If the other attorney calls and catches you off guard,
tell him you are busy with another project and will call back. Don't deal
with the call if you aren't ready. Don't let the other side dictate when the
negotiations happen.

Also, once the negotiations start, in addition to making your own
presentation, listen carefully to how the other side has to say. If you can
figure out where they have flexibility and where their hands are tied you
will be better able to advance your client's interests, and you will be more
successful at resolving any impasses you encounter. Try to figure out who
the decision maker is on the other side. Is the attorney driving the
negotiations or just doing what the client tells him to do? Are the two of
them working together or is one of them letting the other one deal with
whatever it is you are proposing? If the negotiations are in person, watch
closely for the other person's body language, micro expressions and
reactions to the issues you raise during the negotiations. What you hear and
see is at least as important as what you have to say.

Most importantly, never be a deal killer. Always be a deal maker. In
complex transactions there are often multiple attorneys revising a
document. Everyone has to advance their client's interests, but everyone
also has to work together to get the deal done. You want to be assertive and
persuasive about the changes you request. You don't want to meekly
submit some comments and then not even follow up to find out if any were
acceptable to the other side. But you never want to get the reputation for
being a deal killer. Everyone has to get along for the deal to happen. So,
when you are advocating for a particular revision, be sensitive to the other
interests involved and look for ways to compromise.

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
Conduct your negotiations with the mindset that you are part of a team of
professionals in charge of making the deal happen. There is seldom any
harm done by opening your mouth and asking for a change in the language.
If you represent a small player in a big project, you may need to choose
your battles more carefully than you would otherwise. But you still need to
say something, if for no other reason than to justify your existence. No one
expects you to be a wallflower. Lawyers are not wallflowers. But you are
also not a litigator concerned only with advocating your client's position.
You need to be assertive, but you also need to compromise. You need to be
an advocate, but you also need to be a deal maker, not a deal killer. If you
are good at doing that, your services will always be in demand.

                                  Practice Exercises
         Pretend you represent the other side in the transaction involved in
 the Associate Employment Agreement, Laptop Purchase Agreement,
 Residential Lease Agreement, Sale of Assets Agreement and/or
 Consulting Services Agreement you drafted as the practice exercises for
 the previous chapters. Draft proposed revisions to the contract(s) you
 drafted, then give the original document to another student in your class,
 ask the student to represent the side you originally represented, and
 negotiate your proposed revisions with the student.

12. ETHICAL ISSUES IN
CONTRACT DRAFTING

E thical issues are not easy to deal with in a transactional practice.
          Most of the ethical rules are for litigators not transactional
          attorneys, so there is often not much guidance. But there are still
plenty of ethical pitfalls for transactional attorneys. And they are even
more difficult to deal with when you are just starting out. If you commit
malpractice you may lose your job, but professional liability insurance will
likely cover the loss, assuming you have it. If you commit a violation of the
rules of ethics, you could lose your license. So, the stakes are high!

Suppose you are working in a law firm, helping a senior partner close a
loan. You send a draft loan agreement to borrower's counsel. Unknown to
you, the document contains metadata showing the deletion of an "ipso
facto" clause in a prior version. Borrower's counsel checks the metadata
and requests the same change for their client's documents. The partner tells
you to go ahead and delete the clause. The partner says the bank includes it
because some borrowers don't realize it's unenforceable. Then they tell you
to hurry up and get the loan closed. You are rushing when you print out the
documents, and accidentally print out the original unchanged version for the
borrower to sign. After the closing, the senior partner catches the mistake
and tells you to correct it by attaching the signature page to the revised
version. The partner also sees you forgot to get the signature on the
mortgage notarized. But you are able to correct that mistake as well; you
take the document to a notary and have them notarize it after the fact. You
then have the loan documents compiled and bound, and send them to the

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
client with a letter explaining the substantive requirements in the
documents. You aren't in the office when the letter is typed up, so you ask
your paralegal to sign your name and send it out.

How many ethical issues do you see?

I'm sure every law student knows you can't defraud your own client or lie
to the court. Among other things, attorneys are prohibited in the ethical
rules from engaging "in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or
misrepresentation...." E.g., Florida Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 4-
8.4(c). But there are a lot of subtle ways you could find yourself doing
something in connection with your drafting that could be considered
dishonest.

Is it ethical, for example, to include in a contract a provision you know is
unenforceable, like an "ipso facto" clause (entitling the lender to call the
loan if the borrower files a bankruptcy petition), for the purpose of
deceiving a party as to his rights? E.g., Florida Rules of Professional
Conduct, 4-1.2(d)("A lawyer shall not counsel a client to engage, or assist a
client, in conduct that the lawyer knows or reasonably should know is
criminal or fraudulent."); See, Alexandra Sickler, Ethics in Contract
Drafting, 64 Gavel 10.

You probably know what metadata is (information attached to a document
that is not visible on the face of the document); but are you may not be in
the habit of scrubbing the metadata from your word documents before you
provide them to the client or a third party? What if you circulate a set of
loan documents you drafted and accidentally include in the metadata
confidential information about the client? It is clear an attorney has an
ethical obligation to keep client information confidential. E.g., Florida
Rules of Professional Conduct, 4-1.6(a). Are you in violation of the rule if
you accidentally reveal that confidential information to a third party? See
e.g., Florida Rules of Professional Conduct, 4-1.6(e) ("A lawyer must make
reasonable efforts to prevent the inadvertent or unauthorized disclosure of,
or unauthorized access to, information relating to the representation of a
client").

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
What if you fail to keep track of the final version of a document and
accidentally arrange for the signing of an early draft at the closing? You are
implicitly representing the document is the final version by producing it at
the closing, but the misrepresentation is not intentional. Again, does it
matter that you did it by accident? See e.g., Florida Rules of Professional
Conduct, Rule 4-1.1 (Attorneys must also "provide competent
representation," which requires "the legal knowledge, skill, thoroughness,
and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation.")

I think it's a clear ethical violation to have a client sign a blank signature
page, and then substitute the document later. If the client signed a blank
page and then you made it look like the client signed the document you
attached, that is clearly deceitful. But what if you substitute one document
for a revised version after the document is signed? Does it matter whether
the client knows about the substitution, and consents to the new document's
terms, or whether the changes are material, or only affect the rights of
another party to the document? The client still didn't do what it has been
made to look like the client did, right?

What if a senior attorney tells you to do it? Is that an excuse? "A lawyer is
bound by the Rules of Professional Conduct notwithstanding that the
lawyer acted at the direction of another person." E.g., Florida Rules of
Professional Conduct, Rule 4-5.2(a). So, what would you do? Would you
refuse? Or is there some better way of handling the situation?

It isn't unusual for parties to separately sign duplicate originals of a contract
if they are in two different places when the closing occurs. And there is no
problem with the closing attorney subsequently combining the signature
pages to form one fully signed document. What is the difference between
that situation and the one in the hypothetical?

If a client has already signed a document, can the attorney have it notarized
after the fact? The notary's jurat usually states that the signer "subscribed
before me." Subscribed means signed, so isn't the notary attesting to a
misrepresentation if the signer didn't actually sign in front of the notary?

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
And finally, is it o.k. to have your paralegal sign your name to a cover
letter? If the letter just says, "Enclosed please find copies of the
documents," that's one thing. But the paralegal's identity and nonlawyer
status should still be disclosed. If the letter discusses the substantive
content of the documents, that's likely different. Among other things, a
lawyer may be aiding in the unauthorized practice of law by allowing a
nonlawyer to sign a letter containing legal advice. See, Florida Rules of
Professional Conduct, 4-5.5(b)(2) (A nonlawyer may not "hold out to the
public or otherwise represent that the lawyer is admitted to practice in
Florida.").

Even more important than the issue of whether common occurrences like
these constitute ethical violations is the issue of how to handle them should
they arise. You may have noticed most of these issues are the result of
someone making a mistake and then looking for a quick, easy way to fix it.
Mistakes happen. Everyone makes mistakes from time to time. That isn't
the problem. The problem is how you handle the mistakes when they occur.
To avoid violating the rules of ethics, I would recommend that you follow
these three steps.

First, figure out how to properly correct whatever went wrong. Probably
you are going have to re-do whatever you did. If the problem happened in
connection with a closing, that usually means having the document signed
again.

Second, be up front about what happened. Don't try to cover it up. When
you tell the affected party what happened also tell them how you are going
to fix it. Don't just "drop a bomb" on someone's lap and then leave them to
figure out what to do.

Third, correct the mistake on your own time and at your own expense (don't
bill the client for the time you spend correcting your own error). And fix
the problem a way that is as little of an inconvenience as possible to your
client and/or your employer. So if you need a page initialed, bring the
document to the client's place of business; don't ask them to take time off
from work and come into your office to get that done.

I remember my ethics professor in law school saying "Your license is your
ticket to practice law. Whatever you do, don't do anything that could put
your ticket in jeopardy." Unfortunately, when you are really busy and under
a lot of stress, there are shortcuts you might be tempted to take that might
seem perfectly innocent at the time. But later, with 20/20 hindsight, what
you did might also be characterized as inappropriate. Despite the rush of
activity, you still have to pay close attention and stay on top of what you are
doing to avoid ending up on the wrong side of an ethics complaint.

13. GETTING THE CONTRACT
SIGNED (CLOSING THE
DEAL)

I 've been hired to draft a lot of documents, but I don't think there has
      ever been a time when my job wasn't also to get the documents signed
      and the deal done. Sometimes you just need a signature, but more
often there is money to collect as well. If the signer is signing for an entity,
you should always get some verification of the signer's authority. If the
deal is complex enough, that will be just part of the closing agenda and due
diligence process that precedes the actual signing of the documents. And if
all goes well, don't forget to follow-up with the client and make sure the
door is open for them to refer more work your way.

A. Get the Documents Signed and Collect the Money

The last step in drafting, just like the first step (getting up to speed) has
little to do with drafting itself. It is diligently following-up and getting the
deal closed. You would be surprised how many times a project "falls
through the cracks," especially when you are busy, and your attention is
called to other bigger and better things.

And it isn't just the signing you have to get done. If the agreement involves
a deposit that is supposed to be collected at closing, your job is to get the
money and make sure it goes where it is supposed to go. If you don't do
that, there could be hell to pay. If there is a breach by one of the parties

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
later on, and the other party's remedy is to keep the deposit, that party isn't
going to be happy to find out you never got it.

B. Verify Authority to Sign for an Entity

If one of the persons signing the documents is signing on behalf of an
entity, there are a number of things you need to confirm to make sure the
signature will be binding on the entity. Make sure the person is who he
says he is by asking to see their driver's license. And consider having them
swear or affirm that they are signing voluntarily by having their signature
notarized.

In addition, review the state statutes for the type of entity involved to
confirm that the entity has the power to enter into the agreement, and to
determine who has the authority to enter into the agreement on behalf of the
entity. For example, in Florida, the powers of a corporation are enumerated
in § 607.0392, Fla. Stat.; and the authority to exercise those powers is given
to the directors of the corporation in § 607.0801, Fla. Stat.

Then look at the entity's organizational documents (e.g., for a corporation,
the articles and bylaws) to analyze the same issues (i.e. make sure the
transaction is not "ultra vires" or beyond the corporation's powers and the
signer has been properly authorized by the directors). Usually, the purposes
of the corporation are set forth at the beginning of the articles of
organization; and power of the directors to manage the corporation is set
forth in the bylaws. Also, the bylaws will typically state that third parties
may rely on a certificate of the clerk as to the authority of someone else to
enter into the transaction and sign the documents, like this:

 5.5 Evidence of Authority. A certificate by the Clerk or Secretary, as to
 any action taken by the stockholders, Directors, any committee or any
 officer or representative of the corporation shall as to all persons who rely
 on the certificate in good faith be conclusive evidence of such action.

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
Relying on a provision like that in the bylaws, you would require the entity
entering into the agreement to produce a clerk's certificate and resolutions
evidencing the signer's authority. The clerk's certificate identifies the signer
and the signer's title, and authenticates the attached resolutions which
confirm the signer is authorized to sign on behalf of the entity. Here is an
example for a corporation:

            SECRETARY'S CERTIFICATE

The undersigned, on behalf of Cigars for Everyone, Inc., a Florida
corporation (the "Corporation") and not individually, certifies that:

1. Attached to this certificate as Exhibit A is a true, correct and
complete copy of the Action of Directors at a Meeting of the Directors
of the Corporation, duly adopted by the Directors on April 12, 2020,
which Action has not been revoked, modified, amended, or rescinded
and is in full force and effect as of the date of this certificate (the
"Action").

2. The Corporation is a non-profit corporation legally existing and
in good standing under the laws of the State of Florida, as of the date
of this certificate, and has the power, authority and legal right to
enter into, and to execute, deliver, and perform, the obligations under
the documents listed in the Action.

3. The following persons have been duly elected and qualified, and
on the date hereof are officers of the Corporation, holding the
respective offices set opposite their names:

 Name          Title

Sam Zapata     President

Eileen Zapata  Secretary

       Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
The undersigned, has, on behalf of the Corporation, executed this
certificate on this 22nd day of April, 2020.

       ______________________________
       Eileen Zapata, Secretary

                                      Exhibit A

        ACTIONS OF DIRECTORS BY WRITTEN CONSENT

                      CIGARS FOR EVERYONE, INC.

MEETING: April 12, 2020

Pursuant to the Articles of Organization and By-Laws of Cigars for
Everyone, Inc., a Florida corporation (the "Corporation"), the
Directors of the Corporation do adopt the following resolutions and
agree to the taking of the actions set forth below:

RESOLVED: That the Corporation is empowered, authorized,
and directed to take all action and execute and deliver any documents
necessary or proper to direct, complete, carry out, consummate and
effectuate the transfer, conveyance, or sale of the project located on
the property at 101 University Avenue, Gainesville, Florida (the
"Property").

RESOLVED: That the President of the Corporation, Sam
Zapata, be, and is, empowered, authorized, and directed in the name
of and on behalf of the Corporation to take all action and execute and
deliver any documents necessary or proper to direct, complete, carry
out, consummate, and effectuate the transfer, conveyance or sale of
the Property to the University of Florida, including, without
limitation, a quitclaim deed of the Property from the Corporation to
the University of Florida, a Settlement Statement, 1099 Form and
Property Owner's Affidavit.

                         Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
If the transaction involves a loan in a substantial amount it may also be
appropriate to request and opinion from borrower's counsel that the signer is
authorized, and the loan documents are enforceable against the entity. If
there is a mortgage involved, it may be appropriate to go a step further and
request insurance from a title company that the mortgage creates and
enforceable lien on the property, and the lien has the required priority over
other liens. The issue of whether a signer for an entity is properly
authorized is central to any closing, but for very large and complex deals, it
is also just the tip of the iceberg.

C. Create a Closing Agenda

If the deal is something like a commercial loan for the construction of a
multi-unit building, then the process will likely involve the creation of a
closing agenda or checklist, which is a list of due diligence items that need
to be produced, reviewed, and approved before the documents are actually
signed and the deal closed. Here is an example of a short closing checklist:

Borrower Corporation (Borrower). Items marked B are to be
submitted by the Borrower. Items marked L are the responsibility of

 5. Subcontracts

The agenda also helps to keep everyone focused and on track in a large
commercial project involving a lot of attorneys. Using e-mail helps keep
people in the loop too. At the beginning of every closing I handled, one of
the first things I did was get everyone's e-mail address. E-mail is an
effective way to keep everyone in the loop and deliver copies of documents,
drafts, and other closing materials.
I used to also participate in periodic conference calls for the closings I was
involved in. If I were doing closings today, I'd do the conferences online
with a service like Zoom, Uberconference or Skype. The advantage of an
online conference is that you can put a document on the screen during the
conference so everyone else can see it. You can revise the document in real
time as various modifications are discussed. And you can keep a recording
of what was said and done by the parties and their attorneys while the
conference took place, assuming everyone consents to being recorded.

D. Follow Up After the Closing

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
After the deal is done, it is usually counsel's responsibility to distribute to
the parties either the original, signed documents or copies of the signed
documents. In the old days, attorneys would distribute a closing "bible"
containing all the relevant documents. Today you will most likely send out
a CD containing pdfs of the same documents. When you send that package
out to the client, I would also recommend sending the client a cover letter
highlighting any deadlines or other important provisions in the agreement
the client will need to remember. Put together a nice organized package so
the client can see what they paid for and thank them for the opportunity to
be of service. The end of every transaction, assuming all went well, is a
good time to continue developing your relationship with the client.

Law is a service industry. You can't save the world if the world does not
want to hire you to do the work. In the same way that you should always
look for opportunities to add value to a deal, you should also be on the
lookout for opportunities to further develop your relationships with clients.
As long as you have clients, you will never have trouble finding a job.

14. DRAFTING WITH
DOCUMENT ASSEMBLY
PROGRAMS AND CLOSING
WITH ON LINE RESOURCES

T oday we are transitioning from a period when paper was king to a
          digital age when everything is recorded in computer files. When
          personal computers first became popular, attorneys used them to
replace a typewriter and a filing cabinet. But now more and more of the
actual drafting of documents is being done by computer. You don't need to
train yourself to work with every type of software, but you do need to know
what types of programs are out there and when they would be of use.
Beverly Rich, How AI is Changing Contracts, Harvard Business Review
(2018).

When I first started doing transactional work, it was common practice for
the closing attorney to deliver to the parties a "closing binder" after the
transaction was completed. The closing binder consisted of copies of all the
documents and a table of contents (a revised version of the closing agenda),
nicely "velo" bound together. Later the practice changed to providing the
same content on a computer disc (cd). Cd's save a lot of paper and space,
but there are also disadvantages to storing documents in digital form. CD's
replaced floppy disks which are now extinct. And CD's are being replaced
more and more by flash drives, so CD's may soon be extinct as well. I have
old files on my computer that I can no longer open because they were

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
drafted with software that is no longer in use. Say what you want about
paper and other primitive forms of storing information, but there are cave
paintings made by Neanderthals 64,000 years ago that you can still read.

A. Drafting with Document Assembly Programs

Today, computers are not only used to store documents, computers are also
used to draft documents. One type of program is just a form filler. The
user inputs factual information and the program inserts that information into
appropriate blanks in form documents. To use that type of program you
would first create a template for a document. Here is an example of what a
template for a short form mortgage might look like:

                                     MORTGAGE

         <<Borrower's Name>> of <<Borrower's Street Address>>,
 <<Borrower's County>> County, <<Borrower's State>>, for
 consideration paid, grants to <<Lender's Name >>of <<Lender's Street
 Address>>,<<Lender's County>> County, <<Lender's State>>, with
 MORTGAGE COVENANTS, to secure the payment of <<Amount of
 Loan in Words>> dollars in <<Term of Loan in Years>> years with
 <<Interest Rate in Percent>> per cent interest per annum, payable in
 <<Number of Installments>> installments, as provided in a promissory
 note of even date, the land together with the buildings thereon in
 <<Address of Mortgaged Property>>, <<County of Mortgaged
 Property>> County, <<State of Mortgaged Property>> more particularly
 described as follows:

                              <<Property Description>>

         This Mortgage is upon the STATUTORY CONDITION, for any
 breach of which Mortgagee shall have the STATUTORY POWER OF
 SALE.

         This Mortgage is executed under seal this ___ day of _________,
 ____.

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
        Mortgagor

        ___________________
        <<Borrower's Name>>

                COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS

<<County of Mortgaged Property>>

        On this ____ day of _________, ____, before me, personally
appeared <<Borrower's Name>>, who proved to me through satisfactory
evidence of identification, which was
___________________________________________________, to be the
persons whose name is signed on the preceding document, and
acknowledged to me that they signed it voluntarily for its stated purpose.

____________________________                                     _____
               Notary Public                                     My

commission expires:

You would next create an input screen you would use to enter the
information the software needs to fill out the document. That might look
like this:

                            Input Form for Mortgage
What is the borrower's name? __________________
What is the borrower street address?

Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
        Street: _________________
        County: ________________
        State: __________________
What is the lender's name? ____________________
What is the lender's address?
        Street: __________________
        County: _________________
        State: ___________________
What is the amount of the loan in words? ______________________
dollars
What is the term of the loan? _________ years
What is the interest rate? ____________ percent
How many installments will there be? ___________
What is the address of the mortgaged property?

            Street: _________________
            County: ________________
            State: __________________
What is the legal description of the property?
___________________________________________________________
___________________________________________________________
___________________________________________________________
_________________________________________________________

                         Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
Then you would enter the information into the input screen and the software
would produce a draft of the document based on the template.

Obviously you wouldn't go through all this trouble for just one short
document. You would use a program like this if you are repeatedly using
the same lengthy form documents for specific types of transactions. For
example, if your job is to conduct commercial loan closings for an
institutional client of the firm, and the client uses the same forms for each
transaction, then using a program like this to produce and initial draft of
documents for a deal would likely make the process much more efficient.

In addition, there are other programs you could use that are more
sophisticated. For example, there are programs that will not only fill in the
blanks, but also decide what types of provisions to use depending upon
what the facts are. So, the software might ask whether the loan is to be a
recourse loan or a nonrecourse loan. Depending upon the answer, the
software will insert the provisions applicable to a recourse loan or the
provisions applicable to a nonrecourse loan, and then fill in the blanks in
those provisions. The software might also ask for the identity of the
borrower. If the borrower is a partnership, then the program will add
provisions appropriate for a partnership. If the borrower is a corporation,
the program will add provisions appropriate for a corporation.

Banks use this kind of software to generate residential loan documents with
the usual Fannie Mae forms. Brokers use this type of software to generate
purchase and sale agreements and other simple documents for use in
residential real estate transactions. Similar programs are available to
consumers. Nolo sells a popular program called WillMaker that will walk a
non-lawyer through the process of drafting a last will and testament. Rocket
Lawyer, LegalZoom and Law Depot are online services that help consumers
and small businesses draft simple legal documents. Programs like
HotDocs, XpressDox, Contract Express and NetDocuments help lawyers to
produce a first draft of more complex documents. Also, some programs
interface with e-mail, filing and calendaring software, as well as client

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
websites. And programs like LegalSifter and LawGeex use artificial
intelligence to help attorneys review existing contracts. If I were in law
school today, I would consider learning how to use that type of software
and adding my proficiency with it to my resume.

Does all this mean we don't need lawyers? No. These programs make the
process more efficient, but they don't eliminate the need for good lawyers.
You should be aware of them because, as a practical matter, you have to be
able to do better than they can do. If the client can go online and print out a
document that is just as good as the one you drafted, then the client no
longer needs your services. It is more convenient, less expensive and less
time-consuming to have a computer draft a document than to meet with an
attorney and wait for the attorney to send you a draft (and a bill). As a
result, the product the attorney produces must always be better than any
computer can do.

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
                                B. Closing with Online Resources

                                           It also used to be that documents were executed in a closing in an
                                           attorney's office, but that is changing too. More and more
                                           documents are executed online with electronic signatures. For
                                           example, programs called DocuSign, DotLoop and HelloSign
                                           enable attorneys to have some real estate documents signed
                                           online. And some programs also facilitate the exchange of
document drafts and collaboration by attorneys.

Electronic signatures are governed by two statutes. The federal Electronic
Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act 15 U.S.C. §§7001-7031
declares that "a signature, contract, or other record relating to such
transaction may not be denied legal effect, validity, or enforceability solely
because it is in electronic form...." §7001(a)(1). The Uniform Electronic
Transactions Act, a uniform state law, similarly declares the validity and
enforceability of electronic signatures. In Florida, the law specifically
provides as follows:

 LEGAL RECOGNITION OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS,
 ELECTRONIC SIGNATURES, AND ELECTRONIC CONTRACTS.--

 (a)A record or signature may not be denied legal effect or
 enforceability solely because the record or signature is in electronic form.
 (b)A contract may not be denied legal effect or enforceability solely
 because an electronic record was used in the formation of the contract.
 (c)If a provision of law requires a record to be in writing, an electronic
 record satisfies such provision.
 (d)If a provision of law requires a signature, an electronic signature
 satisfies such provision.

 Fla. Stat. §668.50(7).

Someday we may find ourselves relying on a retinal scan or some other biometric measure to show
that an agreement was made. Suraiya Jabin & Farhana Zareen, Biometric Signature Verification,
International Journal of Biometrics (January 2015). For now it is often still necessary that a deed be
signed in person, on paper, and in the presence of a notary for a real estate closing to occur. And

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
banks still typically insist that their loan documents be signed in person. So, attorneys still conduct
in person closings, although they may happen less often.

C. Smart Contracts

In addition to contracts being drafted by computer programs and
agreements being signed online, contracts are also being performed by
computers on line as well. An example of that is a so called "smart
contract."

A smart contract is a computer program that is part of a block chain. The
block chain is a series of connected programs that allow users to transfer
payments on line without an intermediary. A smart contract works by
following one or more "if/ then..." statements that are written into the
program. The purpose of a smart contract is to provide a mechanism for
transactions to occur, like a transfer of digital currency, or an exchange of
digital currency for a digital asset, when certain conditions are met and
without the need for a third party. The Etherium block chain is the most
popular block chain for smart contracts; the programming language most
commonly used for smart contracts is Solidity.

"Crowdfunding" is an example of a smart contract used to transfer digital
currency. The contract initially serves to secure funds from investors for a
project. If a predetermined level of investment is reached, the contract
automatically transfers the funds to the creators for the project. If the level
of investment is not reached, the funds are returned to the investors.

OpenSea.com is another example of smart contract technology. On that
platform consumers and content creators can buy and sell various Non-
Fungible Tokens (digital assets) like music and photography. The NFT's
are paid for with digital currencies in a buyer's virtual wallet (MetaMask,
Coinbase Wallet, TrustWallet, etc.)

There are two types of smart contracts: deterministic and non-
deterministic. A deterministic smart contract gets the information it needs
to execute a transaction from the block chain. A non-deterministic smart
contract requires information outside the block chain to operate. Non-
deterministic contracts require the involvement of an oracle, which creates a

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
link between the contract and the real world. The purpose of an oracle is to
retrieve and verify external information for a smart contract. An example
would be market data from an external feed.

You could think of a purchase and sale agreement as a transaction subject to
a series of conditions. The primary condition for delivery of the subject
matter is the purchase price. Real estate and goods are not digital assets,
but the transfer of ownership could be memorialized in a deed or bill of
sale, and either of those documents could be converted to digital form. The
real problem, however, is that many of the conditions to a typical purchase
and sale arrangement are external to the block chain and would have to be
retrieved and verified not by an oracle but either by the parties themselves
or by one or more third parties involved in the transaction. Until that
problem is solved, smart contracts will primarily serve as a mechanism for
making payments with digital currencies, and buying and selling NFT's.

Attorneys are using technology more and more, just like everyone else. But
in the most important respects, the attorney's role remains unchanged.
When you represent a client, the client is not paying you to obtain a form
document or fill in the blanks and print one out, and then witness your
signature. The client is paying you to think. It is important that you have
the skill to express the client's agreement in a clear, complete, and accurate
manner. But substance is what matters most. And that means using the
knowledge and training you began to acquire in law school and continued
to build on in practice to advance the client's goals and protect the client's
interests. Computers may make the process more efficient. But until the
day comes when a computer can go through law school and think like a
lawyer, there will always be a need for the minds of people like us. There
will always be a place for smart, knowledgeable lawyers who draft well.

15. DRAFTING A CONTRACT
AMENDMENT

T here is one more skill that I think is important to know if you are
          going to practice in this area, and that is how to draft a contract
          amendment. For a variety of reasons, you may need to go back
and change something in a contract you have already drafted. One party or
the other may have changed their practices. Something about the way the
deal was originally planned may not be working as well as it could. Or, the
parties may want to expand what they had originally contemplated doing.
When this happens, drafting a new agreement may be an option. But often
the preferred method is to leave what already exists in place and just
provide for the new terms. If you need to draft a contract amendment, here
is a quick outline of how to do it.

The first thing you need to think about when drafting an amendment is
whether it is better to amend the document or just start over with a new
agreement. The one big advantage of amending is it doesn't give the other
party an opportunity to renegotiate any of the provisions that aren't
changing. But there are other legal issues to consider as well. If the
document is a security instrument, the client may lose the priority of their
interest by starting over. So, it may be better to amend. If the document is
a negotiable instrument, amending may destroy the negotiability of the
instrument. So, it may be better to start over and re-do the original
document. Consider those issues first. If an amendment makes sense, then
start drafting.

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
Start off with a title and exordium, referring to the original agreement, like
this:

                  AMENDMENT TO APARTMENT LEASE

 This Amendment to Apartment Lease (Amendment) dated January
 25, 2019, is by and between South Tower Management Corp., a
 Florida Corporation having an office at 123 Main Street in
 Jacksonville, Florida (Landlord) and William Lancaster III, an
 individual having a residence at 23 Beach Avenue, Apt. 567,
 Jacksonville Beach, Florida (Tenant). The parties mutually agree as
 follows:

Then draft a background section explaining what happened and why the
parties are amending the original document.

 1. Background of Amendment

 A. On January 2, 2015 Landlord and Tenant entered into an
 apartment lease for the property located at 31 West Street, Unit 310,
 Gainesville, Florida (the Lease).

 B. The Lease was for a term of four (4) years beginning on
 January 2, 2015 and ending on January 1, 2019; and the monthly rent
 provided for in the Lease was $1,500 per month.

 C. The Tenant now desires to extend the term of the Lease; and
 the Landlord is willing to extend the term at a higher rental rate.

 Accordingly, the parties mutually agree as follows:

If you want to use the defined terms in the original lease, then consider
adding a statement like this: "Capitalized terms not otherwise defined in

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
this Amendment have the same meanings as provided in the Lease."
After you have completed the background section, explain what each
change is, as though you are editing the original document. In other words,
reference the section to change, delete the old language, and insert the new
language, like this:

 2. Changes to Lease
 A. Section 3 of the Lease (Term of Rental) is deleted and replaced
 with the following:

        "3. Term of Rental
        The term of the rental is for four (4) years beginning on
 January 2, 2019 and ending on January 1, 2023."
 B. Section 4(a) of the Lease (Payment of Rent) is deleted and
 replaced with the following:
        "(a) Payment of Rent
        On or before the first day of each month, the Tenant will pay
 the Landlord rent in the amount of two thousand dollars ($2,000) per
 month."

Once you have made all the changes, finish with a reiteration of the rest of
the contract, a testimonium, and signature lines.

 3. Remainder of Lease
 All other terms and conditions of the Lease remain in full force and
 effect.

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
Executed by the parties as of the date above.

Now you know how to draft a contract from scratch, revise a form
document, negotiate terms, and close a deal. And you also know how to
amend a contract after the deal is done. That is pretty much everything you
need to know to start drafting contracts and practicing as a transactional
lawyer.

Keep learning as much as you can; and seek perfection in everything you
write. Good luck!

Welcome to Big Law, LLP. I have a project I would like you to start
working on a.s.a.p. As you know, Big Law hires the best and the brightest
law students from the top law schools in Florida. Big Law is a limited
liability partnership located at 456 Gulf Shore Boulevard in Naples,
Florida. We are a large general practice firm, and employ approximately
300 lawyers.

Every year, Big Law interviews students at top Florida law schools, then
does call back interviews at the firm for a small group of highly qualified
applicants. Right now, we are hiring about a dozen associates per year, but
that may change depending upon market conditions.

Although the firm's associates have historically been employees at will, Big
Law would like to make the firm more marketable to prospective associates

       Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
by offering them written contracts. And we would like your help drafting a
form document we can use.

The agreement will be for a one-year term, renewable at the end of each
year at our option (not the associate's option). We will let the associate
know three months before the end of the term. The employer should be Big
Law; and you will need to insert blanks for the employee, a law student
residing in Florida.

We think it is important to make clear in the agreement we rely on the
veracity of the statements in each candidate's resume. If any of those
statements turn out to be false, we would want the right to end the
relationship. And we would also want the right to do that if the candidate
either fails to graduate from law school or fails to pass the bar exam (or is
subsequently disbarred).

As you know, we pay our associates well. The starting salary is $160,000
per year (payable every other week). We provide full health insurance
coverage, dental and vision insurance for the associate and his or her family,
as well as a life insurance policy in the amount of $250,000. Also, we
make matching contributions to a 401(k) plan of up to six percent of the
associate's salary.

Big law agrees to reimburse associates for their yearly license fee and the
cost of attendance at continuing legal education conferences within the
associate's area(s) of expertise or for approved legal ethics, bias
elimination, substance abuse, or mental illness awareness programs, or
professionalism programs.

We do not require our associates to reimburse the firm for damages caused
by them as a result of their negligence. But we do require associates to
reimburse the firm for uninsured losses caused by the associate's gross
negligence or willful misconduct. (Uninsured losses may occur either
because the relevant conduct isn't covered or because it is covered but a
deductible applies to a portion of the loss.)

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
In exchange we require all associates to work a minimum of 1,800 billable
hours per year. Time is billable only if it is spent working on a specific
matter for a client of the firm. Associates must keep track of their time
every day and submit daily timesheets to their administrative assistant.

Clients of the firm must always be represented by associates in a competent,
professional and ethical manner, in accordance with prevailing standards of
legal practice. Also, associates are required to attend periodic department
meetings and other firm events, and comply with any ethical requirements
for continuing legal education.

As long as each associate meets the billable hour's requirement, the
associate is welcome to take up to four weeks' vacation. And, as long as
that requirement is met, he or she can do as much pro bono work as he or
she desires. However, the associate must inform the firm of the pro bono
work and arrange for a partner of the firm to provide supervision for the
work.

It should also be made clear, however, that time spent completing
administrative tasks, attending continuing legal education classes, working
on pro bono cases, and other matters not billable to a firm client for a
specific matter is not included in the billable hour's requirement.

In addition, we require associates to devote all of their professional time,
attention and energies to the business of Law Firm (e.g. an associate cannot
work at the firm and also have their own practice on the side). Here is a
sample provision I found in an employment agreement for a pharmacist
(you will have to fix the language):

        Fidelity. The Agent agrees to devote all of the Agent's
        professional time, attention and energies to the
        pharmaceutical business of the hereinbefore mentioned
        Corporation. During the term of this contract, said Agent
        may not at any time hereafter engage in the practice of
        pharmacy to any extent whatsoever, except pursuant to this
        arrangement with the Corporation.

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
The firm expects associates to act in an appropriate manner at all times, and
not engage in any conduct that would hurt the firm's reputation.
Discrimination against employees of the firm on the basis of race or gender,
and sexual harassment will not be tolerated and will also be grounds for
dismissal. Here is another sample provision I found in an employment
agreement for a realtor (again, you will have to fix the language).

        Conduct. Any conduct that might injure the professional
        reputation and standing of Employer in the real estate
        brokerage community shall not hereafter be engaged in by the
        Employee. Discrimination against brokers, salesmen and
        other employees of the Employer, on the basis of race or
        gender also may not be engaged in by aforementioned
        Employee; and said employee must not sexually harass
        employees of said Employer.

We review each associate's performance in a yearly evaluation. If the
associate's performance is satisfactory to us and the associate's services are
still needed by the firm, then we would want to have the right to renew the
contract for an additional year. If not, then we would want to have the right
to end the associate's employment.

If an associate desires to leave the firm, he or she must give us at least thirty
days' written notice. Associates are not permitted to solicit business from
any client of the firm for a period of one year after they leave, regardless of
whether the employee resigns or is terminated. Also, the identities of the
firm's clients and the matters in which we represent them have to be kept
confidential.

Please add the usual administrative provisions at the end of the agreement.
Agreements not included in the final document will be superseded. Oral
modifications after the agreement is signed will not be valid. Florida law
will be applied. If there is a dispute, the parties have to try mediation to
resolve it first (we agree to pay the cost). If that doesn't work, then any
lawsuits should be brought in the county the firm is located in.

Thank you in advance for your assistance.

TRANSCRIPT OF CLIENT
INTAKE FOR LAPTOP
PURCHASE AGREEMENT

Rodriguez: Good morning.

Lancaster: Good morning, Ben. How are you?

Rodriguez: I am well, Margaret. Thank you.

Lancaster: So, what brings you in today?

Rodriguez: Well, I've been working on an agreement with Apple
computer. I want you to document it.

Lancaster: Wonderful. Is the agreement with the University or just the

Law School? Rodriguez:    I think it should be with the Levin College

of Law.

Lancaster: We've worked with Apple before. I think the legal name is
"Apple, Inc." and they are out of California, right?

Rodriguez: Yes, they are a Delaware corporation located in California.
The address is One Apple Park Way in Cupertino.

Lancaster: I've been there. The giant circular building?

Rodriguez: That's it. Anyway, we went there to work with Apple to
address a student / teacher issue we've been dealing with. Students like to

         Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
use laptops in class, but teachers find them distracting. Many of the law
school professors have outright banned them.

Lancaster: I see the issue. But it's not really the computer that is the
problem; it is the internet, right?
Rodriguez: Exactly. As it turns out, Apple has people working on the
same issue: making a classroom-friendly computer product. You know,
Apple has a lot of interest in education and working with teachers to
assimilate computers into the classroom.

Lancaster: I know. So, did you come up with a solution?

Rodriguez: I think so. Apple is going to develop a line of classroom
approved computers for us, and we are going to give them to all the
entering 1L students.
Lancaster: Wow. A free laptop for every student. Sounds like a good
marketing idea.

Rodriguez: It is, isn't it? We'll raise the tuition $1,000 to compensate, but
that's another issue.

Lancaster: So, what is a classroom approved computer?
Rodriguez: Well, it's basically the MacBook Air model with certain
modifications.

Lancaster: How is it different?

Rodriguez: First and foremost, it is Wi-fi and Bluetooth disabled. In other
words, it doesn't have either of those features, and it is made so neither can
be added. That's important, so we want them to put in writing in the
contract that these computers cannot be used for internet access.
Lancaster: I guess that takes care of internet surfing and e-mailing in
class.

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
Rodriguez: Right. Second, it is preloaded with E-books for all required
courses. We've already given the books to Apple, so they can upload them
to each laptop.

Lancaster: What a great idea. No more lugging around a backpack full of
books. The students will love that.

Rodriguez: Third, in terms of software, the laptops will also come with
Microsoft Word, Acrobat Reader, Dragon Naturally Speaking, and
Grammarly. But programs like Safari, Mail, Messages, iTunes, and
Facetime will all be deleted.

Lancaster: Hmm. I've never heard of Dragon Naturally Speaking. What
is that? Dictation software?

Rodriguez: Yes, it's fantastic. You should try it in your practice. Once
you get used to using it, you will wonder how you did without it.

Lancaster: O.k., is that it?

Rodriguez: No, one more thing. The enclosure for each computer will be
blue on the bottom and orange on the top, and the gator logo will also be on
the top. We saw a prototype yesterday. It was great. The gator lights up
when you turn the computer on.

Lancaster: Wow. I think these will be a hit. So, is UF committing to buy
a certain number of the laptops?

Rodriguez: Yes. For starters, we are buying 250 laptops for $1,000 each.
So that's $250,000 total.

Lancaster: That's a lot of laptops!

Rodriguez: Well, they will be delivered to the Faculty Lounge in Holland
Hall. They should be there by August 1st. If they come early, that's fine.
But they have to be there by the 1st so we can get them to the students
before classes start.

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
Lancaster: Do they have to be set up or prepped or anything before the
students get them?

Rodriguez: No, they are ready to go. Just open the box and plug them in.
Lancaster: Great. How is the University paying? Lump sum?
Installments?

Rodriguez: Installments. Apple didn't like it, but they agreed to let us pay
$6,944.44 per month for three years. Payments are due the first of each
month.

Lancaster: Late fee?
Rodriguez: No. We decided that if a payment is late, Apple has to give us
written notice and one month to cure. If we then make the payment plus
simple interest at the default rate of 12% per annum, the breach is cured.
But if we don't make the payment within one month, then we have to pay
the remaining balance in full.

Lancaster: Two questions. Does the cure period start when the notice is
received? And does interest accrue just on the outstanding payment?

Rodriguez: Yes, and yes.
Lancaster: O.k.

Rodriguez: And the payments are by wire transfer. We'll need wire
instructions from Apple to make that happen, so make sure they are
obligated to give the instructions before the first payment is due.

Lancaster: Isn't the first payment due when the contract is signed?
Rodriguez: No, the payments start when the laptops are delivered.

Lancaster: O.k.

Rodriguez: Now, one of the things that was important to Apple was the
law school agree to adopt a policy approving the use of these computers in

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
all classes. So, we should probably put that in there somewhere.

Lancaster: O.k. What about repairs and maintenance? How will that
work?
Rodriguez: A representative of Apple will come to the school once a
week during each semester and handle any repair or replacement claims.
We will give the representative a table or a booth in the student lounge to
work out of. Don't put that in the contract though. Just make sure they are
obligated to provide that service.

Lancaster: For how long will Apple provide that service?

Rodriguez: Three years from when the computers are delivered.
Lancaster: Will the University pay for the service?

Rodriguez: Yes. It's an extra $250 per month, due on the first day of each
month. We'll pay the rent by check. And we can terminate at any time.
These units should be fairly trouble-free so there may be no need for
repairs.

Lancaster: What about notice and an opportunity to cure? Does that
apply to the rental period too?
Rodriguez: No. They are going to give us a one-week grace period. After
that, there is a $25 late fee. And they can cancel the lease if any payment is
more than a month overdue. Of course, if they cancel the lease, we still
have to continue paying for the computers.

Lancaster: What about a warranty? Is there some type of warranty?

Rodriguez: Yes, it is the same for any other MacBook Air. Apple has it
on their website. I don't think we need to restate it in the contract.
Lancaster: Yeah, but the law school is not an authorized reseller. Can the
students still take advantage of the warranty?

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
Rodriguez: Yes, we talked about that when we were in California. Apple
is giving the University the right to transfer the warranty to the students.
Also, computers bought or received from the University pursuant to this
arrangement will be eligible for participation in Apple's GiveBack
Program. You can read about that on the website.

Lancaster: O.k., so even though the school is not an authorized reseller,
like a store selling computers to the public, computers received from the
school are still covered by the warranty, and they are still eligible for
participation in the GiveBack Program.

Rodriguez: Correct. But there is a condition.

Lancaster: What? Rodriguez: To obtain warranty coverage for the
students, UF has to give Apple the name and address of every student
receiving a computer pursuant to this program. The same is true of the
GiveBack program.

Lancaster: What else did you talk about when you were in California?

Rodriguez: Let's see. We agreed not to sell or give these computers to
anyone other than students at UF. Also, Apple agreed we could advertise
these computers on campus, as long as we use their marketing materials;
and they said they would provide us with what we need.

Lancaster: When do we get the marketing materials?

Rodriguez: Within a month after the contract is signed.

Lancaster: It almost sounds like UF will be an agent of Apple.

Rodriguez: Apple doesn't want that. In fact, they want the contract to
make clear we are not employees or agents.

Lancaster: What if 2Ls and 3Ls want the computers? You said the school
was only giving them to first year students, didn't you?

Rodriguez: Yes, but 2Ls and 3Ls can also buy them directly from Apple.
If they verify their status by providing a student ID, Apple agreed that they

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
will sell them a classroom-approved computer for $1,000. That's the same
price we pay.
Lancaster: O.k. You didn't agree to any exculpatory provisions, did you?
Rodriguez: We resisted but they wanted an indemnity, so we have to give
them one. Draft it narrowly, of course. But we do need to include an
indemnity.
Lancaster: Release?
Rodriguez: No release. No waiver. Just the indemnity.
Lancaster: What about administrative provisions? I would normally have
the parties agree that Florida law applies, and, if there is litigation, it will be
commenced in Alachua County.
Rodriguez: Good. That's fine. There have also been a lot of side
discussions leading up to this agreement. Likely, that will continue.
Representatives of each side may also try to decide on changes to the
agreement after it is signed. But we want to prevent all that. If it isn't in
writing and signed by the parties, it isn't part of the arrangement. And that
should be true whether someone claims it was decided before the document
was signed or after it was executed. Do you know what I mean?
Lancaster: Yes. I can take care of those issues with a couple standard
provisions.
Rodriguez: Excellent. I think that's about it.
Lancaster: O.k., I can have a draft for you a week from today. Is that
o.k.?
Rodriguez: Yes, that's fine. I look forward to reviewing it.

MEMORANDUM FOR
RESIDENTIAL LEASE
AGREEMENT

          M E M O R A N D U M

TO:       ________________

FROM:     ________________

DATE:     ________________

SUBJECT:  Residential Lease Agreement

_____________________________________________________________
_________________

         I need your help drafting a residential lease. As part of its efforts to
rise in prominence and the US News and World Report rankings, the
University of Florida has hired Harvard Professor, Dr. Cornel West as a
visiting professor for the next academic year. Dr. West will teach two
courses at UF next year, and he will also do a number of public speaking
engagements at the school.

            While Dr. West is in Gainesville, he will be renting the Powell
University House at 2151 W University Ave, Gainesville, FL 32603. UF
has been using the Powell House for alumni events, but recently converted
the building back to a residence for prominent visiting faculty. The house

          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
has five bedrooms and three bathrooms. It is 4,345 square feet and includes
a pool in the back yard. I need you to draft a lease for the rental of that
space by Dr. West.

            At the outset, I want to make clear that we do not want to use a
form lease or any canned rental provisions for this contract. The
relationship between the University and Dr. Cornel is not the usual
relationship between a landlord and tenant. Among other things, the school
is not renting the space for a profit and it is not in the business of renting
such space. Dr. West is a guest of the school, and UF wants to make sure he
is well taken care of while he is living in Gainesville.

            What I am looking for then is a readable document that sets forth
the arrangement between the parties in a clear and concise way. Don't
include any legalese. Use active voice and keep your sentences short and
simple. Use what you learned in your legal drafting class and draft the
lease from scratch.

            The owner of the Powell House is the University Housing Corp.,
a Florida corporation. Use 210 Gerson Hall P.O. Box 117166, Gainesville,
FL 32611-7166 as the address for the corporation, and the address for the
Powell University House as Dr. West's address.

         The parties agreed that the lease will be for ten months starting on
August 1st and ending on May 31st; and the rent will be $1,500 per month
due on the first day of the month.

         The house will be fully furnished. In fact, there are a number of
very expensive antiques in the Powell House, so we will need $1,500
security deposit. If either the building or the furniture is damaged, we
should be able to use the deposit money to cover the cost to repair or
replace the applicable items. And we'll give the remaining balance back
after the end of the term. If the damages exceed the amount of the deposit,
it should be clear the excess will have to be paid by Dr. Cornel on demand.
Also, with regard to the deposit, please make sure the lease complies with
Fla. Stat. sec. 83.49. But don't worry about any other legal requirements
for leases in Florida.

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
            UF agrees to take care of the maintenance for the outside of the
house, like cleaning the pool, spraying for bugs and keeping the lawn
mowed. We will probably be there once a week but don't put that in the
lease. Just say we'll do the maintenance. If more is needed, Dr. Cornell has
to let us know.

         UF pays the taxes on the Powell House and plans to obtain hazard
insurance for the house. If Dr. West gets a tax bill, he must send it to us
within a few days. Also, Dr. West has agreed to pay the premium for the
insurance, and he won't engage in any activities that would result in a
premium increase.

         Dr. West has also agreed to maintain the inside of the house and
keep it clean and sanitary. He knows there are valuable antiques inside, and
he will make reasonable efforts to protect them from damage. Pets are not
allowed; and smoking is not allowed either.

         I think it goes without saying, but let's make it clear anyway, Dr.
West can't make any alterations to the inside of the house without the
written consent of UF. And that includes painting the walls, putting
pictures or paintings up, or taking down what is already hanging.

            As with any lease, the landlord, UF should have the right to make
periodic inspections of the house. But the university won't do that unless
the inspections are during the week between the hours of 9:00 and 5:00 pm.
Also, the university has agreed to give Dr. West at least a week's notice in
advance of any inspection. And the notice will be provided in writing,
since Dr. West is notorious for not reading e-mails.

            The plan is for Dr. West to teach during the fall and spring
semesters, but there is a possibility he may stay an additional year. So he
should have the ability to renew for an additional year, if his tenure as
visiting professor is extended. To do that he should give UF written notice
at least a month before the lease ends. Also, if for any reason Dr. West is
not happy or otherwise wants to end the lease, he should be able to do so.
UF only requires that it be given at least one month's notice, in writing.

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
            If there are any problems with Dr. West not paying the rent on
time, UF will work to resolve the issue without any penalties being
imposed. So there should be no late fees, and costs of collection need not
be included. If any payment is not received, the University is going to send
Dr. West a written notice, reminding him the rent is due, and he will have
two weeks after he receives the notice to rectify the situation by making the
payment. Only if the payment is still not received after the notice and two
week period can the University terminate the lease and pursue legal action,
if necessary.

            There are some "boilerplate" provisions you should be sure to
include. We don't want Dr. West to be able to assign his interests in the
lease or sublet any of the space. We should make clear that "time is of the
essence." Also, any lawsuits should be brought in Alachua County, and the
law that applies should be Florida.

            W. Kent Fuchs will be signing the lease for the school and,
obviously, Dr. West will sign for himself. I think that's it. If you have any
questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

            Thanks in advance for your help.

MEMORANDUM FOR SALE
OF ASSETS AGREEMENT

          M E M O R A N D U M

TO:       ________________________

FROM:     ________________________

DATE:     ________________________

SUBJECT:  Sale of Assets Agreement

_____________________________________________________________
_________________

            We represent Coffee Castle LLC in connection with its sale of
business assets (the equipment in an on campus kitchen kiosk) to Food
Enterprises, Inc. d/b/a Bagel World. Coffee Castle is located at 309 Village
Drive in Gainesville. Bagel world has a place of business at 4113 NW 16th
Blvd in Gainesville. Coffee Castle is a Florida limited liability company
and Food Enterprises is a Florida corporation.

            Coffee Castle has been selling various coffees on campus for five
years, and its lease is now up. The school wants a vendor with a broader
menu, including sandwiches for breakfast and lunch. Accordingly, Bagel
World has been chosen as a replacement tenant. Rather than retain the
equipment it was using, Coffee Castle has agreed to sell it to Bagel World.

          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
         A list of the equipment Coffee Castle is selling to Bagel World is
attached. Basically it is everything you need to run a coffee store, except
the coffee and the paper cups. Coffee Castle is selling the equipment
without any implied warranties (i.e. merchantability or fitness for use). The
purchase price is $100,000 payable at a closing at the law offices of Tickle,
Bice and Erp, LLC, 172 Main Street, Gainesville on December 1, 2019.
Payment must be made by cashier's check or wire transfer.

         Prior to the closing, the parties have agreed that Bagel World will
have the opportunity to do further inspections of the equipment to confirm
that the equipment is in good working condition and fit for use in Bagel
World's business. The inspections should be between 9:00 a.m. and 5:00
p.m. at Coffee Castle, and they should be completed within a couple
weeks. Also, Bagel World needs to give Coffee Castle 24 hours advance
notice.

         Bagel World also plans to do a UCC lien search to confirm there are
no liens on the equipment. If there are, Bagel World will want to back out
of the deal.

         At the closing, Coffee Castle has agreed to deliver a bill of sale for
the equipment, as well as any operating manuals and warranty terms. Also,
Coffee Castle needs to produce a clerk certificate and resolution confirming
the sale is authorized and is not a sale of substantially all the assets of
Coffee Castle. (Coffee Castle has over 100 other locations in Florida.)

         To induce Bagel World to enter into this transaction, Coffee Castle
represented and warranted that it was a corporation in good standing,
authorized to do business in Florida; each of the pieces of the equipment is
in good operating condition; Coffee Castle owns the equipment and there
are no liens on any of the items comprising the equipment. Also, there are
no legal proceedings pending against Coffee Castle that would affect the
equipment in any way. Each of these representations and warranties should
be stated in the contract.

            Bagel World is giving Coffee Castle a $10,000 deposit when the
contract is signed. The deposit will serve as liquidated damages if Bagel

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
World fails to fulfill its obligations under the contract. Please note,
however, Bagel World has the right to terminate the contract and receive the
deposit back if the equipment fails inspection or Bagel World discovers a
prior lien on the equipment. If the transaction goes through, the deposit will
be credited to the purchase price.

            Until the transaction is completed, Coffee Castle has agreed to
properly store the equipment and ensure it is not damaged or stolen. Coffee
Castle must clean the equipment prior to the closing so that it will be ready
for use. And Coffee Castle also granted Bagel World's request that the
equipment be taken off the market and not shown to any other prospective
buyers.

         After the closing, there will be no need for Coffee Castle to ship the
equipment to Bagel World. Rather, it will be turned over to Bagel World at
309 Village Drive (Bagel World will be using the same location Coffee
Castle used). Bagel World has already signed a lease with the school,
renting the space as of the closing date for this transaction. Bagel World
has not yet decided if it will use the name "Bagel World" for the business.
That is not a concern for Coffee Castle, as long as Bagel World does not use
the name "Coffee Castle."

         The agreement should make clear prior statements and
understandings are not enforceable unless memorialized in the contract.
Subsequent agreements are also invalid unless reduced to writing and
signed by the parties. Florida law will govern the interpretation of the
agreement. If there is a lawsuit, the parties agree it will be commenced in
Alachua County. Those are all standard "boilerplate" provisions.

         I think that's it for now. Please have a draft on my desk by
morning. Thank you for your assistance.

TRANSCRIPT OF CLIENT
INTAKE FOR CONSULTING
SERVICES AGREEMENT

                 Client Intake for AutoDocs
               Consulting Services Agreement

Chang: Hello Mr. Ruiz. How are you?

Ruiz: I am well. Thank you for seeing me on a Saturday.

Chang:  Oh please! I haven't had a weekend off since I started at this
firm.

Ruiz:   Busy?

Chang: You have no idea. So what brings you in today?

Ruiz: I want you to prepare a form of consulting agreement I can use
for my new business.

Chang: I didn't know you started a business. Congratulations!

Ruiz: Thank you. Basically what I do is provides training and advice
to lawyers and law firms interested in using AutoDocs to draft legal
documents. The business is a Florida corporation called AutoDocs
Consulting Corp., and it has a legal address of 112 West Street in
Gainesville.

        Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
Chang: Great idea! I thought about using document assembly software
for my practice but it's a steep learning curve, and I think it would take a
while to put the templates together.

Ruiz: That's where I come in. I train someone like you to use the
software, and I help you get everything set up. I can do the whole thing in
one weekend. By Monday morning you'll be up and running.

Chang: That's a great idea. So the service you provide is AutoDocs
training?

Ruiz: Well, there's a lot to it. I actually wrote down my own
description of what I do, if you'd like to see it. The language is pretty
technical so I figured this would help. Here is what I put together:

                                Description of Services

         Document automation training concerning the use of
         AutoDocs document assembly software, including how to
         create user-friendly templates and to generate documents,
         including templates with multiple authors; how to create
         and use a template repository with centralized template
         creation and management, permissions for individuals and
         groups based on roles, check in/check-out functionality,
         roll-back, and forward publishing; how to generate
         documents via browser-based templates in the cloud, on-
         premise or on Abacus Private Cloud; how to use the
         AutoDocs user interface, including how to efficiently
         manage the permissions of end users and groups with a
         tight and synchronized integration with active directory;
         how to integrate with business systems such as BPM,
         CRM, DMS, ECM, and e-signature technologies; and how
         to keep track of template versions uploaded to production
         environments, noting when, why and who uploaded and
         published.

Chang: That's very helpful. Thank you. I'll use that language verbatim.

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
Ruiz: Wonderful.

Chang: Now, did you say you also help the lawyer put together a set of
templates for documents he actually uses in his practice?

Ruiz: Yes. I'll talk to the Ruiz ahead of time about his practice and
we'll agree on a set of documents to automate, then I'll likely give him an
estimate of the cost to automate the documents and we'll agree on a date by
which that work will be done.

Chang: Do you want me to put the estimate and the deadline in the
document?

Ruiz: Yes. My hourly rate is $200 per hour. The estimate is just for
the automation of the documents. I can't guarantee the final bill will not
exceed that amount, but I'll try to keep the work on budget; and, if it looks
like we are going over budget by more than say 20% I'll tell the Ruiz before
the costs are incurred.

Chang: All right. I'll have to figure out how to draft that. But I
understand what you are looking for.

Ruiz: I decided I want to collect 50% of the estimated cost of the
automation up front and the other 50% within a week after the consultation
is completed. The training fees I bill monthly and expect payment in 30
days.

Chang: O.K. That seems reasonable.

Ruiz: And it's fine with me if you make clear I don't' get reimbursed
for travel, parking, meals, lodging or anything like that. Probably, the Ruiz
will want that in there.

Chang: Fair enough. What about the equipment and supplies you use?
Do you provide those?

Ruiz: Actually no. I use the Ruiz's computer, install the software on
his system, and then work on the documents he has.

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
Chang: I guess the Ruizs will probably prefer it that way.

Ruiz: Right. They will be worried about me keeping confidential
whatever they tell me about how they practice and the methods they use.
And they will want to prohibit me from copying, using or distributing their
form documents. If I do everything on their system, they will feel more at
ease about protecting their own information and documents.

Chang: I see. Should I also mention in the agreement you will keep
communications confidential and your work product will be solely their
property.

Ruiz: I think so, yes; and the standard things too. I'm an independent
contractor, not an employee, so they don't have to worry about withholding
taxes or paying benefits and that type of thing. That's standard for this type
of agreement, right?

Chang: Yes. I forgot to ask. Will this agreement be in effect for some
time period?

Ruiz: Yes. I do most of the work in a short period, like over the
weekend. But then I make myself available for an additional guidance
during the first year of use. So the agreement has a one year term.

Chang: Can you or the Ruiz terminate for any reason?

Ruiz:   Just if the other side doesn't do what it agreed to do. That's fair,
right?

Chang: Yes, absolutely. I'll also add the usual provisions that Florida
law applies, any lawsuits will be brought in Alachua County, etc.

Ruiz: I think the agreement should also the parties can't assign it.

Chang: O.k. And then I usually make clear prior statement and
agreements are not enforceable unless made part of the agreement; and
subsequent agreement have to be reduced to writing and signed to be
enforceable.

        Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
Ruiz:  Sounds perfect.

Chang: Let's see. What have we left out?

Ruiz: There is one more thing. I can do the automation whenever they
want. But the training is different. I do one on one Ruiz training Monday
through Sunday between 9 and 5 for a maximum of 10 hours per week. I
have other Ruizs so I can't spend more time than that with any one Ruiz.

Chang: O.k.

Ruiz: I can also do a class for the Ruiz's employees. That would have
to be between 9 and 5, Monday through Friday. And the maximum number
of classes I can do is 3 per week.

Chang: What if the Ruiz cancels an appointment or class, or doesn't
show up at the scheduled time?

Ruiz: I charge a cancellation fee of $200 for that. I've thought about
doing more, but it hasn't been a problem. So just put the $200 cancellation
fee in there and we should be all set.

Chang: O.k. I can put together a draft and have something for you to
review by _________ ___, 20__.

Ruiz: Wonderful. Thank you.

Chang: Always a pleasure.

Ruiz: Same here. Take the rest of the day off.

Chang: Hah hah.

INTRODUCTION TO
COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE
LOAN DOCUMENTS

O ne of the most common areas of practice for transactional
            lawyers is commercial real estate lending. The documents that
            are typically used for that type of transaction are a promissory
note, guaranty, loan agreement, real estate mortgage and security
agreement. Needless to say, it is exceedingly unlikely that you would ever
be asked to draft those documents from scratch. If you need to develop
your own set of forms, you will likely do that by looking at precedent
language in other documents. More often, the firm you are working for or
the institutional client you represent will have their own set of documents
they will want you to use. So your job will be to tailor those documents to
the terms of the deal you are handling. To do that you will need a solid
understanding of what those documents are and why they are used to
protect a lender's interests in a commercial real estate transaction.

A. Promissory Note

A promissory note contains the borrower's promise to repay the loan. To
understand why promissory notes are drafted the way they are you have to
first have a basic understanding of the business of banking. From a bank's
perspective, the character of a financial transaction is the opposite of what it
is from the customer's perspective. When you deposit money with a bank,
you create a liability for the bank. Effectively, you are making a demand

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
loan to the bank for the amount of the deposit. Similarly, when you borrow
money from the bank, you are effectively creating an asset for the bank.
From the bank's perspective a loan is an asset, just like a corporate bond,
except the issuer is the bank's customer not a corporation. On the books of
the bank, deposits are liabilities and loans are assets.

Because a promissory note evidences an asset, it is important that the bank
be able to sell or transfer it to other banks or outside investors. Typically
bank loans are pooled in the secondary market and then securitized to
enable investors to invest in the pool of loans, just like investors invest in
groups of stocks by investing in a mutual fund. To facilitate that process,
promissory notes are usually drafted to qualify as negotiable instruments
under Article III of the Uniform Commercial Code.

A negotiable instrument is typically defined as "an unconditional promise
or order to pay a fixed amount of money, with or without interest or other
charges" that is (1) payable to bearer or to order, (2) payable on demand or
at a definite time; and (3) contains no other undertakings in addition to the
payment of money, except an undertaking or power to give collateral to
secure payment, an authorization or power to the holder to confess
judgment or realize on or dispose of collateral; or a waiver of the benefit of
any law intended for the advantage or protection of an obligor. E.g., Fla.
Stat. § 673.1041.

For these reasons, promissory notes are typically very simple and short.
There is no exordium and no background section. The body of the
document is usually just the core obligation (the promise to repay the loan).
Rather than using "will," the obligation is often drafted with "promises to."
Also, to comply with Article III, it is made clear that the payee is not simply
the lender, but rather "to the order of" the lender.

         For value received, the undersigned ________________, a
 _____________ corporation, with an address of
 _________________________ (the "Borrower"), promises to pay to the
 order of __________ Bank, a _________________ Bank with an address

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
 of __________________________________ (together with its successors
 and assigns, the "Lender"), the principal amount of _______________
 Thousand Dollars and Zero Cents ($____,000.00) on or before
 ___________ __, ____ (the "Maturity Date"), as set forth below, together
 with interest from the date hereof on the unpaid principal balance from
 time to time outstanding until paid in full.

Next the interest rate and the due date for monthly payments are typically
set forth.

         The aggregate principal balance outstanding shall bear interest
 thereon at a per annum rate equal to ___________ Percent (____%). All
 accrued and unpaid interest shall be payable monthly in arrears on the 1st
 of each month, commencing on _____________, providing that, in any
 event, on the Maturity Date all outstanding principal, plus interest thereon
 and all costs and expenses, shall be due and payable.

And that's pretty much it. Often there is added a provision for late fees in
the event of late payment, and the recovery of attorney's fees, if the loan
goes into collection. The waivers referred to in the UCC are included (e.g.,
diligence, presentment, protest and demand, and notice of protest of
demand, of non-payment, of dishonor and of maturity). And there may be
one administrative provision (typically just choice of law). But otherwise,
there are just the testimonium and signature lines. Notably, a promissory
note is only signed by one party: the borrower.

B. Guaranty

A guaranty is a document in which someone other than the borrower
guarantees the borrower's obligation to repay the loan in the even the
borrower fails to pay. A guaranty is also a short, simple document, and it is
usually organized like a promissory note. A guaranty consists primarily of
the core obligation (the guarantors agreement to pay the borrower's debt in

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
the event that the borrower defaults on the loan obligation). Oddly, the
lender is often referred to as "you" in a guaranty.

         To induce you to make or continue to make loans or advances, or
 grant other financial accommodations to _____________________, a
 ____________ corporation, having an address at
 ______________________ ("Borrower"), pursuant to a Promissory Note
 in the original principal sum of $___,000.00, of even date herewith, and
 all other documents executed in connection therewith (collectively, the
 "Loan Documents") and in consideration thereof, the undersigned
 Guarantor guarantees the payment to you of all sums which may be
 presently due and owing and of all sums which shall in the future become
 due and owing to you from the Borrower under said Loan Documents,
 and also guarantees the due performance by the Borrower of all its
 obligations under said Loan Documents.

As with a promissory note, various waivers are often added to the
document. And then the document typically ends with just one signature:
that of the guarantor.

C. Loan Agreement

A loan agreement contains all the other agreements and representations
between the borrower and the bank. Like the other agreements I have
discussed in this book, a loan agreement typically starts off with an
exordium, background section and definitions.

If the loan is for the construction of the property, then the loan agreement
will next include the conditions to making the loan and funding each
advance. The conditions to making the loan include what is normally
produced at the loan closing, like execution of the loan documents and the
delivery of legal opinions. The conditions to each advance often include
the borrower's submission of a request in the required form as well as the
bank's inspection and approval of whatever work has been done. Also,
there is usually an "in balance" provision requiring that the remaining

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
proceeds of the loan provide sufficient funds to complete and operate the
project. Here is a brief example:

 (C) The Lender may require as a condition of any advance that the
 Borrower submit satisfactory evidence that the unadvanced portions of
 the Loan and the Construction Financing are sufficient to pay all costs for
 the completion of the Project in accordance with the Project Budget and
 the approved plans and specifications.

Whether the loan is for construction or acquisition, various representations
and warranties will be listed next. These represent the assumptions upon
which the decision to lend was based and include the borrower's good
standing, if the borrower is an entity, the financial condition of the
borrower, the due execution of the loan documents, the borrower's
ownership of the property and other similar matters.

After the representations, the borrower's obligations (referred to here a
"covenants") are listed, including the borrower's agreement to construct the
project, if the loan is a construction loan. Here is an example:

Borrower agrees and covenants with Lender as follows:

A.  Construction and Completion of Project. To

construct and develop the Project continually and with due diligence in

compliance with the Plans and Specifications and applicable law so as to

complete the same, in usable condition with full certificates of occupancy

and all other required licenses, permits and public approvals issued, on or

before the Completion Date.

Among the important covenants to focus on when reviewing or drafting a
loan agreement are the financial covenants, including any requirements that
the borrower maintain a required financial condition and produce various
financial documents. Here is an example of the former:

Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
           H. Debt Coverage Ratio. The Borrower shall maintain (i) a
 Debt Coverage Ratio for the Loan of at least 110%, and (ii) a Debt
 Coverage Ratio for All Debt of at least 105%. A Debt Coverage Ratio for
 All Debt means the ratio calculated by dividing the Net Operating Income
 for any period by the scheduled debt service for all debt on the Mortgaged
 Property that requires current debt service, including the Loan, for such
 period. The Debt Coverage Ratio for the Loan means the ratio calculated
 by dividing the Net Operating Income for any period by the scheduled
 debt service for the Loan for such period. The Net Operating Income
 means, for any period, the difference between the Project's actual rental
 receipts received during such period less the sum of (x) Operating
 Expenses paid or accrued during such period plus (y) scheduled deposits
 to the Replacement Reserve Account for such period.

As you can see, this covenant incorporates a number of detailed definitions
that have to be reviewed to fully understand what is required. Financial
reporting covenants are also important to review carefully. Here is an
example of a reporting requirement:

 H. Financial Reporting. The Borrower shall furnish the Lender with
 such reports, financial statements, records and other information relating
 to the financial condition or operations of the Borrower and the
 construction and operation of the Project and as the Lender may
 reasonably require, including, but not limited to, (i) annual audited
 financial statements of the Borrower (to be delivered to the Lender within
 one hundred twenty (120) days of the end of Borrower's fiscal year), and
 (iii) such other reports to show that the Project is being built and operated
 consistently with this Agreement, the organizational documents of the
 Borrower, and the Loan Documents.

In addition to the financial covenants, the loan agreement may also provide
for the creation of various reserve and deposit accounts; and the funds in
those accounts may be used to pay for insurance and taxes or maintenance
expenses, or the account may be an operating account used for the
disbursement of loan proceeds, as in this example:

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
(g) Borrower shall maintain with Bank throughout the term of the Loan,
    and any extension thereof, an interest bearing commercial operating
    account ("Operating Account"). All disbursements of Loan proceeds
    may be made by the Bank by crediting such disbursements directly
    into the Operating Account. Borrower agrees that such disbursements
    shall constitute Advances under this Agreement and the Note. In
    addition, Borrower authorizes Bank to pay any principal or interest
    upon the Note when and as the same shall become due under the terms
    thereof by debiting the Operating Account.

The next section in a loan agreement usually lists the "Events of Default"
and the Lender's remedies in the event any of those Events occur. A
"default" is a breach of the agreement. An "Event of Default" is a breach of
the agreement that continues beyond a prescribed period after notice of is
given. If an "Event of Default" occurs the lender usually has the right
declare the entire loan amount immediately due and payable (i.e. the lender
has the right to "accelerate" the loan). Here are excerpts from two
applicable provisions in a loan agreement:

SECTION 7.     EVENTS OF DEFAULT

       The occurrence of any one or more of the following events
constitutes an "Event of Default" under the terms of this Agreement:

*           *  *

       7.3 The Borrower fails to pay the principal of, or fees, or interest
on, the Note or any other indebtedness of the Borrower under the Loan
Documents after the same is due and payable and such failure continues
beyond the date which is ten (10) days after written demand is made by
the Lender.

            Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
       7.4 The Borrower defaults in the due observance or performance
of any other covenant, condition, or agreement to be observed or
performed by the Borrower pursuant to the terms of any of the Loan
Documents and such default remains uncured thirty (30) days after
written notice is given by the Lender to the Borrower.

SECTION 8.  RIGHTS ON DEFAULT

       Upon the occurrence of any one or more of the Events of Default
enumerated in the foregoing Section 7, and at any time thereafter, then:

       8.1 The Lender may declare all indebtedness due under the Note
and any and all other indebtedness of the Borrower to the Lender due
under the other Loan Documents or otherwise to be due and payable,
whether or not the indebtedness evidenced by the Note or the other Loan
Documents is otherwise due and payable and whether or not the Lender
has initiated any foreclosure or other action for the enforcement pursuant
to the provisions of the Loan Documents, whereupon all indebtedness due
under the Note and the other Loan Documents and any other such
indebtedness becomes immediately due and payable, both as to principal
and interest, without presentment, demand, protest, or notice of any kind,
all of which are expressly waived by the Borrower.

Like the other agreements discussed in prior chapters, a loan agreement
usually ends with various administrative provisions, a testimonium and
signature blocks for the borrower and the lender.

D. Real Estate Mortgage

The purpose of a mortgage is to give the lender a security interest in the
land and the buildings comprising the project. The core of a real estate
mortgage is the conveyance of the property by the borrower to the lender as

            Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
security for the loan. The language typically used would, for example, be
as follows:

                The Mortgagor, FOR CONSIDERATION PAID, HEREBY
 CONVEYS, TRANSFERS, ASSIGNS, SETS-OVER AND GRANTS to
 the Mortgagee, with mortgage covenants, to secure the payment of
 ________________________ and 00/100 Dollars ($_______________),
 with interest and any other charges due thereon, payable as provided in
 Mortgagor's promissory note of even date (the "Note"), to secure the
 performance of all covenants and agreements contained herein, in the
 Note and in a loan agreement of even date between Mortgagor and
 Mortgagee (the "Loan Agreement"), and to secure the payment and
 performance of all other debts, covenants and agreements of or by
 Mortgagor to or for the benefit of Mortgagee now existing or hereafter
 arising while this mortgage is still undischarged of record, all of its right,
 title and interest in and to the land, with buildings and other
 improvements thereon, whether now existing or hereafter constructed or
 located, commonly known as and numbered
 _____________________________, _______________, as more
 particularly described in Exhibit A attached hereto, together with (i) any
 and all further or additional title, estate, interest or rights which may, at
 any time, be acquired by Mortgagor in and to such land and
 improvements, and (ii) all rents, issues, benefits and profits arising from
 the foregoing.

The Mortgagor is the borrower and the Mortgagee is the lender. After the
core obligation or covenant, various additional covenants regarding the use
and maintenance of the property (the lender's collateral) are included. If the
mortgage is granted in a state that permits non-judicial foreclosures, the
lender is also granted a "power of sale" (the power to sell the property and
payoff the debt if an Event of Default occurs). Like promissory notes,
mortgages are signed by the mortgagee (borrower) only.

After execution, a mortgage must be recorded at the appropriate office. In
Florida, mortgages are recorded with the clerk of the circuit court. Also,

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
because mortgages are recorded the mortgagor's signature must typically be
notarized and/or witnessed.

E. Security Agreement

The purpose of a security agreement is usually to give the lender a security
interest in personal property, like machinery and equipment or inventory (a
mortgage gives the lender a security interest in real property). In a real
estate deal, this would typically include an assignment of leases and rents.
Often the security agreement is incorporated in the mortgage, but it may
also be set forth in a separate document. Here is an example of the core
grant of a security interest in an assignment of leases and rents.

As further security for Borrower's payment and performance of the
Obligations, Borrower agrees with Lender as follows:

1.    Subject to the terms and conditions of this Assignment,

Borrower hereby transfers, assigns, and delivers to Lender as security for

Borrower's payment and performance of the Obligations all of

Borrower's right, title, and interest in and to:

(i)   All present and future leases, occupancy agreements, and

tenancies with respect to the Premises, together with all renewals,

extensions, and modifications thereof (collectively, "Leases");

(ii)  All rents and other payments due to Borrower by virtue of the

Leases or otherwise due to Borrower as the result of any use, possession,

or occupancy of any portion or portions of the Premises (collectively,

"Rents"); and

(iii) All right, title, and interest of Borrower in and to all guarantees
of the Leases.

The legal requirements for a security interest in personal property are
different than the requirements for a security interest in real property.
Security interests in personal property are governed by Article IX of the
Uniform Commercial Code. Article IX requires, among other things, that

               Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
security interests in personal property be "perfected" by filing a separate
document called a "financing statement" with the appropriate filing office.
In Florida financing statements are filed in the Florida Transactions
Registry.
The legal requirements for creating a security interests in leases and rents
vary from state to state. It may be sufficient to file the assignment with the
mortgage or it may be necessary to file a separate financing statement. And
additional steps may be required as well, depending upon whatever state
law applies.
That is a quick outline of the documents involved in a commercial real
estate loan. And those are typical examples of the types of form documents
you often work with in a transactional practice. You probably noticed the
sample provisions I included contain some legalese and often don't conform
to the conventions discussed in chapters two through six of this book. The
primary reason for that is because the documents were drafted before law
schools started offering courses on contract drafting. If you get the
opportunity to revise the forms you are using, you can do better!

PROMISSORY NOTE

                 Promissory Note

$______________  Date: ___________ ___ , 20__

         For value received,
______________________________________________ (the "Borrower")
hereby promises to pay to the order of _______________________ (the
"Bank"), at the office of the Bank located at
______________________________, or at such other office as the holder
hereof may designate, the principal sum of
_____________________________________________________________
______ DOLLARS ($_______________) payable in the total number of
____________ payments of principal and interest, with each of the first
______ payments in the amount of $________ and consisting of principal
and interest, calculated at the fixed rate set forth below and the final
payment to consist of the entire unpaid principal balance plus accrued
interest thereon. The first of said payments of principal and interest is to be
made on _________ ___, 20___, and the remainder of said payments are
payable on the corresponding date of each succeeding __________, with
the final payment, unless sooner paid, to be made on ___________ ___,
20__.

         The interest on the unpaid balance shall be payable on the dates
provided above and is to be computed on the basis of a three hundred sixty
(360)day year and actual days elapsed as follows: at a variable rate per
year of _________________ (___) percentage points in excess of the
Base Rate (as defined in the Loan Agreement (the "Agreement") of even

Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
date between the Borrower and the Bank) in effect from time to time at the
Bank.

         On default or after maturity or after judgment has been rendered on
this Note, the unpaid principal balance shall, at the option of the Bank, bear
interest at a rate which is three (3) percentage points per annum greater than
that which would otherwise be applicable. The Bank may collect a late
charge not to exceed six percent (6.00%) of any installment of interest or
principal, or of any other amount due to the Bank which is not paid or
reimbursed within fourteen (14) days of the due date thereof to defray the
extra cost and expense involved in handling such delinquent payment and
the increased risk of noncollection. The minimum late charge shall be
$25.00.

         If, at any time, the rate of interest, together with all amounts which
constitute interest and which are reserved, charged or taken by Bank as
compensation for fees, services or expenses incidental to the making,
negotiating or collection of the loan evidenced hereby, shall be deemed by
any competent court of law, governmental agency or tribunal to exceed the
maximum rate of interest permitted to be charged by the Bank to the
Borrower, then, during such time as such rate of interest would be deemed
excessive, that portion of each sum paid attributable to that portion of such
interest rate that exceeds the maximum rate of interest so permitted shall be
deemed a voluntary prepayment of principal.

         Borrower may prepay this Note in whole or in part, at any time,
without penalty or premium. Any such prepayment shall be credited in the
inverse order of their maturity and shall not affect the obligation to pay the
regular installments required hereunder.

         All payments and prepayments shall be applied first to the payment
of all interest on the unpaid principal of this Note and the balance on
account of the principal and all other amounts due under this Note, the
Agreement or any Related Agreement (as defined in the Agreement). The
Bank is authorized, but not required, to charge any amount due hereunder or
under the Agreement or any Related Agreement to any account of the
Borrower when and as it becomes due.

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
         Upon the happening of any Event of Default (as defined in the
Agreement), the entire indebtedness with accrued interest thereon due under
this Note, shall, at the option of the Bank, accelerate and become
immediately due and payable without demand or notice of any kind.
Failure to exercise such option shall not constitute a waiver of the right to
exercise the same in the event of any subsequent default.

         This Note has been executed and delivered in accordance with the
Agreement, incorporated herein by reference, which contains, among
others, terms and conditions upon which the entire unpaid principal hereof
and all interest hereon may become due and payable prior to the stated
maturity hereof and provisions as to further rights of the Bank and duties of
the Borrower and any Guarantor (as defined in the Agreement) with respect
hereto. This Note is secured by collateral as further described in certain of
the Related Agreements.

         The Borrower agrees to pay all taxes levied or assessed upon the
outstanding principal against any holder of this Note and to pay all costs,
including attorneys' fees and all other costs and expenses incurred in the
collection, protection, preservation, defense, administration or enforcement
of this Note or any guaranty or endorsement of this Note or in any litigation
arising out of the transactions of which this Note or any guaranty or
endorsement of this Note is a part.

         The Borrower hereby gives the Bank a lien and right of set off for
all of Borrower's liabilities and obligations upon and against all the
deposits, credits, collateral and property of the Borrower, now or hereafter
in the possession, custody, safekeeping or control of the Bank. At any time,
without demand or notice, Bank may set off the same or any part thereof
and apply the same to any liability or obligation of the Borrower even
though unmatured.

         THE BANK AND THE BORROWER IRREVOCABLY WAIVE
ALL RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY PROCEEDING
HEREAFTER INSTITUTED BY OR AGAINST THE BANK OR THE
BORROWER IN RESPECT OF THIS NOTE OR ARISING OUT OF
ANY DOCUMENT, INSTRUMENT OR AGREEMENT EVIDENCING,

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
GOVERNING OR SECURING THIS NOTE, INCLUDING THE
AFORESAID AGREEMENT.

         BORROWER (1) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE LOAN
EVIDENCED BY THIS NOTE IS PART OF A COMMERCIAL
TRANSACTION AND (2) TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY ANY
STATE OR FEDERAL LAW, WAIVES THE RIGHT BORROWER MAY
HAVE TO PRIOR NOTICE OF AND A HEARING ON THE RIGHT OF
ANY HOLDER OF THIS NOTE TO ANY REMEDY OR
COMBINATION OF REMEDIES THAT ENABLES SAID HOLDER, BY
WAY OF ATTACHMENT, FOREIGN ATTACHMENT, GARNISHMENT
OR REPLEVIN, TO DEPRIVE BORROWER OF ANY OF
BORROWER'S PROPERTY, AT ANY TIME, PRIOR TO FINAL
JUDGMENT IN ANY LITIGATION INSTITUTED IN CONNECTION
WITH THIS NOTE. The Borrower further waives diligence, demand,
presentment for payment, notice of nonpayment, protest and notice of
protest, and notice of any renewals or extensions of this Note, and all rights
under any statute of limitations, and agrees that the time for payment of this
Note may be changed and extended at Bank's sole discretion, without
impairing borrower's liability hereon, and further consents to the release of
all or any part of the security for the payment hereof at the discretion of
Bank, or the release of any party liable for this obligation without affecting
the liability of the other parties hereto. Any delay on the part of the Bank in
exercising any right hereunder shall not operate as a waiver of any such
right, and any waiver granted for one occasion shall not operate as a waiver
in the event of any subsequent default.

         This Note shall bind the heirs, executors, administrators, successors
and assigns of Borrower and shall inure to the benefit of the Bank, its
successors and assigns.

         This Note is executed as a sealed instrument and shall be governed
by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts.

to Mortgagee receipts evidencing the payments.

         Mortgagor shall promptly discharge any lien which obtains priority
over this Security Instrument after the date of this Security Instrument

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
unless Mortgagor: (a) agrees in writing to the payment of the obligation
secured by the lien in a manner acceptable to Mortgagee; (b) contests in
good faith the lien by, or defends against enforcement of the lien in, legal
proceedings which in the Mortgagee's opinion operate to prevent the
enforcement of the lien or forfeiture of any part of the Property; or (c)
secures from the holder of the lien an agreement satisfactory to Mortgagee
subordinating the lien to this Security Instrument. If Mortgagee determines
that any part of the Property is subject to such a lien, Mortgagee may give
Mortgagor a notice identifying the lien. Mortgagor shall satisfy the lien or
take one or more of the actions set forth above within 10 days of the giving
of notice.

         3. Hazard Insurance. Mortgagor shall keep the improvements now
existing or hereafter erected on the Property insured against loss by fire,
hazards included within the term "extended coverage" and any other
hazards, including floods or flooding, for which Mortgagee requires
insurance. This insurance shall be maintained in the amounts and for the
periods that Mortgagee requires. The insurance carrier providing the
insurance shall be chosen by Mortgagor subject to Mortgagee's approval
which shall not be unreasonably withheld.

         All insurance policies and renewals shall be acceptable to
Mortgagee and shall include a standard mortgage clause naming Mortgagee
as its interest may appear. Mortgagee shall have the right to hold the
policies and renewals. If Mortgagee requires, Mortgagor shall promptly
give to Mortgagee all receipts of paid premiums and renewal notices. In the
event of loss, Mortgagor shall give prompt notice to the insurance carrier
and Mortgagee, Mortgagee may make proof of loss if not made promptly by
Mortgagor.

         Unless Mortgagee and Mortgagor otherwise agree in writing and
provided that no breach of any covenant or agreement in this Security
Instrument or the Debt Instrument exists, insurance proceeds shall be
applied to restoration or repair of the Property damages, if the restoration or
repair is economically feasible and Mortgagee's security is not lessened. If
a breach of any covenant or agreement in this Security Instrument or the
Debt Instrument exists or the restoration or repair is not economically

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
feasible or Mortgagee's security would be lessened, the insurance proceeds,
subject to the rights of any prior mortgagee, shall be applied to the sums
secured by this Security Instrument, whether or not then due, with any
excess paid to Mortgagor. If Mortgagor abandons the Property, or does not
answer within 30 days a notice from Mortgagee that the insurance carrier
has offered to settle a claim, then Mortgagee may collect the insurance
proceeds. Mortgagee may use the proceeds to repair or restore the Property
or to pay sums secured by this Security Instrument, whether or not then
due. The 30day period will begin when the notice is given.

         Unless Mortgagee and Mortgagor otherwise agree in writing, any
application of proceeds to principal shall not extend or postpone the due
date of any of the Obligations or change the amount of the Obligations. If
under paragraph 15 the Property is acquired by Mortgagee, Mortgagor's
right to any insurance policies and proceeds resulting from damage to the
Property prior to the acquisition shall pass to Mortgagee to the extent of the
sums secured by this Security Instrument immediately prior to the
acquisition.

         4. Preservation and Maintenance of Property; Leaseholds.
Mortgagor shall not destroy, damage or substantially change the Property,
allow the Property to deteriorate or commit waste. If this Security
Instrument is a leasehold, Mortgagor shall comply with the provisions of
the lease, and if Mortgagor acquires fee title to the Property, the leasehold
and fee title shall not merge unless Mortgagee agrees to the merger in
writing.

         5. Protection of Mortgagee's Rights in the Property. If Mortgagor
fails to perform the covenants and agreements contained in this Security
Instrument, or there is a legal proceeding that may significantly affect
Mortgagee's rights in the Property (such a proceeding in bankruptcy,
probate, for condemnation or to enforce laws or regulations), then
Mortgagee may do and pay for whatever is necessary to protect the value of
the Property and Mortgagee's rights in the Property. Mortgagee's actions
may include paying any sums secured by a lien which has priority over this
Security Instrument, obtaining hazard insurance or any other insurance
required hereunder and paying premiums therefor, appearing in court,

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
paying reasonable attorneys' fees and entering on the Property to make
repairs. Although Mortgagee may take action under this paragraph 5,
Mortgagee does not have to do so.

         Any amounts disbursed by Mortgagee under this paragraph 5 shall
become additional debt of Mortgagor and part of the Obligations secured by
this Security Instrument. Unless Mortgagor and Mortgagee agree to other
terms of payment, these amounts shall bear interest from the date of
disbursement at the rate provided in the Debt Instrument, or in the note or
agreement guaranteed by the Debt Instrument, as the case may be, and shall
be payable, with interest, upon notice from Mortgagee to Mortgagor
requesting payment.

         6. Inspection. Mortgagee or its agent may make reasonable entries
upon and inspections of Property. Mortgagee shall give Mortgagor notice
at the time of or prior to an inspection specifying reasonable cause for the
inspection.

         7. Condemnation. The proceeds of any award or claim for
damages, direct or consequential, in connection with any condemnation or
taking of any part of the Property, or for conveyance in lieu of
condemnation, are hereby assigned and shall be paid to Mortgagee, subject
to the rights of prior mortgagees.

         In the event of a total or partial taking of the Property, the proceeds,
subject to the rights of prior mortgagees, shall be applied to the sums
secured by this Security Instrument, whether or not then due, with any
excess paid to Mortgagor.

         If the Property is abandoned by Mortgagor, or if, after notice by
Mortgagee to Mortgagor that the condemnor has offered to make an award
or settle a claim for damages, Mortgagor fails to respond to Mortgagee
within 30 days after the date the notice is given, Mortgagee is authorized to
collect and apply the proceeds, at its option, either to restoration or repair of
the Property or to the sums secured by this Security Instrument, whether or
not then due.

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
         Unless Mortgagee and Mortgagor otherwise agree in writing, any
application of proceeds to the payment of the Obligations shall not extend
or postpone the due date of any of the Obligations or change the amount of
any payments.

         8. Mortgagor Not Released; Forbearance by Mortgagee Not a
Waiver. Extension of the time for payment or modification or amortization
of the sums secured by this Security Instrument granted by Mortgagee to
any successor in interest of Mortgagor shall not operate to release the
liability of the original Mortgagor or Mortgagor's successors in interest.
Mortgagee shall not be required to commence proceedings against any
successor in interest or refuse to extend time for payment or otherwise
modify amortization of the sums secured by this Security Instrument by
reason of any demand made by the original Mortgagor or Mortgagor's
successors in interest. Any forbearance by Mortgagee in exercising any
right or remedy shall not be a waiver of or preclude the exercise of any right
or remedy.

         9. Successors and Assigns Bound; Joint and Several Liability;
Cosigners. The covenants and agreements of this Security Instrument shall
bind and benefit the successors and assigns of Mortgagee and Mortgagor,
subject to the provisions of paragraph 14. Mortgagor's covenants and
agreements shall be joint and several. Any Mortgagor who cosigns this
Security Instrument but does not execute the Debt Instrument: (a) is
cosigning this Security Instrument only to mortgage, grant and convey that
Mortgagor's interest in the Property under the terms of this Security
Instrument; (b) is not personally obligated to pay the sums secured by this
Security Instrument; and (c) agrees that Mortgagee and any other
Mortgagor may agree to extend, modify, forbear or make any
accommodations with regard to the terms of this Security Instrument or the
Debt Instrument without that Mortgagor's consent and, at Mortgagee's
request, to join in the execution of any modification of this Security
Instrument, the purpose of which is to evidence of record any such
extension, modification, forbearance or accommodation.

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
         10. Loan Charges. If the Obligations secured by this Security
Instrument are subject to a law which sets maximum loan charges, and that
law is finally interpreted so that the interest or other loan charges collected
or to be collected in connection with the Obligations exceed the permitted
limits, then: (a) any such loan charge shall be reduced by the amount
necessary to reduce the charge to the permitted limit; and (b) any sums
already collected from Mortgagor which exceeded permitted limits will be
refunded to Mortgagor. Mortgagee may choose to make this refund by
reducing the principal owed under the Debt Instrument or by making a
direct payment to Mortgagor. If a refund reduces principal, the reduction
will be treated as a partial payment without any prepayment charge under
the Debt Instrument.

         11. Notices. Any notice to Mortgagor provided for in this Security
Instrument shall be given by delivering it or by mailing it by certified mail,
return receipt requested, unless applicable law requires use of another
method. The notice shall be directed to the Property Address or any other
address Mortgagor designates by notice to Mortgagee. Any notice to
Mortgagee shall be given by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the
following address or any other address Mortgagee designates by notice to
Mortgagor:
_____________________________________________________________
________________________________________. Any notice provided for
in this Security Instrument shall be deemed to have been given to
Mortgagor or Mortgagee when given as provided in this paragraph 12.

         12. Governing Law; Severability. This Security Instrument shall be
governed by federal law and the law of the jurisdiction in which the
Property is located. In the event that any provision or clause of this
Security Instrument or the Debt Instrument conflicts with applicable law,
such conflict shall not affect other provisions of this Security Instrument or
the Debt Instrument which can be given effect without the conflicting
provision. To this end, the provisions of this Security Instrument and the
Debt Instrument are declared to be severable.

         13. Transfer of the Property or a Beneficial Interest in Mortgagor.
If all or any part of the Property or any interest in it is sold, transferred (or if

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
a beneficial interest in Mortgagor is sold or transferred and Mortgagor is
not a natural person), mortgaged or otherwise encumbered without
Mortgagee's prior written consent, Mortgagee may, at its option, require
immediate payment in full of all sums secured by this Security Instrument.
However, this option shall not be exercised by Mortgagee if exercise is
prohibited by federal law as of the date of this Security Instrument.

         14. Acceleration; Remedies. Upon the occurrence of a default in
the payment and performance when due of all or any portion of the
Obligations or breach of any covenant or agreement in the Debt Instrument
or this Security Instrument or the occurrence of any event specified in
Paragraph 11 or any Event of Default under the Debt Instrument,
Mortgagee may, at its option, (a) declare all of the Obligations to be
immediately due and payable, whereupon the same shall become
immediately due and payable, without presentment or demand for payment,
notice or demand of any kind, all of which are hereby waived by Mortgagor
and (b) invoke the STATUTORY POWER OF SALE and any other
remedies permitted under the Debt Instrument or by applicable law.
Mortgagee shall be entitled to collect all expenses incurred in pursuing the
remedies provided in this paragraph 15, including, but not limited to,
reasonable attorney's fees and costs of title evidence.

         If Mortgagee invokes the STATUTORY POWER OF SALE,
Mortgagee shall mail a copy of a notice of sale to Mortgagor, and to other
persons prescribed by applicable law, in the manner provided by applicable
law. Mortgagee shall publish the notice of sale, and the Property shall be
sold in the manner prescribed by applicable law. Mortgagee or its designee
may purchase the Property at any sale. The proceeds of the sale shall be
applied in the following order: (a) to all expenses of the sale, including, but
not limited to, reasonable attorney's fees; (b) to all sums secured by this
Security Instrument; and (c) any excess to the person or persons legally
entitled to it.

         15. Mortgagee in Possession. Upon acceleration under paragraph
15 or abandonment of the Property, Mortgagee (in person, by agent or by
judicially appointed receiver) shall be entitled to enter upon, take

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
possession of and manage the Property and to collect the rents of the
Property including those past due. Any rents collected by Mortgagee or the
receiver shall be applied first to payment of the costs of management of the
Property and collection of rents, including, but not limited to, receiver's
fees, premiums on receiver's bonds and reasonable attorney's fees, and then
to the sums secured by this Security Instrument.

         16. Release. Upon payment of all sums secured by this Security
Instrument, Mortgagee shall discharge this Security Instrument without
charge to Mortgagor. Mortgagor shall pay any recordation costs.

         17. Waivers. Mortgagor waives all rights of homestead exemption
in the Property and relinquishes all rights of curtesy and dower in the
Property.

         18. Riders to this Security Instrument. If one or more riders are
executed by Mortgagor and recorded together with this Security Instrument,
the covenants and agreements of each such rider shall be incorporated into
and shall amend and supplement the covenants and agreements of this
Security Instrument as if the rider(s) were a part of this Security
Instrument.

         BY SIGNING BELOW, Mortgagor accepts and agrees to the terms
and covenants contained in this Security Instrument and in any rider(s)
executed by Mortgagor and recorded with it.

Mortgagor:

ASSIGNMENT OF RENTS
AND LEASES

                  ASSIGNMENT OF LEASES AND RENTS

        This Assignment of Leases and Rents (this "Assignment") is made
by _____________________________, a
_____________________________ with a principal office at
_________________________________ ("Borrower"), in favor of
_________________________________, a Massachusetts
__________________________ with offices at
_______________________________ ("Lender").

                                      Background

        This Assignment is made to secure Borrower's payment and
performance of all of Borrower's obligations to Lender in connection with
(a) the indebtedness evidenced by Borrower's Promissory Note to Lender
dated of even date herewith in the face amount of $_____________ (the
"Note"), (b) a first mortgage and security agreement dated of even date and
recorded herewith, covering certain real property at
_______________________________ in ____________,
__________________ County, Massachusetts, as more particularly
described on the attached Exhibit A (the "Premises"), (c) any other present
or future notes, mortgages, guarantees, assignments or agreements between
Borrower and Lender in connection with the foregoing obligations, (d) any
substitutions or replacements for any of the foregoing, and (e) any
extensions, renewals, restatements, amendments or modifications thereof
(collectively, the "Obligations").

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
                                      Agreements

         As further security for Borrower's payment and performance of the
Obligations, Borrower agrees with Lender as follows:

         1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Assignment,
Borrower hereby transfers, assigns, and delivers to Lender as security for
Borrower's payment and performance of the Obligations all of Borrower's
right, title, and interest in and to:

          (i) All present and future leases, occupancy agreements, and
                 tenancies with respect to the Premises, together with all
                 renewals, extensions, and modifications thereof (collectively,
                 "Leases");

          (ii) All rents and other payments due to Borrower by virtue of
                 the Leases or otherwise due to Borrower as the result of any
                 use, possession, or occupancy of any portion or portions of
                 the Premises (collectively, "Rents"); and

          (iii) All right, title, and interest of Borrower in and to all
                 guarantees of the Leases.

        2. Borrower authorizes and empowers Lender to collect the
Rents as they become due and irrevocably directs each of the present and
future lessees, tenants, and other occupants of the Premises (all collectively
"Tenants") to pay the Rents to Lender, upon demand by Lender, provided,
however, that no such demand shall be made by Lender unless and until
there shall have occurred and is continuing an Event of Default, as defined
in the Note (an "Event of Default"). Until then, Borrower shall have a
license to collect the Rents.

         3. Borrower agrees that Lender may exercise its rights under
this Assignment without taking actual or constructive possession of the
Premises.

         4. Effective as of the occurrence of an Event of Default,
Borrower irrevocably constitutes and appoints Lender as Borrower's true
and lawful attorney in fact, with full power of substitution, for Borrower
and in Borrower's name, place, and stead, to enter and take possession of

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
the Premises and to do and perform any or all of the following actions, as
fully as Borrower could do if personally present, hereby ratifying and
confirming all that Lender lawfully does or causes to be done by virtue of
the foregoing appointment:

                 (a)  To manage and operate the Premises or any part of
the Premises;

                 (b) To lease any or all of the Premises for such periods of
time, and upon such terms and conditions, as Lender in its sole discretion
decides advisable;

(c) To enforce, terminate, or modify any of the Leases;

                 (d) To enter into subordination, attornment, and
nondisturbance agreements with respect to any mortgages, deeds, or leases
of the Premises (including any mortgages held by Lender) or with any of
the Tenants;

                 (e) To demand, collect, sue for, attach, levy, recover,
receive, compromise and adjust, and make, execute, and deliver receipts,
releases, and discharges for the Rents;

                 (f) To institute, prosecute to completion, or compromise
and settle, all proceedings and actions for Rent or for eviction of any
Tenant;

                 (g) To enforce, enjoin, or restrain the violation of any of
the terms, provisions, and conditions of any of the Leases;

                 (h) To make such repairs and alterations to the Premises
as Lender in its reasonable discretion decides advisable;

                 (i) To pay from the Rents any taxes, assessments, water
rates, sewer rates, or other governmental charges levied, assessed, or
imposed against the Premises or any portion thereof, and also any and all
other charges, costs, and expenses which it may be necessary or advisable
for Lender to pay in the management or operation of the Premises,

Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
including brokerage commissions, management and consulting fees, and
reasonable legal fees; and

                 (j) Generally to do any other thing whatsoever that Lender
in good faith decides advisable with respect to the Premises, as fully as
Borrower might do, provided, however, that (i) to the extent permitted by
law this Assignment shall not operate to place upon Lender any
responsibility or obligation to take any action whatsoever with respect to
the operation, control, care, management, or repair of the Premises, and
(ii) any action or failure or refusal to act by Lender under this Assignment,
except to the extent attributable to Lender's willful or intentional
misconduct or gross negligence, shall be without any liability on its part.

         5. Borrower represents and warrants to Lender as follows:

                 (a) Borrower is the sole owner of the entire landlord's
interest in the Leases, true and complete copies of which have been
delivered to Lender;

                 (b) The Leases are valid and enforceable, are in full force
and effect, and have not been altered, amended, or modified in any manner,
except for such amendments as are included with the copies of Leases
delivered by Borrower to Lender;

                 (c) Except for security deposits and last month's rent
paid by Tenants, no set-off or counterclaim exists under the Leases against
Borrower, and except as previously disclosed in writing to Lender, to
Borrower's knowledge, no party to any of the Leases is in default
thereunder, nor does any basis for such a default exist;

                 (d) Borrower has not previously sold, assigned, transferred,
mortgaged, or pledged any of the Leases or any of the Rents other than with
respect to the Subordinate Loans (as defined in the Loan Agreement); and

                 (e) No Rents becoming due after the date of this
Assignment have been collected, nor has payment of any of the Rents been
anticipated, waived, released, discounted, or otherwise discharged or
compromised.

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
         6. Borrower covenants and agrees with Lender as follows:

                 (a) Except for any assignments in connection with
Subordinate Loans, Borrower will not further assign, pledge, or otherwise
transfer or encumber any of the Leases or any of the Rents without the prior
written consent of Lender and unless the instrument creating such
assignment, pledge, or encumbrance expressly states that it is subject and
subordinate to this Assignment;

                 (b) Borrower will not collect or receive from any Tenant
more than one (1) month's rent in advance of the rent stipulated to be paid
under the applicable lease, except for security deposits and last month's
rent, without in each case having obtained the prior written consent of
Lender;

                 (c) Borrower will perform and observe, or cause to be
performed and observed, all of the terms, covenants, and conditions on
Borrower's part to be performed and observed with respect to each of the
Leases;

                 (d) Upon written request by Lender, Borrower will serve
upon any Tenant or include among the written provisions of any Lease a
specific reference to this Assignment;

                 (e) Borrower will promptly furnish to Lender, on
demand, true copies of all Leases executed after the date of this Assignment
and true copies of each agreement or letter affecting the renewal,
amendment, or modification of any Lease;

                 (f) Borrower will not enter into any agreement with any
management agent or firm with respect to the Premises unless such agent or
firm first agrees with Lender to recognize Lender's rights under this
Assignment and further agrees to transfer all Rents received by such agent
or firm directly to Lender upon Lender's demand after an Event of Default;
and

                 (g) No lease of the Premises outside the ordinary course
of business shall be executed by Borrower without Lender's prior express

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
written approval.

         7. Except to the extent attributable to Lender's willful
misconduct or gross negligence, Borrower shall indemnify and hold Lender
harmless (a) against and from any and all liability, loss, damage, and
expense, including reasonable attorneys' fees, which it may incur under or
in connection with any of the Leases, or by reason of any action taken or
expenses paid or incurred by Lender under this Assignment and (b) against
and from any and all liability, loss, damage, and expense, including
reasonable attorneys' fees, incurred by Lender in connection with any claim
or demand whatsoever that may be asserted against Lender by reason of any
alleged obligation or undertaking on its part to perform or discharge any of
the terms, covenants, or conditions in any of the Leases. Should Lender
pay or incur any such liability, loss, damage, or expense, the amount
thereof, together with interest at the Default Rate as defined in the Note
shall be payable by Borrower to Lender within ten (10) business days after
Lender's written demand. At its option, Lender may reimburse itself from
any Rents which it has collected.

         8. Failure of Lender to avail itself of any of the terms,
covenants, and conditions of this Assignment shall not be construed as a
waiver of any of its rights. The rights and remedies of Lender under this
Assignment are cumulative and are not in lieu of, but are in addition to, any
other rights and remedies which Lender shall have under or by virtue of any
of the other Obligations. Borrower recognizes and agrees that if any of the
Leases is subordinate to the mortgage, Lender may at its election extinguish
such leases in accordance with applicable law through the exercise of its
rights as Lender, regardless of whether Lender previously has exercised its
rights under this Assignment.

         9. Upon the payment and performance in full of all of the
Obligations this Assignment shall terminate and Lender shall execute and
deliver to Borrower at Borrower's expense any instruments necessary to
discharge this Assignment of record.

         10. All terms, covenants, agreements, and conditions in this
Assignment shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon Borrower and

                          Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4294001
Lender and their respective successors and assigns and may not be
terminated, modified, changed, or amended except in writing signed by all
parties hereto. Any notice, demand, or other communication shall be
rendered in writing and shall be delivered in accordance with the notice
provision in the Loan Agreement. If any one or more of the provisions in
this Assignment are held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any
respect, such invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability shall not affect any
other provision.

         Signed as a sealed instrument as of September __, 2005.
