INTRODUCTION

What Is This Book?

This book introduces criminal procedure law in the United
States, with a focus on the "investigation" stage of the criminal
justice system. Specifically, the book focuses on legal
constraints placed upon police and prosecutors, constraints
largely derived from Supreme Court interpretations of the
Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments to the Constitution.
Major topics include searches and seizures, warrants and when
they are required, interrogations, witness identifications of
suspects, and the right to counsel during various stages of
investigation and prosecution.

   At the end of the semester, students should have a solid
foundation in the "black-letter law" of criminal procedure.
This material is tested on the bar examination, and it is the
sort of information that friends and family will expect lawyers
to know, even lawyers who never practice criminal law. For
example, a lawyer lacking basic familiarity with the Miranda
Rule risks looking foolish at Thanksgiving dinner. In addition,
the legal issues covered in this book relate to some of the most
intense ongoing political and social debates in the country.
The law governing stop-and-frisk procedures, for example, is
2 | INTRODUCTION

not merely trivia one should learn for an exam. It affects the
lives of real people. The reliability of eyewitness identifications
affects the likelihood of wrongful convictions, a phenomenon
persons of all political persuasions oppose. In short, policing
and prosecution affect everyone in America, and an informed
citizen--especially a lawyer--should understand the primary
arguments raised in major controversies in criminal procedure
law.

   To be sure, understanding the holdings of major cases is
essential to more nuanced participation in these debates, and
this book devotes the bulk of its pages to Supreme Court
opinions, which your authors have edited for length. (To save
space, we have omitted internal citations, as well as portions
of court opinions, without using ellipses to indicate our edits.)
The book then aims to go beyond the information available
in majority opinions, concurrences, and dissents. To do so, it
includes supplementary material on developments in law and
policy. For example, advances in technology raise questions
about precedent concerning what counts as a "search" under
Fourth Amendment law. The book also provides perspectives
on the practical implications of Supreme Court decisions,
perspectives often given scant attention by the Justices. For
example, state courts have grappled with scientific evidence
about witness reliability that has not yet been addressed in
Supreme Court opinions resolving due process challenges
related to identifications.
Further, in addition to helping students identify situations in
                                                                  INTRODUCTION | 3

which constitutional rights may have been violated, the book
explores what remedies are available for different violations.
For a criminal defendant, the most desirable remedy will
normally be exclusion of evidence obtained though illegal
means--for example, drugs found in a defendant's car or
home during an unlawful search. Contrary to common
misconceptions among the general public, however, not all
criminal procedure law violations result in the exclusion of
evidence. Students will read the leading cases on the
exclusionary rule, confronting arguments on when the
remedy of exclusion--which quite often requires that a guilty
person avoid conviction--is justified by the need to encourage
adherence by law enforcement to the rules presented in this
book concerning searches, seizures, interrogations, and so on.
Your authors have attempted to create a book that presents
material clearly and does not hide the ball. Students who read
assigned material should be well prepared for class, armed
with knowledge of what rules the Supreme Court has
announced, along with the main arguments for and against
the Court's choices.
The remainder of this Introduction consists of further effort
by your authors to convince you of the importance of the
material presented later in the book. Many students possess
this book because they are enrolled in a required course or
know that this material is tested on the bar exam. Others of
you plan to practice criminal law. Still others study criminal
procedure to learn more about important societal
4 | INTRODUCTION

controversies. Regardless, your authors do not take your
attention for granted.

A Note on the Text

Universities exist to promote the search for knowledge and to
transmit human knowledge to future generations. Public
universities in particular have a tradition of sharing knowledge
with the broader populace, not merely their own students,
and they also have a tradition of providing excellent education
at affordable prices. This book exists to further these
important missions of the University of Missouri. Designed
by MU professors, it suits the pedagogical preferences of its
authors. Available at no cost, it reduces students' cost of
attendance.
In addition, this book is available under a Creative Commons
license, meaning that anyone--inside or outside the
university--can use it to study criminal procedure and can
share it at will. Faculty at other universities are free to adopt it.
The project was inspired, in part, by an article one of your
authors published in 2016, calling on law schools and law
faculty to create free casebooks for students.1 It turned out
that calling upon others to create books did not in itself
produce these books. Your authors have since become the
change they wished to see in legal education. Because the
book is new--and is the first casebook produced by either of
                                                                  INTRODUCTION | 5

your authors--student feedback is especially welcome. Future
students will benefit from any improvements.
To increase the book's value as a free resource, the text when
possible contains links to sources at which students can learn
more at no cost. For example, Supreme Court cases are freely
available online, and anyone who wishes to read the full
unedited version of any case may do so. (Even when a link has
not been provided, when naming cases we usually have
included a full citation, which should allow students easy
access to free versions of the text.) Your authors have edited
cases so that reading assignments would be kept reasonable
for a one-semester course; however, there is always more to
learn.
In addition, this book aims to go beyond providing a
"nutshell" summary of American criminal procedure law.
From time to time, particularly when assigned cases raise
issues about which there are important ongoing debates in
American society, the readings will investigate these issues in
greater depth than might be possible were the text confined to
opinions written by Supreme Court Justices. More than one
hundred years ago, Roscoe Pound--then dean of the
University of Nebraska College of Law, later dean at
Harvard--published the great legal realist article "Law in
Books and Law in Action."2 If this book is successful,
students will spend time considering the practical effects--the
law in action--of the opinions contained in Supreme Court
reporters.

     The Key Constitutional
              Language

The U.S. Constitution was drafted as an effort to combine
the original states into one nation under a workable governing
system. The Constitution replaced the original unifying
document created after the Revolutionary War for
independence from Great Britain, known as the Articles of
Confederation, because many regarded the Articles of
Confederation as providing too little authority for the national
government. The national government needed greater ability
to regulate the economy and to provide for national defense
by obligating states to cooperate and help each other as one
country. Prior to the ratification of the Constitution, states
often regarded themselves as very separate entities and that
were not fully committed to a unified whole. After the
Constitution was ratified, creating the United States of
8 | KEY CONSTITUTIONAL LANGUAGE: 4TH, 5TH, 6TH, 8TH,
&#038; 14TH AMENDMENTS

America and designing the details of the nation's governing
system, concerns arose about whether the document provided
enough protection for the rights of individuals. As a result,
the Bill of Rights was drafted and ultimately added ten
Amendments to the Constitution in 1791, the first eight of
which specified legal protections for individuals, known to
us as "constitutional rights", that define the relationship of
individuals to government. "Rights", in a legal sense, are
entitlements for individuals that the government is not
supposed to violate. Over the course of subsequent decades,
additional Amendments have been added to the Constitution.
Of particular importance are the Amendments added after the
Civil War, especially the Fourteenth Amendment (1868) that
contains the rights to due process of law and equal protection
of the laws.

   In this course, students will focus on Supreme Court cases
arising from a handful of constitutional provisions. Five
Amendments to the Constitution of the United States are
reprinted here (four in full, one in part) for your convenience.
Note how the description of rights in these Amendments
contain many vague terms, such as "unreasonable search" and
"cruel and unusual punishment". These terms require
interpretation when disputes arise about their meaning.
Judges have the authority to interpret these terms and thereby
clarify--and change--the meanings of constitutional rights:

Savvy students will have noticed that the constitutional
provisions reprinted above lack definitions for terms such as
"unreasonable", "search", "seizure", "probable cause", "put in
jeopardy", "due process of law", "confronted with the
witnesses against him", and "Assistance of Counsel". The
remainder of this book is, essentially, a summary of the
Supreme Court's ongoing efforts to provide the missing
definitions.
  Briefing a Judicial Opinion
(otherwise known as creating

    a "brief" or "case brief")

When lawyers and law students read a judicial opinion (often
referred to with the shorthand word "case") that decides a legal
dispute and provides reasoning for that decision, they try to
boil the case down to a single page of organized notes that
highlight the key features of the decision. Writing a good case
brief involves the development of skill and analytical ability
that comes from practice--by consistently creating these notes
for every judicial opinion read for a course on Criminal
Procedure. When doing case briefs for the first time, it is highly
likely that a student will write too much or too little. There
is no magical secret for writing a perfect brief. Indeed,
individuals may differ in their own preferences about how
much information to have in a brief. The important point
is that the process of writing briefs will force the student to
focus attentively on the details of the case and provide a quick
reference to use during class discussions and when preparing
for exams without going back to read the entire judicial
opinion again.

   Judges write their opinions for an audience of lawyers and
                                            BRIEFING A JUDICIAL OPINION | 13

judges, not for average citizens, not even for college educated
members of the public. They use words and phrases that may
be unfamiliar to people who did not attend law school. When
you see an unfamiliar word: Look it up in an online dictionary!

   Look at the elements of the generic sample brief below.
When you read judicial opinions and write a one-page brief
with essential information from a case, you first need the name
of the case, the year it was decided, and the court that issued
the opinion. Also note which judge or Supreme Court justice
wrote the majority opinion. This will help you over time as
you begin to recognize the approach to constitutional
interpretation and values of specific Supreme Court justices.
Then a very brief summary of the relevant FACTS in the case.
Next, you need to formulate the question that is the ISSUE in
the case. For this course, the issue should tie the facts to the
part of the Constitution (including the Amendments in the
Bill of Rights) that is alleged to be violated by a government
action. The next element is the statement of the HOLDING.
The holding is the rule that is reinforced, refined, or created
by the judges' decision in the case. Then you should briefly
describe the REASONING of the majority opinion, as well
as the separate reasoning of any Concurring (agreeing with
the outcome) or Dissenting (disagreeing with the outcome)
opinions. Read the judicial opinions in the U.S. Supreme
Court case of Safford School District v. Redding (2009). Write
a case brief and then compare your case brief with the very
simple case brief presented for the Redding case.

SCHOOL DISTRICT V.
REDDING (2009)

              Supreme Court of the United States

     Safford Unified School
  District #1 v. April Redding

             Decided June 25, 2009 - 557 U.S. 364

Justice SOUTER delivered the opinion of the Court.
   The issue here is whether a 13-year-old student's Fourth

Amendment right was violated when she was subjected to a
search of her bra and underpants by school officials acting
on reasonable suspicion that she had brought forbidden
prescription and over-the-counter drugs to school. Because
there were no reasons to suspect the drugs presented a danger
or were concealed in her underwear, we hold that the search
did violate the Constitution.
16 | SAFFORD UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT V. REDDING (2009)

                       I

The events immediately prior to the search in question began
in 13-year-old Savana Redding's math class at Safford Middle
School one October day in 2003. The assistant principal of the
school, Kerry Wilson, came into the room and asked Savana to
go to his office. There, he showed her a day planner, unzipped
and open flat on his desk, in which there were several knives,
lighters, a permanent marker, and a cigarette. Wilson asked
Savana whether the planner was hers; she said it was, but that
a few days before she had lent it to her friend, Marissa Glines.
Savana stated that none of the items in the planner belonged to
her.

   Wilson then showed Savana four white prescription-
strength ibuprofen 400-mg pills, and one over-the-counter
blue naproxen 200-mg pill, all used for pain and inflammation
but banned under school rules without advance permission.
He asked Savana if she knew anything about the pills. Savana
answered that she did not. Wilson then told Savana that he
had received a report that she was giving these pills to fellow
students; Savana denied it and agreed to let Wilson search her
belongings. Helen Romero, an administrative assistant, came
into the office, and together with Wilson they searched
Savana's backpack, finding nothing.

   At that point, Wilson instructed Romero to take Savana to
the school nurse's office to search her clothes for pills. Romero
and the nurse, Peggy Schwallier, asked Savana to remove her
        SAFFORD UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT V. REDDING (2009) | 17

jacket, socks, and shoes, leaving her in stretch pants and a T-
shirt (both without pockets), which she was then asked to
remove. Finally, Savana was told to pull her bra out and to the
side and shake it, and to pull out the elastic on her underpants,
thus exposing her breasts and pelvic area to some degree. No
pills were found.

   Savana's mother filed suit against Safford Unified School
District # 1, Wilson, Romero, and Schwallier for conducting a
strip search in violation of Savana's Fourth Amendment rights.
The individuals (hereinafter petitioners) moved for summary
judgment, raising a defense of qualified immunity. The
District Court for the District of Arizona granted the motion
on the ground that there was no Fourth Amendment
violation, and a panel of the Ninth Circuit affirmed. A closely
divided Circuit sitting en banc, however, reversed. We granted
certiorari and now affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.

                       II

The Fourth Amendment "right of the people to be secure in
their persons ... against unreasonable searches and seizures"
generally requires a law enforcement officer to have probable
cause for conducting a search.

   In T.L.O., we recognized that the school setting "requires
some modification of the level of suspicion of illicit activity
needed to justify a search" and held that for searches by school
officials "a careful balancing of governmental and private
18 | SAFFORD UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT V. REDDING (2009)

interests suggests that the public interest is best served by a
Fourth Amendment standard of reasonableness that stops
short of probable cause." We have thus applied a standard of
reasonable suspicion to determine the legality of a school
administrator's search of a student and have held that a school
search "will be permissible in its scope when the measures
adopted are reasonably related to the objectives of the search
and not excessively intrusive in light of the age and sex of the
student and the nature of the infraction." ***

                      III

                         A

***On the morning of October 8, the same boy handed Wilson
a white pill that he said Marissa Glines had given him. He told
Wilson that students were planning to take the pills at lunch.

   Wilson learned from Peggy Schwallier, the school nurse,
that the pill was Ibuprofen 400 mg, available only by
prescription. Wilson then called Marissa out of class. Outside
the classroom, Marissa's teacher handed Wilson the day
planner, found within Marissa's reach, containing various
contraband items. Wilson escorted Marissa back to his office.

   In the presence of Helen Romero, Wilson requested
Marissa to turn out her pockets and open her wallet. Marissa
produced a blue pill, several white ones, and a razor blade.
Wilson asked where the blue pill came from, and Marissa
        SAFFORD UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT V. REDDING (2009) | 19

answered, "`I guess it slipped in when she gave me the IBU
400s.'" When Wilson asked whom she meant, Marissa replied,
"`Savana Redding.'" Wilson then enquired about the day
planner and its contents; Marissa denied knowing anything
about them. Wilson did not ask Marissa any followup
questions to determine whether there was any likelihood that
Savana presently had pills: neither asking when Marissa
received the pills from Savana nor where Savana might be
hiding them.

   Schwallier did not immediately recognize the blue pill, but
information provided through a poison control hotline
indicated that the pill was a 200-mg dose of an anti-
inflammatory drug, generically called naproxen, available over
the counter. At Wilson's direction, Marissa was then subjected
to a search of her bra and underpants by Romero and
Schwallier, as Savana was later on. The search revealed no
additional pills.

   It was at this juncture that Wilson called Savana into his
office and showed her the day planner. Their conversation
established that Savana and Marissa were on friendly terms:
while she denied knowledge of the contraband, Savana
admitted that the day planner was hers and that she had lent it
to Marissa. Wilson had other reports of their friendship from
staff members, who had identified Savana and Marissa as part
of an unusually rowdy group at the school's opening dance
in August, during which alcohol and cigarettes were found in
the girls' bathroom. Wilson had reason to connect the girls
20 | SAFFORD UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT V. REDDING (2009)

with this contraband, for Wilson knew that Jordan Romero
had told the principal that before the dance, he had been at
a party at Savana's house where alcohol was served. Marissa's
statement that the pills came from Savana was thus sufficiently
plausible to warrant suspicion that Savana was involved in pill
distribution.

   This suspicion of Wilson's was enough to justify a search
of Savana's backpack and outer clothing. If a student is
reasonably suspected of giving out contraband pills, she is
reasonably suspected of carrying them on her person and in
the carryall that has become an item of student uniform in
most places today. If Wilson's reasonable suspicion of pill
distribution were not understood to support searches of outer
clothes and backpack, it would not justify any search worth
making. And the look into Savana's bag, in her presence and
in the relative privacy of Wilson's office, was not excessively
intrusive, any more than Romero's subsequent search of her
outer clothing.

                         B

Here it is that the parties part company, with Savana's claim
that extending the search at Wilson's behest to the point of
making her pull out her underwear was constitutionally
unreasonable. The exact label for this final step in the intrusion
is not important, though strip search is a fair way to speak
of it. Romero and Schwallier directed Savana to remove her
        SAFFORD UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT V. REDDING (2009) | 21

clothes down to her underwear, and then "pull out" her bra
and the elastic band on her underpants. Although Romero
and Schwallier stated that they did not see anything when
Savana followed their instructions, we would not define strip
search and its Fourth Amendment consequences in a way that
would guarantee litigation about who was looking and how
much was seen. The very fact of Savana's pulling her
underwear away from her body in the presence of the two
officials who were able to see her necessarily exposed her breasts
and pelvic area to some degree, and both subjective and
reasonable societal expectations of personal privacy support
the treatment of such a search as categorically distinct,
requiring distinct elements of justification on the part of
school authorities for going beyond a search of outer clothing
and belongings.

   Savana's subjective expectation of privacy against such a
search is inherent in her account of it as embarrassing,
frightening, and humiliating. The reasonableness of her
expectation (required by the Fourth Amendment standard) is
indicated by the consistent experiences of other young people
similarly searched, whose adolescent vulnerability intensifies
the patent intrusiveness of the exposure. The common
reaction of these adolescents simply registers the obviously
different meaning of a search exposing the body from the
experience of nakedness or near undress in other school
circumstances. Changing for gym is getting ready for play;
exposing for a search is responding to an accusation reserved
22 | SAFFORD UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT V. REDDING (2009)

for suspected wrongdoers and fairly understood as so
degrading that a number of communities have decided that
strip searches in schools are never reasonable and have banned
them no matter what the facts may be.

***

Here, the content of the suspicion failed to match the degree
of intrusion. Wilson knew beforehand that the pills were
prescription-strength ibuprofen and over-the-counter
naproxen, common pain relievers equivalent to two Advil, or
one Aleve. He must have been aware of the nature and limited
threat of the specific drugs he was searching for, and while
just about anything can be taken in quantities that will do
real harm, Wilson had no reason to suspect that large amounts
of the drugs were being passed around, or that individual
students were receiving great numbers of pills.

   ....there is no evidence in the record of any general practice
among Safford Middle School students of hiding that sort of
thing in underwear; neither Jordan nor Marissa suggested to
Wilson that Savana was doing that, and the preceding search
of Marissa that Wilson ordered yielded nothing. Wilson never
even determined when Marissa had received the pills from
Savana; if it had been a few days before, that would weigh
heavily against any reasonable conclusion that Savana
presently had the pills on her person, much less in her
underwear.

   In sum, what was missing from the suspected facts that
       SAFFORD UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT V. REDDING (2009) | 23

pointed to Savana was any indication of danger to the students
from the power of the drugs or their quantity, and any reason
to suppose that Savana was carrying pills in her underwear. We
think that the combination of these deficiencies was fatal to
finding the search reasonable.

   In so holding, we mean to cast no ill reflection on the
assistant principal, for the record raises no doubt that his
motive throughout was to eliminate drugs from his school
and protect students from what Jordan Romero had gone
through. Parents are known to overreact to protect their
children from danger, and a school official with responsibility
for safety may tend to do the same. The difference is that the
Fourth Amendment places limits on the official, even with the
high degree of deference that courts must pay to the educator's
professional judgment.

   We do mean, though, to make it clear that the T.L.O.
concern to limit a school search to reasonable scope requires
the support of reasonable suspicion of danger or of resort to
underwear for hiding evidence of wrongdoing before a search
can reasonably make the quantum leap from outer clothes and
backpacks to exposure of intimate parts. The meaning of such
a search, and the degradation its subject may reasonably feel,
place a search that intrusive in a category of its own demanding
its own specific suspicions.

   [The Court found qualified immunity warranted for
Wilson, Romero, and Schwallier because "the cases viewing
school strip searches differently from the way we see them are
24 | SAFFORD UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT V. REDDING (2009)

numerous enough, with well-reasoned majority and dissenting
opinions, to counsel doubt that we were sufficiently clear in
the prior statement of law." The case was remanded for
resolution of the question of liability for the school district.]

   Justice THOMAS, concurring in the judgment in part and
dissenting in part.

   By declaring the search unreasonable in this case, the
majority has "`surrender[ed] control of the American public
school system to public school students'" by invalidating
school policies that treat all drugs equally and by second-
guessing swift disciplinary decisions made by school officials.
The Court's interference in these matters of great concern to
teachers, parents, and students illustrates why the most
constitutionally sound approach to the question of applying
the Fourth Amendment in local public schools would in fact
be the complete restoration of the common-law doctrine of in
loco parentis.

***

In the end, the task of implementing and amending public
school policies is beyond this Court's function. Parents,
teachers, school administrators, local politicians, and state
officials are all better suited than judges to determine the
appropriate limits on searches conducted by school officials.
Preservation of order, discipline, and safety in public schools
is simply not the domain of the Constitution. And, common
       SAFFORD UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT V. REDDING (2009) | 25

sense is not a judicial monopoly or a Constitutional
imperative.

   Only then will teachers again be able to "`govern the[ir]
pupils, quicken the slothful, spur the indolent, restrain the
impetuous, and control the stubborn'" by making "`rules,
giv[ing] commands, and punish[ing] disobedience'" without
interference from judges. By deciding that it is better equipped
to decide what behavior should be permitted in schools, the
Court has undercut student safety and undermined the
authority of school administrators and local officials. Even
more troubling, it has done so in a case in which the
underlying response by school administrators was reasonable
and justified. I cannot join this regrettable decision. I,
therefore, respectfully dissent from the Court's determination
that this search violated the Fourth Amendment.

Notes, Comments, and Questions

April Redding sued the Safford Unified school district on
behalf of her daughter, Savana. During the oral argument,
some of the Justices asked questions that betrayed their lack
of knowledge about modern middle school life. Justice Scalia,
for example, inquired about some of the items classified as
contraband at Savana's school. He said learning that a "black
marker pencil" was contraband "astounded" him. Told by
counsel that students use such markers "for sniffing," Justice
26 | SAFFORD UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT V. REDDING (2009)

Scalia replied, "Oh, is that what they do? ... They sniff them? ...
Really?"

   Justice Breyer, after trying to pin down the facts concerning
how Savana was searched--and after suggesting that
underwear might be a sensible place to hide pills--reminisced
on his own school days.

   "In my experience when I was 8 or 10 or 12 years old, you
know, we did take our clothes off once a day, we changed for
gym, okay?"

   He continued, "And in my experience, too, people did
sometimes stick things in my underwear."

   The audience burst into laughter, and he clarified: "Or not
my underwear. Whatever. ... I was the one who did it? I don't
know."

   Dahlia Lithwick, who covered the case for Slate, predicted
as follows after the oral argument:

   "When constitutional historians sit down someday to
compile the definitive Supreme Court Concordance of Not
Getting It, the entry directly next to Lilly Ledbetter (`Court
fails utterly to understand realities of gender pay
discrimination') will be Savana Redding (`Court compares
strip searches of 13-year-old girls to American Pie-style locker-
room hijinks'). After today's argument, it's plain the court
will overturn a 9th Circuit Court of Appeals opinion finding
a school's decision to strip-search a 13-year-old girl
unconstitutional. That the school in question was looking for
a prescription pill with the mind-altering force of a pair of
       SAFFORD UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT V. REDDING (2009) | 27

Advil--and couldn't be bothered to call the child's mother
first--hardly matters."

   Having read the Court's opinion, we know that Lithwick's
prediction was not correct. Justice Breyer, he of the hijinks
memories, joined an eight-Justice majority finding that the
school's behavior violated the Fourth Amendment. Although
there was broad consensus for finding a violation, a smaller
majority of Justices denied Savana money damages, holding
that the school officials were protected by "qualified
immunity,"
SAMPLE CASE BRIEF

(Simple case brief)

SAFFORD SCHOOLS V.
REDDING (2009) U.S.
Supreme Court

"Score" 8-1
   Majority opinion author: Justice David Souter
   Facts: A middle school student reported that fellow student

Marissa Glines was giving prescription strength Ibuprofen to
other students. The day planner carried by Glines was found
to contain pills. Glines denied any knowledge of the pills and
said she was given the dayplanner by Savana Redding.
Redding also denied knowledge of the pills. School officials
searched Reddings' belongings and then ordered Redding to
disrobe and shake out her underwear in front of school
officials. No pills were found in her possession. Her family
sued the school officials over the intrusive search.

   Issue: Did school officials violate teenage student Redding's
Fourth Amendment right against "unreasonable searches" by
requiring the student to disrobe and shake out her underwear
                                                          SAMPLE CASE BRIEF | 29

in front of school officials based solely on a report from
another student that Redding possessed and distributed the
prescription-strength version of over-the-counter pain pills?

   Holding: Yes, school officials violated teenage student
Redding's Fourth Amendment right against "unreasonable
searches" by requiring the student to disrobe and shake out her
underwear in front of school officials based solely on a report
from another student that Redding possessed and distributed
the prescription-strength version of over-the-counter pain
pills.

   Reasoning: Searches are reasonable under the Fourth
Amendment when, after balancing the government's interest
and the individual's privacy interest, the government interest is
stronger. Redding suffered a significant intrusion based solely
on a statement from another student and no specific evidence
that contraband was hidden on her body. The other student's
statement justified a search of a backpack and other belongings
because of the important need to protect students from drugs,
but did not provide enough justification to require disrobing
and examining underwear.

   Concurring opinion(s): (Justice Clarence Thomas
concurred with the part of the opinion-omitted above--that
concluded school officials could not be sued for money
damages due to qualified immunity).

   Dissenting opinion(s): Justice Thomas: school officials did
not violate the student's Fourth Amendment right because
they stand in the place of parents while students are at school
30 | SAMPLE CASE BRIEF

and must protect students' health and safety. School officials,
parents, and school board members should determine policies
and practices at schools--judges should not make those
decisions.
PART II

WHY IS CRIMINAL
PROCEDURE SO
IMPORTANT?

In this 1936 unanimous opinion by Chief Justice Charles
Evans Hughes, the Supreme Court reviewed a criminal case
from Mississippi. Students will see immediately why the
actions of police, prosecutors, and judges upset the Supreme
Court Justices.
BROWN V. MISSISSIPPI
(1936)

              Supreme Court of the United States

    Ed Brown v. Mississippi

         Decided Feb. 17, 1936 -- 297 U.S. 278 (1936)

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE HUGHES delivered the [unanimous]
opinion of the Court.

   The question in this case is whether convictions, which rest
solely upon confessions shown to have been extorted by
officers of the state by brutality and violence, are consistent
with the due process of law required by the Fourteenth
Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.

   Petitioners were indicted for the murder of one Raymond
Stewart, whose death occurred on March 30, 1934. They were
indicted on April 4, 1934 and were then arraigned and pleaded
not guilty. Counsel were appointed by the court to defend
them. Trial was begun the next morning and was concluded on
34 | BROWN V. MISSISSIPPI (1936)

the following day, when they were found guilty and sentenced
to death.

   Aside from the confessions, there was no evidence sufficient
to warrant the submission of the case to the jury. After a
preliminary inquiry, testimony as to the confessions was
received over the objection of defendants' counsel. Defendants
then testified that the confessions were false and had been
procured by physical torture. The case went to the jury with
instructions, upon the request of defendants' counsel, that if
the jury had reasonable doubt as to the confessions having
resulted from coercion, and that they were not true, they were
not to be considered as evidence. On their appeal to the
Supreme Court of the State, defendants assigned as error the
inadmissibility of the confessions. The judgment was affirmed.

   Defendants then moved in the Supreme Court of the State
to arrest the judgment and for a new trial on the ground that
all the evidence against them was obtained by coercion and
brutality known to the court and to the district attorney, and
that defendants had been denied the benefit of counsel or
opportunity to confer with counsel in a reasonable manner.
The motion was supported by affidavits. At about the same
time, defendants filed in the Supreme Court a "suggestion of
error" explicitly challenging the proceedings of the trial, in the
use of the confessions and with respect to the alleged denial of
representation by counsel, as violating the due process clause
of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the
United States. The state court entertained the suggestion of
                                               BROWN V. MISSISSIPPI (1936) | 35

error, considered the federal question, and decided it against
defendants' contentions. Two judges dissented. We granted a
writ of certiorari.

   The grounds of the decision were (1) that immunity from
self-incrimination is not essential to due process of law; and
(2) that the failure of the trial court to exclude the confessions
after the introduction of evidence showing their
incompetency, in the absence of a request for such exclusion,
did not deprive the defendants of life or liberty without due
process of law; and that even if the trial court had erroneously
overruled a motion to exclude the confessions, the ruling
would have been mere error reversible on appeal, but not a
violation of constitutional right.

   The opinion of the state court did not set forth the evidence
as to the circumstances in which the confessions were
procured. That the evidence established that they were
procured by coercion was not questioned. The state court said:
`After the state closed its case on the merits, the appellants, for
the first time, introduced evidence from which it appears that
the confessions were not made voluntarily but were coerced.'
There is no dispute as to the facts upon this point, and as
they are clearly and adequately stated in the dissenting opinion
of Judge Griffith (with whom Judge Anderson concurred),
showing both the extreme brutality of the measures to extort
the confessions and the participation of the state authorities,
we quote this part of his opinion in full, as follows:

   "The crime with which these defendants, all ignorant
36 | BROWN V. MISSISSIPPI (1936)

negroes, are charged, was discovered about 1 o'clock p.m. on
Friday, March 30, 1934. On that night one Dial, a deputy
sheriff, accompanied by others, came to the home of Ellington,
one of the defendants, and requested him to accompany them
to the house of the deceased, and there a number of white
men were gathered, who began to accuse the defendant of
the crime. Upon his denial they seized him, and with the
participation of the deputy they hanged him by a rope to the
limb of a tree, and, having let him down, they hung him again,
and when he was let down the second time, and he still
protested his innocence, he was tied to a tree and whipped,
and, still declining to accede to the demands that he confess,
he was finally released, and he returned with some difficulty
to his home, suffering intense pain and agony. The record of
the testimony shows that the signs of the rope on his neck
were plainly visible during the so-called trial. A day or two
thereafter the said deputy, accompanied by another, returned
to the home of the said defendant and arrested him, and
departed with the prisoner towards the jail in an adjoining
county, but went by a route which led into the state of
Alabama; and while on the way, in that state, the deputy
stopped and again severely whipped the defendant, declaring
that he would continue the whipping until he confessed, and
the defendant then agreed to confess to such a statement as
the deputy would dictate, and he did so, after which he was
delivered to jail.

   "The other two defendants, Ed Brown and Henry Shields,
                                               BROWN V. MISSISSIPPI (1936) | 37

were also arrested and taken to the same jail. On Sunday night,
April 1, 1934, the same deputy, accompanied by a number
of white men, one of whom was also an officer, and by the
jailer, came to the jail, and the two last named defendants
were made to strip and they were laid over chairs and their
backs were cut to pieces with a leather strap with buckles on
it, and they were likewise made by the said deputy definitely to
understand that the whipping would be continued unless and
until they confessed, and not only confessed, but confessed
in every matter of detail as demanded by those present; and
in this manner the defendants confessed the crime, and, as
the whippings progressed and were repeated, they changed
or adjusted their confession in all particulars of detail so as
to conform to the demands of their torturers. When the
confessions had been obtained in the exact form and contents
as desired by the mob, they left with the parting admonition
and warning that, if the defendants changed their story at any
time in any respect from that last stated, the perpetrators of
the outrage would administer the same or equally effective
treatment.

   "Further details of the brutal treatment to which these
helpless prisoners were subjected need not be pursued. It is
sufficient to say that in pertinent respects the transcript reads
more like pages torn from some medieval account than a
record made within the confines of a modern civilization
which aspires to an enlightened constitutional government.

   "All this having been accomplished, on the next day, that
38 | BROWN V. MISSISSIPPI (1936)

is, on Monday, April 2, when the defendants had been given
time to recuperate somewhat from the tortures to which they
had been subjected, the two sheriffs, one of the county where
the crime was committed, and the other of the county of the
jail in which the prisoners were confined, came to the jail,
accompanied by eight other persons, some of them deputies,
there to hear the free and voluntary confession of these
miserable and abject defendants. The sheriff of the county of
the crime admitted that he had heard of the whipping but
averred that he had no personal knowledge of it. He admitted
that one of the defendants, when brought before him to
confess, was limping and did not sit down, and that this
particular defendant then and there stated that he had been
strapped so severely that he could not sit down, and, as already
stated, the signs of the rope on the neck of another of the
defendants were plainly visible to all. Nevertheless the solemn
farce of hearing the free and voluntary confessions was gone
through with, and these two sheriffs and one other person
then present were the three witnesses used in court to establish
the so-called confessions, which were received by the court and
admitted in evidence over the objections of the defendants
duly entered of record as each of the said three witnesses
delivered their alleged testimony. There was thus enough
before the court when these confessions were first offered to
make known to the court that they were not, beyond all
reasonable doubt, free and voluntary; and the failure of the
court then to exclude the confessions is sufficient to reverse the
                                               BROWN V. MISSISSIPPI (1936) | 39

judgment, under every rule of procedure that has heretofore
been prescribed, and hence it was not necessary subsequently
to renew the objections by motion or otherwise.

   "The spurious confessions having been obtained--and the
farce last mentioned having been gone through with on
Monday, April 2d--the court, then in session, on the
following day, Tuesday, April 3, 1934, ordered the grand jury
to reassemble on the succeeding day, April 4, 1934, at 9 o'clock,
and on the morning of the day last mentioned the grand jury
returned an indictment against the defendants for murder.
Late that afternoon the defendants were brought from the
jail in the adjoining county and arraigned, when one or more
of them offered to plead guilty, which the court declined to
accept, and, upon inquiry whether they had or desired counsel,
they stated that they had none, and did not suppose that
counsel could be of any assistance to them. The court
thereupon appointed counsel, and set the case for trial for
the following morning at 9 o'clock, and the defendants were
returned to the jail in the adjoining county about thirty miles
away.

   "The defendants were brought to the courthouse of the
county on the following morning, April 5th, and the so-called
trial was opened, and was concluded on the next day, April
6, 1934, and resulted in a pretended conviction with death
sentences. The evidence upon which the conviction was
obtained was the so-called confessions. Without this evidence,
a peremptory instruction to find for the defendants would
40 | BROWN V. MISSISSIPPI (1936)

have been inescapable. The defendants were put on the stand,
and by their testimony the facts and the details thereof as to
the manner by which the confessions were extorted from them
were fully developed, and it is further disclosed by the record
that the same deputy, Dial, under whose guiding hand and
active participation the tortures to coerce the confessions were
administered, was actively in the performance of the supposed
duties of a court deputy in the courthouse and in the presence
of the prisoners during what is denominated, in
complimentary terms, the trial of these defendants. This
deputy was put on the stand by the state in rebuttal, and
admitted the whippings. It is interesting to note that in his
testimony with reference to the whipping of the defendant
Ellington, and in response to the inquiry as to how severely he
was whipped, the deputy stated, `Not too much for a negro;
not as much as I would have done if it were left to me.' Two
others who had participated in these whippings were
introduced and admitted it--not a single witness was
introduced who denied it. The facts are not only undisputed,
they are admitted, and admitted to have been done by officers
of the state, in conjunction with other participants, and all
this was definitely well known to everybody connected with
the trial, and during the trial, including the state's prosecuting
attorney and the trial judge presiding."***

   The state is free to regulate the procedure of its courts in
accordance with its own conceptions of policy, unless in so
doing it "offends some principle of justice so rooted in the
                                               BROWN V. MISSISSIPPI (1936) | 41

traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as
fundamental." The state may abolish trial by jury.3 It may
dispense with indictment by a grand jury and substitute
complaint or information. But the freedom of the state in
establishing its policy is the freedom of constitutional
government and is limited by the requirement of due process
of law. Because a state may dispense with a jury trial, it does
not follow that it may substitute trial by ordeal. The rack and
torture chamber may not be substituted for the witness
stand.... It would be difficult to conceive of methods more
revolting to the sense of justice than those taken to procure the
confessions of these petitioners, and the use of the confessions
thus obtained as the basis for conviction and sentence was a
clear denial of due process.****

   In the instant case, the trial court was fully advised by the
undisputed evidence of the way in which the confessions had
been procured. The trial court knew that there was no other
evidence upon which conviction and sentence could be based.
Yet it proceeded to permit conviction and to pronounce
sentence. The conviction and sentence were void for want of
the essential elements of due process, and the proceeding thus
vitiated could be challenged in any appropriate manner. It was
challenged before the Supreme Court of the State by the
express invocation of the Fourteenth Amendment. That court
entertained the challenge, considered the federal question thus
presented, but declined to enforce petitioners' constitutional
right. The court thus denied a federal right fully established
42 | BROWN V. MISSISSIPPI (1936)

and specially set up and claimed, and the judgment must be
reversed.

Notes, Comments, and Questions

As noted in the footnote we added to the Brown opinion,
the Court included a statement about jury trials that is no
longer accurate.States are required to provide trial by jury for
crimes punishable by more than six months' imprisonment.
See Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U.S. 145 (1968). In 1936, the
Supreme Court had not yet "incorporated" many provisions
from the Bill of Rights against the states, meaning that the
states were free to ignore them. For purposes of this course,
students should presume that constitutional provisions apply
with equal force against the states and the federal government,
unless instructed otherwise. One key criminal procedure
provision not incorporated is the right to indictment by a
grand jury. See Hurtado v. California, 110 U.S. 516 (1884).
In Timbs v. Indiana, 139 S. Ct. 682 (2019), the Court
unanimously held that the Excessive Fines Clause of the
Eighth Amendment is incorporated against the states. This
continues the decades-long trend of incorporating the Bill of
Rights through the Fourteenth Amendment.

   Students may find one procedural aspect of Brown
particularly upsetting, in addition to the terrible conduct that
agents of the state committed against the defendants: After the
defendants were convicted, they appealed to the highest court
                                               BROWN V. MISSISSIPPI (1936) | 43

of their state, and the state court affirmed the convictions. Two
dissenting members of that court set forth at length the terrible
conduct--so carefully that the Supreme Court of the United
States would later cut and paste much of the dissent. Whatever
one's position on theories related to federalism, one cannot
avoid the conclusion that at least in this case, a state's justice
system was sorely in need of federal supervision. Throughout
this course, students will notice an ongoing debate about how
much Supreme Court oversight is necessary to protect
Americans from police officers, prosecutors, and judges
behaving badly. The Court's assessment has changed over
time, and justices serving together often disagree.
WHAT TO LOOK FOR
WHEN READING CASES

As the semester progresses, students will learn to answer two
key questions presented in every single criminal procedure
case: First, were someone's rights (usually constitutional
rights) violated? Second, if so, so what?

   Answering the first question requires knowledge of the
Supreme Court's decisions interpreting the Fourth, Fifth, and
Sixth Amendments to the Constitution, among other
provisions. For example, the Court has considered over several
cases--decided over several decades--what counts as a
"search" for purposes of the Fourth Amendment. It has
debated what the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth and
Fourteenth Amendments require of police officers conducting
interrogations. And it has weighed how to protect the right to
counsel guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment to all criminal
defendants.

   Answering the second question-- "So what?"--requires
knowledge of the remedies the Supreme Court has provided
for violations of the rights of criminal suspects and defendants.
For a defendant, the most desirable remedy is often the
exclusion of evidence obtained illegally. When the
"exclusionary rule" applies, evidence gained during an
                       WHAT TO LOOK FOR WHEN READING CASES | 45

unlawful search or interrogation, for example, may become
unavailable to prosecutors, which may lead to the dismissal of
criminal charges. The proper scope of the exclusionary rule
has been hotly debated for decades, and even its existence is
not taken for granted by everyone on the Supreme Court.
When exclusion of evidence is not available, the best remedy
may be money damages, although that remedy has its own
shortcomings. Students will learn the basics of when various
remedies are available for violations of criminal procedure
rules.

   In a sense, the rules governing searches, seizures,
interrogations, and so on can be considered the "substantive"
law of criminal procedure. These rules constitute the bulk of
most criminal procedure courses, and this one is no exception.
Questions in this category include: When do police need a
warrant? When must police give "Miranda warnings"? What
must states provide for criminal defendants too poor to hire a
lawyer?

   The remedies are what one might call the "procedural"
aspect of criminal procedure law. Questions in this category
include: If police executing a search warrant break down
someone's door without justification, can the homeowner
exclude evidence found during the ensuing search? Does the
answer change if the warrant was somehow defective? When
can prosecutors use confessions obtained in violation of the
Miranda Rule? The portion of assigned readings explicitly
devoted to remedies is far less than that given to "substantive"
46 | WHAT TO LOOK FOR WHEN READING CASES

criminal procedure rights. Keep in mind, however, that rights
without remedies are largely worthless,[1] and those students
who one day prosecute crimes or represent defendants will care
deeply about the practical consequences of Supreme Court
doctrine.

[1] Don't take our word for it. Sir John Holt, the Lord Chief
Justice of England, wrote in Ashby v. White (1703), "If the
plaintiff has a right, he must of necessity have a means to
vindicate and maintain it, and a remedy if he is injured in the
exercise or enjoyment of it; and indeed it is a vain thing to
imagine a right without a remedy; for want of right and want
of remedy are reciprocal." 14 St. Tr. 695, 92 Eng. Rep. 126,
136. Fans of Latin put it this way: "ubi jus ibi remedium."
THE SCOPE OF THE
CRIMINAL JUSTICE
SYSTEM

Before returning to the meat of criminal procedure law, let us
consider for a moment just how large and important a system
is being governed by nine Justices interpreting a handful of
ancient clauses.

   Beginning around 1970, the United States began a massive
increase in incarceration. Between 1980 and 2010, the
incarceration rate more than doubled. Despite a small drop in
incarceration over the past decade, as of early 2018 the United
States incarcerated about 2.3 million people, including
inmates at prisons, local jails, and juvenile facilities, among
other places. This chart (released to the public domain via
Wikimedia Commons) shows how the incarceration rate
(essentially, the number of inmates per 100,000 U.S. residents)
was relatively flat for decades through the 1960s, began rising
after 1970, and then increased rapidly after 1985. The rate has
decreased slightly over the past few years.
48 | THE SCOPE OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM

   Missouri's 2018 incarceration rate (859 per 100,000
residents) is higher than the U.S. as a whole (698) and is tenth-
highest among states. The states with the highest incarceration
rates in 2018 were Mississippi (1,039), Louisiana (1,052), and
Oklahoma (1,079). The states with the lowest rates were
Rhode Island (361), Vermont (328) and Massachusetts (324).
Even these states have higher incarceration rates than most
countries, including Turkey (287), Iran (284), South Africa
(280), Israel (265), New Zealand (220), Singapore (201),
Poland (199), Jamaica (138), Iraq (126), France (102), and
Ireland (81).[1] The overall U.S. rate exceeds every other
country in the world.

   The next chart (provided courtesy of The Sentencing
Project) shows the raw numbers of prisoners in America. Note
that this does not include inmates in jails or juvenile facilities.
                   THE SCOPE OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM | 49

   In Missouri, about 50,000 people are incarcerated, with
32,000 in state prisons, 11,000 in local jails, 5,600 in federal
prisons, and 1,000 in facilities for youths.[2] Nationwide, the
total prison and jail population as of December 31, 2016 was
2,162,400.[3] In addition, 4,537,100 persons were under
supervision--on parole or probation--creating a total
correctional system population of 6,613,500. Missouri's total
correctional population was 105,900.

   Because states house the overwhelming bulk of U.S.
prisoners, state budgets fund the overwhelming bulk of U.S.
correctional expenses. In 1985--just before the American
prison population began its sharp increase--states spent a
combined $6.7 billion on corrections. By 1990, the cost had
risen to $16.9 billion. It was $36.4 billion in 2000, $51.4 billion
in 2010, and $57.7 billion in 2016.[4]

   The next chart (provided courtesy of the Prison Policy
Initiative) shows where incarcerated women are housed and
what offenses led them to confinement.
50 | THE SCOPE OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM

   [The PPI also has a chart entitled "The Whole Pie," which
covers all incarcerated persons, male and female. Although we
lack permission to include the chart in this book, students may
(and should) find it online:https://www.prisonpolicy.org/
reports/pie2019.html.]

   The likelihood of imprisonment is not distributed evenly
among different groups of Americans. Women constitute
about half of the total U.S. population but only 7 percent of
the total prison population. Racial disparities are also stark.
In 2016, state and federal jails and prisons housed (out of a
total of 1,458,173 inmates) 486,900 black inmates (41 percent
of the total), 439,800 white inmates (39 percent of the total),
and 339,300 Hispanic inmates (17 percent of the total).[5]
According to Census data taken around the same time (July 1,
2017), 77 percent of Americans described themselves as white
alone (no other race), 13 percent as black or African American
alone, 3 percent as two or more races, and 18 percent as
Hispanic or Latino.[6] Although the demographic
                   THE SCOPE OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM | 51

definitions--particularly for deciding who counts as
Hispanic--used in various surveys are not always identical,
the results are clear. Black and Hispanic Americans are
significantly overrepresented among prisoners.

   Despite the high U.S. incarceration rate, most Americans
will never serve time. Instead, the majority of Americans
encounter the justice system through their interactions with
police officers. U.S. law enforcement agencies employ about
650,000 officers at the local, state, and federal level. That works
out to about one officer for every 500 Americans. In 2014,
officers performed about 11.2 million arrests. As was noted
for incarceration, arrest rates exhibit disparities by race and
sex. The 2014 arrests included 7,771,915 arrests of whites and
3,115,383 of blacks. About 3 million of the arrests were of
women, compared to 8.2 million arrests of men. Young men
are especially likely to be arrested.[7]

   When suspects are arrested and prosecuted, states often
provide legal counsel because the defendants otherwise could
not afford it. In Missouri, the fiscal year 2018 budget allocates
$46.3 million for the public defender system, which represents
about $7.13 per Missourian. The per capita expense on
indigent defense varies tremendously among states. For
example, in 2017 Wisconsin spent $86 million, or $14.83 per
resident. That same year Texas spent $37 million, or $1.31 per
resident.

A FEW RECENT CASES

A Few Recent Cases

We will return now to the discussion we set aside after reading
Brown v. Mississippi.

   "Yes, yes," one might say, "the criminal justice system is
important. As a nation we spend immense sums on police,
prosecution, and prisons. And back in 1934, some goons in
Mississippi abused criminal defendants, which required
intervention by the Supreme Court. What about today?"

   This is a fair question; otherwise, we would not have placed
it in the mouths of our hypothetical students. We expect that
by the end of the semester, few if any students will question
whether police and prosecutors still require judicial oversight.
The amount and proper form of that oversight will almost
surely remain contested--indeed, the Justices themselves
contest these issues every year--but the principle is likely to
win near unanimous assent. To assuage skepticism without
delay, however, we will present some evidence now.

   In 2013, the State of California freed Kash Delano Register,
whom the state had imprisoned for 34 years for a murder he
54 | A FEW RECENT CASES

did not commit.12 Mr. Register had been convicted on the
basis of false identification testimony, and the lawyers who
won his release produced proof that police and prosecutors
had concealed from Register's trial defense team evidence of
his innocence, including reports of eyewitnesses who would
have contradicted the testimony of prosecution witnesses,
along with evidence of how police had used threats of
unrelated criminal prosecution to pressure the witnesses
against Register. Absent the work of students and faculty at
Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, Register might remain
incarcerated today. Prosecutors opposed his release until 2013.
In 2016, the Los Angeles City Council approved a $16.7
million settlement payment to Register.13 The city has paid
tens of millions of dollars in other recent settlements related to
police conduct.14

   In 2012, the State of Missouri released George Allen, Jr.,
whom the state had imprisoned for 30 years for a St. Louis
rape and murder he did not commit.15 Although prosecutors
could not explain how Allen could have travelled from his
University City home to the murder scene--St. Louis was
paralyzed that day by a 20-inch snowstorm--a jury eventually
convicted Allen on the basis of his confession. Decades after
his conviction, new lawyers for Allen--from the Bryan Cave
law firm and the Innocence Project--produced evidence that
police had elicited a false confession from Allen, who was
mentally ill. Missouri courts found that prosecutors withheld
exculpatory evidence, including lab results, fingerprint
                                                       A FEW RECENT CASES | 55

records, and information about bizarre interrogation tactics
such as hypnosis of a key witness. Allen died in 2016, and
the City of St. Louis and Allen's family settled his civil rights
lawsuit in 2018 for $14 million.

   The National Registry of Exonerations, maintained by the
University of Michigan, lists 2,253 exonerations, representing
"more than 19,790 years lost."16 Because it covers only
exonerations, it does not include cases in which misconduct is
uncovered in time to prevent a wrongful conviction.

   In 2015, the Wall Street Journal reported that America's
"10 cities with the largest police departments paid out $248.7
million" in 2014 in settlements and court judgements in police
misconduct cases.17 Students should keep in mind that
because so much misconduct cannot be remedied through
monetary damages, numbers likes these understate the
problem.

   Chicago has settled several multi-million-dollar cases in
recent years. Examples include: "A one-time death row inmate
brutally beaten by police: $6.1 million. An unarmed man
fatally shot by an officer as he lay on the ground: $4.1
million."18 Another involved an officer who "posted messages
on his Facebook page falsely calling [a] teen a drug dealer and
criminal" and officers handcuffing this same teen without
cause. (Settlement around $500,000.) More recent cases
include "a police officer [who] pointed a gun at [the plaintiff's]
3-year-old daughter's chest during a 2013 raid of the family's
56 | A FEW RECENT CASES

Chicago home" and a man who spent about 20 years in prison
after being framed.19

   As the Baltimore Sun noted--in its 2014 report of how
the "city has paid about $5.7 million since 2011 over lawsuits
claiming that police officers brazenly beat up alleged
suspects"--the "perception that officers are violent can poison
the relationship between residents and police."20 The
newspaper observed:

   "Over ... four years, more than 100 people have won court
judgments or settlements related to allegations of brutality and
civil rights violations. Victims include a 15-year-old boy riding
a dirt bike, a 26-year-old pregnant accountant who had
witnessed a beating, a 50-year-old woman selling church raffle
tickets, a 65-year-old church deacon rolling a cigarette and an
87-year-old grandmother aiding her wounded grandson."

   In multiple jurisdictions, class action lawsuits about
unlawful strip searches have yielded large payments. In 2010,
the Cook County (Illinois) Board of Commissioners agreed
to a $55 million settlement with suspects stripped-searched
at Cook County Jail. New York City reached a $50 million
settlement in 2001 and another one for $33 million in 2010,
both related to searches in city jails such as Rikers Island.
Similar settlements (for smaller amounts) have been reached in
places such as Kern County, California; Burlington County,
New Jersey; and Washington, D.C.. Massachusetts officials
settled a suit concerning the Western Massachusetts Regional
Women's Correctional Center, agreeing to prohibit male
                                                       A FEW RECENT CASES | 57

guards from continuing their practice of videotaping the strip
searches of female inmates.

   Less sensational issues (nonetheless important to those
involved) include the ongoing debate over "stop-and-frisk"
tactics nationwide, in addition to racial profiling of motorists.
These practices affect persons whose involvement with the
criminal justice system might otherwise be fairly minimal. In
New York City, a federal court found that NYPD officers
violated the Fourth Amendment by performing unreasonable
searches and seizures and further found that police violated
the Equal Protection Clause of Fourteenth Amendment by
stopping and frisking New Yorkers in a racially discriminatory
manner.21 In Missouri, annual reports by the Attorney
General regularly find racial disparities in vehicle stops.22
According to the 2017 report, black motorists were far more
likely to be stopped, despite police finding contraband less
often when stopping black motorists than when stopping
white motorists. "African-Americans represent 10.9% of the
driving-age population but 18.7% of all traffic stops .... The
contraband hit rate for whites was 35.5%, compared with
32.9% for blacks and 27.9% for Hispanics. This means that,
on average, searches of African-Americans and Hispanics are
less likely than searches of whites to result in the discovery of
contraband."

   In sum, the incidence of police and prosecutorial
misconduct is not limited to dusty case files from the old
Confederacy.
58 | A FEW RECENT CASES

   Meanwhile, crime remains a serious problem, one America
has struggled with since colonial times. Since the 1800s, the
United States has had a much higher murder rate than
European countries otherwise similar to us in measures of
economic power and educational attainment. Then,
beginning around 1965, the U.S. homicide rate increased
dramatically.23 Although the increase was not uniform
(different decades saw different trends, and different locations
experienced trends differently), the United States as a whole
suffered a big increase in crime from the mid-1960s through
the early-1990s, with the nationwide homicide rate peaking at
around 10 per 100,000 persons. Since then, crime has dropped
significantly, returning over twenty years to what was observed
in the early 1960s.24 By 2000, the homicide rate had dropped
to around 5.5 per 100,000, which is close to the current rate.25
In other words, American crime rates remain well above those
of Western Europe, Canada, and Australia, but they are far
better than American rates of a generation ago. The sharp
increase in crime between the 1960s and 1990s may explain in
part the rapid increase in American incarceration, as politicians
offered "tough-on-crime" solutions. The causes of the huge
increase in crime beginning around 1965, as well as of the
subsequent decrease, are hotly disputed.26 In any event, crime
remains an important political and social issue in America.
Court decisions about how police may behave will be better
understood if given broader social context. For example,
judicial decisions that prevent the convictions of undisputedly
                                                       A FEW RECENT CASES | 59

guilty defendants may be unpopular among voters, and voters
elect the politicians who appoint and confirm Supreme Court
Justices. Further, Justices may recognize their relative lack of
expertise in the fields of policing and criminology, and they
may hesitate to mandate practices (or to prohibit practices)
without thoughtfully considering how their decisions could
affect ongoing national efforts to fight crime. The debate over
how much the Court should meddle in the affairs of police
departments is a thread that runs through the course material.

BARRON V. CITY OF
BALTIMORE (1833)

            Barron v. Baltimore, 32 U.S. 243 (1833)

   JOHN BARRON, survivor of
  JOHN CRAIG, for the use of
 LUKE TIERNAN, Executor of

           JOHN CRAIG,
                    v.

      The MAYOR and CITY
   COUNCIL OF BALTIMORE.

                        January Term, 1833

[Syllabus: clerk's summary of the case] ....Craig & Barron, of
whom the plaintiff was survivor, were owners of an extensive
and highly productive wharf, in the eastern section of
Baltimore, enjoying, at the period of their purchase of it, the
deepest water in the harbor. The city, in the asserted exercise
of its corporate authority over the harbor, the paving of streets,
and regulating grades for paving, and over the health of
64 | BARRON V. CITY OF BALTIMORE (1833)

Baltimore, diverted from their accustomed and natural course,
certain streams of water which flow from the range of hills
bordering the city, and diverted them, partly by adopting new
grades of streets, and partly by the necessary results of paving,
and partly by mounds, embankments and other artificial
means, purposely adapted to bend the course of the water to
the wharf in question. These streams becoming very full and
violent in rains, carried down with them from the hills and
the soil over which they ran, large masses of sand and earth,
which they deposited along, and widely in front of the wharf
of the plaintiff. The alleged consequence was, that the water
was rendered so shallow that it ceased to be useful for vessels of
an important burden, lost its income, and became of little or
no value as a wharf. ***

   ***On all points, the decision of Baltimore county court was
against the defendants, and a verdict for $4500 was rendered
for the plaintiff. An appeal was taken to the court of appeals,
which reversed the judgment of Baltimore county court, and
did not remand the case to that court for a further trial. From
this judgment, the defendant in the court of appeals
prosecuted a writ of error to this court. [32 U.S. 243, 245] ***

   [The plaintiff argues...]2. ...3. That this exercise of authority
[by Baltimore in its construction of roads] was repugnant to
the [C]onstitution of the United States, contravening the fifth
article of the amendments [i.e., 5th Amendment] to the
constitution, which declares that `private property shall not be
taken for public use, without just compensation;'.***
                                 BARRON V. CITY OF BALTIMORE (1833) | 65

   Chief Justice John MARSHALL, delivered the opinion of
the court.

   ***The plaintiff in error contends, that it comes within that
clause in the fifth amendment to the constitution, which
inhibits the taking of private property for public use, without
just compensation. He insists, that this amendment being in
favor of the liberty of the citizen, ought to be so construed as
to restrain the legislative power of a state, as well as that of the
United States. If this proposition be untrue, the court can take
no jurisdiction of the cause.

   The question thus presented is, we think, of great
importance, but not of much difficulty. The constitution was
ordained and established by the people of the United States
for themselves, for their own government, and not for the
government of the individual states. Each state established a
constitution for itself, and in that constitution, provided such
limitations and restrictions on the powers of its particular
government, as its judgment dictated. The people of the
United States framed such a government for the United States
as they supposed best adapted to their situation and best
calculated to promote their interests. The powers they
conferred on this government were to be exercised by itself;
and the limitations on power, if expressed in general terms,
are naturally, and, we think, necessarily, applicable to the
government created by the instrument. They are limitations
of power granted in the instrument itself; not of distinct
66 | BARRON V. CITY OF BALTIMORE (1833)

governments, framed by different persons and for different
purposes.

   If these propositions be correct, the fifth amendment must
be understood as restraining the power of the general
government, not as applicable to the states. In their several
constitutions, they have imposed such restrictions on their
respective governments, as their own wisdom suggested; such
as they deemed most proper for themselves. It is a subject on
which they judge exclusively, and with which others interfere
no further than they are supposed to have a common interest.

   ***

Had the people of the several states, or any of them, required
changes in their constitutions; had they required additional
safeguards to liberty from the apprehended encroachments of
their particular governments; the remedy was in their own
hands, and could have been applied by themselves. A
convention could have been assembled by the discontented
state, and the required improvements could have been made by
itself. The unwieldy and cumbrous machinery of procuring a
recommendation from two-thirds of congress, and the assent
of three-fourths of their sister states, could never have occurred
to any human being, as a mode of doing that which might
be effected by the state itself. Had the framers of these
amendments intended them to be limitations on the powers of
the state governments, they would have imitated the framers
of the original constitution, and have expressed that intention.
                                 BARRON V. CITY OF BALTIMORE (1833) | 67

Had congress engaged in the extraordinary occupation of
improving the constitutions of the several states, by affording
the people additional protection from the exercise of power
by their own governments, in matters which concerned
themselves alone, they would have declared this purpose in
plain and intelligible language.

   But it is universally understood, it is a part of the history
of the day, that the great revolution which established the
constitution of the United States, was not effected without
immense opposition. Serious fears were extensively
entertained, that those powers which the patriot statesmen,
who then watched over the interests of our country, deemed
essential to union, and to the attainment of those unvaluable
objects for which union was sought, might be exercised in a
manner dangerous to liberty. In almost every convention by
which the constitution was adopted, amendments to guard
against the abuse of power were recommended. These
amendments demanded security against the apprehended
encroachments of the general government-not against those of
the local governments. In compliance with a sentiment thus
generally expressed, to quiet fears thus extensively entertained,
amendments were proposed by the required majority in
congress, and adopted by the states. These amendments
contain no expression indicating an intention to apply them to
the state governments. This court cannot so apply them.

   We are of opinion, that the provision in the fifth
amendment to the constitution, declaring that private
68 | BARRON V. CITY OF BALTIMORE (1833)

property shall not be taken for public use, without just
compensation, is intended solely as a limitation on the exercise
of power by the government of the United States, and is not
applicable to the legislation of the states. ***

   NOTES: The decision in Barron v. Baltimore provided a
baseline understanding of the original purpose of the Bill of
Rights: to protect people against actions by the national
government alone, not actions by state and local governments.
The ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment after the Civil
War added new language that lawyers used to try to persuade
the Supreme Court that provisions of the Bill of Rights should
also provide protection against state and local governmental
actions. The Fourteenth Amendment was very clearly
intended to provide protection against states (and localities,
which are subdivisions of states) by saying: "No State shall...."
But the rights listed in the Amendment that are protected
against state action are not as specifid as many of the rights
listed in the Bill of Rights. Instead, they are vaguely stated
rights that require interpretation by judges: states must
respect the "privileges and immunities of citizenship"; "due
process of law" is required before states deprive anyone of "life,
liberty, or property"; and states must provide "equal
protection of the laws."

   In a series of individual cases filed throughout the 150- year
period following the ratification of the Fourteenth
Amendment, lawyers sought to convince the Supreme Court
that individual components within the Bill of Rights should
                                 BARRON V. CITY OF BALTIMORE (1833) | 69

also be protected from state infringement by considering these
individual rights as part of the "due process of law" to which
people are entitled. Not all of these claims were initially
successful, but over time most provisions of the Bill of Right
were "incorporated" into the Fourteenth Amendment for
application against state action. Thus, the process of
incorporating individual rights from the Bill of Rights into the
coverage of the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause
served to "nationalize" many constitutional rights so that they
apply everywhere within the country as protections against
actions by all levels of government.
HURTADO V.
CALIFORNIA (1884)

                       U.S. Supreme Court

Hurtado v. California, 110 U.S.
             516 (1884)

                          March 3, 1884
   [Syllabus: summary by clerk] The constitution of the state
of California adopted in 1879, in article 1, 8, provides as
follows: `Offenses heretofore required to be prosecuted by
indictment, shall be prosecuted by information, after
examination and commitment by a magistrate, or by
indictment, with or without such examination and
commitment, as may be prescribed by law. A grand jury shall
be drawn and summoned at least once a year in each
county.'***. Section 809 of the Penal Code is as follows:
`When a defendant has been examined and committed, as
provided in section 872 of this Code, it shall be the duty of
the district attorney, within thirty days thereafter, to file in the
superior court of the county in which the offense is triable, an
                                           HURTADO V. CALIFORNIA (1884) | 71

information charging the defendant with such offense. The
information shall [110 U.S. 516, 518] be in the name of the
people of the state of California, and subscribed by the
district attorney, and shall be in form like an indictment for
the same offense.'

   In pursuance of the foregoing provision of the
constitution, and of the several sections of the Penal Code of
California, the district attorney of Sacramento county, on the
twentieth day of February, 1882, made and filed an
information against the plaintiff in error, charging him with
the crime of murder in the killing of one Jose Antonio
Stuardo. Upon this information, and without any previous
investigation of the cause by any grand jury, the plaintiff in
error was arraigned on the twenty-second day of March, 1882,
and pleaded not guilty. A trial of the issue was thereafter had,
and on May 7, 1882, the jury rendered its verdict, in which it
found the plaintiff in error guilty of murder in the first degree.
On the fifth day of June, 1882, the superior court of
Sacramento county, in which the plaintiff in error had been
tried, rendered its judgment upon said verdict, that the said
Joseph Hurtado, plaintiff in error, be punished by the
infliction of death, and the day of his execution was fixed for
the twentieth day of July, 1882. From this judgment an appeal
was taken

   JUSTICE MATTHEWS (the opinion of the Court)
   It is claimed on behalf of the prisoner that the conviction
and sentence are void, on the ground that they are repugnant
72 | HURTADO V. CALIFORNIA (1884)

to that clause of the fourteenth article of amendment to the
constitution of the United States, which is in these words:
`Nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or
property without due process of law.' The proposition of law
we are asked to affirm is that an indictment or presentment by
a grand jury, as known to the common law of England, is
essential to that `due process of law,' when applied to
prosecutions for felonies, which is secured and guarantied by
this provision of the constitution of the United States, and
which accordingly it is forbidden to the states, respectively, to
dispense with in the administration of criminal law. The
question is one of grave and serious import, affecting both
private and public rights and interests of great magnitude, and
involves a consideration of what additional restrictions upon
the legislative policy of the states has been imposed by the
fourteenth amendment to the constitution of the United
States. ***

   [I]t is maintained on behalf of the plaintiff in error that the
phrase `due process of law' is equivalent to `law of the land,' as
found in the twenty-ninth chapter of Magna Charta; that by
immemorial usage it has acquired a fixed, definite, and
technical meaning; that it refers to and includes, not only the
general principles of public liberty and private right... it has
now been added as an additional security to the individual
against oppression by the states themselves; that one of these
institutions is that of the grand jury, an indictment or
presentment by which against the accused in cases of alleged
                                           HURTADO V. CALIFORNIA (1884) | 73

felonies is an essential part of due process of law, in order that
he may not be harassed and destroyed by prosecutions
founded only upon private malice or popular fury.

   ***The real syllabus of the passage quoted [from a prior
case] is that a process of law, which is not otherwise
forbidden, must be taken to be due process of law, if it can
show the sanction of settled usage both in England and in this
country; but it by no means follows, that nothing else can be
due process of law. The point in the case cited arose in
reference to a summary proceeding, questioned on that
account as not due process of law. The answer was, however
exceptional it may be, as tested by definitions and principles of
ordinary procedure, nevertheless, this, in substance, has been
immemorially the actual law of the land, and, therefore, is due
process of law. [110 U.S. 516, 529] But to hold that such a
characteristic is essential to due process of law, would be to
deny every quality of the law but its age, and to render it
incapable of progress or improvement. It would be to stamp
upon our jurisprudence the unchangeableness attributed to
the laws of the Medes and Persians.

   ***Tried by these principles, we are unable to say that the
substitution for a presentment or indictment by a grand jury
of the proceeding by information after examination and
commitment by a magistrate, certifying to the probable guilt
of the defendant, with the right on his part to the aid of
counsel, and to the cross-examination of the witnesses
produced for the prosecution, is not due process of law. It is,
74 | HURTADO V. CALIFORNIA (1884)

as we have seen, an ancient proceeding at common law, which
might include every case of an offense of less grade than a
felony, except misprision of treason; and in every
circumstance of its administration, as authorized by the
statute of California, it carefully considers and guards the
substantial interest of the prisoner. It is merely a preliminary
proceeding, and can result in no final judgment, except as the
consequence of a regular judicial trial, conducted precisely as
in cases of indictments. ***For these reasons, finding no error
therein, the judgment of the supreme court of California is
affirmed.

   JUSTICE JOHN HARLAN, dissenting.
   ***As I cannot agree that the state may, consistently, with
due process of law require a person to answer for a capital
offense, except upon the presentment or indictment of a
grand jury, and as human life is involved in the judgment
rendered here, I do not feel at liberty to withhold a statement
of the reasons for my dissent from the opinion of the court.
   ***[The authors of the 14th Amendment] perceived no
reason why, in respect of those rights, the same limitations
should not be imposed upon the general government that had
been imposed upon the states by their own constitutions.
Hence the prompt adoption of the original amendments, by
the fifth of which it is, among other things, provided that `no
person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without
due process of law.' This language is similar to that of the
clause of the fourteenth amendment now under examination.
                                           HURTADO V. CALIFORNIA (1884) | 75

That similarity was not accidental, but evinces a purpose to
impose upon the states the same restrictions, in respect of
proceedings involving life, liberty, and property, which had
been imposed upon the general government.

   `Due process of law,' within the meaning of the national
constitution, does not import one thing with reference to the
powers of the states and another with reference to the powers
of the general government. If particular proceedings,
conducted under the authority of the general government,
and involving life, are prohibited because not constituting
that due process of law required by the fifth amendment of
the constitution of the United States, similar proceedings,
conducted under the authority of a state, must be deemed
illegal, as not being due process of law within the meaning of
the fourteenth amendment. The words `due process of law,' in
the latter amendment, must receive the same interpretation
they had at the common law from which they were derived,
and which was given to them at the formation of the general
government. What was that interpretation? [110 U.S. 516,
542]  In seeking that meaning we are, fortunately, not left
without authoritative directions as to the source, and the only
source, from which the necessary information is to be
obtained.

   ***It is said by the court that the constitution of the United
States was made for an undefined and expanding future, and
that its requirement of due process of law, in proceedings
involving life, liberty, and property, must be so interpreted as
76 | HURTADO V. CALIFORNIA (1884)

not to deny to the law the capacity of progress and
improvement; that the greatest security for the fundamental
principles of justice resides in the right of the people to make
their own laws and alter them at pleasure. It is difficult,
however, to perceive anything in the system of prosecuting
human beings for their lives, by information, which suggests
that the state which adopts it has entered upon an era of
progress and improvement in the law of criminal procedure.
***

   NOTES: The Hurtado case provides an example of an
attorney trying to convince the Supreme Court to recognize
against the states the Fifth Amendment right to be indicted
by a grand jury by declaring that the grand jury right is part of
the Fourteenth Amendment right to due process, and
therefore applies to protect individuals in state court
proceedings. The Supreme Court majority did not agree.
However, Justice Harlan agreed and his dissenting opinion
argued that the intent of the Fourteenth Amendment was to
provide individuals with the same protection against state and
local actions that they enjoyed against federal actions.
Harlan's argument did not carry the day, but over the course
of more than ten decades, the Supreme Court gradually
included many rights from the Bill of Rights--but not all
rights--against state and local infringement.

   Beginning with Gitlow v. New York (1925), in which the
Supreme Court said that the First Amendment right to
freedom of speech is protected from state and local
                                           HURTADO V. CALIFORNIA (1884) | 77

infringement by the Fourteenth Amendment Due Process
Clause, the Court decided other First Amendment cases
similarly protecting free press and religious rights during the
1930s.
PALKO V. CONNECTICUT
(1937)

                       U.S. Supreme Court

      Palko v. Connecticut

                        302 U.S. 319 (1937)

JUSTICE BENJAMIN CARDOZO delivered the opinion of
the Court.

   A statute of Connecticut permitting appeals in criminal
cases to be taken by the state is challenged by appellant as
an infringement of the Fourteenth Amendment of the
Constitution of the United States. Whether the challenge
should be upheld is now to be determined.

   Appellant was indicted in Fairfield County, Connecticut,
for the crime of murder in the first degree. A jury found him
guilty of murder in the second degree, and he was sentenced to
confinement in the state prison for life. Thereafter, the State
of Connecticut, with the permission of the judge presiding at
                                            PALKO V. CONNECTICUT (1937) | 79

the trial, gave notice of appeal to the Supreme Court of Errors.
This it did pursuant to an act adopted in 1886. Upon such
appeal, the Supreme Court of Errors reversed the judgment
and ordered a new trial. State v. Palko,121 Conn. 669, 186 Atl.
657. It found that there had been error of law to the prejudice
of the state (1) in excluding testimony as to a confession by
defendant; (2) in excluding testimony upon cross-examination
of defendant to impeach his credibility, and (3) in the
instructions to the jury as to the difference between first and
second degree murder.

   Pursuant to the mandate of the Supreme Court of Errors,
defendant was brought to trial again. Before a jury was
impaneled and also at later stages of the case, he made the
objection that the effect of the new trial was to place him
twice in jeopardy for the same offense, and, in so doing, to
violate the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of
the United States. Upon the overruling of the objection, the
trial proceeded. The jury returned a verdict of murder in the
first degree, and the court sentenced the defendant to the
punishment of death. The Supreme Court of Errors affirmed
the judgment of conviction

   1. The execution of the sentence will not deprive appellant
of his life without the process of law assured to him by the
Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution.

   The argument for appellant is that whatever is forbidden
by the Fifth Amendment is forbidden by the Fourteenth also.
The Fifth Amendment, which is not directed to the states,
80 | PALKO V. CONNECTICUT (1937)

but solely to the federal government, creates immunity from
double jeopardy. No person shall be "subject for the same
offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb." The
Fourteenth Amendment ordains, "nor shall any State deprive
any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process
of law." To retry a defendant, though under one indictment
and only one, subjects him, it is said, to double jeopardy in
violation of the Fifth Amendment if the prosecution is one on
behalf of the United States. From this the consequence is said
to follow that there is a denial of life or liberty without due
process of law, if the prosecution is one on behalf of the People
of a State.

   We have said that, in appellant's view, the Fourteenth
Amendment is to be taken as embodying the prohibitions of
the Fifth. His thesis is even broader. Whatever would be a
violation of the original bill of rights (Amendments I to VIII)
if done by the federal government is now equally unlawful by
force of the Fourteenth Amendment if done by a state. There
is no such general rule.***

   The Fifth Amendment provides, among other things, that
no person shall be held to answer for a capital or otherwise
infamous crime unless on presentment or indictment of a
grand jury. This court has held that, in prosecutions by a state,
presentment or indictment by a grand jury may give way to
informations at the instance of a public officer. Hurtado v.
California,110 U. S. 516;Gaines v. Washington,277 U. S.
81,277 U. S. 86. The Fifth Amendment provides also that no
                                            PALKO V. CONNECTICUT (1937) | 81

person shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness
against himself. This court has said that, in prosecutions by
a state, the exemption will fail if the state elects to end
it.Twining v. New Jersey,211 U. S. 78,211 U. S. 106,211 U.
S. 111,211 U. S. 112.Cf. Snyder v. Massachusetts, supra,p.291
U. S. 105;Brown v. Mississippi,297 U. S. 278,297 U. S. 285.
The Sixth Amendment calls for a jury trial in criminal cases,
and the Seventh for a jury trial in civil cases at common law
where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars. This
court has ruled that consistently with those amendments trial
by jury may be modified by a state or abolished
altogether.Walker v. Sauvinet,92 U. S. 90;Maxwell v.
Dow,176 U. S. 581;New York Central R. Co. v. White,243 U.
S. 188,243 U. S. 208;Wagner Electric Mfg. Co. v. Lyndon,262
U. S. 226,262 U. S. 232. As to the Fourth Amendment, one
should refer toWeeks v. United States,232 U. S. 383,232 U.
S. 398, and, as to other provisions of the Sixth, toWest v.
Louisiana,194 U. S. 258.

   On the other hand, the due process clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment may make it unlawful for a state to abridge by
its statutes the freedom of speech which the First Amendment
safeguards against encroachment by the Congress,De Jonge v.
Oregon,299 U. S. 353,299 U. S. 364;Herndon v. Lowry,301 U.
S. 242,301 U. S. 259; or the like freedom of the press,Grosjean
v. American Press Co.,297 U. S. 233;Near v. Minnesota ex
rel. Olson,283 U. S. 697,283 U. S. 707; or the free exercise of
religion,Hamilton v. Regents,293 U. S. 245,293 U. S. 262;cf.
82 | PALKO V. CONNECTICUT (1937)

Grosjean v. American Press Co., supra; Pierce v. Society of
Sisters,268 U. S. 510; or the right of peaceable assembly,
without which speech would be unduly trammeled,De Jonge
v. Oregon, supra; Herndon v. Lowry, supra;or the right of one
accused of crime to the benefit of counsel,Powell v.
Alabama,287 U. S. 45. In these and other situations,
immunities that are valid as against the federal government by
force of the specific pledges of particular amendments have
been found to be implicit in the concept of ordered liberty,
and thus, through the Fourteenth Amendment, become valid
as against the states.

   The line of division may seem to be wavering and broken
if there is a hasty catalogue of the cases on the one side and
the other. Reflection and analysis will induce a different view.
There emerges the perception of a rationalizing principle
which gives to discrete instances a proper order and coherence.
The right to trial by jury and the immunity from prosecution
except as the result of an indictment may have value and
importance. Even so, they are not of the very essence of a
scheme of ordered liberty. To abolish them is not to violate a
"principle of justice so rooted in the traditions and conscience
of our people as to be ranked as fundamental.".... Few would
be so narrow or provincial as to maintain that a fair and
enlightened system of justice would be impossible without
them. What is true of jury trials and indictments is true also,
as the cases show, of the immunity from compulsory self-
incrimination.Twining v. New Jersey, supra.This too might be
                                            PALKO V. CONNECTICUT (1937) | 83

lost, and justice still be done. Indeed, today, as in the past,
there are students of our penal system who look upon the
immunity as a mischief, rather than a benefit, and who would
limit its scope, or destroy it altogether. [Footnote 3] No doubt
there would remain the need to give protection against torture,
physical or mental.Brown v. Mississippi, supra.Justice,
however, would not perish if the accused were subject to a
duty to respond to orderly inquiry. The exclusion of these
immunities and privileges from the privileges and immunities
protected against the action of the states has not been arbitrary
or casual. It has been dictated by a study and appreciation of
the meaning, the essential implications, of liberty itself.

   We reach a different plane of social and moral values when
we pass to the privileges and immunities that have been taken
over from the earlier articles of the federal bill of rights and
brought within the Fourteenth Amendment by a process of
absorption. These, in their origin, were effective against the
federal government alone. If the Fourteenth Amendment has
absorbed them, the process of absorption has had its source
in the belief that neither liberty nor Justice would exist if they
were sacrificed.... This is true, for illustration, of freedom of
thought, and speech.

   ***Our survey of the cases serves, we think, to justify the
statement that the dividing line between them, if not
unfaltering throughout its course, has been true for the most
part to a unifying principle. On which side of the line the
case made out by the appellant has appropriate location must
84 | PALKO V. CONNECTICUT (1937)

be the next inquiry, and the final one. Is that kind of double
jeopardy to which the statute has subjected him a hardship so
acute and shocking that our polity will not endure it? Does
it violate those "fundamental principles of liberty and justice
which lie at the base of all our civil and political institutions"?
Hebert v. Louisiana, supra.The answer surely must be "no."
What the answer would have to be if the state were permitted
after a trial free from error to try the accused over again or
to bring another case against him, we have no occasion to
consider. We deal with the statute before us, and no other. The
state is not attempting to wear the accused out by a multitude
of cases with accumulated trials. It asks no more than this,
that the case against him shall go on until there shall be a trial
free from the corrosion of substantial legal error.... This is not
cruelty at all, nor even vexation in any immoderate degree. If
the trial had been infected with error adverse to the accused,
there might have been review at his instance, and as often
as necessary to purge the vicious taint. A reciprocal privilege,
subject at all times to the discretion of the presiding
judge,State v. Carabetta,106 Conn. 114, 127 Atl. 394, has
now been granted to the state. There is here no seismic
innovation. The edifice of justice stands, its symmetry, to
many, greater than before.***

   The judgment is
   Affirmed.
   MR. JUSTICE BUTLER dissents. (Justice Butler merely
noted that he "dissents"--meaning he disagreed with the
                                            PALKO V. CONNECTICUT (1937) | 85

majority's decision. But he did not write an opinion to explain
the reasons for his disagreement with the majority opinion)

   NOTES: In Palko v. Connecticut, Justice Cardozo put
forward a "test" so that judges can know which rights in the
Bill of Rights apply against the states and which rights in the
Bill of Rights only apply against the federal government. As
indicated by Cardozo, the rights that apply against the states
are "of the very essence of a scheme of ordered liberty...[;]
[the rights that embody] a `principle of justice so rooted in
the traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked
as fundamental.'" Obviously, this "test" is not easy to apply.
It directs judges to decide if certain rights are "fundamental"
and essential to a society that protects liberty. Cardozo's test
was very influential and justices made reference to it in their
opinions for decades after the Palko decision. (But not all
justices agreed that this was the proper test for deciding which
rights to incorporate and apply throughout the nation against
states and localities.)
ADAMSON V.
CALIFORNIA (1947)

           Adamson v. California, 332 U.S. 46 (1947)

APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME
     COURT OF CALIFORNIA

MR. JUSTICE REED delivered the opinion of the Court.
   The appellant, Adamson, a citizen of the United States,

was convicted, without recommendation for mercy, by a jury
in a Superior Court of the State of California of murder in
the first degree. After considering the same objections to the
conviction that are pressed here, the sentence of death was
affirmed by the Supreme Court of the state.27 Cal. 2d 478,
165 P.2d 3. Review of that judgment by this Court was sought
and allowed under Judicial Code § 237; 28 U.S.C. § 344. The
provisions of California law which were challenged in the state
proceedings as invalid under the Fourteenth Amendment to
the Federal Constitution are those of the state constitution
and penal code in the margin. They permit the failure of a
defendant to explain or to deny evidence against him to be
                                          ADAMSON V. CALIFORNIA (1947) | 87

commented upon by court and by counsel, and to be
considered by court and jury. The defendant did not testify. As
the trial court gave its instructions and the District Attorney
argued the case in accordance with the constitutional and
statutory provisions just referred to, we have for decision the
question of their constitutionality in these circumstances
under the limitations of § 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment.

   The appellant was charged in the information with former
convictions for burglary, larceny and robbery and pursuant to
§ 1025, California Penal Code, answered that he had suffered
the previous convictions. This answer barred allusion to these
charges of convictions on the trial. Under California's
interpretation of § 1025 of the Penal Code and § 2051 of
the Code of Civil Procedure, however, if the defendant, after
answering affirmatively charges alleging prior convictions,
takes the witness stand to deny or explain away other evidence
that has been introduced, "the commission of these crimes
could have been revealed to the jury on cross-examination to
impeach his testimony."... This forces an accused who is a
repeated offender to choose between the risk of having his
prior offenses disclosed to the jury or of having it draw harmful
inferences from uncontradicted evidence that can only be
denied or explained by the defendant.

   In the first place, appellant urges that the provision of the
Fifth Amendment that no person "shall be compelled in any
criminal case to be a witness against himself" is a fundamental
national privilege or immunity protected against state
88 | ADAMSON V. CALIFORNIA (1947)

abridgment by the Fourteenth Amendment or a privilege or
immunity secured, through the Fourteenth Amendment,
against deprivation by state action because it is a personal right,
enumerated in the federal Bill of Rights.

   We shall assume, but without any intention thereby of
ruling upon the issue, that permission by law to the court,
counsel and jury to comment upon and consider the failure of
defendant "to explain or to deny by his testimony any evidence
or facts in the case against him" would infringe defendant's
privilege against self-incrimination under the Fifth
Amendment if this were a trial in a court of the United States
under a similar law. Such an assumption does not determine
appellant's rights under the Fourteenth Amendment. It is
settled law that the clause of the Fifth Amendment, protecting
a person against being compelled to be a witness against
himself, is not made effective by the Fourteenth Amendment
as a protection against state action on the ground that freedom
from testimonial compulsion is a right of national citizenship,
or because it is a personal privilege or immunity secured by the
Federal Constitution as one of the rights of man that are listed
in the Bill of Rights.

   The reasoning that leads to those conclusions starts with the
unquestioned premise that the Bill of Rights, when adopted,
was for the protection of the individual against the federal
government, and its provisions were inapplicable to similar
actions done by the states.Barron v. Baltimore,7 Pet. 243... ***

   ***Nothing has been called to our attention that either the
                                          ADAMSON V. CALIFORNIA (1947) | 89

framers of the Fourteenth Amendment or the states that
adopted intended its due process clause to draw within its
scope the earlier amendments to the Constitution.Palkoheld
that such provisions of the Bill of Rights as were "implicit in
the concept of ordered liberty," p.302 U. S. 325, became secure
from state interference by the clause. But it held nothing
more.

   Specifically, the due process clause does not protect, by
virtue of its mere existence, the accused's freedom from giving
testimony by compulsion in state trials that is secured to him
against federal interference by the Fifth Amendment.Twining
v. New Jersey,211 U. S. 78,211 U. S. 99-114;Palko v.
Connecticut, supra,p.302 U. S. 323. ***

   We find no other error that gives ground for our
intervention in California's administration of criminal justice.

   Affirmed.
   MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, concurring.
   Less than ten years ago, Mr. Justice Cardozo announced as
settled constitutional law that, while the Fifth Amendment,
"which is not directed to the states, but solely to the federal
government," provides that no person shall be compelled in
any criminal case to be a witness against himself, the process of
law assured by the Fourteenth Amendment does not require
such immunity from self-crimination: "in prosecutions by a
state, the exemption will fail if the state elects to end it."Palko
v. Connecticut,302 U. S. 319,302 U. S. 322,302 U. S. 324.
Mr. Justice Cardozo spoke for the Court, consisting of Mr.
90 | ADAMSON V. CALIFORNIA (1947)

Chief Justice Hughes, and McReynolds, Brandeis, Sutherland,
Stone, Roberts, Black, JJ. (Mr. Justice Butler dissented.) The
matter no longer called for discussion; a reference toTwining
v. New Jersey,211 U. S. 78, decided thirty years before
thePalkocase, sufficed.

   Decisions of this Court do not have equal intrinsic
authority. TheTwiningcase shows the judicial process at its
best -- comprehensive briefs and powerful arguments on both
sides, followed by long deliberation, resulting in an opinion by
Mr. Justice Moody which at once gained and has ever since
retained recognition as one of the outstanding opinions in the
history of the Court. After enjoying unquestioned prestige
for forty years, theTwining case should not now be diluted,
even unwittingly, either in its judicial philosophy or in its
particulars. As the surest way of keeping theTwiningcase
intact, I would affirm this case on its authority.

   ***Between the incorporation of the Fourteenth
Amendment into the Constitution and the beginning of the
present membership of the Court -- a period of seventy years
-- the scope of that Amendment was passed upon by forty-
three judges. Of all these judges, only one, who may
respectfully be called an eccentric exception, ever indicated the
belief that the Fourteenth Amendment was a shorthand
summary of the first eight Amendments theretofore limiting
only the Federal Government, and that due process
incorporated those eight Amendments as restrictions upon the
powers of the States. Among these judges were not only those
                                          ADAMSON V. CALIFORNIA (1947) | 91

who would have to be included among the greatest in the
history of the Court, but -- it is especially relevant to note
-- they included those whose services in the cause of human
rights and the spirit of freedom are the most conspicuous in
our history. It is not invidious to single out Miller, Davis,
Bradley, Waite, Matthews, Gray, Fuller, Holmes, Brandeis,
Stone and Cardozo (to speak only of the dead) as judges who
were alert in safeguarding and promoting the interests of
liberty and human dignity through law. But they were also
judges mindful of the relation of our federal system to a
progressively democratic society, and therefore duly regardful
of the scope of authority that was left to the States even after
the Civil War. And so they did not find that the Fourteenth
Amendment, concerned as it was with matters fundamental
to the pursuit of justice, fastened upon the States procedural
arrangements which, in the language of Mr. Justice Cardozo,
only those who are "narrow or provincial" would deem
essential to "a fair and enlightened system of justice."Palko v.
Connecticut,302 U. S. 319,302 U. S. 325. To suggest that it
is inconsistent with a truly free society to begin prosecutions
without an indictment, to try petty civil cases without the
paraphernalia of a common law jury, to take into consideration
that one who has full opportunity to make a defense remains
silent is, in de Tocqueville's phrase, to confound the familiar
with the necessary.

   The short answer to the suggestion that the provision of the
Fourteenth Amendment, which ordains "nor shall any State
92 | ADAMSON V. CALIFORNIA (1947)

deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due
process of law," was a way of saying that every State must
thereafter initiate prosecutions through indictment by a grand
jury, must have a trial by a jury of twelve in criminal cases,
and must have trial by such a jury in common law suits where
the amount in controversy exceeds twenty dollars, is that it is
a strange way of saying it. It would be extraordinarily strange
for a Constitution to convey such specific commands in such a
roundabout and inexplicit way. ***

   MR. JUSTICE BLACK, dissenting.
   The appellant was tried for murder in a California state
court. He did not take the stand as a witness in his own behalf.
The prosecuting attorney, under purported authority of a
California statute, Cal.Penal Code, § 1323 (Hillyer-Lake,
1945), argued to the jury that an inference of guilt could be
drawn because of appellant's failure to deny evidence offered
against him. The appellant's contention in the state court and
here has been that the statute denies him a right guaranteed by
the Federal Constitution. The argument is that (1) permitting
comment upon his failure testify has the effect of compelling
him to testify, so as to violate that provision of the Bill of
Rights contained in the Fifth Amendment that "No person
. . . shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness
against himself", and (2) although this provision of the Fifth
Amendment originally applied only as a restraint upon federal
courts,Barron v. Baltimore,7 Pet. 243, the Fourteenth
                                          ADAMSON V. CALIFORNIA (1947) | 93

Amendment was intended to, and did, make the prohibition
against compelled testimony applicable to trials in state courts.

   ***The first ten amendments were proposed and adopted
largely because of fear that Government might unduly
interfere with prized individual liberties. The people wanted
and demanded a Bill of Rights written into their Constitution.
***

   My study of the historical events that culminated in the
Fourteenth Amendment, and the expressions of those who
sponsored and favored, as well as those who opposed, its
submission and passage persuades me that one of the chief
objects that the provisions of the Amendment's first section,
separately and as a whole, were intended to accomplish was
to make the Bill of Rights, applicable to the states. With full
knowledge of the import of theBarrondecision, the framers
and backers of the Fourteenth Amendment proclaimed its
purpose to be to overturn the constitutional rule that case
had announced. This historical purpose has never received full
consideration or exposition in any opinion of this Court
interpreting the Amendment.***

   MR. JUSTICE MURPHY, with whom MR. JUSTICE
RUTLEDGE concurs, dissenting.

   While in substantial agreement with the views of MR.
JUSTICE BLACK, I have one reservation and one addition to
make.

   I agree that the specific guarantees of the Bill of Rights
should be carried over intact into the first section of the
94 | ADAMSON V. CALIFORNIA (1947)

Fourteenth Amendment. But I am not prepared to say that the
latter is entirely and necessarily limited by the Bill of Rights.
Occasions may arise where a proceeding falls so far short of
conforming to fundamental standards of procedure as to
warrant constitutional condemnation in terms of a lack of due
process despite the absence of a specific provision in the Bill of
Rights.***

   NOTES: A decade after the Palko decision, the Adamson
case shows the majority using the Palko test to reject a claim
that the Fifth Amendment protection against compelled self-
incrimination should be applicable to the states through the
Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Clause. The Adamson
opinions are interesting because Justice Black argues in dissent
that the Fourteenth Amendment was intended to apply the
entire Bill of Rights to the states. And Justice Murphy's
dissent, while endorsing Black's view, also argues that there
could be other rights not listed in the Bill of Rights that also
apply to the states through the Due Process Clause. Justice
Frankfurter wrote his concurring opinion specifically to reject
the dissenters' argument that the entire Bill of Rights should
be incorporated in the Due Process Clause and applied to the
states.
DUNCAN V. LOUISIANA
(1968)

           Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U.S. 145 (1968)

APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME
     COURT OF LOUISIANA.

MR. JUSTICE WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.
   Appellant, Gary Duncan, was convicted of simple battery in

the Twenty-fifth Judicial District Court of Louisiana. Under
Louisiana law, simple battery is a misdemeanor, punishable
by a maximum of two years' imprisonment and a $300 fine.
Appellant sought trial by jury, but, because the Louisiana
Constitution grants jury trials only in cases in which capital
punishment or imprisonment at hard labor may be imposed,
the trial judge denied the request. Appellant was convicted
and sentenced to serve 60 days in the parish prison and pay
a fine of $10. Appellant sought review in the Supreme Court
of Louisiana, asserting that the denial of jury trial violated
rights guaranteed to him by the United States Constitution.
The Supreme Court, finding "[n]o error of law in the ruling
96 | DUNCAN V. LOUISIANA (1968)

complained of," denied appellant a writ of certiorari. Pursuant
to 28 U.S.C.§ 1257(2) appellant sought review in this Court,
alleging that the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the
United States Constitution secure the right to jury trial in state
criminal prosecutions where a sentence as long as two years
may be imposed. ...

   Appellant was 19 years of age when tried. While driving
on Highway 23 in Plaquemines Parish on October 18, 1966,
he saw two younger cousins engaged in a conversation by the
side of the road with four white boys. Knowing his cousins,
Negroes who had recently transferred to a formerly all-white
high school, had reported the occurrence of racial incidents at
the school, Duncan stopped the car, got out, and approached
the six boys. At trial, the white boys and a white onlooker
testified, as did appellant and his cousins. The testimony was
in dispute on many points, but the witnesses agreed that
appellant and the white boys spoke to each other, that
appellant encouraged his cousins to break off the encounter
and enter his car, and that appellant was about to enter the car
himself for the purpose of driving away with his cousins. The
whites testified that, just before getting in the car, appellant
slapped Herman Landry, one of the white boys, on the elbow.
The Negroes testified that appellant had not slapped Landry,
but had merely touched him. The trial judge concluded that
the State had proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Duncan
had committed simple battery, and found him guilty.
                                              DUNCAN V. LOUISIANA (1968) | 97

                       I

The Fourteenth Amendment denies the States the power to
"deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due
process of law." In resolving conflicting claims concerning the
meaning of this spacious language, the Court has looked
increasingly to the Bill of Rights for guidance; many of the
rights guaranteed by the first eight Amendments to the
Constitution have been held to be protected against state
action by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment. That clause now protects the right to
compensation for property taken by the State; the rights of
speech, press, and religion covered by the First Amendment;
the Fourth Amendment rights to be free from unreasonable
searches and seizures and to have excluded from criminal trials
any evidence illegally seized;] the right guaranteed by the Fifth
Amendment to be free of compelled self-incrimination; and
the Sixth Amendment rights to counsel, to a speedy and public
trial, to confrontation of opposing witnesses, and to
compulsory process for obtaining witnesses.

   The test for determining whether a right extended by the
Fifth and Sixth Amendments with respect to federal criminal
proceedings is also protected against state action by the
Fourteenth Amendment has been phrased in a variety of ways
in the opinions of this Court. The question has been asked
whether a right is among those "fundamental principles of
liberty and justice which lie at the base of all our civil and
98 | DUNCAN V. LOUISIANA (1968)

political institutions,'"Powell v. Alabama,287 U. S. 45,287 U.
S. 67(1932); whether it is "basic in our system of
jurisprudence,"In re Oliver,333 U. S. 257,333 U. S. 273(1948),
and whether it is "a fundamental right, essential to a fair
trial,"Gideon v. Wainwright,372 U. S. 335,372 U. S. 343-344
(1963);Malloy v. Hogan,378 U. S. 1,378 U. S. 6(1964);Pointer
v. Texas,380 U. S. 400,380 U. S. 403(1965). The claim before
us is that the right to trial by jury guaranteed by the Sixth
Amendment meets these tests. The position of Louisiana, on the
other hand, is that the Constitution imposes upon the States no
duty to give a jury trial in any criminal case, regardless of the
seriousness of the crime or the size of the punishment which may
be imposed. Because we believe that trial by jury in criminal cases
is fundamental to the American scheme of justice, we hold that
the Fourteenth Amendment guarantees a right of jury trial in
all criminal cases which -- were they to be tried in a federal court
-- would come within the Sixth Amendment's guarantee. Since
we consider the appeal before us to be such a case, we hold that
the Constitution was violated when appellant's demand for jury
trial was refused.

   The history of trial by jury in criminal cases has been
frequently told. [Footnote 15] It is sufficient for present
purposes to say that, by the time our Constitution was written,
jury trial in criminal cases had been in existence in England for
several centuries and carried impressive credentials traced by
many to Magna Carta***

   Jury trial came to America with English' colonists, and
                                             DUNCAN V. LOUISIANA (1968) | 99

received strong support from them. Royal interference with
the jury trial was deeply resented. Among the resolutions
adopted by the First Congress of the American Colonies (the
Stamp Act Congress) on October 19, 1765 -- resolutions
deemed by their authors to state "the most essential rights and
liberties of the colonists" -- was the declaration:

   "That trial by jury is the inherent and invaluable right of
every British subject in these colonies."

   ***The Declaration of Independence stated solemn
objections to the King's making "Judges dependent on his
Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount
and payment of their salaries," to his "depriving us in many
cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury," and to his "transporting
us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offenses." The
Constitution itself, in Art. III, § 2, commanded:

   "The Trial of all Crimes. except in Cases of Impeachment,
shall be by Jury, and such Trial shall be held in the State where
the said Crimes shall have been committed."

   Objections to the Constitution because of the absence of
a bill of rights were met by the immediate submission and
adoption of the Bill of Rights. Included was the Sixth
Amendment which, among other things, provided:

   "In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the
right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the
State and district wherein the crime shall have been
committed."

   The constitutions adopted by the original States guaranteed
100 | DUNCAN V. LOUISIANA (1968)

jury trial. Also, the constitution of every State entering the
Union thereafter in one form or another protected the right to
jury trial in criminal cases.

   Even such skeletal history is impressive support for
considering the right to jury trial in criminal cases to be
fundamental to our system of justice, an importance
frequently recognized in the opinions of this Court. ***

   Jury trial continues to receive strong support. The laws of
every State guarantee a right to jury trial in serious criminal
cases; no State has dispensed with it; nor are there significant
movements underway to do so. Indeed, the three most recent
state constitutional revisions, in Maryland, Michigan, and
New York, carefully preserved the right of the accused to have
the judgment of a jury when tried for a serious crime.

   ***The guarantees of jury trial in the Federal and State
Constitutions reflect a profound judgment about the way in
which law should be enforced and justice administered. A
right to jury trial is granted to criminal defendants in order to
prevent oppression by the Government.

   Those who wrote our constitutions knew from history and
experience that it was necessary to protect against unfounded
criminal charges brought to eliminate enemies and against
judges too responsive to the voice of higher authority. The
framers of the constitutions strove to create an independent
judiciary, but insisted upon further protection against
arbitrary action. Providing an accused with the right to be
tried by a jury of his peers gave him an inestimable safeguard
                                             DUNCAN V. LOUISIANA (1968) | 101

against the corrupt or overzealous prosecutor and against the
compliant, biased, or eccentric judge. If the defendant
preferred the common sense judgment of a jury to the more
tutored but perhaps less sympathetic reaction of the single
judge, he was to have it. Beyond this, the jury trial provisions
in the Federal and State Constitutions reflect a fundamental
decision about the exercise of official power -- a reluctance to
entrust plenary powers over the life and liberty of the citizen to
one judge or to a group of judges. Fear of unchecked power, so
typical of our State and Federal Governments in other respects,
found expression in the criminal law in this insistence upon
community participation in the determination of guilt or
innocence. The deep commitment of the Nation to the right
of jury trial in serious criminal cases as a defense against
arbitrary law enforcement qualifies for protection under the
Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and must
therefore be respected by the States.***

   ***The State of Louisiana urges that holding that the
Fourteenth Amendment assures a right to jury trial will cast
doubt on the integrity of every trial conducted without a jury.
Plainly, this is not the import of our holding. Our conclusion
is that, in the American States, as in the federal judicial system,
a general grant of jury trial for serious offenses is a fundamental
right, essential for preventing miscarriages of justice and for
assuring that fair trials are provided for all defendants. We
would not assert, however, that every criminal trial -- or any
particular trial -- held before a judge alone is unfair or that
102 | DUNCAN V. LOUISIANA (1968)

a defendant may never be as fairly treated by a judge as he
would be by a jury. Thus, we hold no constitutional doubts
about the practices, common in both federal and state courts,
of accepting waivers of jury trial and prosecuting petty crimes
without extending a right to jury trial. However, the fact is
that, in most places, more trials for serious crimes are to juries
than to a court alone; a great many defendants prefer the
judgment of a jury to that of a court. Even where defendants
are satisfied with bench trials, the right to a jury trial very likely
serves its intended purpose of making judicial or prosecutorial
unfairness less likely.***

   [Footnote 14] (Other footnotes have been edited out of the
case but this is an important footnote that explains the test Justice
White used to support his conclusion)

   In one sense, recent cases applying provisions of the first
eight Amendments to the States represent a new approach to
the "incorporation" debate. Earlier the Court can be seen as
having asked, when inquiring into whether some particular
procedural safeguard was required of a State, if a civilized
system could be imagined that would not accord the particular
protection. For example,Palko v. Connecticut,302 U. S.
319,302 U. S. 325(1937), stated:

   "The right to trial by jury and the immunity from
prosecution except as the result of an indictment may have
value and importance. Even so, they are not of the very essence
of a scheme of ordered liberty. . . . Few would be so narrow or
                                            DUNCAN V. LOUISIANA (1968) | 103

provincial as to maintain that a fair and enlightened system of
justice would be impossible without them."

   The recent cases, on the other hand, have proceeded upon
the valid assumption that state criminal processes are not
imaginary and theoretical schemes but actual systems bearing
virtually every characteristic of the common law system that
has been developing contemporaneously in England and in
this country. The question thus is whether given this kind of
system a particular procedure is fundamental -- whether, that
is, a procedure is necessary to an Anglo-American regime of
ordered liberty. It is this sort of inquiry that can justify the
conclusions that state courts must exclude evidence seized in
violation of the Fourth Amendment,Mapp v. Ohio,367 U.
S. 643(1961); that state prosecutors may not comment on a
defendant's failure to testify,Griffin v. California,380 U. S.
609(1965), and that criminal punishment may not be imposed
for the status of narcotics addiction,Robinson v.
California,370 U. S. 660(1962). Of immediate relevance for
this case are the Court's holdings that the States must comply
with certain provisions of the Sixth Amendment, specifically
that the States may not refuse a speedy trial, confrontation
of witnesses, and the assistance, at state expense if necessary,
of counsel.See cases cited in nn.8-12supra.Of each of these
determinations that a constitutional provision originally
written to bind the Federal Government should bind the
States as well it might be said that the limitation in question
is not necessarily fundamental to fairness in every criminal
104 | DUNCAN V. LOUISIANA (1968)

system that might be imagined but is fundamental in the
context of the criminal processes maintained by the American
States.

   When the inquiry is approached in this way the question
whether the States can impose criminal punishment without
granting a jury trial appears quite different from the way it
appeared in the older cases opining that States might abolish
jury trial.See, e.g., Maxwell v. Dow,176 U. S. 581(1900). A
criminal process which was fair and equitable but used no
juries is easy to imagine. It would make use of alternative
guarantees and protections which would serve the purposes
that the jury serves in the English and American systems. Yet
no American State has undertaken to construct such a system.
Instead, every American State, including Louisiana, uses the
jury extensively, and imposes very serious punishments only
after a trial at which the defendant has a right to a jury's
verdict. In every State, including Louisiana, the structure and
style of the criminal process -- the supporting framework and
the subsidiary procedures -- are of the sort that naturally
complement jury trial, and have developed in connection with
and in reliance upon jury trial.

   MR. JUSTICE BLACK, with whom MR. JUSTICE
DOUGLAS joins, concurring.

   The Court today holds that the right to trial by jury
guaranteed defendants in criminal cases in federal courts by
Art. III of the United States Constitution and by the Sixth
Amendment is also guaranteed by the Fourteenth
                                            DUNCAN V. LOUISIANA (1968) | 105

Amendment to defendants tried in state courts. With this
holding I agree for reasons given by the Court. I also agree
because of reasons given in my dissent inAdamson v.
California,332 U. S. 46,332 U. S. 68. In that dissent, at332 U.
S. 90, I took the position, contrary to the holding inTwining
v. New Jersey,211 U. S. 78, that the Fourteenth Amendment
made all of the provisions of the Bill of Rights applicable to the
States. ***

   MR. JUSTICE HARLAN, whom MR. JUSTICE
STEWART joins, dissenting.

   Every American jurisdiction provides for trial by jury in
criminal cases. The question before us is not whether jury trial
is an ancient institution, which it is; nor whether it plays a
significant role in the administration of criminal Justice, which
it does; nor whether it will endure, which it shall. The question
in this case is whether the State of Louisiana, which provides
trial by jury for all felonies, is prohibited by the Constitution
from trying charges of simple battery to the court alone. In
my view, the answer to that question, mandated alike by our
constitutional history and by the longer history of trial by jury,
is clearly "no."

   The States have always borne primary responsibility for
operating the machinery of criminal justice within their
borders, and adapting it to their particular circumstances. In
exercising this responsibility, each State is compelled to
conform its procedures to the requirements of the Federal
Constitution. The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth
106 | DUNCAN V. LOUISIANA (1968)

Amendment requires that those procedures be fundamentally
fair in all respects. It does not, in my view, impose or encourage
nationwide uniformity for its own sake; it does not command
adherence to forms that happen to be old, and it does not
impose on the States the rules that may be in force in the
federal courts except where such rules are also found to be
essential to basic fairness.***

   NOTES: The Duncan decision illustrates a number of
important points.

   First, look at the flimsy basis for this criminal prosecution.
It is a reminder that there is nothing about "law"and courts
that ensures these aspects of the governing system are utilized
to advance justice. Here, the law was used in a segregated
county to ensure that racial discrimination was preserved and
that whites in positions of authority could use courts to
enforce inequality and unequal treatment. Racial
discrimination has been a key characteristic of the American
criminal justice throughout the history of the United States.
Unfortunately, social science research on police stops, searches,
prosecution decisions, use of force by police, and sentencing
shows that racial discrimination continues to exist in many
American jurisdictions. Such improper denials of equal justice
under law may be less visible and obvious than they were in
Brown v. Mississippi (1936) and Duncan v. Louisiana (1968),
but they continue to be a problem for the attainment of the
justice system's professed ideals.
                                            DUNCAN V. LOUISIANA (1968) | 107

   Second, Justice White's majority opinion lists a variety of
rights that had been incorporated in the two decades after the
decision in Adamson v. California. In a number of individual
cases, the Supreme Court declared that individual rights in the
Bill of Rights were incorporated into the Due Process Clause
of the Fourteenth Amendment and thereby applied to protect
individuals against actions by state and local officials. Most of
the rights affecting criminal justice were incorporated by the
Supreme Court during the 1960s. Two additional rights were
incorporated four decades later in the twenty-first century,
McDonald v. City of Chicago (2010), incorporating the Second
Amendment right to own firearms, and Timbs v. Indiana
(2019), incorporating the Eighth Amendment protection
against excessive fines. As of 2022, several provisions of the
Bill of Rights have not been incorporated and therefore only
protect individuals against the actions of the federal
government: Third Amendment protection against
quartering troops in people's homes; Fifth Amendment
protection requirement of indictment by grand jury to charge
serious crimes; Seventh Amendment jury trial right in civil
lawsuits; Eighth Amendment protection against excessive bail.

   Third, Justice White's opinion applied the Palko principle
to determine that the Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury
was incorporated into the Fourteenth Amendment Due
Process Clause for application to state court proceedings. Yet,
in Footnote 14--that appears at the end of White's majority
opinion (the other footnotes have been edited out of the case
108 | DUNCAN V. LOUISIANA (1968)

opinions presented above)--White indicated that he was using
an altered version of Cardozo's Palko test. Instead of asking
whether the right to trial by jury is fundamental and essential
to liberty in a hypothetical society, White made his judgement
on behalf of the Court majority by determining that the right
to trial by jury is fundamental and essential to liberty in
American society, based on the traditions brought to North
America from British legal practices.
PART IV

FOURTH
AMENDMENT:
WHAT IS A
SEARCH?

What Is a Search? The Basics

The Fourth Amendment is short, just 54 words, and it reflects
the desires of those who wrote and ratified it to protect
Americans against unreasonable government intrusion into
their lives. The Amendment mentions some of the more
important aspects of a person's life--her house, her papers, her
effects, even her "person," that is, her body--and declares that
government agents may not unreasonably search or seize those
things. Here is the text:

   "The right of the people to be secure in their persons,
houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and
seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but
upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and
particularly describing the place to be searched, and the
persons or things to be seized."
110 | FOURTH AMENDMENT: WHAT IS A SEARCH?

   These words have inspired arguments about their meanings.
For example, what counts as a "house" and thereby merits
protection from unreasonable searches? Is it limited to
physical buildings in which people live, or is some area outside
the structure included? We will see later that the Court
eventually defined the concept of "curtilage," which is an
outdoor area that the Court treats as part of the "house."

   Over the coming weeks, students will encounter vigorous
debate over the meaning of "reasonable." When is it reasonable
for a police officer to stop and frisk a pedestrian about whom
the officer has suspicion? When is it reasonable for police to
search cars without warrants? For now, we will set aside the
concept of reasonableness for one simple reason: Before
something can be an "unreasonable search," it must first be
a "search." The cases assigned for this chapter concern the
definition of "search" for purposes of Fourth Amendment
jurisprudence. (Similarly, before something can be an
"unreasonable seizure," it must first be a "seizure." We will
consider the definition of "seizure" later in the semester.)

   To key elements are important for understanding the
concept of a "search" and judges' approach to deciding
whether actions by government--especially the police as
government officials--violate the Fourth Amendment's
protection against "unreasonable searches." First, the
existence of a government action that is defined as a search is
typically defined as an intrusion that violates an individual's
"reasonable expectation of privacy." If someone is walking in
                        FOURTH AMENDMENT: WHAT IS A SEARCH? | 111

the open down a public sidewalk and a police officer watches
the person from across the street, that is not a search. It would
not be reasonable for an individual to consider it an intrusion
for someone to see them when they have placed themselves in
a public place that is visible to others. On the other hand, if
a police officer pressed her face against the window of a house
in order to try to look through a narrow opening in a close
curtain, that is quite different with respect to it impact on an
individual's reasonable expectation of privacy.

   Second, judges generally evaluate claims about Fourth
Amendment violations through a balancing test that asks
whether the individual's interest in privacy in a specific
situation outweighs the importance of the government's
interest in intruding on the individual's expectation of
privacy. Thus, when people boarding a commercial flight
must walk through a metal detector, the government's interest
in preventing people from bringing weapons or bombs on
planes--in order to prevent hijackings and other life-
threatening dangers--outweighs the minimal intrusion of
having a machine detect whether an individual is carrying a
weapon under her clothing. By contrast, if school officials
strip search students looking for missing pencil, the
government's interest in a low-value, non-dangerous item
would not justify such a severe intrusion on the students'
reasonable expectation of privacy. Thus, this latter example
would violate Fourth Amendment rights.
FLORIDA V. JARDINES
(2013)

              Supreme Court of the United States

   Florida v. Joelis Jardines

             Decided March 26, 2013 - 569 U.S. 1
   Justice SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court.
   We consider whether using a drug-sniffing dog on a
homeowner's porch to investigate the contents of the home is
a "search" within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.

                       I

In 2006, Detective William Pedraja of the Miami-Dade Police
Department received an unverified tip that marijuana was
being grown in the home of respondent Joelis Jardines. One
month later, the Department and the Drug Enforcement
Administration sent a joint surveillance team to Jardines'
home. Detective Pedraja was part of that team. He watched the
home for fifteen minutes and saw no vehicles in the driveway
114 | FLORIDA V. JARDINES (2013)

or activity around the home, and could not see inside because
the blinds were drawn. Detective Pedraja then approached
Jardines' home accompanied by Detective Douglas Bartelt, a
trained canine handler who had just arrived at the scene with
his drug-sniffing dog. The dog was trained to detect the scent
of marijuana, cocaine, heroin, and several other drugs,
indicating the presence of any of these substances through
particular behavioral changes recognizable by his handler.

   Detective Bartelt had the dog on a six-foot leash, owing in
part to the dog's "wild" nature and tendency to dart around
erratically while searching. As the dog approached Jardines'
front porch, he apparently sensed one of the odors he had
been trained to detect, and began energetically exploring the
area for the strongest point source of that odor. As Detective
Bartelt explained, the dog "began tracking that airborne odor
by ... tracking back and forth," engaging in what is called
"bracketing," "back and forth, back and forth." Detective
Bartelt gave the dog "the full six feet of the leash plus whatever
safe distance [he could] give him" to do this--he testified that
he needed to give the dog "as much distance as I can." And
Detective Pedraja stood back while this was occurring, so that
he would not "get knocked over" when the dog was "spinning
around trying to find" the source.

   After sniffing the base of the front door, the dog sat, which
is the trained behavior upon discovering the odor's strongest
point. Detective Bartelt then pulled the dog away from the
door and returned to his vehicle. He left the scene after
                                               FLORIDA V. JARDINES (2013) | 115

informing Detective Pedraja that there had been a positive alert
for narcotics.

   On the basis of what he had learned at the home, Detective
Pedraja applied for and received a warrant to search the
residence. When the warrant was executed later that day,
Jardines attempted to flee and was arrested; the search revealed
marijuana plants, and he was charged with trafficking in
cannabis.

   At trial, Jardines moved to suppress the marijuana plants on
the ground that the canine investigation was an unreasonable
search. The trial court granted the motion, and the Florida
Third District Court of Appeal reversed. On a petition for
discretionary review, the Florida Supreme Court quashed the
decision of the Third District Court of Appeal and approved
the trial court's decision to suppress, holding (as relevant here)
that the use of the trained narcotics dog to investigate Jardines'
home was a Fourth Amendment search unsupported by
probable cause, rendering invalid the warrant based upon
information gathered in that search.

   We granted certiorari, limited to the question of whether
the officers' behavior was a search within the meaning of the
Fourth Amendment.

                       II

[W]hen it comes to the Fourth Amendment, the home is first
among equals. At the Amendment's "very core" stands "the
116 | FLORIDA V. JARDINES (2013)

right of a man to retreat into his own home and there be
free from unreasonable governmental intrusion." This right
would be of little practical value if the State's agents could
stand in a home's porch or side garden and trawl for evidence
with impunity; the right to retreat would be significantly
diminished if the police could enter a man's property to
observe his repose from just outside the front window.

   We therefore regard the area "immediately surrounding and
associated with the home"--what our cases call the
curtilage--as "part of the home itself for Fourth Amendment
purposes." Here there is no doubt that the officers entered it:
The front porch is the classic exemplar of an area adjacent to
the home and "to which the activity of home life extends."

   Since the officers' investigation took place in a
constitutionally protected area, we turn to the question of
whether it was accomplished through an unlicensed physical
intrusion. While law enforcement officers need not "shield
their eyes" when passing by the home "on public
thoroughfares," an officer's leave to gather information is
sharply circumscribed when he steps off those thoroughfares
and enters the Fourth Amendment's protected areas. As it is
undisputed that the detectives had all four of their feet and
all four of their companion's firmly planted on the
constitutionally protected extension of Jardines' home, the
only question is whether he had given his leave (even
implicitly) for them to do so. He had not.

   We have recognized that "the knocker on the front door is
                                                FLORIDA V. JARDINES (2013) | 117

treated as an invitation or license to attempt an entry, justifying
ingress to the home by solicitors, hawkers and peddlers of all
kinds." This implicit license typically permits the visitor to
approach the home by the front path, knock promptly, wait
briefly to be received, and then (absent invitation to linger
longer) leave. Complying with the terms of that traditional
invitation does not require fine-grained legal knowledge; it is
generally managed without incident by the Nation's Girl
Scouts and trick-or-treaters. Thus, a police officer not armed
with a warrant may approach a home and knock, precisely
because that is "no more than any private citizen might do."

   But introducing a trained police dog to explore the area
around the home in hopes of discovering incriminating
evidence is something else. There is no customary invitation
to do that. An invitation to engage in canine forensic
investigation assuredly does not inhere in the very act of
hanging a knocker. To find a visitor knocking on the door
is routine (even if sometimes unwelcome); to spot that same
visitor exploring the front path with a metal detector, or
marching his bloodhound into the garden before saying hello
and asking permission, would inspire most of us to--well, call
the police. The scope of a license--express or implied--is
limited not only to a particular area but also to a specific
purpose. Consent at a traffic stop to an officer's checking out
an anonymous tip that there is a body in the trunk does not
permit the officer to rummage through the trunk for narcotics.
118 | FLORIDA V. JARDINES (2013)

Here, the background social norms that invite a visitor to the
front door do not invite him there to conduct a search.

   The government's use of trained police dogs to investigate
the home and its immediate surroundings is a "search" within
the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. The judgment of the
Supreme Court of Florida is therefore affirmed.

Notes, Comments, and Questions

Does the outcome change if the dog is sniffing the door of
an apartment instead of a home? Consider a police officer
who is investigating an individual for methamphetamine
production. The individual lives on the third floor of an
apartment building. The police officer leads a dog to the third-
floor hallway; the dog sniffs several doors in the hallway
without alerting. While sniffing the suspect's door, the dog
alerts to the presence of drugs. Search or no search? Why or
why not? See State v. Edstrom, 916 N.W.2d 512, 515 (Minn.
2018),cert. denied,139 S. Ct. 1262 (2019).
PART V

FOURTH
AMENDMENT:
WHAT IS A
SEARCH? SOME
SPECIFICS

As the cases make clear, the word "search" for purposes of
the Fourth Amendment does not have its normal English
meaning, that is, something to the effect of "try to find
something" or "look for something." Instead, the Supreme
Court has created a legal term of art. Some activities that one
might normally describe with the word "search" (such as
looking through someone's garbage in the hope of finding
something interesting) turn out not to count as "searches" in
Fourth Amendment jurisprudence. Students should consider
when reading these cases whether the Court's reasoning is
persuasive. Further, they should consider whether a unifying
set of principles can be found that (at least most of the time)
allows one to predict whether a given activity will count as a
120 | FOURTH AMENDMENT: WHAT IS A SEARCH? SOME
SPECIFICS

"search." Absent such a set of principles, it may appear that the
Court's doctrine in this area is somewhat arbitrary.

   Not all Fourth Amendment "searches" involve physical
intrusion into an area in which someone enjoys a reasonable
expectation of privacy. In the next case, the Court applies this
principle to the use of thermal imaging technology.
KYLLO V. UNITED
STATES (2001)

              Supreme Court of the United States

   Danny Lee Kyllo v. United
                States

             Decided June 11, 2001 -- 533 U.S. 27
   Justice SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court.
   This case presents the question whether the use of a
thermal-imaging device aimed at a private home from a public
street to detect relative amounts of heat within the home
constitutes a "search" within the meaning of the Fourth
Amendment.

                       I

In 1991 Agent William Elliott of the United States
Department of the Interior came to suspect that marijuana was
being grown in the home belonging to petitioner Danny Kyllo,
part of a triplex on Rhododendron Drive in Florence, Oregon.
122 | KYLLO V. UNITED STATES (2001)

Indoor marijuana growth typically requires high-intensity
lamps. In order to determine whether an amount of heat was
emanating from petitioner's home consistent with the use of
such lamps, at 3:20 a.m. on January 16, 1992, Agent Elliott
and Dan Haas used an Agema Thermovision 210 thermal
imager to scan the triplex. Thermal imagers detect infrared
radiation, which virtually all objects emit but which is not
visible to the naked eye. The imager converts radiation into
images based on relative warmth--black is cool, white is hot,
shades of gray connote relative differences; in that respect, it
operates somewhat like a video camera showing heat images.
The scan of Kyllo's home took only a few minutes and was
performed from the passenger seat of Agent Elliott's vehicle
across the street from the front of the house and also from the
street in back of the house. The scan showed that the roof over
the garage and a side wall of petitioner's home were relatively
hot compared to the rest of the home and substantially warmer
than neighboring homes in the triplex. Agent Elliott
concluded that petitioner was using halide lights to grow
marijuana in his house, which indeed he was. Based on tips
from informants, utility bills, and the thermal imaging, a
Federal Magistrate Judge issued a warrant authorizing a search
of petitioner's home, and the agents found an indoor growing
operation involving more than 100 plants. Petitioner was
indicted on one count of manufacturing marijuana. He
unsuccessfully moved to suppress the evidence seized from his
home and then entered a conditional guilty plea.
                                         KYLLO V. UNITED STATES (2001) | 123

   The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit remanded the
case for an evidentiary hearing regarding the intrusiveness of
thermal imaging. On remand the District Court found that
the Agema 210 "is a non-intrusive device which emits no rays
or beams and shows a crude visual image of the heat being
radiated from the outside of the house"; it "did not show any
people or activity within the walls of the structure"; "[t]he
device used cannot penetrate walls or windows to reveal
conversations or human activities"; and "[n]o intimate details
of the home were observed." Based on these findings, the
District Court upheld the validity of the warrant that relied
in part upon the thermal imaging, and reaffirmed its denial of
the motion to suppress. A divided Court of Appeals initially
reversed, but that opinion was withdrawn and the panel (after
a change in composition) affirmed, with Judge Noonan
dissenting. The court held that petitioner had shown no
subjective expectation of privacy because he had made no
attempt to conceal the heat escaping from his home and even
if he had, there was no objectively reasonable expectation of
privacy because the imager "did not expose any intimate details
of Kyllo's life," only "amorphous `hot spots' on the roof and
exterior wall." We granted certiorari.

                       II

"At the very core" of the Fourth Amendment "stands the right
of a man to retreat into his own home and there be free from
124 | KYLLO V. UNITED STATES (2001)

unreasonable governmental intrusion." With few exceptions,
the question whether a warrantless search of a home is
reasonable and hence constitutional must be answered no.

   On the other hand, the antecedent question whether or not
a Fourth Amendment "search" has occurred is not so simple
under our precedent....but the lawfulness of warrantless visual
surveillance of a home has still been preserved. As we observed
in California v. Ciraolo, 476 U.S. 207 (1986), "[t]he Fourth
Amendment protection of the home has never been extended
to require law enforcement officers to shield their eyes when
passing by a home on public thoroughfares."

   ***We have subsequently applied this principle to hold that
a Fourth Amendment search does not occur--even when the
explicitly protected location of a house is concerned--unless
"the individual manifested a subjective expectation of privacy
in the object of the challenged search," and "society [is] willing
to recognize that expectation as reasonable." We have applied
this test in holding that it is not a search for the police to use a
pen register at the phone company to determine what numbers
were dialed in a private home, and we have applied the test
on two different occasions in holding that aerial surveillance
of private homes and surrounding areas does not constitute a
search.

   The present case involves officers on a public street engaged
in more than naked-eye surveillance of a home. We have
previously reserved judgment as to how much technological
                                         KYLLO V. UNITED STATES (2001) | 125

enhancement of ordinary perception from such a vantage
point, if any, is too much. ***

   We have said that the Fourth Amendment draws "a firm line
at the entrance to the house." That line, we think, must be not
only firm but also bright--which requires clear specification
of those methods of surveillance that require a warrant. While
it is certainly possible to conclude from the videotape of the
thermal imaging that occurred in this case that no "significant"
compromise of the homeowner's privacy has occurred, we
must take the long view, from the original meaning of the
Fourth Amendment forward.

   Where, as here, the Government uses a device that is not in
general public use, to explore details of the home that would
previously have been unknowable without physical intrusion,
the surveillance is a "search" and is presumptively
unreasonable without a warrant.

***
   Justice STEVENS, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE,

Justice O'CONNOR, and Justice KENNEDY join,
dissenting.

   There is, in my judgment, a distinction of constitutional
magnitude between "through-the-wall surveillance" that gives
the observer or listener direct access to information in a private
area, on the one hand, and the thought processes used to draw
inferences from information in the public domain, on the
other hand. The Court has crafted a rule that purports to deal
126 | KYLLO V. UNITED STATES (2001)

with direct observations of the inside of the home, but the case
before us merely involves indirect deductions from "off-the-
wall" surveillance, that is, observations of the exterior of the
home. Those observations were made with a fairly primitive
thermal imager that gathered data exposed on the outside of
petitioner's home but did not invade any constitutionally
protected interest in privacy. Moreover, I believe that the
supposedly "bright-line" rule the Court has created in
response to its concerns about future technological
developments is unnecessary, unwise, and inconsistent with
the Fourth Amendment.

                       I

There is no need for the Court to craft a new rule to decide
this case, as it is controlled by established principles from our
Fourth Amendment jurisprudence. One of those core
principles, of course, is that "searches and seizures inside a
home without a warrant are presumptively unreasonable." But
it is equally well settled that searches and seizures of property
in plain view are presumptively reasonable. "`What a person
knowingly exposes to the public, even in his own home or
office, is not a subject of Fourth Amendment protection.'"
That is the principle implicated here.

   While the Court "take[s] the long view" and decides this
case based largely on the potential of yet-to-be-developed
technology that might allow "through-the-wall surveillance,"
                                         KYLLO V. UNITED STATES (2001) | 127

this case involves nothing more than off-the-wall surveillance
by law enforcement officers to gather information exposed to
the general public from the outside of petitioner's home. All
that the infrared camera did in this case was passively measure
heat emitted from the exterior surfaces of petitioner's home;
all that those measurements showed were relative differences
in emission levels, vaguely indicating that some areas of the
roof and outside walls were warmer than others. As still images
from the infrared scans show, no details regarding the interior
of petitioner's home were revealed. Unlike an x-ray scan, or
other possible "through-the-wall" techniques, the detection of
infrared radiation emanating from the home did not
accomplish "an unauthorized physical penetration into the
premises," nor did it "obtain information that it could not
have obtained by observation from outside the curtilage of the
house."

   Indeed, the ordinary use of the senses might enable a
neighbor or passerby to notice the heat emanating from a
building, particularly if it is vented, as was the case here.
Additionally, any member of the public might notice that one
part of a house is warmer than another part or a nearby
building if, for example, rainwater evaporates or snow melts at
different rates across its surfaces. Such use of the senses would
not convert into an unreasonable search if, instead, an
adjoining neighbor allowed an officer onto her property to
verify her perceptions with a sensitive thermometer. Nor, in
my view, does such observation become an unreasonable
128 | KYLLO V. UNITED STATES (2001)

search if made from a distance with the aid of a device that
merely discloses that the exterior of one house, or one area
of the house, is much warmer than another. Nothing more
occurred in this case.

   Thus, the notion that heat emissions from the outside of a
dwelling are a private matter implicating the protections of the
Fourth Amendment (the text of which guarantees the right of
people "to be secure in their ... houses" against unreasonable
searches and seizures (emphasis added)) is not only
unprecedented but also quite difficult to take seriously. Heat
waves, like aromas that are generated in a kitchen, or in a
laboratory or opium den, enter the public domain if and when
they leave a building. A subjective expectation that they would
remain private is not only implausible but also surely not "one
that society is prepared to recognize as `reasonable.'"

***

Notes, Comments, and Questions

The Kyllo majority reasoned in 2001 (in a case about police
conduct that occurred in 1991) that the use of thermal
imaging constituted a search because the technology was "not
in general public use."

   Today, however, the general public has many uses for
                                         KYLLO V. UNITED STATES (2001) | 129

thermal imaging, from HVAC performance testing to hunting
to wildlife rescue to evaluating the performance of kitchen
devices.

   Agema Infrared Systems, the Swedish corporation that
manufactured the "Agema Thermovision 210" at issue in
Kyllo, was acquired by FLIR Systems Inc. in 1998.
Headquartered in Oregon, FLIR now sells a $200 thermal
imaging camera (the "FLIR ONE") that can attach to a
smartphone, with fancier versions available for higher prices.
According to the FLIR product page, one can use the FLIR
ONE to "[f]ind problems around the home fast, like where
you're losing heat, how your insulation's holding up, electrical
problems, and water damage - all of which are point-and-
shoot easy to find." It also suggests, "See in the dark and
explore the natural world safely with the FLIR ONE. Watch
animals in their natural habitat and even use it to find your
lost pet ... or what they might have left behind in the yard."
Another suggested use from the advertisement: "Detecting
tiny variations in heat means that you can see in total darkness,
create new kinds of art, and discover new things about your
world every day... or help your child with their science fair
experiment."

   Consider a police officer who uses such a device to
investigate a suspected drug-grower's home. He sees images
consistent with growing drugs. He shows the images to a
judge, who grants a search warrant. Officers find drugs in the
130 | KYLLO V. UNITED STATES (2001)

house, and prosecutors have charged the owner with drug
crimes. Search or no search? Why or why not?

   In January 2020, the City Counsel of Bessemer, Michigan
voted to purchase "an odor-detecting device as a means of
addressing growing complaints about marijuana odor." The
device is called a "Nasal Ranger," and the company that sells
it describes it as "the `state-of-the-art' in field olfactometry for
confidently measuring and quantifying odor strength in the
ambient air." According to St. Croix Sensory, Inc., "The
portable Nasal Ranger Field Olfactometer determines ambient
odor Dilution-to-Threshold (D/T) concentration objectively
with your trained nose." If a Bessmer police officer stands on a
public sidewalk and uses the Nasal Ranger to detect marijuana
odors emanating from a house, is that a search? Why or why
not?

PART VI

FOURTH
AMENDMENT:
WHAT IS A
SEARCH? MORE
SPECIFICS

The Fourth Amendment protects the people's "persons,
houses, papers, and effects." While this language is quite broad,
it does not include everything someone might possess or wish
to protect from intrusion. For example, if one owns
agricultural land far from any "house," that land is not a
person, a house, a paper, or an effect. Police searches of such
land, therefore, are not "searches" regulated by the Fourth
Amendment. The Court has attempted to define the barrier
separating the "curtilage" (an area near a house that is treated as
a "house" for Fourth Amendment purposes) from the "open
fields" (which enjoy no Fourth Amendment protection).

Notes, Comments, and Questions
132 | FOURTH AMENDMENT: WHAT IS A SEARCH? MORE
SPECIFICS

In both Oliver and Dunn, police walked onto someone's land
without permission. In describing the "open fields doctrine,"
the Oliver Court stated: "The "open fields" doctrine, first
enunciated by this Court in Hester v. United States, 265 U.S.
57 (1924), permits police officers to enter and search a field
without a warrant."

   Consider whether that statement is truly accurate. Is it truly
lawful for police to wander uninvited on the open fields of
suspects? Perhaps it would be more accurate to state: "Police
should not do this, but if they do, the Fourth Amendment has
nothing to say about it." The Hester case cited by the Court in
Oliver may provide a clue. In the syllabus, the Court describes
police witnesses who "held no warrant and were trespassers on
the land." By definition, trespassers are violating the law. We do
not call it a "trespass" when someone walks on the property of
another to visit as an invited guest, or to knock on the door and
leave literature about religion or politics, or to execute a valid
search warrant.

   If officers who find useful (and admissible) evidence while
trespassing in the open fields of suspects are breaking the law,
should they be punished? Is it plausible to believe that they
will be? If, as seems more likely, police departments would
laud such behavior rather than condemning it, does that raise
questions about the sensibility of the open fields doctrine?

   At common law, the crimes of arson and burglary (which

                                                                        SPECIFICS | 133

are both crimes against the dwelling), defined "house" as both
a dwelling house and buildings located within the curtilage.
Fourth Amendment law essentially imports this principle.

   So what is curtilage? Curtilage is: "The land or yard
adjoining a house, usually within an enclosure. Under the
Fourth Amendment, the curtilage is an area usually protected
from warrantless searches." Black's Law Dictionary (11th ed.
2019).

   Because the Court treats the curtilage surrounding a home
as part of a "house" for Fourth Amendment purposes, police
officers normally cannot walk on to curtilage and look around
with neither permission nor a warrant. In response to this
restriction, police have flown over houses and curtilage, using
their eyes and cameras to gain information relevant to criminal
investigations.

Notes, Comments, and Questions

Supreme Court precedent strongly suggests that as long as
police pilots obey the law (such as FAA regulations on
minimum altitudes), the "reasonable expectation of privacy
test" will not prevent police from flying over a home.

   Diligent defense counsel may wish to examine whether state
or local laws restrict overflights more strictly than FAA
regulations. Especially as remote-controlled helicopters (a.k.a.
134 | FOURTH AMENDMENT: WHAT IS A SEARCH? MORE
SPECIFICS

"drones") become widely available at low prices, police can
easily fly camera-toting aircraft over the homes of suspects. If
a municipality prohibits such conduct by the general public,
then perhaps police who violate local ordinances will also
violate reasonable expectations of privacy.

   What are the limits for observations from the air? Consider
an officer who uses a drone equipped with a video camera
to monitor a suspect through his bedroom window. There is
nothing to suggest that drones flying in neighborhoods are
sufficiently rare; a drone with streaming video can be
purchased for about $60 at Target. Search or no search? Why
or why not? Does the outcome change if there is a local
ordinance limiting the public's use of drones to public spaces?

   In the next case, the Court turned its attention to the use
of dogs during traffic stops, in which motorists are detained
involuntarily.
ILLINOIS V. CABALLES
(2005)

              Supreme Court of the United States

    Illinois v. Roy I. Caballes

             Decided Jan. 24, 2005 - 543 U.S. 405
   Justice STEVENS delivered the opinion of the Court.
   Illinois State Trooper Daniel Gillette stopped respondent
for speeding on an interstate highway. When Gillette radioed
the police dispatcher to report the stop, a second trooper,
Craig Graham, a member of the Illinois State Police Drug
Interdiction Team, overheard the transmission and
immediately headed for the scene with his narcotics-detection
dog. When they arrived, respondent's car was on the shoulder
of the road and respondent was in Gillette's vehicle. While
Gillette was in the process of writing a warning ticket, Graham
walked his dog around respondent's car. The dog alerted at
the trunk. Based on that alert, the officers searched the trunk,
found marijuana, and arrested respondent. The entire incident
lasted less than 10 minutes.
   Respondent was convicted of a narcotics offense and
136 | ILLINOIS V. CABALLES (2005)

sentenced to 12 years' imprisonment and a $256,136 fine. The
trial judge denied his motion to suppress the seized evidence
and to quash his arrest. He held that the officers had not
unnecessarily prolonged the stop and that the dog alert was
sufficiently reliable to provide probable cause to conduct the
search. Although the Appellate Court affirmed, the Illinois
Supreme Court reversed, concluding that because the canine
sniff was performed without any "`specific and articulable
facts'" to suggest drug activity, the use of the dog "unjustifiably
enlarg[ed] the scope of a routine traffic stop into a drug
investigation."

   The question on which we granted certiorari is narrow:
"Whether the Fourth Amendment requires reasonable,
articulable suspicion to justify using a drug-detection dog to
sniff a vehicle during a legitimate traffic stop." Thus, we
proceed on the assumption that the officer conducting the dog
sniff had no information about respondent except that he had
been stopped for speeding; accordingly, we have omitted any
reference to facts about respondent that might have triggered a
modicum of suspicion.

   [T]he Illinois Supreme Court held that the initially lawful
traffic stop became an unlawful seizure solely as a result of
the canine sniff that occurred outside respondent's stopped
car. That is, the court characterized the dog sniff as the cause
rather than the consequence of a constitutional violation. In its
view, the use of the dog converted the citizen-police encounter
from a lawful traffic stop into a drug investigation, and because
                                              ILLINOIS V. CABALLES (2005) | 137

the shift in purpose was not supported by any reasonable
suspicion that respondent possessed narcotics, it was unlawful.
In our view, conducting a dog sniff would not change the
character of a traffic stop that is lawful at its inception and
otherwise executed in a reasonable manner, unless the dog sniff
itself infringed respondent's constitutionally protected
interest in privacy. Our cases hold that it did not.

   Official conduct that does not "compromise any legitimate
interest in privacy" is not a search subject to the Fourth
Amendment. We have held that any interest in possessing
contraband cannot be deemed "legitimate," and thus,
governmental conduct that only reveals the possession of
contraband "compromises no legitimate privacy interest."
This is because the expectation "that certain facts will not
come to the attention of the authorities" is not the same as
an interest in "privacy that society is prepared to consider
reasonable." Respondent concedes that "drug sniffs are
designed, and if properly conducted are generally likely, to
reveal only the presence of contraband." Although respondent
argues that the error rates, particularly the existence of false
positives, call into question the premise that drug-detection
dogs alert only to contraband, the record contains no evidence
or findings that support his argument. Moreover, respondent
does not suggest that an erroneous alert, in and of itself, reveals
any legitimate private information, and, in this case, the trial
judge found that the dog sniff was sufficiently reliable to
138 | ILLINOIS V. CABALLES (2005)

establish probable cause to conduct a full-blown search of the
trunk.

   Accordingly, the use of a well-trained narcotics-detection
dog--one that "does not expose noncontraband items that
otherwise would remain hidden from public view," during
a lawful traffic stop, generally does not implicate legitimate
privacy interests. In this case, the dog sniff was performed on
the exterior of respondent's car while he was lawfully seized
for a traffic violation. Any intrusion on respondent's privacy
expectations does not rise to the level of a constitutionally
cognizable infringement.

   This conclusion is entirely consistent with our recent
decision that the use of a thermal-imaging device to detect
the growth of marijuana in a home constituted an unlawful
search. Kyllo v. United States, 533 U.S. 27 (2001). Critical
to that decision was the fact that the device was capable of
detecting lawful activity--in that case, intimate details in a
home, such as "at what hour each night the lady of the house
takes her daily sauna and bath." The legitimate expectation
that information about perfectly lawful activity will remain
private is categorically distinguishable from respondent's
hopes or expectations concerning the nondetection of
contraband in the trunk of his car. A dog sniff conducted
during a concededly lawful traffic stop that reveals no
information other than the location of a substance that no
individual has any right to possess does not violate the Fourth
Amendment.
                                              ILLINOIS V. CABALLES (2005) | 139

   The judgment of the Illinois Supreme Court is vacated, and
the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent
with this opinion.

   Justice SOUTER, dissenting.
   I would hold that using the dog for the purposes of
determining the presence of marijuana in the car's trunk was
a search unauthorized as an incident of the speeding stop and
unjustified on any other ground. I would accordingly affirm
the judgment of the Supreme Court of Illinois, and I
respectfully dissent.
   At the heart both of Place and the Court's opinion today
is the proposition that sniffs by a trained dog are sui generis
because a reaction by the dog in going alert is a response to
nothing but the presence of contraband. Hence, the argument
goes, because the sniff can only reveal the presence of items
devoid of any legal use, the sniff "does not implicate legitimate
privacy interests" and is not to be treated as a search.
   The infallible dog, however, is a creature of legal fiction.
Although the Supreme Court of Illinois did not get into the
sniffing averages of drug dogs, their supposed infallibility is
belied by judicial opinions describing well-trained animals
sniffing and alerting with less than perfect accuracy, whether
owing to errors by their handlers, the limitations of the dogs
themselves, or even the pervasive contamination of currency
by cocaine. Indeed, a study cited by Illinois in this case for
the proposition that dog sniffs are "generally reliable" shows
140 | ILLINOIS V. CABALLES (2005)

that dogs in artificial testing situations return false positives
anywhere from 12.5% to 60% of the time, depending on the
length of the search. In practical terms, the evidence is clear
that the dog that alerts hundreds of times will be wrong dozens
of times.***

FOURTH
AMENDMENT:
PROBABLE CAUSE
AND REASONABLE
SUSPICION

The Fourth Amendment provides that "no warrants shall
issue, but upon probable cause." Accordingly, warrants (and
the searches that followed in the wake of their issuance) have
been challenged on the ground that police did not provide
sufficient evidence when obtaining the warrants from judges.
In addition, the Court has held that in several common
situations, police may conduct searches and seizures without
a warrant, but only with probable cause. In Illinois v. Gates,
the Court set forth a new standard for when an informant's tip
provides probable cause to justify a search or arrest.
ILLINOIS V. GATES (1983)

              Supreme Court of the United States

     Illinois v. Lance Gates

              Decided June 8, 1983 - 462 U.S. 213

   Justice REHNQUIST delivered the opinion of the Court.

***

                       III

This totality-of-the-circumstances approach is far more
consistent with our prior treatment of probable cause than
is any rigid demand that specific "tests" be satisfied by every
informant's tip. Perhaps the central teaching of our decisions
bearing on the probable cause standard is that it is a "practical,
nontechnical conception." "In dealing with probable cause, ...
as the very name implies, we deal with probabilities. These are
not technical; they are the factual and practical considerations
of everyday life on which reasonable and prudent men, not
legal technicians, act." Our observation in United States v.
146 | ILLINOIS V. GATES (1983)

Cortez, 449 U.S. 411, 418 (1981) regarding "particularized
suspicion," is also applicable to the probable cause standard:

   "The process does not deal with hard certainties, but with
probabilities. Long before the law of probabilities was
articulated as such, practical people formulated certain
common-sense conclusions about human behavior; jurors as
factfinders are permitted to do the same--and so are law
enforcement officers. Finally, the evidence thus collected must
be seen and weighed not in terms of library analysis by
scholars, but as understood by those versed in the field of law
enforcement."

   As these comments illustrate, probable cause is a fluid
concept--turning on the assessment of probabilities in
particular factual contexts--not readily, or even usefully,
reduced to a neat set of legal rules. Informants' tips doubtless
come in many shapes and sizes from many different types of
persons.

   Moreover, the "two-pronged test" directs analysis into two
largely independent channels--the informant's "veracity" or
"reliability" and his "basis of knowledge." There are persuasive
arguments against according these two elements such
independent status. Instead, they are better understood as
relevant considerations in the totality-of-the-circumstances
analysis that traditionally has guided probable cause
determinations: a deficiency in one may be compensated for,
in determining the overall reliability of a tip, by a strong
                                                    ILLINOIS V. GATES (1983) | 147

showing as to the other, or by some other indicia of reliability.

   If, for example, a particular informant is known for the
unusual reliability of his predictions of certain types of
criminal activities in a locality, his failure, in a particular case,
to thoroughly set forth the basis of his knowledge surely
should not serve as an absolute bar to a finding of probable
cause based on his tip. Likewise, if an unquestionably honest
citizen comes forward with a report of criminal
activity--which if fabricated would subject him to criminal
liability--we have found rigorous scrutiny of the basis of his
knowledge unnecessary. Conversely, even if we entertain some
doubt as to an informant's motives, his explicit and detailed
description of alleged wrongdoing, along with a statement that
the event was observed first-hand, entitles his tip to greater
weight than might otherwise be the case. Unlike a totality-
of-the-circumstances analysis, which permits a balanced
assessment of the relative weights of all the various indicia
of reliability (and unreliability) attending an informant's tip,
the "two-pronged test" has encouraged an excessively technical
dissection of informants' tips, with undue attention being
focused on isolated issues that cannot sensibly be divorced
from the other facts presented to the magistrate.

***
148 | ILLINOIS V. GATES (1983)

Notes, Comments, and Questions

The Gates Court rejects the Aguilar-Spinelli test's insistence
on using two specific measures to compose a (somewhat)
mathematical formula for probable cause. As the Court
explains, the existence of probable cause will not be found by
entering "veracity" and "basis of knowledge" into a formula
which yields the total weight of evidence presented to a
magistrate.

   As the Court puts it:
   "This totality-of-the-circumstances approach is far more
consistent with our prior treatment of probable cause than
is any rigid demand that specific `tests' be satisfied by every
informant's tip. Perhaps the central teaching of our decisions
bearing on the probable cause standard is that it is a `practical,
nontechnical conception.'"
   When police have probable cause to believe either (1) that
evidence of crime will be found in a particular place or (2)
that a certain person has committed a crime, important police
action becomes lawful that would have remained unlawful
absent probable cause. One important example involves
vehicle stops; police may stop a car based on probable cause to
believe that its driver has committed a traffic law violation. It
is widely believed that many officers use this power for reasons
other than traffic enforcement--for example, stopping drivers
who violate trivial traffic rules in the hope of discovering
                                                    ILLINOIS V. GATES (1983) | 149

evidence of more serious lawbreaking. In addition, some critics
of police allege that at least some officers use their traffic-stop
authority in ways that constitute unlawful discrimination,
such as on the basis of race. Based on these beliefs and
allegations, motorists have sought review of vehicle stops,
justified by probable cause, on the basis of police officers' "real"
or "true" reasons for conducting the stops. The Court has
resisted engaging in such review.
THE PHENOMENON OF
"DRIVING WHILE BLACK
(OR BROWN)"

For decades, observers have documented that black and brown
drivers are more likely than white drivers to be stopped by
police, a phenomenon sometimes described as "Driving While
[Black/Brown]" or "DWB." (Similar observations have been
made about which pedestrians police choose to stop and frisk,
a topic to which we will return.) U.S. Senator Tim Scott (R-
S.C.) described in a 2016 speech his experiences as a black
motorist, along with incidents in which Capitol police
questioned whether he really was a member of the Senate.27
Reporting that he had been stopped by police while driving
seven times over the prior year, he asked colleagues to "imagine
the frustration, the irritation the sense of a loss of dignity that
accompanies each of those stops."

   Noting that in most of the incidents, "[He] was doing
nothing more than driving a new car, in the wrong
neighborhood, or some other reason just as trivial," he said,
"I have felt the anger, the frustration, the sadness and the
humiliation that comes with feeling that you're being targeted
for nothing more than just being yourself."
                    THE PHENOMENON OF "DRIVING WHILE BLACK (OR
                                                                         BROWN)" | 151

   After being stopped by Capitol police, Sen. Scott received
apologies on multiple occasions from police leadership. Most
Americans, however, lack the social capital possessed by
Senators and cannot expect that sort of response to
complaints.

   Although the cause of "DWB" stops is disputed, the
existence of the phenomenon is well-documented,28 as are its
effects on relations between police departments and minority
communities. For example, one of your authors once attended
an event in St. Louis at which a leader of the St. Louis City
police said that certain St. Louis County police departments
treat minority residents so badly, City police have trouble
getting cooperation from potential witnesses, impeding the
City department's ability to solve serious crimes.

   Robert Wilkins, now a federal appellate judge, was a
plaintiff in 1990s litigation related to DWB stops in Maryland.
A 2016 CBS News interview in which he describes his
experiences is available here: https://www.youtube.com/
watch?v=pYsl6AQBZn4

   In the spring and summer of 2020, police treatment of
members of minority communities--especially African
Americans--once again received a national spotlight. The May
2020 killing of George Floyd by police in Minneapolis and the
March 2020 killing of Breonna Taylor by police in Louisville
aroused particular indignation, inspiring protests across the
country. Police response to protests in some cities, including
152 | THE PHENOMENON OF "DRIVING WHILE BLACK (OR
BROWN)"

violence captured on video, inspired further calls for reform,
along with more radical proposals.

   As you read subsequent chapters, consider how Supreme
Court criminal procedure decisions affect how police
departments interact with communities they exist to serve. For
example, does the Court's Fourth Amendment doctrine
encourage police officers to act in ways that build confidence
among community members? When police officers violate
rules set forth by the Court, do existing legal remedies
encourage better future behavior? If you are unhappy with the
state of policing, how might things be improved? If instead
you think policing is going fairly well, to what do you attribute
the discontent exhibited during the 2020 protests?

   One purpose of this book is to help you consider questions
like these. Recall, however, that most Americans will never
attend law school. Knowledge of criminal procedure doctrine
among the public is sketchy at best. If Americans better
understood Supreme Court doctrine related to the Fourth,
Fifth, and Sixth Amendments, do you think they would have
more or less faith in the criminal justice system? Why? After
finishing this book, answer these questions again and examine
whether your own opinions have changed.

   A recent study of policing in Ohio strongly suggests that the
disparities demonstrated during Wilkins's lawsuit exist today,
at least in some American jurisdictions.

   The extreme racial disparities found in nonmoving traffic
violations (i.e.,drivingunder suspension and without a

are generally detected either through electronic surveillance or
once a traffic stop has been made, are consistent with Meehan
and Ponder's conclusion that, "officers must be `hunting' for,
or clearly noticing, African American drivers," in these
jurisdictions. This practice among law enforcement officers
creates a "self-fulfilling prophecy," in that ifblackmotorists are
disproportionately surveilled, stopped, and cited for traffic
offenses by police, its cumulative effect can help explain the
disproportionate number ofblacksthat ultimately have their
driver's licenses suspended. And given the strong inducements
todrivenoted earlier, a considerable segment of these motorists
continue todrive, are eventually caught again, and this cycle
only repeats itself, with escalating legal and financial
consequences accruing to the motorist.

PART VIII

FOURTH
AMENDMENT:
SEIZURES AND
ARRESTS

In this chapter, we consider the Court's definition of "seizure"
for Fourth Amendment purposes. The common meaning of
"seizure"--to take possession of a thing or person by force or
by legal process--provides some insight to the term's meaning
in constitutional law. But as is true for other terms of art, such
as "search," the dictionary definition is not identical to the
doctrinal meaning. We also consider when police may conduct
arrests.

          What Is a Seizure?

Just as something cannot be an "unreasonable search" without
being a "search," something cannot be an "unreasonable
seizure" without being a "seizure." Arrests are easily deemed
"seizures" of the persons arrested. A variety of less invasive
police tactics, however, have required more subtle analysis.

   Mr. Justice STEWART announced the judgment of the
Court and delivered an opinion, in which Mr. Justice
REHNQUIST joined.29

   The respondent was brought to trial in the United States
District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan on a charge
of possessing heroin with intent to distribute it. She moved
to suppress the introduction at trial of the heroin as evidence
against her on the ground that it had been acquired from her
through an unconstitutional search and seizure by agents of
the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). The District
Court denied the respondent's motion, and she was convicted
158 | UNITED STATES V. MENDENHALL (1980)

after a trial upon stipulated facts. The Court of Appeals
reversed. We granted certiorari.

                       I

At the hearing in the trial court on the respondent's motion
to suppress, it was established how the heroin she was charged
with possessing had been obtained from her. The respondent
arrived at the Detroit Metropolitan Airport on a commercial
airline flight from Los Angeles early in the morning on
February 10, 1976. As she disembarked from the airplane, she
was observed by two agents of the DEA, who were present
at the airport for the purpose of detecting unlawful traffic in
narcotics. After observing the respondent's conduct, which
appeared to the agents to be characteristic of persons
unlawfully carrying narcotics, the agents approached her as she
was walking through the concourse, identified themselves as
federal agents, and asked to see her identification and airline
ticket. The respondent produced her driver's license, which
was in the name of Sylvia Mendenhall, and, in answer to a
question of one of the agents, stated that she resided at the
address appearing on the license. The airline ticket was issued
in the name of "Annette Ford." When asked why the ticket
bore a name different from her own, the respondent stated
that she "just felt like using that name." In response to a
further question, the respondent indicated that she had been

in California only two days. Agent Anderson then specifically
identified himself as a federal narcotics agent and, according
to his testimony, the respondent "became quite shaken,
extremely nervous. She had a hard time speaking."

   After returning the airline ticket and driver's license to her,
Agent Anderson asked the respondent if she would
accompany him to the airport DEA office for further
questions. She did so, although the record does not indicate a
verbal response to the request. The office, which was located
up one flight of stairs about 50 feet from where the respondent
had first been approached, consisted of a reception area
adjoined by three other rooms. At the office the agent asked
the respondent if she would allow a search of her person and
handbag and told her that she had the right to decline the
search if she desired. She responded: "Go ahead." She then
handed Agent Anderson her purse, which contained a receipt
for an airline ticket that had been issued to "F. Bush" three
days earlier for a flight from Pittsburgh through Chicago to
Los Angeles. The agent asked whether this was the ticket that
she had used for her flight to California, and the respondent
stated that it was.

   A female police officer then arrived to conduct the search
of the respondent's person. She asked the agents if the
respondent had consented to be searched. The agents said that
she had, and the respondent followed the policewoman into
a private room. There the policewoman again asked the
respondent if she consented to the search, and the respondent
160 | UNITED STATES V. MENDENHALL (1980)

replied that she did. The policewoman explained that the
search would require that the respondent remove her clothing.
The respondent stated that she had a plane to catch and was
assured by the policewoman that if she were carrying no
narcotics, there would be no problem. The respondent then
began to disrobe without further comment. As the respondent
removed her clothing, she took from her undergarments two
small packages, one of which appeared to contain heroin, and
handed both to the policewoman. The agents then arrested the
respondent for possessing heroin.

                      II

Here the Government concedes that its agents had neither
a warrant nor probable cause to believe that the respondent
was carrying narcotics when the agents conducted a search
of the respondent's person. It is the Government's position,
however, that the search was conducted pursuant to the
respondent's consent, and thus was excepted from the
requirements of both a warrant and probable cause. Evidently,
the Court of Appeals concluded that the respondent's
apparent consent to the search was in fact not voluntarily given
and was in any event the product of earlier official conduct
violative of the Fourth Amendment. We must first consider,
therefore, whether such conduct occurred, either on the
concourse or in the DEA office at the airport.
                              UNITED STATES V. MENDENHALL (1980) | 161

                        A30

[I]f the respondent was "seized" when the DEA agents
approached her on the concourse and asked questions of her,
the agents' conduct in doing so was constitutional only if they
reasonably suspected the respondent of wrongdoing. But
"[o]bviously, not all personal intercourse between policemen
and citizens involves `seizures' of persons. Only when the
officer, by means of physical force or show of authority, has in
some way restrained the liberty of a citizen may we conclude
that a `seizure' has occurred."

   We conclude that a person has been "seized" within the
meaning of the Fourth Amendment only if, in view of all
of the circumstances surrounding the incident, a reasonable
person would have believed that he was not free to leave.
Examples of circumstances that might indicate a seizure, even
where the person did not attempt to leave, would be the
threatening presence of several officers, the display of a weapon
by an officer, some physical touching of the person of the
citizen, or the use of language or tone of voice indicating that
compliance with the officer's request might be compelled. In
the absence of some such evidence, otherwise inoffensive
contact between a member of the public and the police cannot,
as a matter of law, amount to a seizure of that person.

   On the facts of this case, no "seizure" of the respondent
occurred. The events took place in the public concourse. The
agents wore no uniforms and displayed no weapons. They did
162 | UNITED STATES V. MENDENHALL (1980)

not summon the respondent to their presence, but instead
approached her and identified themselves as federal agents.
They requested, but did not demand to see the respondent's
identification and ticket. Such conduct without more, did not
amount to an intrusion upon any constitutionally protected
interest. The respondent was not seized simply by reason of
the fact that the agents approached her, asked her if she would
show them her ticket and identification, and posed to her a
few questions. Nor was it enough to establish a seizure that the
person asking the questions was a law enforcement official. In
short, nothing in the record suggests that the respondent had
any objective reason to believe that she was not free to end the
conversation in the concourse and proceed on her way, and for
that reason we conclude that the agents' initial approach to her
was not a seizure.

   Our conclusion that no seizure occurred is not affected by
the fact that the respondent was not expressly told by the
agents that she was free to decline to cooperate with their
inquiry, for the voluntariness of her responses does not depend
upon her having been so informed. We also reject the
argument that the only inference to be drawn from the fact
that the respondent acted in a manner so contrary to her self-
interest is that she was compelled to answer the agents'
questions. It may happen that a person makes statements to
law enforcement officials that he later regrets, but the issue in
such cases is not whether the statement was self-protective, but
rather whether it was made voluntarily.

   ***
   [In a concurrence joined by Chief Justice Burger and Justice
Blackmun, Justice Powell wrote that the Court should not
decide whether the agents "seized" Mendenhall because the
courts below had not considered it. Further, he argued that if
the encounter did constitute a seizure, it was justified because
the circumstances provided "reasonable suspicion."]

   Mr. Justice WHITE, with whom Mr. Justice BRENNAN,
Mr. Justice MARSHALL, and Mr. Justice STEVENS join,
dissenting.

   ***
   Whatever doubt there may be concerning whether Ms.
Mendenhall's Fourth Amendment interests were implicated
during the initial stages of her confrontation with the DEA
agents, she undoubtedly was "seized" within the meaning of
the Fourth Amendment when the agents escorted her from the
public area of the terminal to the DEA office for questioning
and a strip-search of her person. [T]he nature of the intrusion
to which Ms. Mendenhall was subjected when she was
escorted by DEA agents to their office and detained there for
questioning and a strip-search was so great that it "was in
important respects indistinguishable from a traditional arrest."
Although Ms. Mendenhall was not told that she was under
arrest, she in fact was not free to refuse to go to the DEA office
164 | UNITED STATES V. MENDENHALL (1980)

and was not told that she was. Furthermore, once inside the
office, Ms. Mendenhall would not have been permitted to leave
without submitting to a strip-search.31

   The Court recognizes that the Government has the burden
of proving that Ms. Mendenhall consented to accompany the
officers, but it nevertheless holds that the "totality of evidence
was plainly adequate" to support a finding of consent. On the
record before us, the Court's conclusion can only be based on
the notion that consent can be assumed from the absence of
proof that a suspect resisted police authority.

   Since the defendant was not present to testify at the
suppression hearing, we can only speculate about her state
of mind as her encounter with the DEA agents progressed
from surveillance, to detention, to questioning, to seclusion
in a private office, to the female officer's command to remove
her clothing. Nevertheless, it is unbelievable that this sequence
of events involved no invasion of a citizen's constitutionally
protected interest in privacy. The rule of law requires a
different conclusion.

Notes, Comments, and Questions

The Court in Mendenhall stated that a person is seized if "a
reasonable person [in his situation] would have believed that
he was not free to leave." As a result, lawyers and others have
                              UNITED STATES V. MENDENHALL (1980) | 165

recommended that if someone is approached by police and
wishes either to avoid or to end the encounter, a useful tactic
is to ask, "Am I free to leave?" If the answer is "yes," then
the person may leave without further discussion. If the answer
is "no," then the person should stay--a reasonable person in
the situation would not feel free to go. A person told "no"
can later challenge the interaction as an unlawful seizure. At
a minimum the encounter should be considered a "seizure;"
the debate will be about its legality. (An equivalent tactic is
to ask, "Am I being detained?" An answer of "no" indicates
permission to leave. "Yes" indicates a seizure.)

   Consider the following scenario:
   Police approach a suspect (who had recently parked his car)
and ask to speak to him. The suspect agrees. The officer asks
for identification, and the suspect produces a driver's license.
Before returning the license, the officer asks for and receives
permission to search the suspect's vehicle. Is that search the
product of valid consent given by a suspect who had not been
"seized" during the encounter? Or, instead, did the officer
detain the suspect by retaining his driver's license, thereby
creating a situation in which a reasonable person would not
feel free to leave? See United States v. De La Rosa, 922 F.2d
675, 678 (11th Cir. 1991); id. at 680-81 (Clark, J., dissenting
on this question).32
   Now imagine a slightly different scenario: Police lawfully
stop a car and ask the driver for his license, which is provided.
166 | UNITED STATES V. MENDENHALL (1980)

Before returning the license, officers ask for permission to
search the car. Is this scenario different from the prior one in
any material way? See United States v. Thompson, 712 F.2d
1356, 1360-61 (11th Cir. 1983).
ATWATER V. CITY OF
LAGO VISTA (2001)

              Supreme Court of the United States

  Gail Atwater v. City of Lago
                 Vista

            Decided April 24, 2001 - 532 U.S. 318

   Justice SOUTER delivered the opinion of the Court.
   The question is whether the Fourth Amendment forbids
a warrantless arrest for a minor criminal offense, such as a
misdemeanor seatbelt violation punishable only by a fine. We
hold that it does not.

                       I

                         A

In Texas, if a car is equipped with safety belts, a front-seat
passenger must wear one, and the driver must secure any small
168 | ATWATER V. CITY OF LAGO VISTA (2001)

child riding in front. Violation of either provision is "a
misdemeanor punishable by a fine not less than $25 or more
than $50." Texas law expressly authorizes "[a]ny peace officer
[to] arrest without warrant a person found committing a
violation" of these seatbelt laws, although it permits police to
issue citations in lieu of arrest.

   In March 1997, petitioner Gail Atwater was driving her
pickup truck in Lago Vista, Texas, with her 3-year-old son
and 5-year-old daughter in the front seat. None of them was
wearing a seatbelt. Respondent Bart Turek, a Lago Vista police
officer at the time, observed the seatbelt violations and pulled
Atwater over. According to Atwater's complaint (the
allegations of which we assume to be true for present
purposes), Turek approached the truck and "yell[ed]"
something to the effect of "[w]e've met before" and "[y]ou're
going to jail." He then called for backup and asked to see
Atwater's driver's license and insurance documentation,
which state law required her to carry. When Atwater told
Turek that she did not have the papers because her purse had
been stolen the day before, Turek said that he had "heard that
story two-hundred times."

   Atwater asked to take her "frightened, upset, and crying"
children to a friend's house nearby, but Turek told her,
"[y]ou're not going anywhere." As it turned out, Atwater's
friend learned what was going on and soon arrived to take
charge of the children. Turek then handcuffed Atwater, placed
her in his squad car, and drove her to the local police station,
                              ATWATER V. CITY OF LAGO VISTA (2001) | 169

where booking officers had her remove her shoes, jewelry, and
eyeglasses, and empty her pockets. Officers took Atwater's
"mug shot" and placed her, alone, in a jail cell for about one
hour, after which she was taken before a magistrate and
released on $310 bond.

   Atwater was charged with driving without her seatbelt
fastened, failing to secure her children in seatbelts, driving
without a license, and failing to provide proof of insurance.
She ultimately pleaded no contest to the misdemeanor seatbelt
offenses and paid a $50 fine; the other charges were dismissed.

                         B

Atwater and her husband, petitioner Michael Haas, filed suit
in a Texas state court against Turek and respondents City of
Lago Vista and Chief of Police Frank Miller. So far as concerns
us, petitioners (whom we will simply call Atwater) alleged that
respondents (for simplicity, the City) had violated Atwater's
Fourth Amendment "right to be free from unreasonable
seizure" and sought compensatory and punitive damages.

   ***

                      II

***
   ...[S]he asks us to mint a new rule of constitutional law on

the understanding that when historical practice fails to speak
170 | ATWATER V. CITY OF LAGO VISTA (2001)

conclusively to a claim grounded on the Fourth Amendment,
courts are left to strike a current balance between individual
and societal interests by subjecting particular contemporary
circumstances to traditional standards of reasonableness.
Atwater accordingly argues for a modern arrest rule, one not
necessarily requiring violent breach of the peace, but
nonetheless forbidding custodial arrest, even upon probable
cause, when conviction could not ultimately carry any jail time
and when the government shows no compelling need for
immediate detention.

   If we were to derive a rule exclusively to address the
uncontested facts of this case, Atwater might well prevail. She
was a known and established resident of Lago Vista with no
place to hide and no incentive to flee, and common sense says
she would almost certainly have buckled up as a condition of
driving off with a citation. In her case, the physical incidents of
arrest were merely gratuitous humiliations imposed by a police
officer who was (at best) exercising extremely poor judgment.
Atwater's claim to live free of pointless indignity and
confinement clearly outweighs anything the City can raise
against it specific to her case.

   But we have traditionally recognized that a responsible
Fourth Amendment balance is not well served by standards
requiring sensitive, case-by-case determinations of government
need, lest every discretionary judgment in the field be
converted into an occasion for constitutional review. Often
enough, the Fourth Amendment has to be applied on the spur
                              ATWATER V. CITY OF LAGO VISTA (2001) | 171

(and in the heat) of the moment, and the object in
implementing its command of reasonableness is to draw
standards sufficiently clear and simple to be applied with a
fair prospect of surviving judicial second-guessing months and
years after an arrest or search is made. Courts attempting to
strike a reasonable Fourth Amendment balance thus credit the
government's side with an essential interest in readily
administrable rules.

   [C]omplications arise the moment we begin to think about
the possible applications of the several criteria Atwater
proposes for drawing a line between minor crimes with limited
arrest authority and others not so restricted.

   One line, she suggests, might be between "jailable" and
"fine-only" offenses, between those for which conviction
could result in commitment and those for which it could not.
The trouble with this distinction, of course, is that an officer
on the street might not be able to tell. It is not merely that
we cannot expect every police officer to know the details of
frequently complex penalty schemes, but that penalties for
ostensibly identical conduct can vary on account of facts
difficult (if not impossible) to know at the scene of an arrest.
Is this the first offense or is the suspect a repeat offender? Is
the weight of the marijuana a gram above or a gram below
the fine-only line? Where conduct could implicate more than
one criminal prohibition, which one will the district attorney
ultimately decide to charge? And so on.

   ***
172 | ATWATER V. CITY OF LAGO VISTA (2001)

   Accordingly, we confirm today what our prior cases have
intimated: the standard of probable cause "applie[s] to all
arrests, without the need to `balance' the interests and
circumstances involved in particular situations." If an officer
has probable cause to believe that an individual has committed
even a very minor criminal offense in his presence, he may,
without violating the Fourth Amendment, arrest the offender.

                     IV

Atwater's arrest satisfied constitutional requirements. There is
no dispute that Officer Turek had probable cause to believe
that Atwater had committed a crime in his presence. She
admits that neither she nor her children were wearing seatbelts.
Turek was accordingly authorized (not required, but
authorized) to make a custodial arrest without balancing costs
and benefits or determining whether or not Atwater's arrest
was in some sense necessary.

   Nor was the arrest made in an "extraordinary manner,
unusually harmful to [her] privacy or ... physical interests."
Atwater's arrest was surely "humiliating," as she says in her
brief, but it was no more "harmful to ... privacy or ... physical
interests" than the normal custodial arrest. She was
handcuffed, placed in a squad car, and taken to the local police
station, where officers asked her to remove her shoes, jewelry,
and glasses, and to empty her pockets. They then took her
photograph and placed her in a cell, alone, for about an hour,
                              ATWATER V. CITY OF LAGO VISTA (2001) | 173

after which she was taken before a magistrate, and released on
$310 bond. The arrest and booking were inconvenient and
embarrassing to Atwater, but not so extraordinary as to violate
the Fourth Amendment.

   The Court of Appeals's en banc judgment is affirmed.
   Justice O'CONNOR, with whom Justice STEVENS,
Justice GINSBURG, and Justice BREYER join, dissenting.
   The Court recognizes that the arrest of Gail Atwater was
a "pointless indignity" that served no discernible state interest
and yet holds that her arrest was constitutionally permissible.
Because the Court's position is inconsistent with the explicit
guarantee of the Fourth Amendment, I dissent.
   A full custodial arrest, such as the one to which Ms. Atwater
was subjected, is the quintessential seizure. When a full
custodial arrest is effected without a warrant, the plain
language of the Fourth Amendment requires that the arrest be
reasonable.
   A custodial arrest exacts an obvious toll on an individual's
liberty and privacy, even when the period of custody is
relatively brief. The arrestee is subject to a full search of her
person and confiscation of her possessions. If the arrestee is the
occupant of a car, the entire passenger compartment of the car,
including packages therein, is subject to search as well.33 The
arrestee may be detained for up to 48 hours without having a
magistrate determine whether there in fact was probable cause
for the arrest. Because people arrested for all types of violent
and nonviolent offenses may be housed together awaiting such
174 | ATWATER V. CITY OF LAGO VISTA (2001)

review, this detention period is potentially dangerous. And
once the period of custody is over, the fact of the arrest is a
permanent part of the public record.

   ***
   Because a full custodial arrest is such a severe intrusion on
an individual's liberty, its reasonableness hinges on "the degree
to which it is needed for the promotion of legitimate
governmental interests." In light of the availability of citations
to promote a State's interests when a fine-only offense has
been committed, I cannot concur in a rule which deems a
full custodial arrest to be reasonable in every circumstance.
Giving police officers constitutional carte blanche to effect an
arrest whenever there is probable cause to believe a fine-only
misdemeanor has been committed is irreconcilable with the
Fourth Amendment's command that seizures be reasonable.
Instead, I would require that when there is probable cause to
believe that a fine-only offense has been committed, the police
officer should issue a citation unless the officer is "able to point
to specific and articulable facts which, taken together with
rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant [the
additional] intrusion" of a full custodial arrest.
   The record in this case makes it abundantly clear that Ms.
Atwater's arrest was constitutionally unreasonable. Atwater
readily admits--as she did when Officer Turek pulled her
over--that she violated Texas' seatbelt law. While Turek was
justified in stopping Atwater, neither law nor reason supports
his decision to arrest her instead of simply giving her a citation.
                              ATWATER V. CITY OF LAGO VISTA (2001) | 175

The officer's actions cannot sensibly be viewed as a permissible
means of balancing Atwater's Fourth Amendment interests
with the State's own legitimate interests.

   ***
   Such unbounded discretion carries with it grave potential
for abuse. The majority takes comfort in the lack of evidence
of "an epidemic of unnecessary minor-offense arrests." But the
relatively small number of published cases dealing with such
arrests proves little and should provide little solace. Indeed,
as the recent debate over racial profiling demonstrates all too
clearly, a relatively minor traffic infraction may often serve as
an excuse for stopping and harassing an individual. After
today, the arsenal available to any officer extends to a full arrest
and the searches permissible concomitant to that arrest. An
officer's subjective motivations for making a traffic stop are
not relevant considerations in determining the reasonableness
of the stop. But it is precisely because these motivations are
beyond our purview that we must vigilantly ensure that
officers' poststop actions--which are properly within our
reach--comport with the Fourth Amendment's guarantee of
reasonableness.
   The Court neglects the Fourth Amendment's express
command in the name of administrative ease. In so doing, it
cloaks the pointless indignity that Gail Atwater suffered with
the mantle of reasonableness. I respectfully dissent.
176 | ATWATER V. CITY OF LAGO VISTA (2001)

Notes, Comments, and Questions

The result in Atwater may exemplify a maxim popularized by
Justice Antonin Scalia, who once observed during a speech,
"A lot of stuff that's stupid is not unconstitutional." Justice
Scalia added that during a prior speech, he had proposed that
all federal judges should receive a stamp with the words
"STUPID BUT CONSTITUTIONAL" that could be used
on complaints; then someone sent him one. Scalia, like others
expressing similar sentiments, was known to argue that if you
wish to prohibit stupid (but constitutional) conduct, you
should contact your legislature, not federal judges.

   If students encounter examples in this book of disagreeable
police (or prosecutorial) conduct that the Court has deemed
constitutional, they may wish to ask themselves two questions:
(1) Is it plausible that a legislature can solve the problem that
the Court has declined to solve, and (2) what specific
suggestions might I have for my legislator? Most students are
far more likely to become legislators than Supreme Court
Justices.
TENNESSEE V. GARNER
(1984)

                       U.S. Supreme Court

Tennessee v. Garner, 471 U.S.
                1 (1984)

   JUSTICE WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.
   This case requires us to determine the constitutionality of
the use of deadly force to prevent the escape of an apparently
unarmed suspected felon. We conclude that such force may
not be used unless it is necessary to prevent the escape and the
officer has probable cause to believe that the suspect poses a
significant threat of death or serious physical injury to the
officer or others.

                       I

At about 10:45 p. m. on October 3, 1974, Memphis Police
Officers Elton Hymon and Leslie Wright were dispatched to
178 | TENNESSEE V. GARNER (1984)

answer a "prowler inside call." Upon arriving at the scene, they
saw a woman standing on her porch and gesturing toward
the adjacent house. [Footnote 1] She told them she had heard
glass breaking and that "they" or "someone" was breaking in
next door. While Wright radioed the dispatcher to say that
they were on the scene, Hymon went behind the house. He
heard a door slam and saw someone run across the backyard.
The fleeing suspect, who was appellee-respondent's decedent,
Edward Garner, stopped at a 6-feet-high chain link fence at
the edge of the yard. With the aid of a flashlight, Hymon
was able to see Garner's face and hands. He saw no sign of a
weapon, and, though not certain, was "reasonably sure" and
"figured" that Garner was unarmed. App. 41, 56; Record 219.
He thought Garner was 17 or 18 years old and about 5 5 or
5 7 tall. While Garner was crouched at the base of the fence,
Hymon called out "police, halt" and took a few steps toward
him. Garner then began to climb over the fence. Convinced
that, if Garner made it over the fence, he would elude capture,
Hymon shot him. The bullet hit Garner in the back of the
head. Garner was taken by ambulance to a hospital, where he
died on the operating table. Ten dollars and a purse taken from
the house were found on his body.

   In using deadly force to prevent the escape, Hymon was
acting under the authority of a Tennessee statute and pursuant
to Police Department policy. The statute provides that

   "[i]f, after notice of the intention to arrest the defendant, he
                                            TENNESSEE V. GARNER (1984) | 179

either flee or forcibly resist, the officer may use all the necessary
means to effect the arrest."

   Tenn.Code Ann. 40-7-108 (1982). The Department policy
was slightly more restrictive than the statute, but still allowed
the use of deadly force in cases of burglary. App. 140-144.
The incident was reviewed by the Memphis Police Firearm's
Review Board and presented to a grand jury. Neither took any
action.Id.at 57.

   Garner's father then brought this action in the Federal
District Court for the Western District of Tennessee, seeking
damages under 42 U.S.C. 1983 for asserted violations of
Garner's constitutional rights. The complaint alleged that the
shooting violated the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, and
Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution. It
named as defendants Officer Hymon, the Police Department,
its Director, and the Mayor and city of Memphis. After a 3-day
bench trial, the District Court entered judgment for all
defendants. It dismissed the claims against the Mayor and the
Director for lack of evidence. It then concluded that Hymon's
actions were authorized by the Tennessee statute, which in
turn was constitutional. Hymon had employed the only
reasonable and practicable means of preventing Garner's
escape. Garner had "recklessly and heedlessly attempted to
vault over the fence to escape, thereby assuming the risk of
being fired upon." App. to Pet. for Cert. A10.

   ***
   The [U.S.] Court of Appeals reversed and remanded. 710
180 | TENNESSEE V. GARNER (1984)

F.2d 240 (1983). It reasoned that the killing of a fleeing suspect
is a "seizure" under the Fourth Amendment, and is therefore
constitutional only if "reasonable." The Tennessee statute
failed as applied to this case, because it did not adequately limit
the use of deadly force by distinguishing between felonies of
different magnitudes -- "the facts, as found, did not justify
the use of deadly force under the Fourth Amendment."Id.at
246. Officers cannot resort to deadly force unless they "have
probable cause . . . to believe that the suspect [has committed
a felony and] poses a threat to the safety of the officers or a
danger to the community if left at large."

   ***
   Whenever an officer restrains the freedom of a person to
walk away, he has seized that person.United States v. Brignoni-
Ponce,422 U.S. 873, 878(1975). While it is not always clear
just when minimal police interference becomes a seizure,see
United States v. Mendenhall,446 U. S. 544(1980), there can
be no question that apprehension by the use of deadly force
is a seizure subject to the reasonableness requirement of the
Fourth Amendment.

                         A

A police officer may arrest a person if he has probable cause
to believe that person committed a crime.E.g., United States v.
Watson,423 U. S. 411(1976). Petitioners and appellant argue
that, if this requirement is satisfied, the Fourth Amendment
                                            TENNESSEE V. GARNER (1984) | 181

has nothing to say about how that seizure is made. This
submission ignores the many cases in which this Court, by
balancing the extent of the intrusion against the need for it, has
examined the reasonableness of the manner in which a search
or seizure is conducted. To determine the constitutionality of
a seizure,

   "[w]e must balance the nature and quality of the intrusion
on the individual's Fourth Amendment interests against the
importance of the governmental interests alleged to justify the
intrusion."

   ***
   The same balancing process applied in the cases cited above
demonstrates that, notwithstanding probable cause to seize a
suspect, an officer may not always do so by killing him. The
intrusiveness of a seizure by means of deadly force is
unmatched. The suspect's fundamental interest in his own life
need not be elaborated upon. The use of deadly force also
frustrates the interest of the individual, and of society, in
judicial determination of guilt and punishment. Against these
interests are ranged governmental interests in effective law
enforcement. It is argued that overall violence will be reduced
by encouraging the peaceful submission of suspects who know
that they may be shot if they flee. Effectiveness in making
arrests requires the resort to deadly force, or at least the
meaningful threat thereof. "Being able to arrest such
individuals is a condition precedent to the state's entire system
of law enforcement." Brief for Petitioners 14.
182 | TENNESSEE V. GARNER (1984)

   Without in any way disparaging the importance of these
goals, we are not convinced that the use of deadly force is a
sufficiently productive means of accomplishing them to justify
the killing of nonviolent suspects.Cf. Delaware v. Prouse,
supra,at 659. The use of deadly force is a self-defeating way
of apprehending a suspect and so setting the criminal justice
mechanism in motion. If successful, it guarantees that that
mechanism will not be set in motion. And while the
meaningful threat of deadly force might be thought to lead
to the arrest of more live suspects by discouraging escape
attempts, the presently available evidence does not support
this thesis. The fact is that a majority of police departments
in this country have forbidden the use of deadly force against
nonviolent suspects.See infraat 18-19. If those charged with
the enforcement of the criminal law have abjured the use of
deadly force in arresting nondangerous felons, there is a
substantial basis for doubting that the use of such force is an
essential attribute of the arrest power in all felony cases.See
Schumann v. McGinn,307 Minn. 446, 472,240 N.W.2d 525,
540 (1976) (Rogosheske, J., dissenting in part). Petitioners and
appellant have not persuaded us that shooting nondangerous
fleeing suspects is so vital as to outweigh the suspect's interest
in his own life.

   The use of deadly force to prevent the escape of all felony
suspects, whatever the circumstances, is constitutionally
unreasonable. It is not better that all felony suspects die than
that they escape. Where the suspect poses no immediate threat
                                            TENNESSEE V. GARNER (1984) | 183

to the officer and no threat to others, the harm resulting from
failing to apprehend him does not justify the use of deadly
force to do so. It is no doubt unfortunate when a suspect
who is in sight escapes, but the fact that the police arrive a
little late or are a little slower afoot does not always justify
killing the suspect. A police officer may not seize an unarmed,
nondangerous suspect by shooting him dead. The Tennessee
statute is unconstitutional insofar as it authorizes the use of
deadly force against such fleeing suspects.

   ***
   Note: Members of the public, including students, often
assume that if police improperly use excessive force and
thereby cause injuries or deaths, the police actions violate the
8th Amendment prohibition on cruel and unusual
punishments. In fact, excessive use of force by the police
constitutes an "unreasonable seizure" in violation of the 4th
Amendment, as discussed in Tennessee v. Garner. The 8th
Amendment Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause only
protects people who are being "punished" and the Supreme
Court has limited the definition of punishment to mean
people who have been convicted and sentenced for
committing a crime. People against whom police officers use
force are criminal suspects--or innocent bystanders--who
have not been convicted of any crime. Thus, the 4th
Amendment applies rather than the 8th Amendment.
   To further illustrate the point about the narrow definition
of "punishment" in order to apply the 8th Amendment, in
184 | TENNESSEE V. GARNER (1984)

1977 the Supreme Court issued its decision in Ingraham v.
Wright. At a junior high school in Florida, a student was
given 20 "licks" with a wooden paddle by an assistant principal
for being slow in responding to a teacher's instructions. The
paddling caused injuries that kept the student out of school for
several days. Even though the student was being "punished" in
any conventional usage of the word, the Supreme Court said
that he was not being "punished" according to the meaning
of the 8th Amendment which applies only to punishments
imposed for criminal convictions. The Supreme Court ruled
against the student's claim that the arbitrary paddlings
administered by school officials violated the Cruel and
Unusual Punishments Clause or the Due Process Clause, for
not giving students a hearing to challenge any evidence against
them and tell their side of the story.
PART IX

FOURTH
AMENDMENT:
WARRANTS

              Warrants

The Court has stated repeatedly that searches conducted
without a warrant are presumptively "unreasonable" and,
accordingly, are presumptive violations of the Fourth
Amendment. Although one can argue whether the Court
truly enforces a "warrant requirement"--see Justice Thomas's
dissent in Groh v. Ramirez below--one cannot deny the
importance of valid warrants to a huge range of police
conduct. For example, absent exceptional circumstances (such
as officers chasing a fleeing felon), police normally must have
a valid warrant to search a residence without the occupant's
permission.

   To be valid, a warrant must obey the Fourth Amendment's
command that "no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable
cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly
describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things
to be seized." This portion of the Amendment is known as the
186 | FOURTH AMENDMENT: WARRANTS

"Warrant Clause." It requires: (1) that the evidence presented
to the issuing judge or magistrate be sufficient to qualify as
"probable cause," (2) that the officers bringing the evidence
to the judge or magistrate swear or affirm that the evidence is
true to the best of their knowledge, (3) that the warrant specify
where officers can search, and (4) that the warrant specify what
things or persons officers may look for and may seize if found.

   In addition, the Court has held that only a "neutral and
detached magistrate" may issue a warrant. See Coolidge v. New
Hampshire, 403 U.S. 443 (1971). That means the judge or
magistrate must be independent of law enforcement; a state
attorney general cannot issue warrants. In Connally v. Georgia,
429 U.S. 245 (1977), the Court held that a justice of the peace
who received payment upon issuing a warrant, but no fee upon
denying a warrant application, was not "neutral and
detached."
RICHARDS V.
WISCONSIN (1997)

              Supreme Court of the United States

        Steiney Richards v.
             Wisconsin

             Decided April 28, 1997 - 520 U.S. 385

   Justice STEVENS delivered the opinion of the
[unanimous] Court.

   In Wilson v. Arkansas, we held that the Fourth Amendment
incorporates the common law requirement that police officers
entering a dwelling must knock on the door and announce
their identity and purpose before attempting forcible entry. At
the same time, we recognized that the "flexible requirement
of reasonableness should not be read to mandate a rigid rule
of announcement that ignores countervailing law enforcement
interests," and left "to the lower courts the task of determining
the circumstances under which an unannounced entry is
reasonable under the Fourth Amendment."
188 | RICHARDS V. WISCONSIN (1997)

   In this case, the Wisconsin Supreme Court concluded that
police officers are never required to knock and announce their
presence when executing a search warrant in a felony drug
investigation. In so doing, it reaffirmed a pre-Wilson holding
and concluded that Wilson did not preclude this per se rule.
We disagree with the court's conclusion that the Fourth
Amendment permits a blanket exception to the knock-and-
announce requirement for this entire category of criminal
activity. But because the evidence presented to support the
officers' actions in this case establishes that the decision not
to knock and announce was a reasonable one under the
circumstances, we affirm the judgment of the Wisconsin court.

                       I

On December 31, 1991, police officers in Madison, Wisconsin,
obtained a warrant to search Steiney Richards' motel room for
drugs and related paraphernalia. The search warrant was the
culmination of an investigation that had uncovered substantial
evidence that Richards was one of several individuals dealing
drugs out of motel rooms in Madison. The police requested
a warrant that would have given advance authorization for a
"no-knock" entry into the motel room, but the Magistrate
explicitly deleted those portions of the warrant.

   The officers arrived at the motel room at 3:40 a.m. Officer
Pharo, dressed as a maintenance man, led the team. With him
were several plainclothes officers and at least one man in
                                         RICHARDS V. WISCONSIN (1997) | 189

uniform. Officer Pharo knocked on Richards' door and,
responding to the query from inside the room, stated that
he was a maintenance man. With the chain still on the door,
Richards cracked it open. Although there is some dispute as
to what occurred next, Richards acknowledges that when he
opened the door he saw the man in uniform standing behind
Officer Pharo. He quickly slammed the door closed and, after
waiting two or three seconds, the officers began kicking and
ramming the door to gain entry to the locked room. At trial,
the officers testified that they identified themselves as police
while they were kicking the door in. When they finally did
break into the room, the officers caught Richards trying to
escape through the window. They also found cash and cocaine
hidden in plastic bags above the bathroom ceiling tiles.

   Richards sought to have the evidence from his motel room
suppressed on the ground that the officers had failed to knock
and announce their presence prior to forcing entry into the
room. The trial court denied the motion, concluding that the
officers could gather from Richards' strange behavior when
they first sought entry that he knew they were police officers
and that he might try to destroy evidence or to escape. The
judge emphasized that the easily disposable nature of the drugs
the police were searching for further justified their decision
to identify themselves as they crossed the threshold instead
of announcing their presence before seeking entry. Richards
appealed the decision to the Wisconsin Supreme Court and
that court affirmed.
190 | RICHARDS V. WISCONSIN (1997)

   The Wisconsin Supreme Court did not delve into the events
underlying Richards' arrest in any detail, but accepted the
following facts: "[O]n December 31, 1991, police executed a
search warrant for the motel room of the defendant seeking
evidence of the felonious crime of Possession with Intent to
Deliver a Controlled Substance in violation of Wis. Stat. §
161.41(1m) (1991-92). They did not knock and announce
prior to their entry. Drugs were seized."

                       II

We recognized in Wilson that the knock-and-announce
requirement could give way "under circumstances presenting
a threat of physical violence," or "where police officers have
reason to believe that evidence would likely be destroyed if
advance notice were given." It is indisputable that felony drug
investigations may frequently involve both of these
circumstances. The question we must resolve is whether this
fact justifies dispensing with case-by-case evaluation of the
manner in which a search was executed.

   The Wisconsin court explained its blanket exception as
necessitated by the special circumstances of today's drug
culture, and the State asserted at oral argument that the
blanket exception was reasonable in "felony drug cases because
of the convergence in a violent and dangerous form of
commerce of weapons and the destruction of drugs." But
creating exceptions to the knock-and-announce rule based on
                                          RICHARDS V. WISCONSIN (1997) | 191

the "culture" surrounding a general category of criminal
behavior presents at least two serious concerns.

   First, the exception contains considerable
overgeneralization. For example, while drug investigation
frequently does pose special risks to officer safety and the
preservation of evidence, not every drug investigation will pose
these risks to a substantial degree. For example, a search could
be conducted at a time when the only individuals present in a
residence have no connection with the drug activity and thus
will be unlikely to threaten officers or destroy evidence. Or the
police could know that the drugs being searched for were of
a type or in a location that made them impossible to destroy
quickly. In those situations, the asserted governmental
interests in preserving evidence and maintaining safety may
not outweigh the individual privacy interests intruded upon
by a no-knock entry. Wisconsin's blanket rule impermissibly
insulates these cases from judicial review.

   A second difficulty with permitting a criminal-category
exception to the knock-and-announce requirement is that the
reasons for creating an exception in one category can, relatively
easily, be applied to others. Armed bank robbers, for example,
are, by definition, likely to have weapons, and the fruits of
their crime may be destroyed without too much difficulty. If
a per se exception were allowed for each category of criminal
investigation that included a considerable--albeit
hypothetical--risk of danger to officers or destruction of
evidence, the knock-and-announce element of the Fourth
192 | RICHARDS V. WISCONSIN (1997)

Amendment's reasonableness requirement would be
meaningless.

   Thus, the fact that felony drug investigations may
frequently present circumstances warranting a no-knock entry
cannot remove from the neutral scrutiny of a reviewing court
the reasonableness of the police decision not to knock and
announce in a particular case. Instead, in each case, it is the
duty of a court confronted with the question to determine
whether the facts and circumstances of the particular entry
justified dispensing with the knock-and-announce
requirement.

   In order to justify a "no-knock" entry, the police must have
a reasonable suspicion that knocking and announcing their
presence, under the particular circumstances, would be
dangerous or futile, or that it would inhibit the effective
investigation of the crime by, for example, allowing the
destruction of evidence. This standard--as opposed to a
probable-cause requirement--strikes the appropriate balance
between the legitimate law enforcement concerns at issue in
the execution of search warrants and the individual privacy
interests affected by no-knock entries. This showing is not
high, but the police should be required to make it whenever
the reasonableness of a no-knock entry is challenged.

                      III

Although we reject the Wisconsin court's blanket exception to
                                         RICHARDS V. WISCONSIN (1997) | 193

the knock-and-announce requirement, we conclude that the
officers' no-knock entry into Richards' motel room did not
violate the Fourth Amendment. We agree with the trial court
that the circumstances in this case show that the officers had
a reasonable suspicion that Richards might destroy evidence if
given further opportunity to do so.

   ***

Notes, Comments, and Questions

When police "knock and announce," they are often not
obligated to wait very long before forcing entry. In United
States v. Banks, 540 U.S. 31 (2003), the Court found that
a "15-to-20-second wait before a forcible entry" was justified
by the circumstances, and federal courts have approved even
shorter wait times.34 Short wait times are especially likely to be
deemed reasonable if officers are searching for drugs and hear
no response after knocking and announcing. The necessary
time officers must wait before "reasonably" breaking a door
varies depending on factors such as what police seek, the
anticipated dangerousness of persons likely to be on the
premises, and how persons react to the arrival of officers.

   The 2017 news that federal agents conducted a no-knock
raid against Paul Manafort, the former presidential campaign
manager for Donald Trump, inspired new interest in the
phenomenon of no-knock entries and the breaking of doors
by police. Although some commentators suggested that such
194 | RICHARDS V. WISCONSIN (1997)

raids are unusual, it would have been more accurate to say that
such raids are unusual for suspects like Paul Manafort. In drug
cases, no-knock raids are not unusual at all.35

   Students interested in what happens when police execute
warrants, particularly without knocking and announcing, may
appreciate Radley Balko's book Rise of the Warrior Cop
(2013). Balko observed:

      Today in America SWAT teams violently smash into
      private homes more than one hundred times per day. The
      vast majority of these raids are to enforce laws against
      consensual crimes.36 In many cities, police departments
      have given up the traditional blue uniforms for "battle
      dress uniforms" modeled after soldier attire. Police
      departments across the country now sport armored
      personnel carriers designed for use on a battlefield. ... They
      carry military-grade weapons. Most of this equipment
      comes from the military itself. Many SWAT teams today
      are trained by current and former personnel from special
      forces units.37

Balko notes also that despite the Supreme Court's guidance
concerning no-knock raids--that is, holdings that the Fourth
Amendment limits the use of such tactics--"the police officers
interviewed for this book unanimously told me that beginning
in about the mid-1980s, judges almost never denied their
requests for a search warrant" and that "knock-and-announce
requests were never a problem."38

   In March 2020, no-knock warrants gained national
attention after police in Louisville, Kentucky shot and killed
                                         RICHARDS V. WISCONSIN (1997) | 195

Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old emergency room technician.
Police entered her apartment soon after midnight on March
13, under authority of a no-knock warrant issued by a judge.
Taylor's boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, said later that when
police entered, he and Taylor believed they were victims of
a burglary and did not know that the persons entering their
home were police officers. Officers said later that they did
knock and announce. After police entered, Walker shot at the
officers, hitting one in the leg. Police fired back, killing Taylor.
She was shot at least eight times. The warrant had been issued
as part of an investigation into drug sales. No drugs were found
in Taylor's apartment. Taylor's death was one of
several--including the May 2020 killing of George Floyd by
police in Minneapolis--that inspired nationwide protests.
Louisville officials announced new policies relating to no-
knock warrants in the wake of protests. In addition, some
have argued that under existing law set forth in Wilson and
Richards, the no-knock warrant in Taylor's case was not
lawfully issued. (In August 2022, the U.S. Department of
Justice announced that four officers involved in executing the
warrant at Taylor's residence would face criminal charges for
violating her civil rights, use of excessive force, and obstructing
justice by creating a false cover story about the events that led
to Taylor's death).

   If mere presence during the execution of a search warrant
does not justify the search of a person, it follows that mere
presence surely does not justify arresting everyone present. To
196 | RICHARDS V. WISCONSIN (1997)

reinforce this message, the Legal Bureau of the New York
Police Department issued a bulletin in 2013 to this effect.39
In response to the question, "May a police officer arrest all
persons found in a location during the execution of a search
warrant?," the bulletin answered, "No. An individual's mere
presence in a search location does not establish probable cause
to arrest."

   Note that while police may detain persons present at the
location to be searched, they may not detain persons who
happened to be at the location earlier but have already left
before police arrive to execute the warrant. In Bailey v. United
States, 568 U.S. 186 (2013), the Court held that the rule of
Michigan v. Summers, 452 U.S. 692 (1981) applies only to
those in "the immediate vicinity of the premises to be
searched." The Court explained, "Because detention is
justified by the interests in executing a safe and efficient search,
the decision to detain must be acted upon at the scene of the
search and not at a later time in a more remote place." In
Bailey, officers had followed two men 0.7 miles after seeing
them leave the building officers had been about to search. The
Court found the detention unreasonable. In a dissent, Justice
Breyer complained that "immediate vicinity" was not defined
by the majority.

Notes, Comments, and Questions

One issue is the question of when a warrant goes "stale." A
                                         RICHARDS V. WISCONSIN (1997) | 197

warrant based upon probable cause to believe that contraband
or suspects will be found in a certain place becomes less reliable
over time. To pick an extreme example, if police receive a
warrant in 2018 to search a particular house for a suspect, news
that the suspect died in 2019 would make it unreasonable
for police to execute the warrant in 2021. Actual cases will
present closer questions. For example, a warrant to search for
drugs recently delivered to the house of a dealer might go stale
relatively quickly because the dealer is likely to sell the drugs
soon. By contrast, courts have found that collectors of child
pornography rarely destroy their material, meaning that
warrants to search their computers for illicit images do not go
stale. Similarly, a warrant to search an accountant's office for
documents proving a client's tax fraud would probably remain
"fresh" for a long time.

   A 2010 raid on a Columbia, Missouri home illustrates the
issue. Police had an eight-day-old warrant to search the house
of Jonathan Whitworth for drugs. The raid went poorly, and
officers shot two dogs, killing one. Officers pointed guns at
Whitworth's wife and her seven-year-old daughter. While
some contraband was found, police did not discover evidence
of significant drug dealing.40 Whitworth and his family sued
the police, alleging among other things that the warrant was
stale when executed. Although the court dismissed the lawsuit,
Columbia police adopted new policies in response to outcry
over the incident.41 (A video of the raid--which is unpleasant

FOURTH
AMENDMENT:
WARRANT
EXCEPTIONS
(PERMISSIBLE
WARRANTLESS
SEARCH
SITUATIONS)

     Warrant Exceptions or
    Permissible Warrantless

        Search Situations

The Court has stated repeatedly over the decades that searches
and seizures conducted without warrants are presumptively
unlawful. The Court has also, however, created several
206 | FOURTH AMENDMENT: WARRANT EXCEPTIONS
(PERMISSIBLE WARRANTLESS SEARCH SITUATIONS)

exceptions to the warrant requirement. We will spend the next
several chapters exploring these exceptions.

   One way to think about situations in which warrantless
searches are permissible is to place these situations in
categories. One common way to categorize these situations is
presented in the following list:

  · Plain View Doctrine (evidence in plain view of officer in
      location where officer is legally permitted to be)

  · Automobile Searches (depending on circumstances,
      warrants are not required for certain automobile
      searches)

  · Searches Incident to a Lawful Arrest (after arresting an
      individual, officers can search the individual and look
      around the immediate area of the arrest to make sure
      there is no weapon within reach of the individual and no
      evidence that the arrestee might destroy)

  · Consent Searches (individuals with authority over a
      location or apparent authority over a location can give a
      consent to a warrantless search if the consent is
      voluntary)

  · Exigent Circumstances (officers can conduct searches
      without a warrant in urgent situations with immediate
      risks of danger to the officers or others, or certain risks of
      immediate loss of evidence that would occur through
      the delay involved in getting a warrant)

  · Special Needs Beyond the Normal Purposes of Law
      FOURTH AMENDMENT: WARRANT EXCEPTIONS (PERMISSIBLE

      Enforcement, also known as the "Special Needs"
      category for searches, with the searches limited in nature
      based on the justification for the search (border entry
      points, airports, drug testing of certain categories of
      people, entry points for sporting events and concerts,
      drunk driving and immigration checkpoints, DNA tests
      of arrestees for violent crimes, etc.)
  · Stop and Frisk searches based on officers' observations of
      potential criminal conduct and dangerousness of an
      individual; often called "Terry searches" after the
      original Supreme Court decision in Terry v. Ohio (1968)
  · Administrative Searches, typically for health and safety
      purposes, such as building code inspections, restaurant
      inspections for compliance with public health codes, etc.

For every warrant exception, students should consider: (1)
when the exception applies and (2) what the exception allows
police to do. In particular, students should note whether
probable cause is necessary for the exception to apply and, if
not, what other quantum of evidence is required.

   In this chapter, we consider the "plain view exception" and
the "automobile exception," each of which has grown over
time. In our first case, the Court considered both exceptions.
THE PLAIN VIEW
EXCEPTION (PLAIN

   The Plain View Exception

The "plain view" exception to the Fourth Amendment
warrant requirement permits a law enforcement officer to seize
what clearly is incriminating evidence or contraband when it
is discovered in a place where the officer has a right to be.

In Coolidge v. New Hampshire, 403 U.S. 443 (1971), the Court
stated that the "plain view exception" existed but did not
justify the search at issue in the case. In Arizona v. Hicks, 480
U.S. 321 (1987), the Court explained the plain view exception
further. As the Hicks Court sets forth, the plain view exception
can apply only if an officer conducts a seizure (1) while the
210 | THE PLAIN VIEW EXCEPTION (PLAIN VIEW DOCTRINE)

officer is somewhere the officer has the lawful right to be (e.g.,
while on a public sidewalk, or inside a house executing a
warrant) and (2) the officer has probable cause to believe that
the object is subject to seizure. Objects are subject to seizure
if they are contraband or are otherwise evidence of, fruits of,
or instrumentalities of a crime. ("Contraband" refers to items
that are unlawful to possess, such as illegal drugs.) In Hicks,
an officer was lawfully inside a house and spotted an object
the officer believed to be stolen. But because the officer lacked
probable cause to support his belief upon picking up the item,
the officer's seizure of the object (a stolen stereo) was deemed
outside the scope of the exception--that is, it was unlawful.

   In Horton v. California, 496 U.S. 128 (1990), the Court
expanded the scope of the plain view exception by removing
the "inadvertence requirement" set forth in Justice Stewart's
plurality opinion in Coolidge. Although the Horton Court
described Coolidge as "binding precedent," it held that the
inadvertence requirement was not "essential" to the Court's
result in Coolidge. As the Horton majority put it, for the
exception to apply, "not only must the officer be lawfully
located in a place from which the object can be plainly seen,
but he or she must also have a lawful right of access to the
object itself." In addition, "not only must the item be in plain
view; its incriminating character must also be `immediately
apparent.'"
THE AUTOMOBILE
EXCEPTION

  The Automobile Exception

In the early 2000s, hip hop mogul Jay-Z released "99
Problems," a song that concerned--among other things--the
law governing when police may search the vehicles of criminal
suspects. The song recounts a conversation between the rapper
and a police officer who pulled him over in 1994.

                  Officer: Do you mind if I look around the car
               a little bit?

                  Jay-Z: Well, my glove compartment is locked,
               so is the trunk and the back,

                         And I know my rights so you go'n need
                      a warrant for that
                  Officer: Aren't you sharp as a tack, some type
               of lawyer or something

                         Or somebody important or
                      something?"
                  Jay-Z: Nah I ain't pass the bar but I know a
               little bit ...43
   Professor Caleb Mason published an essay in 2012 that
212 | THE AUTOMOBILE EXCEPTION

examines "99 Problems" in great detail, focusing particularly
on its relevance to criminal procedure.44

      If this Essay serves no other purpose, I hope it serves to
      debunk, for any readers who persist in believing it, the
      myth that locking your trunk will keep the cops from
      searching it. Based on the number of my students who
      arrived at law school believing that if you lock your trunk
      and glove compartment, the police will need a warrant to
      search them, I surmise that it's even more widespread
      among the lay public. But it's completely, 100% wrong.

         There is no warrant requirement for car searches. The
      Supreme Court has declared unequivocally that because
      cars are inherently mobile (and are pervasively regulated,
      and operated in public spaces), it is reasonable under the
      Fourth Amendment for the police to search the car-the
      whole car, and everything in the car, including
      containers-whenever they have probable cause to believe
      that the car contains evidence of crime.You don't have to
      arrest the person, or impound the vehicle. You just need
      probable cause to believe that the car contains evidence of
      crime. So, in any vehicle stop, the officers may search the
      entire car, without consent, if they develop probable cause
      to believe that car contains, say, drugs.

         All the action, in short, is about probable cause.
      Warrants never come into the picture. The fact that the
      trunk and glove compartments are locked is completely
      irrelevant. Now, Jay-Z may have just altered the lyrics for
      dramatic effect, but that would be unfortunate insofar as
      the song is going to reach many more people than any
      criminal procedure lecture, and everyone should really
                                           THE AUTOMOBILE EXCEPTION | 213

      know the outline of the law in this area.What the line
      should say is: "You'll need some p.c. for that."

In Collins v. Virginia, 138 S. Ct. 1663 (2018), the Court
decided "whether the automobile exception to the Fourth
Amendment permits a police officer, uninvited and without
a warrant, to enter the curtilage of a home in order to search
a vehicle parked therein." For the majority, the question was
straightforward. In an opinion joined by six other Justices,
Justice Sotomayor wrote: "Because the scope of the
automobile exception extends no further than the automobile
itself, it did not justify Officer Rhodes' invasion of the
curtilage. Nothing in this Court's case law suggests that the
automobile exception gives an officer the right to enter a home
or its curtilage to access a vehicle without a warrant. Such
an expansion would both undervalue the core Fourth
Amendment protection afforded to the home and its curtilage
and `"untether"' the exception `"from the justifications
underlying"' it." The Court rejected the idea "that the
automobile exception is a categorical one that permits the
warrantless search of a vehicle anytime, anywhere, including in
a home or curtilage."

   Justice Alito dissented sharply, quoting Charles Dickens: "If
that is the law, [a character in Oliver Twist] exclaimed, `the
law is a ass--a idiot.'" Justice Alito noted, "If the motorcycle
had been parked at the curb, instead of in the driveway, it
is undisputed that Rhodes could have searched it without
obtaining a warrant." He found it bizarre that search became
214 | THE AUTOMOBILE EXCEPTION

"unreasonable" "[b]ecause, in order to reach the motorcycle,
[the officer] had to walk 30 feet or so up the driveway of the
house rented by petitioner's girlfriend, and by doing that, ...
invaded the home's `curtilage.'"

AMENDMENT:

EXCEPTIONS (PART
2)
SEARCH INCIDENT TO A
LAWFUL ARREST

Warrant Exception: Searches
  Incident to a Lawful Arrest

When police perform a lawful arrest, they are allowed to search
the arrestee. The permissible scope of such searches--known
as searches incident to lawful arrest ("SILA")--has been the
subject of multiple Supreme Court cases. No warrant is
required for a SILA.45

   For a search to be justified as a SILA: (1) there must have
been an arrest, (2) the arrest must have been "lawful," and (3)
the search must be "incident" to the arrest--that is, close in
time and space to the arrest.

   Later in the semester, we will study when arrests are
permitted. For now, note that because police often need no
warrant to arrest a suspect, a SILA can sometimes result from
two distinct warrant exceptions. The first allows the
underlying arrest, and the second allows the ensuing search.
CHIMEL V. CALIFORNIA
(1969)

              Supreme Court of the United States

      Ted Steven Chimel v.
              California

             Decided June 23, 1969 - 395 U.S. 752
   Mr. Justice STEWART delivered the opinion of the Court.
   This case raises basic questions concerning the permissible
scope under the Fourth Amendment of a search incident to a
lawful arrest.
   The relevant facts are essentially undisputed. Late in the
afternoon of September 13, 1965, three police officers arrived
at the Santa Ana, California, home of the petitioner with a
warrant authorizing his arrest for the burglary of a coin shop.
The officers knocked on the door, identified themselves to the
petitioner's wife, and asked if they might come inside. She
ushered them into the house, where they waited 10 or 15
minutes until the petitioner returned home from work. When
the petitioner entered the house, one of the officers handed
                                            CHIMEL V. CALIFORNIA (1969) | 219

him the arrest warrant and asked for permission to "look
around." The petitioner objected, but was advised that "on
the basis of the lawful arrest," the officers would nonetheless
conduct a search. No search warrant had been issued.

   Accompanied by the petitioner's wife, the officers then
looked through the entire three-bedroom house, including the
attic, the garage, and a small workshop. In some rooms the
search was relatively cursory. In the master bedroom and
sewing room, however, the officers directed the petitioner's
wife to open drawers and "to physically move contents of the
drawers from side to side so that [they] might view any items
that would have come from [the] burglary." After completing
the search, they seized numerous items--primarily coins, but
also several medals, tokens, and a few other objects. The entire
search took between 45 minutes and an hour.

   ***
   When an arrest is made, it is reasonable for the arresting
officer to search the person arrested in order to remove any
weapons that the latter might seek to use in order to resist
arrest or effect his escape. Otherwise, the officer's safety might
well be endangered, and the arrest itself frustrated. In addition,
it is entirely reasonable for the arresting officer to search for
and seize any evidence on the arrestee's person in order to
prevent its concealment or destruction. And the area into
which an arrestee might reach in order to grab a weapon or
evidentiary items must, of course, be governed by a like rule. A
gun on a table or in a drawer in front of one who is arrested can
220 | CHIMEL V. CALIFORNIA (1969)

be as dangerous to the arresting officer as one concealed in the
clothing of the person arrested. There is ample justification,
therefore, for a search of the arrestee's person and the area
"within his immediate control"--construing that phrase to
mean the area from within which he might gain possession of
a weapon or destructible evidence.

   There is no comparable justification, however, for routinely
searching any room other than that in which an arrest
occurs--or, for that matter, for searching through all the desk
drawers or other closed or concealed areas in that room itself.
Such searches, in the absence of well-recognized exceptions,
may be made only under the authority of a search warrant.
The "adherence to judicial processes" mandated by the Fourth
Amendment requires no less.

   ***
   In the next case, the Court made clear that a search cannot
be "incident to a lawful arrest" if no one is arrested.
KNOWLES V. IOWA
(1998)

              Supreme Court of the United States

    Patrick Knowles v. Iowa

              Decided Dec. 8, 1998 - 525 U.S. 113
   Chief Justice REHNQUIST delivered the opinion of the
Court.
   An Iowa police officer stopped petitioner Knowles for
speeding, but issued him a citation rather than arresting him.
The question presented is whether such a procedure
authorizes the officer, consistently with the Fourth
Amendment, to conduct a full search of the car. We answer
this question "no."
   Knowles was stopped in Newton, Iowa, after having been
clocked driving 43 miles per hour on a road where the speed
limit was 25 miles per hour. The police officer issued a citation
to Knowles, although under Iowa law he might have arrested
him. The officer then conducted a full search of the car, and
under the driver's seat he found a bag of marijuana and a "pot
222 | KNOWLES V. IOWA (1998)

pipe." Knowles was then arrested and charged with violation
of state laws dealing with controlled substances.

   Before trial, Knowles moved to suppress the evidence so
obtained. He argued that the search could not be sustained
under the "search incident to arrest" exception because he had
not been placed under arrest. At the hearing on the motion
to suppress, the police officer conceded that he had neither
Knowles' consent nor probable cause to conduct the search.
He relied on Iowa law dealing with such searches.

   [Under Iowa law at the time, when an officer was authorized
to arrest someone for a traffic offense but instead issued a
citation, "the issuance of a citation in lieu of an arrest" did "not
affect the officer's authority to conduct an otherwise lawful
search."]

   ***
   [W]e [have] noted the two historical rationales for the
"search incident to arrest" exception: (1) the need to disarm
the suspect in order to take him into custody, and (2) the
need to preserve evidence for later use at trial. But neither of
these underlying rationales for the search incident to arrest
exception is sufficient to justify the search in the present case.
   ***
   [T]he authority to conduct a full field search as incident
to an arrest [is] a "bright-line rule," which [is] based on the
concern for officer safety and destruction or loss of evidence,
but which [does] not depend in every case upon the existence
of either concern. Here we are asked to extend that "bright-
                                                  KNOWLES V. IOWA (1998) | 223

line rule" to a situation where the concern for officer safety is
not present to the same extent and the concern for destruction
or loss of evidence is not present at all. We decline to do so.
The judgment of the Supreme Court of Iowa is reversed, and
the cause is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent
with this opinion.

       Notes, Comments, and
                Questions

When the Court decided Riley v. California in 2014, it
considered facts about a "container" that would have been
unimaginable in 1973. Just a few decades ago, no arrestee had
in his pocket a mini-computer full of private data, much less
one capable of connecting to even more powerful computers
with vast repositories of additional private information. Today,
most arrestees carry such devices. The question before the
Court was whether the rule from Robinson allows police to
obtain data from a mobile phone found during a search
incident to lawful arrest.
RILEY V. CALIFORNIA
(2014)

              Supreme Court of the United States

David Leon Riley v. California

            Decided June 25, 2014 - 134 S. Ct. 2473
   Chief Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the
Court.
   [This] case[] raise[s] a common question: whether the
police may, without a warrant, search digital information on a
cell phone seized from an individual who has been arrested.

                       I

                         A

[P]etitioner David Riley was stopped by a police officer for
driving with expired registration tags. In the course of the stop,
the officer also learned that Riley's license had been suspended.
The officer impounded Riley's car, pursuant to department
                                                RILEY V. CALIFORNIA (2014) | 225

policy, and another officer conducted an inventory search of
the car. Riley was arrested for possession of concealed and
loaded firearms when that search turned up two handguns
under the car's hood.

   An officer searched Riley incident to the arrest and found
items associated with the "Bloods" street gang. He also seized
a cell phone from Riley's pants pocket. According to Riley's
uncontradicted assertion, the phone was a "smart phone," a
cell phone with a broad range of other functions based on
advanced computing capability, large storage capacity, and
Internet connectivity. The officer accessed information on the
phone and noticed that some words (presumably in text
messages or a contacts list) were preceded by the letters
"CK"--a label that, he believed, stood for "Crip Killers," a
slang term for members of the Bloods gang.

   At the police station about two hours after the arrest, a
detective specializing in gangs further examined the contents
of the phone. The detective testified that he "went through"
Riley's phone "looking for evidence, because ... gang members
will often video themselves with guns or take pictures of
themselves with the guns." Although there was "a lot of stuff"
on the phone, particular files that "caught [the detective's] eye"
included videos of young men sparring while someone yelled
encouragement using the moniker "Blood." The police also
found photographs of Riley standing in front of a car they
suspected had been involved in a shooting a few weeks earlier.

   Riley was ultimately charged, in connection with that
226 | RILEY V. CALIFORNIA (2014)

earlier shooting, with firing at an occupied vehicle, assault with
a semiautomatic firearm, and attempted murder. The State
alleged that Riley had committed those crimes for the benefit
of a criminal street gang, an aggravating factor that carries an
enhanced sentence. Prior to trial, Riley moved to suppress all
evidence that the police had obtained from his cell phone. He
contended that the searches of his phone violated the Fourth
Amendment, because they had been performed without a
warrant and were not otherwise justified by exigent
circumstances. The trial court rejected that argument. At
Riley's trial, police officers testified about the photographs and
videos found on the phone, and some of the photographs were
admitted into evidence. Riley was convicted on all three counts
and received an enhanced sentence of 15 years to life in prison.

   The California Court of Appeal affirmed. The court relied
on [] California Supreme Court [precedent], which held that
the Fourth Amendment permits a warrantless search of cell
phone data incident to an arrest, so long as the cell phone was
immediately associated with the arrestee's person.

   The California Supreme Court denied Riley's petition for
review and we granted certiorari.

                       II

In the absence of a warrant, a search is reasonable only if it falls
within a specific exception to the warrant requirement.

   The [] case[] before us concern[s] the reasonableness of a
                                                RILEY V. CALIFORNIA (2014) | 227

warrantless search incident to a lawful arrest. In 1914, this
Court first acknowledged in dictum "the right on the part
of the Government, always recognized under English and
American law, to search the person of the accused when legally
arrested to discover and seize the fruits or evidences of crime."
Since that time, it has been well accepted that such a search
constitutes an exception to the warrant requirement. Indeed,
the label "exception" is something of a misnomer in this
context, as warrantless searches incident to arrest occur with
far greater frequency than searches conducted pursuant to a
warrant.

   Although the existence of the exception for such searches
has been recognized for a century, its scope has been debated
for nearly as long. That debate has focused on the extent to
which officers may search property found on or near the
arrestee. [The Court then discussed the development of the
law in Chimel, Robinson, and Gant.]

                      III

[We now must] decide how the search incident to arrest
doctrine applies to modern cell phones, which are now such
a pervasive and insistent part of daily life that the proverbial
visitor from Mars might conclude they were an important
feature of human anatomy. A smart phone of the sort taken
from Riley was unheard of ten years ago; a significant majority
of American adults now own such phones. [The] phone[] [is]
228 | RILEY V. CALIFORNIA (2014)

based on technology nearly inconceivable just a few decades
ago, whenChimelandRobinsonwere decided.

   Absent more precise guidance from the founding era, we
generally determine whether to exempt a given type of search
from the warrant requirement "by assessing, on the one hand,
the degree to which it intrudes upon an individual's privacy
and, on the other, the degree to which it is needed for the
promotion of legitimate governmental interests."

   On the government interest side, [the Court held in
Robinson] that the two risks identified inChimel--harm to
officers and destruction of evidence--are present in all
custodial arrests. There are no comparable risks when the
search is of digital data. In addition, any privacy interests
retained by an individual after arrest [are] significantly
diminished by the fact of the arrest itself. Cell phones,
however, place vast quantities of personal information literally
in the hands of individuals. A search of the information on a
cell phone bears little resemblance to the type of brief physical
search [we have previously] considered.

   We therefore hold [] that officers must generally secure a
warrant before conducting such a search.

                         A

In doing so, we do not overlook ... that searches of a person
incident to arrest, "while based upon the need to disarm and
to discover evidence," are reasonable regardless of "the
                                                RILEY V. CALIFORNIA (2014) | 229

probability in a particular arrest situation that weapons or
evidence would in fact be found." Rather than requiring []
"case-by-case adjudication" ... we ask instead whether
application of the search incident to arrest doctrine to this
particular category of effects would "untether the rule from
the justifications underlying the [] exception."

                             1

Digital data stored on a cell phone cannot itself be used as
a weapon to harm an arresting officer or to effectuate the
arrestee's escape. Law enforcement officers remain free to
examine the physical aspects of a phone to ensure that it will
not be used as a weapon--say, to determine whether there is
a razor blade hidden between the phone and its case. Once
an officer has secured a phone and eliminated any potential
physical threats, however, data on the phone can endanger no
one.***

                             2

California focus[es] primarily on ... preventing the destruction
of evidence. Riley concede[s] that officers could have seized
and secured [his] cell phone[] to prevent destruction of
evidence while seeking a warrant. That is a sensible concession.
And once law enforcement officers have secured a cell phone,
there is no longer any risk that the arrestee himself will be able
to delete incriminating data from the phone.
230 | RILEY V. CALIFORNIA (2014)

   ***

                             1

Cell phones differ in both a quantitative and a qualitative sense
from other objects that might be kept on an arrestee's person.
The term "cell phone" is itself misleading shorthand; many of
these devices are in fact minicomputers that also happen to
have the capacity to be used as a telephone. They could just
as easily be called cameras, video players, rolodexes, calendars,
tape recorders, libraries, diaries, albums, televisions, maps, or
newspapers.

   One of the most notable distinguishing features of modern
cell phones is their immense storage capacity. Before cell
phones, a search of a person was limited by physical realities
and tended as a general matter to constitute only a narrow
intrusion on privacy. Most people cannot lug around every
piece of mail they have received for the past several months,
every picture they have taken, or every book or article they have
read--nor would they have any reason to attempt to do so.
And if they did, they would have to drag behind them a trunk
of the sort held to require a search warrant in Chadwick, rather
than a container the size of the cigarette package inRobinson.

   The storage capacity of cell phones has several interrelated
consequences for privacy. First, a cell phone collects in one
place many distinct types of information--an address, a note,
a prescription, a bank statement, a video--that reveal much
more in combination than any isolated record. Second, a cell
                                                RILEY V. CALIFORNIA (2014) | 231

phone's capacity allows even just one type of information to
convey far more than previously possible. The sum of an
individual's private life can be reconstructed through a
thousand photographs labeled with dates, locations, and
descriptions; the same cannot be said of a photograph or two
of loved ones tucked into a wallet. Third, the data on a phone
can date back to the purchase of the phone, or even earlier.
A person might carry in his pocket a slip of paper reminding
him to call Mr. Jones; he would not carry a record of all his
communications with Mr. Jones for the past several months,
as would routinely be kept on a phone.

   Finally, there is an element of pervasiveness that
characterizes cell phones but not physical records. Prior to the
digital age, people did not typically carry a cache of sensitive
personal information with them as they went about their day.
A decade ago police officers searching an arrestee might have
occasionally stumbled across a highly personal item such as
a diary. But those discoveries were likely to be few and far
between. Today, by contrast, it is no exaggeration to say that
many of the more than 90% of American adults who own
a cell phone keep on their person a digital record of nearly
every aspect of their lives--from the mundane to the intimate.
Allowing the police to scrutinize such records on a routine
basis is quite different from allowing them to search a personal
item or two in the occasional case.

   Although the data stored on a cell phone is distinguished
from physical records by quantity alone, certain types of data
232 | RILEY V. CALIFORNIA (2014)

are also qualitatively different. An Internet search and
browsing history, for example, can be found on an Internet-
enabled phone and could reveal an individual's private
interests or concerns--perhaps a search for certain symptoms
of disease, coupled with frequent visits to WebMD. Data on
a cell phone can also reveal where a person has been. Historic
location information is a standard feature on many smart
phones and can reconstruct someone's specific movements
down to the minute, not only around town but also within a
particular building.

                   IV

We cannot deny that our decision today will have an impact on
the ability of law enforcement to combat crime. Cell phones
have become important tools in facilitating coordination and
communication among members of criminal enterprises, and
can provide valuable incriminating information about
dangerous criminals. Privacy comes at a cost.

   Our holding, of course, is not that the information on a
cell phone is immune from search; it is instead that a warrant
is generally required before such a search, even when a cell
phone is seized incident to arrest. Our cases have historically
recognized that the warrant requirement is "an important
working part of our machinery of government," not merely
                                                RILEY V. CALIFORNIA (2014) | 233

"an inconvenience to be somehow `weighed' against the claims
of police efficiency."

   Moreover, even though the search incident to arrest
exception does not apply to cell phones, other case-specific
exceptions may still justify a warrantless search of a particular
phone. "One well-recognized exception applies when `"the
exigencies of the situation' make the needs of law enforcement
so compelling that [a] warrantless search is objectively
reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.'" Such exigencies
could include the need to prevent the imminent destruction of
evidence in individual cases, to pursue a fleeing suspect, and to
assist persons who are seriously injured or are threatened with
imminent injury.

   In light of the availability of the exigent circumstances
exception, there is no reason to believe that law enforcement
officers will not be able to address some of the more extreme
hypotheticals that have been suggested: a suspect texting an
accomplice who, it is feared, is preparing to detonate a bomb,
or a child abductor who may have information about the
child's location on his cell phone. The defendants here
recognize--indeed, they stress--that such fact-specific threats
may justify a warrantless search of cell phone data. The critical
point is that, unlike the search incident to arrest exception, the
exigent circumstances exception requires a court to examine
whether an emergency justified a warrantless search in each
particular case.

   Modern cell phones are not just another technological
234 | RILEY V. CALIFORNIA (2014)

convenience. With all they contain and all they may reveal,
they hold for many Americans "the privacies of life." The fact
that technology now allows an individual to carry such
information in his hand does not make the information any
less worthy of the protection for which the Founders fought.
Our answer to the question of what police must do before
searching a cell phone seized incident to an arrest is accordingly
simple--get a warrant.

       Notes, Comments, and
                Questions

Let's reconsider Jay-Z's predicament in "99 Problems." If an
officer arrests Jay-Z for reckless driving after catching him
driving 75 in a 55 mph zone, can the officer search the trunk
for drugs?

   What if instead the officer stops Jay-Z for speeding, looks
up the license plate, and sees that Los Angeles County has
an outstanding warrant for Jay-Z's arrest for the crime of
marijuana possession. Now can the officer search the trunk?

   Two additional points to consider:
   When an unarrested third party is near a car, there may
be authority for a "sweep" (to quickly search the vehicle for
dangerous items third parties could use).
   When an unarrested third party is at a house that police
wish to search, police likely can secure the house temporarily as

they seek a warrant (to prevent mischief by, say, Chimel's wife).
This rule applies only if police have probable cause; otherwise,
they cannot obtain a warrant.

CONSENT

      Waiving the Warrant
     Requirement: Consent

As is true of most constitutional rights, the right to be free
from warrantless searches can be waived. Police investigations
rely every day on such consent. Owners of vehicles and luggage
allow officers to search their effects, and occupants of houses
allow officers to enter and look around. There is no dispute
about the principle that genuine consent serves as a valid
substitute for a search warrant. The controversial questions
include what is necessary for consent to be valid, who may
provide valid consent, and whether certain police tactics
render otherwise-valid consent ineffective. Consent to search
must be 1) voluntary--it cannot be coerced through threats
or force; 2) made by an individual with apparent or actual
authority over the property to be searched. Your neighbor
cannot consent to the search of your car.

       Notes, Comments, and
                Questions

The Court addressed consent searches on Greyhound buses
in United States v. Drayton, 536 U.S. 194 (2002). There, the
Court held that police officers could board a bus and ask for
permission to search the property of passengers, as long as
under the totality of the circumstances the officers obtained
valid consent. The majority reiterated that officers need not
advise passengers of their right to leave or to refuse consent.
Previously, in Florida v. Bostick, 501 U.S.429 (1991), the
Court held that officers may approach bus passengers at
random to ask questions and request their consent to searches,
provided "a reasonable person would feel free to decline the
officers' requests or otherwise terminate the encounter." See
also Ohio v. Robinette, 519 U.S. 33 (1996) (rejecting rule
created by Ohio judges that required officers at traffic stops to
state "`At this time you legally are free to go' or [] words of
similar import" before initiating extra questioning or seeking
consent to search).

   Consider the following scenarios:
   A police officer assigned to be a "school resource officer"
at a high school confronts a student who has been sent to
the principal's office for disrespectful classroom behavior. The
officer says, "You must be on drugs to act so stupid. Let me
see what's in that backpack, and then you can go see the
                                                                        CONSENT | 241

principal." If the student hands over the backpack, does the
officer have valid consent to search it? Why or why not?

   A police officer has probable cause to believe that drugs are
being stored at a certain house. The officer, without a warrant,
knocks on the door. When someone answers, the officer says,
"I could get a warrant to search this house for drugs, but I'd
rather save myself the trouble. If you let me look around the
house and I don't find anything, I'll move on to other business.
But if you refuse, I'll be back soon with a warrant, and my
partner and I will search this place from top to bottom." If the
person at the door admits the officer inside, does the officer
have valid consent to enter and search the house? Why or why
not?
ILLINOIS V. RODRIGUEZ
(1990)

                       U.S. Supreme Court

 Illinois v. Rodriguez,497 U.S.
              177(1990)

   Justice SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court.
   ***

                       I

Respondent Edward Rodriguez was arrested in his apartment
by law enforcement officers and charged with possession of
illegal drugs. The police gained entry to the apartment with
the consent and assistance of Gail Fischer, who had lived there
with respondent for several months. The relevant facts leading
to the arrest are as follows .

   On July 26, 1985, police were summoned to the residence
of Dorothy Jackson on South Wolcott in Chicago. They were
                                            ILLINOIS V. RODRIGUEZ (1990) | 243

met by Ms. Jackson's daughter, Gail Fischer, who showed signs
of a severe beating. She told the officers that she had been
assaulted by respondent Edward Rodriguez earlier that day
in an apartment on South California. Fischer stated that
Rodriguez was then asleep in the apartment, and she
consented to travel there with the police in order to unlock the
door with her key so that the officers could enter and arrest
him. During this conversation, Fischer several times referred
to the apartment on South California as "our" apartment, and
said that she had clothes and furniture there. It is unclear
whether she indicated that she currently lived at the
apartment, or only that she used to live there.

   The police officers drove to the apartment on South
California, accompanied by Fischer. They did not obtain an
arrest warrant for Rodriguez, nor did they seek a search
warrant for the apartment. At the apartment, Fischer unlocked
the door with her key and gave the officers permission to enter.
They moved through the door into the living room, where
they observed in plain view drug paraphernalia and containers
filled with white powder that they believed (correctly, as later
analysis showed) to be cocaine. They proceeded to the
bedroom, where they found Rodriguez asleep and discovered
additional containers of white powder in two open attache
cases. The officers arrested Rodriguez and seized the drugs and
related paraphernalia.

   Rodriguez was charged with possession of a controlled
substance with intent to deliver. He moved to suppress all
244 | ILLINOIS V. RODRIGUEZ (1990)

evidence seized at the time of his arrest, claiming that Fischer
had vacated the apartment several weeks earlier and had no
authority to consent to the entry. The Cook County Circuit
Court granted the motion, holding that, at the time she
consented to the entry, Fischer did not have common
authority over the apartment. The Court concluded that
Fischer was not a "usual resident," but rather an "infrequent
visitor" at the apartment on South California, based upon its
findings that Fischer's name was not on the lease, that she did
not contribute to the rent, that she was not allowed to invite
others to the apartment on her own, that she did not have
access to the apartment when respondent was away, and that
she had moved some of her possessions from the apartment.
The Circuit Court also rejected the State's contention that,
even if Fischer did not possess common authority over the
premises, there was no Fourth Amendment violation if the
police reasonably believed at the time of their entry that
Fischer possessed the authority to consent.

   ***

                       II

The Fourth Amendment generally prohibits the warrantless
entry of a person's home, whether to make an arrest or to
search for specific objects.Payton v. New York,445 U. S.
573(1980);Johnson v. United States,333 U. S. 10(1948). The
prohibition does not apply, however, to situations in which
                                            ILLINOIS V. RODRIGUEZ (1990) | 245

voluntary consent has been obtained, either from the
individual whose property is searched,see Schneckloth v.
Bustamonte,412 U. S. 218(1973), or from a third party who
possesses common authority over the premises,see United
States v. Matlock, supra,415 U.S. at415 U. S. 171. The State of
Illinois contends that that exception applies in the present case.

   As we stated inMatlock,415 U.S. at415 U. S. 171, n. 7,
"[c]ommon authority" rests "on mutual use of the property
by persons generally having joint access or control for most
purposes . . . ." The burden of establishing that common
authority rests upon the State. On the basis of this record, it
is clear that burden was not sustained. The evidence showed
that, although Fischer, with her two small children, had lived
with Rodriguez beginning in December, 1984, she had moved
out on July 1, 1985, almost a month before the search at issue
here, and had gone to live with her mother. She took her and
her children's clothing with her, though leaving behind some
furniture and household effects. During the period after July
1, she sometimes spent the night at Rodriguez's apartment,
but never invited her friends there and never went there herself
when he was not home. Her name was not on the lease, nor
did she contribute to the rent. She had a key to the apartment,
which she said at trial she had taken without Rodriguez's
knowledge (though she testified at the preliminary hearing that
Rodriguez had given her the key). On these facts, the State
has not established that, with respect to the South California
apartment, Fischer had "joint access or control for most
246 | ILLINOIS V. RODRIGUEZ (1990)

purposes." To the contrary, the Appellate Court's
determination of no common authority over the apartment
was obviously correct.

                      III

                         A

The State contends that, even if Fischer did not in fact have
authority to give consent, it suffices to validate the entry that
the law enforcement officers reasonably believed she did.

   ***
   "[T]he validity of the search of respondent's apartment
pursuant to a warrant authorizing the search of the entire third
floor depends on whether the officers' failure to realize the
overbreadth of the warrant was objectively understandable and
reasonable. Here it unquestionably was. The objective facts
available to the officers at the time suggested no distinction
between [the suspect's] apartment and the third-floor
premises."
   ***
   It is apparent that, in order to satisfy the "reasonableness"
requirement of the Fourth Amendment, what is generally
demanded of the many factual determinations that must
regularly be made by agents of the government -- whether
the magistrate issuing a warrant, the police officer executing
a warrant, or the police officer conducting a search or seizure
                                            ILLINOIS V. RODRIGUEZ (1990) | 247

under one of the exceptions to the warrant requirement --
is not that they always be correct, but that they always be
reasonable.

   ***
   We see no reason to depart from this general rule with
respect to facts bearing upon the authority to consent to a
search. Whether the basis for such authority exists is the sort of
recurring factual question to which law enforcement officials
must be expected to apply their judgment, and all the Fourth
Amendment requires is that they answer it reasonably. The
Constitution is no more violated when officers enter without a
warrant because they reasonably (though erroneously) believe
that the person who has consented to their entry is a resident
of the premises than it is violated when they enter without a
warrant because they reasonably (though erroneously) believe
they are in pursuit of a violent felon who is about to escape.See
Archibald v. Mosel,677 F.2d 5 (CA1 1982).*
   ***
   Justice MARSHALL, with whom Justice BRENNAN and
Justice STEVENS join, dissenting.
   Dorothy Jackson summoned police officers to her house
to report that her daughter, Gail Fischer, had been beaten.
Fischer told police that Ed Rodriguez, her boyfriend, was her
assaulter. During an interview with Fischer, one of the officers
asked if Rodriguez dealt in narcotics. Fischer did not respond.
Fischer did agree, however, to the officers' request to let them
into Rodriguez's apartment so that they could arrest him for
248 | ILLINOIS V. RODRIGUEZ (1990)

battery. The police, without a warrant and despite the absence
of an exigency, entered Rodriguez's home to arrest him. As a
result of their entry, the police discovered narcotics that the
State subsequently sought to introduce in a drug prosecution
against Rodriguez.

   The majority agrees with the Illinois Appellate Court's
determination that Fischer did not have authority to consent
to the officers' entry of Rodriguez's apartment.Anteat497 U.
S. 181-182. The Court holds that the warrantless entry into
Rodriguez's home was nonetheless valid if the officers
reasonably believed that Fischer had authority to consent.

   ***
   Unlike searches conducted pursuant to the recognized
exceptions to the warrant requirement,see supraat497 U. S.
191-192, third-party consent searches are not based on an
exigency, and therefore serve no compelling social goal. Police
officers, when faced with the choice of relying on consent by
a third party or securing a warrant, should secure a warrant,
and must therefore accept the risk of error should they instead
choose to rely on consent.
   ***
   A search conducted pursuant to an officer's reasonable but
mistaken belief that a third party had authority to consent
is thus on an entirely different constitutional footing from
one based on the consent of a third party who in fact has
such authority. Even if the officers reasonably believed that
Fischer had authority to consent, she did not, and Rodriguez's
                                            ILLINOIS V. RODRIGUEZ (1990) | 249

expectation of privacy was therefore undiminished. Rodriguez
accordingly can challenge the warrantless intrusion into his
home as a violation of the Fourth Amendment.

   Now imagine that two people are present when police request
consent to enter a home. One person consents while the other says,
"Stay out!" Consent or no consent? Why or why not? The Court

(2006)

              Supreme Court of the United States

       Georgia v. Scott Fitz
              Randolph

            Decided March 22, 2006 - 547 U.S. 103

   Justice SOUTER delivered the opinion of the Court.
   The Fourth Amendment recognizes a valid warrantless
entry and search of premises when police obtain the voluntary
consent of an occupant who shares, or is reasonably believed to
share, authority over the area in common with a co-occupant
who later objects to the use of evidence so obtained. The
question here is whether such an evidentiary seizure is likewise
lawful with the permission of one occupant when the other,
who later seeks to suppress the evidence, is present at the scene
and expressly refuses to consent. We hold that, in the
circumstances here at issue, a physically present co-occupant's
                                           GEORGIA V. RANDOLPH (2006) | 251

stated refusal to permit entry prevails, rendering the
warrantless search unreasonable and invalid as to him.

                       I

Respondent Scott Randolph and his wife, Janet, separated in
late May 2001, when she left the marital residence in
Americus, Georgia, and went to stay with her parents in
Canada, taking their son and some belongings. In July, she
returned to the Americus house with the child, though the
record does not reveal whether her object was reconciliation or
retrieval of remaining possessions.

   On the morning of July 6, she complained to the police
that after a domestic dispute her husband took their son away,
and when officers reached the house she told them that her
husband was a cocaine user whose habit had caused financial
troubles. She mentioned the marital problems and said that
she and their son had only recently returned after a stay of
several weeks with her parents. Shortly after the police arrived,
Scott Randolph returned and explained that he had removed
the child to a neighbor's house out of concern that his wife
might take the boy out of the country again; he denied cocaine
use, and countered that it was in fact his wife who abused
drugs and alcohol.

   One of the officers, Sergeant Murray, went with Janet
Randolph to reclaim the child, and when they returned she
not only renewed her complaints about her husband's drug
252 | GEORGIA V. RANDOLPH (2006)

use, but also volunteered that there were "`items of drug
evidence'" in the house. Sergeant Murray asked Scott
Randolph for permission to search the house, which he
unequivocally refused.

   The sergeant turned to Janet Randolph for consent to
search, which she readily gave. She led the officer upstairs to
a bedroom that she identified as Scott's, where the sergeant
noticed a section of a drinking straw with a powdery residue
he suspected was cocaine. He then left the house to get an
evidence bag from his car and to call the district attorney's
office, which instructed him to stop the search and apply for a
warrant. When Sergeant Murray returned to the house, Janet
Randolph withdrew her consent. The police took the straw to
the police station, along with the Randolphs. After getting a
search warrant, they returned to the house and seized further
evidence of drug use, on the basis of which Scott Randolph
was indicted for possession of cocaine.

   He moved to suppress the evidence, as products of a
warrantless search of his house unauthorized by his wife's
consent over his express refusal. The trial court denied the
motion, ruling that Janet Randolph had common authority to
consent to the search.

   ***

                       II

To the Fourth Amendment rule ordinarily prohibiting the
                                           GEORGIA V. RANDOLPH (2006) | 253

warrantless entry of a person's house as unreasonable per se,
one "jealously and carefully drawn" exception recognizes the
validity of searches with the voluntary consent of an individual
possessing authority. That person might be the householder
against whom evidence is sought or a fellow occupant who
shares common authority over property, when the suspect is
absent, and the exception for consent extends even to entries
and searches with the permission of a co-occupant whom the
police reasonably, but erroneously, believe to possess shared
authority as an occupant. None of our co-occupant consent-
to-search cases, however, has presented the further fact of a
second occupant physically present and refusing permission to
search, and later moving to suppress evidence so obtained. The
significance of such a refusal turns on the underpinnings of the
co-occupant consent rule, as recognized since Matlock.

                         A

***

                         C

To begin with, it is fair to say that a caller standing at the
door of shared premises would have no confidence that one
occupant's invitation was a sufficiently good reason to enter
when a fellow tenant stood there saying, "stay out." Without
254 | GEORGIA V. RANDOLPH (2006)

some very good reason, no sensible person would go inside
under those conditions.

   Unless the people living together fall within some
recognized hierarchy, like a household of parent and child or
barracks housing military personnel of different grades, there
is no societal understanding of superior and inferior, a fact
reflected in a standard formulation of domestic property law,
that "[e]ach cotenant ... has the right to use and enjoy the
entire property as if he or she were the sole owner, limited
only by the same right in the other cotenants." [T]here is no
common understanding that one co-tenant generally has a
right or authority to prevail over the express wishes of another,
whether the issue is the color of the curtains or invitations to
outsiders.

                         D

Since the co-tenant wishing to open the door to a third party
has no recognized authority in law or social practice to prevail
over a present and objecting co-tenant, his disputed invitation,
without more, gives a police officer no better claim to
reasonableness in entering than the officer would have in the
absence of any consent at all. Accordingly, in the balancing of
competing individual and governmental interests entailed by
the bar to unreasonable searches, the cooperative occupant's
invitation adds nothing to the government's side to counter
                                           GEORGIA V. RANDOLPH (2006) | 255

the force of an objecting individual's claim to security against
the government's intrusion into his dwelling place.

   ***

                      III

This case invites a straightforward application of the rule that
a physically present inhabitant's express refusal of consent to a
police search is dispositive as to him, regardless of the consent
of a fellow occupant. Scott Randolph's refusal is clear, and
nothing in the record justifies the search on grounds
independent of Janet Randolph's consent. The State does not
argue that she gave any indication to the police of a need for
protection inside the house that might have justified entry into
the portion of the premises where the police found the
powdery straw (which, if lawfully seized, could have been used
when attempting to establish probable cause for the warrant
issued later). Nor does the State claim that the entry and search
should be upheld under the rubric of exigent circumstances,
owing to some apprehension by the police officers that Scott
Randolph would destroy evidence of drug use before any
warrant could be obtained.

   The judgment of the Supreme Court of Georgia is therefore
affirmed.

CALIFORNIA (2014)

              Supreme Court of the United States

       Walter Fernandez v.
              California

             Decided Feb. 25, 2014 - 571 U.S. 292

   Justice ALITO delivered the opinion of the Court.
   Our cases firmly establish that police officers may search
jointly occupied premises if one of the occupants consents. In
Georgia v. Randolph we recognized a narrow exception to this
rule, holding that the consent of one occupant is insufficient
when another occupant is present and objects to the search.
In this case, we consider whether Randolph applies if the
objecting occupant is absent when another occupant consents.
Our opinion in Randolph took great pains to emphasize that
its holding was limited to situations in which the objecting
occupant is physically present. We therefore refuse to extend
Randolph to the very different situation in this case, where
                                      FERNANDEZ V. CALIFORNIA (2014) | 257

consent was provided by an abused woman well after her male
partner had been removed from the apartment they shared.

                       I

                         A

***
   After backup arrived, the officers knocked on the door of

the apartment unit from which the screams had been heard.
Roxanne Rojas answered the door. She was holding a baby and
appeared to be crying. Her face was red, and she had a large
bump on her nose. The officers also saw blood on her shirt
and hand from what appeared to be a fresh injury. Rojas told
the police that she had been in a fight. Officer Cirrito asked
if anyone else was in the apartment, and Rojas said that her
4-year-old son was the only other person present.

   After Officer Cirrito asked Rojas to step out of the
apartment so that he could conduct a protective sweep,
petitioner appeared at the door wearing only boxer shorts.
Apparently agitated, petitioner stepped forward and said,
"`You don't have any right to come in here. I know my rights.'"
Suspecting that petitioner had assaulted Rojas, the officers
removed him from the apartment and then placed him under
arrest. Lopez identified petitioner as his initial attacker, and
petitioner was taken to the police station for booking.

   Approximately one hour after petitioner's arrest, Detective
258 | FERNANDEZ V. CALIFORNIA (2014)

Clark returned to the apartment and informed Rojas that
petitioner had been arrested. Detective Clark requested and
received both oral and written consent from Rojas to search
the premises. In the apartment, the police found Drifters gang
paraphernalia, a butterfly knife, clothing worn by the robbery
suspect, and ammunition. Rojas' young son also showed the
officers where petitioner had hidden a sawed-off shotgun.

                         B

Petitioner was charged with robbery, infliction of corporal
injury on a spouse, cohabitant, or child's parent, possession of
a firearm by a felon, possession of a short-barreled shotgun,
and felony possession of ammunition.

   Before trial, petitioner moved to suppress the evidence
found in the apartment, but after a hearing, the court denied
the motion. Petitioner then pleaded nolo contendere to the
firearms and ammunition charges. On the remaining
counts--for robbery and infliction of corporal injury--he
went to trial and was found guilty by a jury. The court
sentenced him to 14 years of imprisonment.

   ***

                         B

While consent by one resident of jointly occupied premises
is generally sufficient to justify a warrantless search, we
                                     FERNANDEZ V. CALIFORNIA (2014) | 259

recognized a narrow exception to this rule in Georgia v.
Randolph. The Court reiterated the proposition that a person
who shares a residence with others assumes the risk that "any
one of them may admit visitors, with the consequence that a
guest obnoxious to one may nevertheless be admitted in his
absence by another." But the Court held that "a physically
present inhabitant's express refusal of consent to a police search
[of his home] is dispositive as to him, regardless of the consent
of a fellow occupant." The Court's opinion went to great
lengths to make clear that its holding was limited to situations
in which the objecting occupant is present.

                      III

In this case, petitioner was not present when Rojas consented,
but petitioner still contends that Randolph is controlling. He
advances two main arguments. First, he claims that his absence
should not matter since he was absent only because the police
had taken him away. Second, he maintains that it was sufficient
that he objected to the search while he was still present. Such
an objection, he says, should remain in effect until the
objecting party "no longer wishes to keep the police out of his
home." Neither of these arguments is sound.

   We first consider the argument that the presence of the
objecting occupant is not necessary when the police are
responsible for his absence. In Randolph, the Court suggested
in dictum that consent by one occupant might not be
260 | FERNANDEZ V. CALIFORNIA (2014)

sufficient if "there is evidence that the police have removed the
potentially objecting tenant from the entrance for the sake of
avoiding a possible objection." We do not believe the statement
should be read to suggest that improper motive may invalidate
objectively justified removal. Hence, it does not govern here.

   This brings us to petitioner's second argument, viz., that his
objection, made at the threshold of the premises that the police
wanted to search, remained effective until he changed his mind
and withdrew his objection. This argument is inconsistent
with Randolph's reasoning in at least two important ways.
First, the argument cannot be squared with the "widely shared
social expectations" or "customary social usage" upon which
the Randolph holding was based.

   It seems obvious that the calculus of this hypothetical caller
would likely be quite different if the objecting tenant was not
standing at the door. When the objecting occupant is standing
at the threshold saying "stay out," a friend or visitor invited to
enter by another occupant can expect at best an uncomfortable
scene and at worst violence if he or she tries to brush past
the objector. But when the objector is not on the scene (and
especially when it is known that the objector will not return
during the course of the visit), the friend or visitor is much
more likely to accept the invitation to enter. Thus, petitioner's
argument is inconsistent with Randolph's reasoning.

   Second, petitioner's argument would create the very sort of
practical complications that Randolph sought to avoid. The
Randolph Court recognized that it was adopting a
                                      FERNANDEZ V. CALIFORNIA (2014) | 261

"formalis[tic]" rule, but it did so in the interests of "simple
clarity" and administrability.

   ***
   If Randolph is taken at its word--that it applies only when
the objector is standing in the door saying "stay out" when
officers propose to make a consent search--all of these
problems disappear.
   Putting the exception the Court adopted in Randolph to
one side, the lawful occupant of a house or apartment should
have the right to invite the police to enter the dwelling and
conduct a search. Any other rule would trample on the rights
of the occupant who is willing to consent. Such an occupant
may want the police to search in order to dispel "suspicion
raised by sharing quarters with a criminal." And an occupant
may want the police to conduct a thorough search so that any
dangerous contraband can be found and removed. In this case,
for example, the search resulted in the discovery and removal
of a sawed-off shotgun to which Rojas' 4-year-old son had
access.
   Denying someone in Rojas' position the right to allow the
police to enter her home would also show disrespect for her
independence. Having beaten Rojas, petitioner would bar her
from controlling access to her own home until such time as
he chose to relent. The Fourth Amendment does not give him
that power.
   The judgment of the California Court of Appeal is
affirmed.
262 | FERNANDEZ V. CALIFORNIA (2014)

   Justice GINSBURG, with whom Justice SOTOMAYOR
and Justice KAGAN join, dissenting.

   This case calls for a straightforward application of
Randolph. The police officers in Randolph were confronted
with a scenario closely resembling the situation presented here.
After Walter Fernandez, while physically present at his home,
rebuffed the officers' request to come in, the police removed
him from the premises and then arrested him, albeit with cause
to believe he had assaulted his cohabitant, Roxanne Rojas.
At the time of the arrest, Rojas said nothing to contradict
Fernandez' refusal. About an hour later, however, and with no
attempt to obtain a search warrant, the police returned to the
apartment and prevailed upon Rojas to sign a consent form
authorizing search of the premises.

   In this case, the police could readily have obtained a warrant
to search the shared residence. The Court does not dispute
this, but instead disparages the warrant requirement as
inconvenient, burdensome, entailing delay "[e]ven with
modern technological advances." 

   Although the police have probable cause and could obtain a
warrant with dispatch, if they can gain the consent of someone
other than the suspect, why should the law insist on the
formality of a warrant? Because the Framers saw the neutral
magistrate as an essential part of the criminal process shielding
all of us, good or bad, saint or sinner, from unchecked police
activity.

   I would honor the Fourth Amendment's warrant
                                     FERNANDEZ V. CALIFORNIA (2014) | 263

requirement and hold that Fernandez' objection to the search
did not become null upon his arrest and removal from the
scene. "There is every reason to conclude that securing a
warrant was entirely feasible in this case, and no reason to
contract the Fourth Amendment's dominion."

       Notes, Comments, and
                Questions

Justice Souter, who wrote for the majority in Randolph, retired
before Fernandez was decided. In addition, Justice Kennedy,
who voted with the Randolph majority, supported the
Fernandez majority in its limitation of the holding of
Randolph to its unusual facts. Justice Breyer, who concurred
with the Court's judgement in Randolph but did not endorse
all of the majority's reasoning, also joined Justice Alito's
majority opinion in Fernandez. In short, while Randolph
remains good law, its reasoning may not have support from a
current majority of the Court, and its holding is unlikely to be
applied to new fact patterns.

   Beyond the somewhat esoteric questions presented by
Randolph and Fernandez, the broader issue of consent inspires
intense disagreements. In particular, dissenting Justices
question whether people can really "terminate encounters"
with police officers as easily as majority opinions seems to
suggest, and they argue that refusing consent is not always
practical (or even possible), particularly among portions of
264 | FERNANDEZ V. CALIFORNIA (2014)

the populations already uneasy with police. Observers note
that gender, among other factors, affects whether one has the
confidence to deny consent. See David K. Kessler, Free to
Leave? An Empirical Look at the Fourth Amendment's Seizure
Standard, 99 J. Crim L. & Criminology 51 (2009) (reporting
on random survey of Boston residents concerning sidewalks
and buses, finding that "women and young people feel less free
to leave than other groups").

   On the other hand, robust cooperation with police is
essential to the prevention and detection of crime. If police
needed a warrant every time they searched a car, bag, or house,
investigations would be slowed considerably. This reality
encourages Justices to avoid placing high hurdles in the path of
officers who seek consent from members of the public.

 The Authority of Co-Occupants
  and Co-Owners to Consent to

                 Searches

Students, generally familiar with shared housing, frequently
ask about the scope of authority possessed by a co-occupant
to consent to searches of shared living quarters. In particular,
when two or more students share a common living room and
kitchen yet have individual bedrooms, can one resident of a
shared apartment allow police to search the entire premises?
The answer is that residents may authorize searches of areas
                                     FERNANDEZ V. CALIFORNIA (2014) | 265

over which they have control, whether sole control or shared
control. Accordingly, in the apartment described above, a
resident could permit police to search the living room, the
kitchen, and her own personal bedroom, but she would not
have authority to authorize searches of someone else's
bedroom.

   The same principle applies to items that are shared or are
lent by an owner to another person. Someone permitted to use
and carry a backpack--whether the sole owner, a co-owner, or
a borrower--may authorize police to search the bag.

   Recall that police can rely on apparent authority--a search
is reasonable as long as officers reasonably believe they receive
valid consent. Nonetheless, officers should be careful when
entering shared premises with consent to learn what areas are
controlled by the consenting resident.
PART XIII

FOURTH
AMENDMENT:
WARRANT
EXCEPTIONS (PART
4)

  Warrant Exception: Exigent
          Circumstances

The Court has grouped a handful of recurring situations
under the umbrella term "exigent circumstances." This
exception allows police to conduct searches without warrants
as long as officers have probable cause to believe that one of
the approved kinds of unusual situations--that is, exigent
circumstances--exists. For all the categories of exigent
circumstances, the Court has decided that seeking a warrant
would be impossible, or at least impractical. The key categories
are: (1) hot pursuit of a fleeing criminal suspect, (2) protection
of public safety from immediate threats, and (3) preservation
268 | FOURTH AMENDMENT: WARRANT EXCEPTIONS (PART 4)

of evidence (that officers have probable cause to believe is
subject to seizure and will be found on the premises) from
destruction.

   We begin with hot pursuit.

CIRCUMSTANCES: HOT
PURSUIT

        Warden, Maryland
   Penitentiary v. Bennie Joe

               Hayden

             Decided May 29, 1967 - 387 U.S. 294

   Mr. Justice BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the
Court.

   ***

                       I

About 8 a.m. on March 17, 1962, an armed robber entered
the business premises of the Diamond Cab Company in
Baltimore, Maryland. He took some $363 and ran. Two cab
270 | EXIGENT CIRCUMSTANCES: HOT PURSUIT

drivers in the vicinity, attracted by shouts of "Holdup,"
followed the man to 2111 Cocoa Lane. One driver notified
the company dispatcher by radio that the man was a Negro
about 5' 8" tall, wearing a light cap and dark jacket, and that he
had entered the house on Cocoa Lane. The dispatcher relayed
the information to police who were proceeding to the scene
of the robbery. Within minutes, police arrived at the house in
a number of patrol cars. An officer knocked and announced
their presence. Mrs. Hayden answered, and the officers told her
they believed that a robber had entered the house, and asked to
search the house. She offered no objection.46

   The officers spread out through the first and second floors
and the cellar in search of the robber. Hayden was found in
an upstairs bedroom feigning sleep. He was arrested when the
officers on the first floor and in the cellar reported that no
other man was in the house. Meanwhile an officer was
attracted to an adjoining bathroom by the noise of running
water, and discovered a shotgun and a pistol in a flush tank;
another officer who, according to the District Court, "was
searching the cellar for a man or the money" found in a
washing machine a jacket and trousers of the type the fleeing
man was said to have worn. A clip of ammunition for the pistol
and a cap were found under the mattress of Hayden's bed, and
ammunition for the shotgun was found in a bureau drawer in
Hayden's room. All these items of evidence were introduced
against respondent at his trial.
                          EXIGENT CIRCUMSTANCES: HOT PURSUIT | 271

                       II

We agree with the Court of Appeals that neither the entry
without warrant to search for the robber, nor the search for
him without warrant was invalid. Under the circumstances
of this case, "the exigencies of the situation made that course
imperative." The police were informed that an armed robbery
had taken place, and that the suspect had entered 2111 Cocoa
Lane less than five minutes before they reached it. They acted
reasonably when they entered the house and began to search
for a man of the description they had been given and for
weapons which he had used in the robbery or might use
against them. The Fourth Amendment does not require police
officers to delay in the course of an investigation if to do so
would gravely endanger their lives or the lives of others. Speed
here was essential, and only a thorough search of the house
for persons and weapons could have insured that Hayden was
the only man present and that the police had control of all
weapons which could be used against them or to effect an
escape.

   [T]he seizures occurred prior to or immediately
contemporaneous with Hayden's arrest, as part of an effort to
find a suspected felon, armed, within the house into which
he had run only minutes before the police arrived. The
permissible scope of search must, therefore, at the least, be as
broad as may reasonably be necessary to prevent the dangers
that the suspect at large in the house may resist or escape.
272 | EXIGENT CIRCUMSTANCES: HOT PURSUIT

   ***

       Notes, Comments, and
                Questions

Hot pursuit allows officers to follow a fleeing felon into a
house. The Court has explained that "`hot pursuit' means some
sort of a chase, but it need not be an extended hue and cry `in
and about (the) public streets.'" United States v. Santana, 427
U.S. 38 (1976).

   After entering a home in hot pursuit, police may look
around to protect themselves, find the suspect, find weapons,
etc. The Court in Hayden even allows an officer to search
a washing machine around the time the suspect was caught
elsewhere. Consider the following scenario:

   Police have probable cause to arrest a suspect for a
misdemeanor. The suspect flees, and police give chase. If the
suspect enters a home, may police follow? Why or why not?
See Stanton v. Sims, 571 U.S. 3 (2013) (declining to decide
the question); People v. Wear, 893 N.E.2d 631 (Ill. 2008)
(extending "hot pursuit" doctrine to misdemeanors).

   In addition to its appearance in criminal procedure law,
"hot pursuit" is a term of art in international law. A
"backgrounder" published by the Council on Foreign
Relations (CFR) describes the doctrine as follows: "The
doctrine generally pertains to the law of the seas and the ability
of one state's navy to pursue a foreign ship that has violated
                          EXIGENT CIRCUMSTANCES: HOT PURSUIT | 273

laws and regulations in its territorial waters (twelve nautical
miles from shore), even if the ship flees to the high seas."
Quoting Professor Michael P. Scharf, the CFR document
explained further: "It means you are literally and temporally
in pursuit and following the tail of a fugitive. ... [A state] is
allowed to temporarily violate borders to make an
apprehension under those circumstances."

   Students interested in further information can review the
1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, which covers hot
pursuit in Article 111, along with the 1958 Convention on the
High Seas, which covers the doctrine in Article 23. Students
will notice similarities among the international law doctrine
and our domestic criminal procedure rule. Under each, state
agents are permitted to briefly enter otherwise prohibited areas
for law enforcement purposes. On the other hand, application
of "hot pursuit" on land (for example, entering a foreign
country to capture or kill a wanted terrorist) is disputed in
international law.

   In the next case, the Court considers whether a "routine
felony arrest" constitutes exigent circumstances and
accordingly allows warrantless entry of a home in which police
have probable cause to believe the felony suspect will be found.
Students should consider that even in the Bronx in 1970--the
location and year of the search at issue--the crime rate was not
so high that arresting a man suspected of murdering someone
two days earlier during an armed robbery had become
"routine." What then made this scenario different from "hot
274 | EXIGENT CIRCUMSTANCES: HOT PURSUIT

pursuit" and other sorts of exigent circumstances in the eyes of
the Justices?
WARDEN V. HAYDEN
(1967)

              Supreme Court of the United States

Theodore Payton v. New York

             Decided April 15, 1980 - 445 U.S. 573

   Mr. Justice STEVENS delivered the opinion of the Court.
   These appeals challenge the constitutionality of New York
statutes that authorize police officers to enter a private
residence without a warrant and with force, if necessary, to
make a routine felony arrest.

                       I

On January 14, 1970, after two days of intensive investigation,
New York detectives had assembled evidence sufficient to
establish probable cause to believe that Theodore Payton had
murdered the manager of a gas station two days earlier. At
about 7:30 a.m. on January 15, six officers went to Payton's
276 | WARDEN V. HAYDEN (1967)

apartment in the Bronx, intending to arrest him. They had not
obtained a warrant. Although light and music emanated from
the apartment, there was no response to their knock on the
metal door. They summoned emergency assistance and, about
30 minutes later, used crowbars to break open the door and
enter the apartment. No one was there. In plain view, however,
was a .30-caliber shell casing that was seized and later admitted
into evidence at Payton's murder trial.

   In due course Payton surrendered to the police, was indicted
for murder, and moved to suppress the evidence taken from
his apartment. The trial judge held that the warrantless and
forcible entry was authorized by the New York Code of
Criminal Procedure, and that the evidence in plain view was
properly seized. He found that exigent circumstances justified
the officers' failure to announce their purpose before entering
the apartment as required by the statute. He had no occasion,
however, to decide whether those circumstances also would
have justified the failure to obtain a warrant, because he
concluded that the warrantless entry was adequately
supported by the statute without regard to the circumstances.
The Appellate Division, First Department, summarily
affirmed. The New York Court of Appeals affirmed the
conviction[] of [] Payton.

   Before addressing the narrow question presented by these
appeals, we put to one side other related problems that are not
presented today. Although it is arguable that the warrantless
entry to effect Payton's arrest might have been justified by
                                                WARDEN V. HAYDEN (1967) | 277

exigent circumstances, none of the New York courts relied on
any such justification. The Court of Appeals majority treated
[] Payton's [] case[] as involving [a] routine arrest in which
there was ample time to obtain a warrant, and we will do the
same. Accordingly, we have no occasion to consider the sort
of emergency or dangerous situation, described in our cases as
"exigent circumstances," that would justify a warrantless entry
into a home for the purpose of either arrest or search.

   Nor do these cases raise any question concerning the
authority of the police, without either a search or arrest
warrant, to enter a third party's home to arrest a suspect. The
police broke into Payton's apartment intending to arrest
Payton. We also note that it [is not] argued that the police
lacked probable cause to believe that [Payton] was at home
when they entered. Finally, we are dealing with [an] entr[y]
into [a] home[] made without the consent of any occupant.

                       II

***
   It is a "basic principle of Fourth Amendment law" that

searches and seizures inside a home without a warrant are
presumptively unreasonable. Yet it is also well settled that
objects such as weapons or contraband found in a public place
may be seized by the police without a warrant. The seizure
of property in plain view involves no invasion of privacy and
is presumptively reasonable, assuming that there is probable
278 | WARDEN V. HAYDEN (1967)

cause to associate the property with criminal activity. [T]his
distinction has equal force when the seizure of a person is
involved. [T]he critical point is that any differences in the
intrusiveness of entries to search and entries to arrest are
merely ones of degree rather than kind. The two intrusions
share this fundamental characteristic: the breach of the
entrance to an individual's home. The Fourth Amendment
protects the individual's privacy in a variety of settings. In
none is the zone of privacy more clearly defined than when
bounded by the unambiguous physical dimensions of an
individual's home--a zone that finds its roots in clear and
specific constitutional terms: "The right of the people to be
secure in their ... houses ... shall not be violated." That
language unequivocally establishes the proposition that "[a]t
the very core [of the Fourth Amendment] stands the right of
a man to retreat into his own home and there be free from
unreasonable governmental intrusion." In terms that apply
equally to seizures of property and to seizures of persons, the
Fourth Amendment has drawn a firm line at the entrance to
the house. Absent exigent circumstances, that threshold may
not reasonably be crossed without a warrant.

                      IV

***
   If there is sufficient evidence of a citizen's participation in a

felony to persuade a judicial officer that his arrest is justified,
                                                WARDEN V. HAYDEN (1967) | 279

it is constitutionally reasonable to require him to open his
doors to the officers of the law. Thus, for Fourth Amendment
purposes, an arrest warrant founded on probable cause
implicitly carries with it the limited authority to enter a
dwelling in which the suspect lives when there is reason to
believe the suspect is within.

   Because no arrest warrant was obtained, the judgments
must be reversed and the cases remanded to the New York
Court of Appeals for further proceedings not inconsistent
with this opinion.

   Mr. Justice WHITE, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE
and Mr. Justice REHNQUIST join, dissenting.

   The Court today holds that absent exigent circumstances
officers may never enter a home during the daytime to arrest
for a dangerous felony unless they have first obtained a
warrant. This hard-and-fast rule, founded on erroneous
assumptions concerning the intrusiveness of home arrest
entries, finds little or no support in the common law or in
the text and history of the Fourth Amendment. I respectfully
dissent.

   ***
   In sum, the background, text, and legislative history of the
Fourth Amendment demonstrate that the purpose was to
restrict the abuses that had developed with respect to warrants;
the Amendment preserved common-law rules of arrest.
Because it was not considered generally unreasonable at
common law for officers to break doors to effect a warrantless
280 | WARDEN V. HAYDEN (1967)

felony arrest, I do not believe that the Fourth Amendment was
intended to outlaw the types of police conduct at issue in the
present cases.

   ***
   Our cases establish that the ultimate test under the Fourth
Amendment is one of "reasonableness." I cannot join the
Court in declaring unreasonable a practice which has been
thought entirely reasonable by so many for so long.

       Notes, Comments, and
                Questions

Consider the "routine felony arrest" in other locations. Do
the police need a search warrant to enter third party's home?
Suspect's place of employment? Suspect's privately-owned
business? Suspect's girlfriend's home? Suspect's parent's
home?

  Exigent Circumstances: Public
                   Safety

The next category of exigent circumstances includes situations
in which police believe public safety is at immediate risk. For
example, when operators receive a 911 call reporting an
ongoing assault, police need not seek a warrant before heading
to the crime scene and, if necessary, entering a home.
                                                WARDEN V. HAYDEN (1967) | 281

Firefighters and emergency medical personnel also enter
buildings without warrants to provide prompt aid. Similarly,
officers who hear screams coming from a house or perceive
other evidence of imminent danger may have probable cause
that justifies warrantless entry. In these situations, police could
not effectively "serve and protect" without an exception to the
warrant requirement.
PAYTON V. NEW YORK
(1980)

              Supreme Court of the United States

 Brigham City, Utah v. Charles W.
                   Stuart

             Decided May 22, 2006 - 547 U.S. 398

   Chief Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the
[unanimous] Court.

   In this case we consider whether police may enter a home
without a warrant when they have an objectively reasonable
basis for believing that an occupant is seriously injured or
imminently threatened with such injury. We conclude that
they may.

                       I

This case arises out of a melee that occurred in a Brigham City,
Utah, home in the early morning hours of July 23, 2000. At
about 3 a.m., four police officers responded to a call regarding
                                             PAYTON V. NEW YORK (1980) | 283

a loud party at a residence. Upon arriving at the house, they
heard shouting from inside, and proceeded down the driveway
to investigate. There, they observed two juveniles drinking beer
in the backyard. They entered the backyard, and
saw--through a screen door and windows--an altercation
taking place in the kitchen of the home. According to the
testimony of one of the officers, four adults were attempting,
with some difficulty, to restrain a juvenile. The juvenile
eventually "broke free, swung a fist and struck one of the
adults in the face." The officer testified that he observed the
victim of the blow spitting blood into a nearby sink. The other
adults continued to try to restrain the juvenile, pressing him
up against a refrigerator with such force that the refrigerator
began moving across the floor. At this point, an officer opened
the screen door and announced the officers' presence. Amid
the tumult, nobody noticed. The officer entered the kitchen
and again cried out, and as the occupants slowly became aware
that the police were on the scene, the altercation ceased.

   The officers subsequently arrested respondents and charged
them with contributing to the delinquency of a minor,
disorderly conduct, and intoxication. In the trial court,
respondents filed a motion to suppress all evidence obtained
after the officers entered the home, arguing that the
warrantless entry violated the Fourth Amendment. The court
granted the motion, and the Utah Court of Appeals affirmed.

   We granted certiorari in light of differences among state
courts and the Courts of Appeals concerning the appropriate
284 | PAYTON V. NEW YORK (1980)

Fourth Amendment standard governing warrantless entry by
law enforcement in an emergency situation.

                       II

It is a "`basic principle of Fourth Amendment law that searches
and seizures inside a home without a warrant are
presumptively unreasonable.'" Nevertheless, because the
ultimate touchstone of the Fourth Amendment is
"reasonableness," the warrant requirement is subject to certain
exceptions. We have held, for example, that law enforcement
officers may make a warrantless entry onto private property to
fight a fire and investigate its cause, to prevent the imminent
destruction of evidence, or to engage in "`hot pursuit'" of a
fleeing suspect. "[W]arrants are generally required to search
a person's home or his person unless `the exigencies of the
situation' make the needs of law enforcement so compelling
that the warrantless search is objectively reasonable under the
Fourth Amendment."

   One exigency obviating the requirement of a warrant is the
need to assist persons who are seriously injured or threatened
with such injury. "`The need to protect or preserve life or avoid
serious injury is justification for what would be otherwise
illegal absent an exigency or emergency.'" Accordingly, law
enforcement officers may enter a home without a warrant to
render emergency assistance to an injured occupant or to
protect an occupant from imminent injury.
                                             PAYTON V. NEW YORK (1980) | 285

   ***
   We think the officers' entry here was plainly reasonable
under the circumstances. The officers were responding, at 3
o'clock in the morning, to complaints about a loud party. As
they approached the house, they could hear from within "an
altercation occurring, some kind of a fight." "It was loud and it
was tumultuous." The officers heard "thumping and crashing"
and people yelling "stop, stop" and "get off me." As the trial
court found, "it was obvious that ... knocking on the front
door" would have been futile. The noise seemed to be coming
from the back of the house; after looking in the front window
and seeing nothing, the officers proceeded around back to
investigate further. They found two juveniles drinking beer
in the backyard. From there, they could see that a fracas was
taking place inside the kitchen. A juvenile, fists clenched, was
being held back by several adults. As the officers watch, he
breaks free and strikes one of the adults in the face, sending the
adult to the sink spitting blood.
   In these circumstances, the officers had an objectively
reasonable basis for believing both that the injured adult might
need help and that the violence in the kitchen was just
beginning. Nothing in the Fourth Amendment required them
to wait until another blow rendered someone "unconscious"
or "semi-conscious" or worse before entering. The role of a
peace officer includes preventing violence and restoring order,
not simply rendering first aid to casualties; an officer is not like
286 | PAYTON V. NEW YORK (1980)

a boxing (or hockey) referee, poised to stop a bout only if it
becomes too one-sided.

   The manner of the officers' entry was also reasonable. After
witnessing the punch, one of the officers opened the screen
door and "yelled in police." When nobody heard him, he
stepped into the kitchen and announced himself again. Only
then did the tumult subside. The officer's announcement of
his presence was at least equivalent to a knock on the screen
door. Indeed, it was probably the only option that had even
a chance of rising above the din. Under these circumstances,
there was no violation of the Fourth Amendment's knock-
and-announce rule. Furthermore, once the announcement
was made, the officers were free to enter; it would serve no
purpose to require them to stand dumbly at the door awaiting
a response while those within brawled on, oblivious to their
presence.

   Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Supreme Court
of Utah, and remand the case for further proceedings not
inconsistent with this opinion.

   * * *
   The Michigan Court of Appeals affirmed, concluding that
the State had not met its burden. Perhaps because one judge
dissented, the Michigan Supreme Court initially granted an
application for leave to appeal. After considering briefs and
oral argument, however, the majority of that Court vacated
its earlier order because it was "no longer persuaded that the
questions presented should be reviewed by this Court."
                                             PAYTON V. NEW YORK (1980) | 287

   Today, without having heard Officer Goolsby's testimony,
this Court decides that the trial judge got it wrong. I am not
persuaded that he did, but even if we make that assumption,
it is hard to see how the Court is justified in micromanaging
the day-to-day business of state tribunals making fact-intensive
decisions of this kind. We ought not usurp the role of the
factfinder when faced with a close question of the
reasonableness of an officer's actions, particularly in a case tried
in a state court. I therefore respectfully dissent.

       Exigent Circumstances:
     Preserving Evidence from

               Destruction

Our next category of exigent circumstances includes situations
in which police have probable cause to believe (1) that items
subject to seizure are in a particular place and (2) that waiting
for a warrant would put the evidence at serious risk of
destruction. Common scenarios involve suspects who may be
about to flush drugs down the toilet, burn documents, or
tamper with electronic devices.

             Decided May 16, 2011 - 563 U.S. 452

   Justice ALITO delivered the opinion of the Court.
   It is well established that "exigent circumstances," including
the need to prevent the destruction of evidence, permit police
officers to conduct an otherwise permissible search without
first obtaining a warrant. In this case, we consider whether
this rule applies when police, by knocking on the door of a
residence and announcing their presence, cause the occupants
to attempt to destroy evidence. The Kentucky Supreme Court
held that the exigent circumstances rule does not apply in the
case at hand because the police should have foreseen that their
conduct would prompt the occupants to attempt to destroy
evidence. We reject this interpretation of the exigent
                                        BRIGHAM CITY V. STUART (2006) | 289

circumstances rule. The conduct of the police prior to their
entry into the apartment was entirely lawful. They did not
violate the Fourth Amendment or threaten to do so. In such a
situation, the exigent circumstances rule applies.

                       I

                         A

This case concerns the search of an apartment in Lexington,
Kentucky. Police officers set up a controlled buy of crack
cocaine outside an apartment complex. Undercover Officer
Gibbons watched the deal take place from an unmarked car in
a nearby parking lot. After the deal occurred, Gibbons radioed
uniformed officers to move in on the suspect. He told the
officers that the suspect was moving quickly toward the
breezeway of an apartment building, and he urged them to
"hurry up and get there" before the suspect entered an
apartment.

   In response to the radio alert, the uniformed officers drove
into the nearby parking lot, left their vehicles, and ran to the
breezeway. Just as they entered the breezeway, they heard a
door shut and detected a very strong odor of burnt marijuana.
At the end of the breezeway, the officers saw two apartments,
one on the left and one on the right, and they did not know
which apartment the suspect had entered. Gibbons had
radioed that the suspect was running into the apartment on
290 | BRIGHAM CITY V. STUART (2006)

the right, but the officers did not hear this statement because
they had already left their vehicles. Because they smelled
marijuana smoke emanating from the apartment on the left,
they approached the door of that apartment.

   Officer Steven Cobb, one of the uniformed officers who
approached the door, testified that the officers banged on the
left apartment door "as loud as [they] could" and announced,
"`This is the police'" or "`Police, police, police.'" Cobb said
that "[a]s soon as [the officers] started banging on the door,"
they "could hear people inside moving," and "[i]t sounded
as [though] things were being moved inside the apartment."
These noises, Cobb testified, led the officers to believe that
drug-related evidence was about to be destroyed.

   At that point, the officers announced that they "were going
to make entry inside the apartment." Cobb then kicked in
the door, the officers entered the apartment, and they found
three people in the front room: respondent Hollis King,
respondent's girlfriend, and a guest who was smoking
marijuana. The officers performed a protective sweep of the
apartment during which they saw marijuana and powder
cocaine in plain view. In a subsequent search, they also
discovered crack cocaine, cash, and drug paraphernalia.

   Police eventually entered the apartment on the right. Inside,
they found the suspected drug dealer who was the initial target
of their investigation.

   ***
   Over the years, lower courts have developed an exception
                                        BRIGHAM CITY V. STUART (2006) | 291

to the exigent circumstances rule, the so-called "police-created
exigency" doctrine. Under this doctrine, police may not rely
on the need to prevent destruction of evidence when that
exigency was "created" or "manufactured" by the conduct of
the police.

   ***

                      III

Despite the welter of tests devised by the lower courts, the
answer to the question presented in this case follows directly
and clearly from the principle that permits warrantless searches
in the first place. As previously noted, warrantless searches are
allowed when the circumstances make it reasonable, within
the meaning of the Fourth Amendment, to dispense with the
warrant requirement. Therefore, the answer to the question
before us is that the exigent circumstances rule justifies a
warrantless search when the conduct of the police preceding
the exigency is reasonable in the same sense. Where, as here, the
police did not create the exigency by engaging or threatening
to engage in conduct that violates the Fourth Amendment,
warrantless entry to prevent the destruction of evidence is
reasonable and thus allowed.

   ***
   In this case, we see no evidence that the officers either
violated the Fourth Amendment or threatened to do so prior
to the point when they entered the apartment. Officer Cobb
292 | BRIGHAM CITY V. STUART (2006)

testified without contradiction that the officers "banged on the
door as loud as [they] could" and announced either "`Police,
police, police'" or "`This is the police.'" This conduct was
entirely consistent with the Fourth Amendment, and we are
aware of no other evidence that might show that the officers
either violated the Fourth Amendment or threatened to do so
(for example, by announcing that they would break down the
door if the occupants did not open the door voluntarily).

   Like the court below, we assume for purposes of argument
that an exigency existed. Because the officers in this case did not
violate or threaten to violate the Fourth Amendment prior to
the exigency, we hold that the exigency justified the warrantless
search of the apartment.

   The judgment of the Kentucky Supreme Court is reversed,
and the case is remanded for further proceedings not
inconsistent with this opinion.

   Justice GINSBURG, dissenting.
   The Court today arms the police with a way routinely to
dishonor the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement in
drug cases. In lieu of presenting their evidence to a neutral
magistrate, police officers may now knock, listen, then break
the door down, nevermind that they had ample time to obtain
a warrant. I dissent from the Court's reduction of the Fourth
Amendment's force.
   This case involves a principal exception to the warrant
requirement, the exception applicable in "exigent
circumstances." "[C]arefully delineated," the exception should
                                        BRIGHAM CITY V. STUART (2006) | 293

govern only in genuine emergency situations. Circumstances
qualify as "exigent" when there is an imminent risk of death
or serious injury, or danger that evidence will be immediately
destroyed, or that a suspect will escape. The question
presented: May police, who could pause to gain the approval
of a neutral magistrate, dispense with the need to get a warrant
by themselves creating exigent circumstances? I would answer
no, as did the Kentucky Supreme Court. The urgency must
exist, I would rule, when the police come on the scene, not
subsequent to their arrival, prompted by their own conduct.

   That heavy burden has not been carried here. There was
little risk that drug-related evidence would have been destroyed
had the police delayed the search pending a magistrate's
authorization. As the Court recognizes, "[p]ersons in
possession of valuable drugs are unlikely to destroy them
unless they fear discovery by the police." Nothing in the record
shows that, prior to the knock at the apartment door, the
occupants were apprehensive about police proximity.

   In no quarter does the Fourth Amendment apply with
greater force than in our homes, our most private space which,
for centuries, has been regarded as "`entitled to special
protection.'" Home intrusions, the Court has said, are indeed
"the chief evil against which ... the Fourth Amendment is
directed." "`[S]earches and seizures inside a home without a
warrant are [therefore] presumptively unreasonable.'" How
"secure" do our homes remain if police, armed with no
warrant, can pound on doors at will and, on hearing sounds
294 | BRIGHAM CITY V. STUART (2006)

indicative of things moving, forcibly enter and search for
evidence of unlawful activity?

   ***
   Under an appropriately reined-in "emergency" or "exigent
circumstances" exception, the result in this case should not
be in doubt. The target of the investigation's entry into the
building, and the smell of marijuana seeping under the
apartment door into the hallway, the Kentucky Supreme
Court rightly determined, gave the police "probable cause ...
sufficient ... to obtain a warrant to search the ... apartment."
As that court observed, nothing made it impracticable for the
police to post officers on the premises while proceeding to
obtain a warrant authorizing their entry.
   I [] would not allow an expedient knock to override the
warrant requirement. Instead, I would accord that core
requirement of the Fourth Amendment full respect. When
possible, "a warrant must generally be secured," the Court
acknowledges. There is every reason to conclude that securing
a warrant was entirely feasible in this case, and no reason to
contract the Fourth Amendment's dominion.

EXIGENT
CIRCUMSTANCES:
PRESERVING EVIDENCE
FROM DESTRUCTION

Exigent Circumstance: Drunk
Driving

Questions concerning the scope of the "exigent circumstances"
exception to the warrant requirement have arisen repeatedly
in the context of drunk driving cases. These cases commonly
involve a special kind of evidence--alcohol in the blood of a
driver--at risk of being destroyed by the body's metabolism.
KENTUCKY V. KING
(2011)

              Supreme Court of the United States

 Missouri v. Tyler G. McNeely

             Decided April 17, 2013 - 569 U.S. 141

   Justice SOTOMAYOR announced the judgment of the
Court and delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to
Parts I, II-A, II-B, and IV, and an opinion with respect to
Part[] III, in which Justice SCALIA, Justice GINSBURG, and
Justice KAGAN join.

   In Schmerber v. California, 384 U.S. 757 (1966), this Court
upheld a warrantless blood test of an individual arrested for
driving under the influence of alcohol because the officer
"might reasonably have believed that he was confronted with
an emergency, in which the delay necessary to obtain a
warrant, under the circumstances, threatened the destruction
of evidence." The question presented here is whether the
natural metabolization of alcohol in the bloodstream presents
a per se exigency that justifies an exception to the Fourth
                                                   KENTUCKY V. KING (2011) | 297

Amendment's warrant requirement for nonconsensual blood
testing in all drunk-driving cases. We conclude that it does
not, and we hold, consistent with general Fourth Amendment
principles, that exigency in this context must be determined
case by case based on the totality of the circumstances.

                       I

While on highway patrol at approximately 2:08 a.m., a
Missouri police officer stopped Tyler McNeely's truck after
observing it exceed the posted speed limit and repeatedly cross
the centerline. The officer noticed several signs that McNeely
was intoxicated, including McNeely's bloodshot eyes, his
slurred speech, and the smell of alcohol on his breath.
McNeely acknowledged to the officer that he had consumed "a
couple of beers" at a bar and he appeared unsteady on his feet
when he exited the truck. After McNeely performed poorly on
a battery of field-sobriety tests and declined to use a portable
breath-test device to measure his blood alcohol concentration
(BAC), the officer placed him under arrest.

   The officer began to transport McNeely to the station
house. But when McNeely indicated that he would again
refuse to provide a breath sample, the officer changed course
and took McNeely to a nearby hospital for blood testing. The
officer did not attempt to secure a warrant. Upon arrival at the
hospital, the officer asked McNeely whether he would consent
to a blood test. Reading from a standard implied consent form,
298 | KENTUCKY V. KING (2011)

the officer explained to McNeely that under state law refusal
to submit voluntarily to the test would lead to the immediate
revocation of his driver's license for one year and could be used
against him in a future prosecution. McNeely nonetheless
refused. The officer then directed a hospital lab technician
to take a blood sample, and the sample was secured at
approximately 2:35 a.m. Subsequent laboratory testing
measured McNeely's BAC at 0.154 percent, which was well
above the legal limit of 0.08 percent.

   ***
   To determine whether a law enforcement officer faced an
emergency that justified acting without a warrant, this Court
looks to the totality of circumstances. We apply this "finely
tuned approach" to Fourth Amendment reasonableness in this
context because the police action at issue lacks "the traditional
justification that ... a warrant ... provides." Absent that
established justification, "the fact-specific nature of the
reasonableness inquiry" demands that we evaluate each case of
alleged exigency based "on its own facts and circumstances."
   The State properly recognizes that the reasonableness of a
warrantless search under the exigency exception to the warrant
requirement must be evaluated based on the totality of the
circumstances. But the State nevertheless seeks a per se rule for
blood testing in drunk-driving cases. The State contends that
whenever an officer has probable cause to believe an individual
has been driving under the influence of alcohol, exigent
circumstances will necessarily exist because BAC evidence is
                                                  KENTUCKY V. KING (2011) | 299

inherently evanescent. As a result, the State claims that so long
as the officer has probable cause and the blood test is
conducted in a reasonable manner, it is categorically
reasonable for law enforcement to obtain the blood sample
without a warrant.

   It is true that as a result of the human body's natural
metabolic processes, the alcohol level in a person's blood
begins to dissipate once the alcohol is fully absorbed and
continues to decline until the alcohol is eliminated. This fact
was essential to our holding in Schmerber, as we recognized
that, under the circumstances, further delay in order to secure
a warrant after the time spent investigating the scene of the
accident and transporting the injured suspect to the hospital
to receive treatment would have threatened the destruction of
evidence.

   But it does not follow that we should depart from careful
case-by-case assessment of exigency and adopt the categorical
rule proposed by the State and its amici. In those drunk-
driving investigations where police officers can reasonably
obtain a warrant before a blood sample can be drawn without
significantly undermining the efficacy of the search, the Fourth
Amendment mandates that they do so. We do not doubt that
some circumstances will make obtaining a warrant impractical
such that the dissipation of alcohol from the bloodstream will
support an exigency justifying a properly conducted
warrantless blood test. That, however, is a reason to decide
each case on its facts, as we did in Schmerber, not to accept
300 | KENTUCKY V. KING (2011)

the "considerable overgeneralization" that a per se rule would
reflect.

   ***
   In short, while the natural dissipation of alcohol in the
blood may support a finding of exigency in a specific case, as
it did in Schmerber, it does not do so categorically. Whether a
warrantless blood test of a drunk-driving suspect is reasonable
must be determined case by case based on the totality of the
circumstances.
   ***
   We hold that in drunk-driving investigations, the natural
dissipation of alcohol in the bloodstream does not constitute
an exigency in every case sufficient to justify conducting a
blood test without a warrant.
   The judgment of the Missouri Supreme Court is affirmed.
   Chief Justice ROBERTS, with whom Justice BREYER and
Justice ALITO join, concurring in part and dissenting in part
   [Chief Justice Roberts would have provided more robust
guidance to law enforcement about precisely when warrantless
nonconsensual blood draws are allowed. He wrote:
   "A police officer reading this Court's opinion would have no
idea--no idea--what the Fourth Amendment requires of him,
once he decides to obtain a blood sample from a drunk driving
suspect who has refused a breathalyzer test. I have no quarrel
with the Court's `totality of the circumstances' approach as
a general matter; that is what our cases require. But the
circumstances in drunk driving cases are often typical, and the
                                                   KENTUCKY V. KING (2011) | 301

Court should be able to offer guidance on how police should
handle cases like the one before us."

   "In my view, the proper rule is straightforward. Our cases
establish that there is an exigent circumstances exceptionto
the warrant requirement. That exception applies when there
is a compelling need to prevent the imminent destruction of
important evidence, and there is no time to obtain a warrant.
The natural dissipation of alcohol in the bloodstream
constitutes not only the imminent but ongoing destruction
of critical evidence. That would qualify as an exigent
circumstance, except that there may be time to secure a
warrant before blood can be drawn. If there is, an officer must
seek a warrant. If an officer could reasonably conclude that
there is not, the exigent circumstances exception applies by its
terms, and the blood may be drawn without a warrant."47]

   Justice THOMAS, dissenting.
   [Justice Thomas argued, "Because the body's natural
metabolization of alcohol inevitably destroys evidence of the
crime, it constitutes an exigent circumstance. As a result, I
would hold that a warrantless blood draw does not violate the
Fourth Amendment." He noted that all parties agreed about
the "rapid destruction of evidence" that "occurs inevery
situation where police have probable cause to arrest a drunk
driver."

       Notes, Comments, and
302 | KENTUCKY V. KING (2011)

                Questions

The Court in Birchfield v. North Dakota (2016)holds implied
blood-draw consent laws that result in criminal prosecution
unconstitutional. What result if the implied consent law
results in an administrative (rather than criminal) penalty?
For example, suppose a state's implied consent law requires
drivers arrested or drunk driving to consent to a breathalyzer,
blood draw, saliva or urine analysis or have their license
administratively revoked for one year. See, e.g., 577.020,
RSMo (2016).

   In Mitchell v. Wisconsin, 139 S. Ct 2525 (2019), the Court
issued a plurality opinion affirming the legality of a warrantless
blood draw conducted by police after a suspect became
unconscious. The plurality opinion--approved by four
Justices--stated that when a driver is unconscious and cannot
submit to a breath test, police may perform a blood draw
under the exigent circumstances exception to the warrant
requirement. The opinion relied upon Schmerber v.
California, Missouri v. McNeely, and Birchfield. Justice
Thomas, concurring in the judgment, would have held that
the natural metabolism of alcohol by the human body always
creates a per se exigency "once police have probable cause to
believe the driver is drunk." Four Justices dissented, in two
separate opinions.

       Notes, Comments, and
                                                  KENTUCKY V. KING (2011) | 303

                Questions

In 1984, the Court prohibited police from entering a house to
arrest an apparently intoxicated man who had recently driven
his car off the road and stumbled home. In 2016, the Court
allowed states to demand--under threat of criminal
prosecution--that motorists arrested for drunk driving
submit to breath tests. The home entry was "unreasonable,"
and demanding the breath test is "reasonable."

   Students might also consider, however, that the decisions
could result in part on changing attitudes toward drunk
driving. What was a noncriminal violation in Wisconsin in the
1980s is now punished far more severely across the nation.
Mothers Against Drunk Driving, founded in 1980 after the
founder's daughter was killed in a crash involving a drunk
driver, won important legislative victories beginning in 1984,
when Congress acted to force states to raise their drinking ages
to 21 years.48

 Warrant Exception: Ports of
                 Entry

When persons and items enter the United States from abroad,
agents of the executive enjoy expansive authority to conduct
searches and seizures without a warrant. The Court has
repeatedly chosen to provide relatively little judicial oversight
of the executive's use of that authority, especially when
compared to oversight of common domestic policing.

   We begin with the Court's approval of routine searches at
the California-Mexico border. No quantum of evidence (or
suspicion) is needed.

    United States v. Manuel
         Flores-Montano

            Decided March 30, 2004 - 541 U.S. 149

   Chief Justice REHNQUIST delivered the opinion of the
[unanimous] Court.

   ***
   The Government's interest in preventing the entry of
unwanted persons and effects is at its zenith at the
international border. Time and again, we have stated that
"searches made at the border, pursuant to the longstanding
right of the sovereign to protect itself by stopping and
examining persons and property crossing into this country, are
reasonable simply by virtue of the fact that they occur at the
border." Congress, since the beginning of our Government,
                      UNITED STATES V. FLORES-MONTANO (2004) | 313

"has granted the Executive plenary authority to conduct
routine searches and seizures at the border, without probable
cause or a warrant, in order to regulate the collection of duties
and to prevent the introduction of contraband into this
country." It is axiomatic that the United States, as sovereign,
has the inherent authority to protect, and a paramount interest
in protecting, its territorial integrity.

   That interest in protecting the borders is illustrated in this
case by the evidence that smugglers frequently attempt to
penetrate our borders with contraband secreted in their
automobiles' fuel tank. Over the past 5 ½ fiscal years, there
have been 18,788 vehicle drug seizures at the southern
California ports of entry. Of those 18,788, gas tank drug
seizures have accounted for 4,619 of the vehicle drug seizures,
or approximately 25%. In addition, instances of persons
smuggled in and around gas tank compartments are discovered
at the ports of entry of San Ysidro and Otay Mesa at a rate
averaging 1 approximately every 10 days.

   Respondent asserts two main arguments with respect to
his Fourth Amendment interests. First, he urges that he has
a privacy interest in his fuel tank, and that the suspicionless
disassembly of his tank is an invasion of his privacy. But on
many occasions, we have noted that the expectation of privacy
is less at the border than it is in the interior. We have long
recognized that automobiles seeking entry into this country
may be searched. It is difficult to imagine how the search of
a gas tank, which should be solely a repository for fuel, could
314 | UNITED STATES V. FLORES-MONTANO (2004)

be more of an invasion of privacy than the search of the
automobile's passenger compartment.

   Justice BREYER, concurring.
   I join the Court's opinion in full. I also note that Customs
keeps track of the border searches its agents conduct, including
the reasons for the searches. This administrative process
should help minimize concerns that gas tank searches might be
undertaken in an abusive manner.
   * * *
   In addition to permitting extensive suspicionless searches and
seizures at international borders, the Court has permitted
similar searches and seizures at checkpoints some distance from
the border. The fixed checkpoint at issue in the next case was 66
miles north of the United States-Mexico border.

   Mr. Justice POWELL delivered the opinion of the Court.
   Th[is] case[] involve[s] criminal prosecutions for offenses
relating to the transportation of illegal Mexican aliens.
[D]efendant was arrested at a permanent checkpoint operated
by the Border Patrol away from the international border with
Mexico, and [] sought the exclusion of certain evidence on the
ground that the operation of the checkpoint was incompatible
with the Fourth Amendment. [W]hether the Fourth
Amendment was violated turns primarily on whether a vehicle
may be stopped at a fixed checkpoint for brief questioning of
its occupants even though there is no reason to believe the
316 | UNITED STATES V. MARTINEZ-FUERTE (1976)

particular vehicle contains illegal aliens. We hold today that
such stops are consistent with the Fourth Amendment. We
also hold that the operation of a fixed checkpoint need not be
authorized in advance by a judicial warrant.

                      

                         A

The respondents are defendants in three separate prosecutions
resulting from arrests made on three different occasions at the
permanent immigration checkpoint on Interstate 5 near San
Clemente, Cal. Interstate 5 is the principal highway between
San Diego and Los Angeles, and the San Clemente checkpoint
is 66 road miles north of the Mexican border.

   The "point" agent visually screens all northbound vehicles,
which the checkpoint brings to a virtual, if not a complete,
halt. Most motorists are allowed to resume their progress
without any oral inquiry or close visual examination. In a
relatively small number of cases the "point" agent will
conclude that further inquiry is in order. He directs these cars
to a secondary inspection area, where their occupants are asked
about their citizenship and immigration status. The
Government informs us that at San Clemente the average
length of an investigation in the secondary inspection area is
three to five minutes. A direction to stop in the secondary
inspection area could be based on something suspicious about
                       UNITED STATES V. MARTINEZ-FUERTE (1976) | 317

a particular car passing through the checkpoint, but the
Government concedes that none of the three stops at issue was
based on any articulable suspicion. During the period when
these stops were made, the checkpoint was operating under
a magistrate's "warrant of inspection," which authorized the
Border Patrol to conduct a routine-stop operation at the San
Clemente location.

   ***

                      IV

It is agreed that checkpoint stops are "seizures" within the
meaning of the Fourth Amendment. The defendants contend
primarily that the routine stopping of vehicles at a checkpoint
is invalid because Brignoni-Ponce must be read as proscribing
any stops in the absence of reasonable suspicion. [W]e turn
first to whether reasonable suspicion is a prerequisite to a valid
stop, a question to be resolved by balancing the interests at
stake.

                         A

Our previous cases have recognized that maintenance of a
traffic-checking program in the interior is necessary because
the flow of illegal aliens cannot be controlled effectively at
the border. We note here only the substantiality of the public
interest in the practice of routine stops for inquiry at
318 | UNITED STATES V. MARTINEZ-FUERTE (1976)

permanent checkpoints, a practice which the Government
identifies as the most important of the traffic-checking
operations. These checkpoints are located on important
highways; in their absence such highways would offer illegal
aliens a quick and safe route into the interior. Routine
checkpoint inquiries apprehend many smugglers and illegal
aliens who succumb to the lure of such highways. And the
prospect of such inquiries forces others onto less efficient roads
that are less heavily traveled, slowing their movement and
making them more vulnerable to detection by roving patrols.

   A requirement that stops on major routes inland always be
based on reasonable suspicion would be impractical because
the flow of traffic tends to be too heavy to allow the
particularized study of a given car that would enable it to be
identified as a possible carrier of illegal aliens. In particular,
such a requirement would largely eliminate any deterrent to
the conduct of well-disguised smuggling operations, even
though smugglers are known to use these highways regularly.

                         B

While the need to make routine checkpoint stops is great, the
consequent intrusion on Fourth Amendment interests is quite
limited. The stop does intrude to a limited extent on motorists'
right to "free passage without interruption," and arguably on
their right to personal security. But it involves only a brief
detention of travelers during which "`[a]ll that is required of
                       UNITED STATES V. MARTINEZ-FUERTE (1976) | 319

the vehicle's occupants is a response to a brief question or two
and possibly the production of a document evidencing a right
to be in the United States.'"

   Neither the vehicle nor its occupants are searched, and
visual inspection of the vehicle is limited to what can be seen
without a search. This objective intrusion the stop itself, the
questioning, and the visual inspection also existed in roving-
patrol stops. But we view checkpoint stops in a different light
because the subjective intrusion--the generating of concern or
even fright on the part of lawful travelers--is appreciably less
in the case of a checkpoint stop.

   ***
   Routine checkpoint stops do not intrude similarly on the
motoring public. First, the potential interference with
legitimate traffic is minimal. Motorists using these highways
are not taken by surprise as they know, or may obtain
knowledge of, the location of the checkpoints and will not
be stopped elsewhere. Second, checkpoint operations both
appear to and actually involve less discretionary enforcement
activity. The regularized manner in which established
checkpoints are operated is visible evidence, reassuring to law-
abiding motorists, that the stops are duly authorized and
believed to serve the public interest. The location of a fixed
checkpoint is not chosen by officers in the field, but by officials
responsible for making overall decisions as to the most effective
allocation of limited enforcement resources. We may assume
that such officials will be unlikely to locate a checkpoint where
320 | UNITED STATES V. MARTINEZ-FUERTE (1976)

it bears arbitrarily or oppressively on motorists as a class. And
since field officers may stop only those cars passing the
checkpoint, there is less room for abusive or harassing stops of
individuals than there was in the case of roving-patrol stops.
Moreover, a claim that a particular exercise of discretion in
locating or operating a checkpoint is unreasonable is subject to
post-stop judicial review.

   ***

                      VI

In summary, we hold that stops for brief questioning routinely
conducted at permanent checkpoints are consistent with the
Fourth Amendment and need not be authorized by warrant.
The principal protection of Fourth Amendment rights at
checkpoints lies in appropriate limitations on the scope of the
stop. We have held that checkpoint searches are constitutional
only if justified by consent or probable cause to search. And
our holding today is limited to the type of stops described
in this opinion. "[A]ny further detention ... must be based
on consent or probable cause." None of the defendants in
these cases argues that the stopping officers exceeded these
limitations. We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals
for the Ninth Circuit and remand the case with directions to
affirm the conviction of Martinez-Fuerte.

   Mr. Justice BRENNAN, with whom Mr. Justice
MARSHALL joins, dissenting.
                       UNITED STATES V. MARTINEZ-FUERTE (1976) | 321

   Today's decision is the ninth this Term marking the
continuing evisceration of Fourth Amendment protections
against unreasonable searches and seizures. Consistent with
this purpose to debilitate Fourth Amendment protections, the
Court's decision today virtually empties the Amendment of its
reasonableness requirement by holding that law enforcement
officials manning fixed checkpoint stations who make
standardless seizures of persons do not violate the
Amendment. I dissent.

   We are told today [] that motorists without number may
be individually stopped, questioned, visually inspected, and
then further detained without even a showing of articulable
suspicion, let alone the heretofore constitutional minimum of
reasonable suspicion, a result that permits search and seizure
to rest upon "nothing more substantial than inarticulate
hunches." This defacement of Fourth Amendment
protections is arrived at by a balancing process that
overwhelms the individual's protection against unwarranted
official intrusion by a governmental interest said to justify the
search and seizure. But that method is only a convenient cover
for condoning arbitrary official conduct.

   ***
   Since the objective is almost entirely the Mexican illegally in
the country, checkpoint officials, uninhibited by any objective
standards and therefore free to stop any or all motorists
without explanation or excuse, wholly on whim, will perforce
target motorists of Mexican appearance. The process will then
322 | UNITED STATES V. MARTINEZ-FUERTE (1976)

inescapably discriminate against citizens of Mexican ancestry
and Mexican aliens lawfully in this country for no other reason
than that they unavoidably possess the same "suspicious"
physical and grooming characteristics of illegal Mexican aliens.

   Every American citizen of Mexican ancestry and every
Mexican alien lawfully in this country must know after today's
decision that he travels the fixed checkpoint highways at the
risk of being subjected not only to a stop, but also to detention
and interrogation, both prolonged and to an extent far more
than for non-Mexican appearing motorists. To be singled out
for referral and to be detained and interrogated must be
upsetting to any motorist. One wonders what actual
experience supports my Brethren's conclusion that referrals
"should not be frightening or offensive because of their public
and relatively routine nature." In point of fact, referrals viewed
in context, are not relatively routine; thousands are otherwise
permitted to pass. But for the arbitrarily selected motorists
who must suffer the delay and humiliation of detention and
interrogation, the experience can obviously be upsetting. And
that experience is particularly vexing for the motorist of
Mexican ancestry who is selectively referred, knowing that the
officers' target is the Mexican alien. That deep resentment will
be stirred by a sense of unfair discrimination is not difficult to
foresee.49

   In short, if a balancing process is required, the balance
should be struck to require that Border Patrol officers act upon
at least reasonable suspicion in making checkpoint stops. In
                       UNITED STATES V. MARTINEZ-FUERTE (1976) | 323

any event, even if a different balance were struck, the Court
cannot, without ignoring the Fourth Amendment
requirement of reasonableness, justify wholly unguided
seizures by officials manning the checkpoints.

   The cornerstone of this society, indeed of any free society,
is orderly procedure. The Constitution, as originally adopted,
was therefore, in great measure, a procedural document. For
the same reasons the drafters of the Bill of Rights largely placed
their faith in procedural limitations on government action.
The Fourth Amendment's requirement that searches and
seizures be reasonable enforces this fundamental
understanding in erecting its buffer against the arbitrary
treatment of citizens by government. But to permit, as the
Court does today, police discretion to supplant the objectivity
of reason and, thereby, expediency to reign in the place of
order, is to undermine Fourth Amendment safeguards and
threaten erosion of the cornerstone of our system of a
government, for, as Mr. Justice Frankfurter reminded us,
"[t]he history of American freedom is, in no small measure,
the history of procedure."

       Notes, Comments, and
                Questions

A police officer is 66 miles from the Canadian border. There
is no checkpoint. The officer spots a car and is suspicious that
it contains Canadians who are not legally in the United States.
324 | UNITED STATES V. MARTINEZ-FUERTE (1976)

How much evidence must the officer have to stop the car to
conduct a brief investigation of its occupants?

   What is your authority for your answer to the previous
question? If you do not have authority to which you can refer,
review the Court's opinion in Martinez-Fuerte. In that
opinion, which mostly concerned fixed checkpoints, the
Court referred to prior law concerning roving patrols.

       Notes, Comments, and
                Questions

Students should be aware of three ongoing controversies
related to border enforcement: (1) the existence and
significance of an "extended border" and areas known as the
"functional equivalent" of the border, (2) the treatment of
electronic devices crossing the border, and (3) the treatment
of persons crossing the border seeking asylum or otherwise
fleeing persecution and poverty.

    The Functional Border and
           Extended Border

International airports and the land immediately surrounding
those airports are treated as the "functional equivalent" of the
border. Accordingly, a traveler flying from England to St.
                       UNITED STATES V. MARTINEZ-FUERTE (1976) | 325

Louis could be subjected to the same searches permissible at
the border itself.

   More controversially, federal officials have argued that they
possess search and seizure authority within 100 miles of
international borders in an area known as the "extended
border." See, e.g., 8 C.F.R. § 287.1. If all authority granted to
law enforcement at the physical border exists throughout the
extended border, then people in New York City, Los Angeles,
Houston, New Orleans, Seattle, Washington, D.C., and all of
Florida could be subjected to suspicionless searches of their
persons and effects at will. Civil libertarian organizations have
accordingly decried the concept of the extended border, calling
it an unlawful "Constitution-Free Zone."

   The map below illustrates the ACLU's take on the extended
border:

It is not clear precisely what authority federal officials claim to
326 | UNITED STATES V. MARTINEZ-FUERTE (1976)

possess in the extended border--official guidance documents
differ, and actual practice can diverge from such
documents--nor is there robust judicial guidance. In an era
of increasingly-vigorous immigration enforcement, this issue is
attracting more attention.
ELECTRONIC DEVICES
AT OR NEAR THE
BORDER

Electronic Devices at or Near
             the Border

Referring to Supreme Court cases granting border officials
wide discretion to search persons and effects entering and
leaving the United States, federal officials have claimed to have
authority to inspect electronic devices at the border. Privacy
advocates have argued that searches conducted under this
purported authority violate the Fourth Amendment.

   Although some caselaw exists on this question, see, e.g.,
United States v. Cotterman, 709 F.3d 952 (9th Cir. 2013) (en
banc) (holding that reasonable suspicion is necessary to search
electronic devices at border in certain cases); Alasaad v.
McAleenan, 1:17-cv-11730-DJC (D. Mass. Nov. 12, 2019)
(applying rule to larger class of searches); United States v. Ickes,
393 F.3d 501 (4th Cir. 2005) (allowing suspicionless searches),
the law is not clear. Further litigation is ongoing.

   In response to the risk of searches (which could expose
328 | ELECTRONIC DEVICES AT OR NEAR THE BORDER

lawful information such as trade secrets, personal
correspondence, and embarrassing literature to inspection),
some international travelers have begun wiping data from their
computers and other devices before entering the United States;
they can then download data from the cloud after clearing
immigration and customs.
TREATMENT OF
REFUGEES, ASYLUM
SEEKERS, AND OTHER
MIGRANTS

    Treatment of Refugees,
  Asylum Seekers, and Other

               Migrants

The treatment of border crossers has received significant news
coverage recently. In particular, the question of how the
United States may treat migrants who claim to be fleeing
persecution--especially migrants entering the United States
with children--has inspired intense debate. For example, U.S.
Senator Kamala Harris visited the Otay Mesa Detention
Facility50 near San Diego in June 2018 and called the
treatment of detainees "a crime against humanity that is being
committed by the United States government." As one might
expect, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and
Department of Homeland Security officials have disagreed
with such assessments and have defended current practices as
330 | TREATMENT OF REFUGEES, ASYLUM SEEKERS, AND OTHER
MIGRANTS

lawful exercises of the executive's authority to enforce laws at
the border. Immigration law and refugee policy are beyond
the scope of this course. Students might nonetheless consider
whether the Court's decisions on how the Fourth
Amendment restricts (or does not restrict) executive discretion
with respect to searches and seizures at the border shed light
on what other border enforcement tactics are and are not (and
should be or should not be) lawful.
PART XVI

FOURTH
AMENDMENT:
WARRANT
EXCEPTIONS (PART
7)
TRAFFIC CHECKPOINTS

   Warrant Exception: Traffic
            Checkpoints

In this chapter, we consider two situations in which the Court
has authorized warrantless searches: (1) checkpoints, generally
aimed at protecting the public from intoxicated drivers, and
(2) "protective sweeps" that police may conduct in association
with an arrest. Note that sweeps are distinct from searches
incident to lawful arrest and are governed by different rules.

   We begin with vehicle checkpoints. Checkpoints involve
stopping cars randomly--or otherwise selecting cars to stop
without any specific reason to believe that the drivers are
intoxicated or otherwise breaking the law or transporting
items subject to seizure. Accordingly, vehicle checkpoints can
be permissible only if the Court allows police seizures of
persons and property without even reasonable suspicion,
much less probable cause. The question is whether such
seizures are "reasonable" under the Fourth Amendment.

   * * *
   In the next case, the Court considered whether the holding of
Michigan v. Sitz--permitting roadway checkpoints to look for
334 | TRAFFIC CHECKPOINTS

drunk drivers-allows police to conduct random (suspicionless)
stops of vehicles to check whether they contain illegal drugs. While
a checkpoint for "drugged" drivers would almost surely have
been permissible for the same reasons that the Court permitted
drunk driving checkpoints, the question of a checkpoint for
contraband or other evidence of crime proved more
controversial.
INDIANAPOLIS V.
EDMOND (2000)

              Supreme Court of the United States

 City of Indianapolis v. James
               Edmond

              Decided Nov. 28, 2000 - 531 U.S. 32

   Justice O'CONNOR delivered the opinion of the Court.
   In Michigan Dept. of State Police v. Sitz and United States
v. Martinez-Fuerte, we held that brief, suspicionless seizures
at highway checkpoints for the purposes of combating drunk
driving and intercepting illegal immigrants were
constitutional. We now consider the constitutionality of a
highway checkpoint program whose primary purpose is the
discovery and interdiction of illegal narcotics.

                       I

In August 1998, the city of Indianapolis began to operate
336 | INDIANAPOLIS V. EDMOND (2000)

vehicle checkpoints on Indianapolis roads in an effort to
interdict unlawful drugs. The city conducted six such
roadblocks between August and November that year, stopping
1,161 vehicles and arresting 104 motorists. Fifty-five arrests
were for drug-related crimes, while 49 were for offenses
unrelated to drugs. The overall "hit rate" of the program was
thus approximately nine percent.

   The parties stipulated to the facts concerning the operation
of the checkpoints by the Indianapolis Police Department
(IPD) for purposes of the preliminary injunction proceedings
instituted below. At each checkpoint location, the police stop a
predetermined number of vehicles. Approximately 30 officers
are stationed at the checkpoint. Pursuant to written directives
issued by the chief of police, at least one officer approaches the
vehicle, advises the driver that he or she is being stopped briefly
at a drug checkpoint, and asks the driver to produce a license
and registration. The officer also looks for signs of impairment
and conducts an open-view examination of the vehicle from
the outside. A narcotics-detection dog walks around the
outside of each stopped vehicle.

   The directives instruct the officers that they may conduct a
search only by consent or based on the appropriate quantum
of particularized suspicion. The officers must conduct each
stop in the same manner until particularized suspicion
develops, and the officers have no discretion to stop any vehicle
out of sequence. The city agreed in the stipulation to operate
the checkpoints in such a way as to ensure that the total
                                      INDIANAPOLIS V. EDMOND (2000) | 337

duration of each stop, absent reasonable suspicion or probable
cause, would be five minutes or less.

   Respondents James Edmond and Joell Palmer were each
stopped at a narcotics checkpoint in late September 1998.
Respondents then filed a lawsuit on behalf of themselves and
the class of all motorists who had been stopped or were subject
to being stopped in the future at the Indianapolis drug
checkpoints. Respondents claimed that the roadblocks
violated the Fourth Amendment of the United States
Constitution and the search and seizure provision of the
Indiana Constitution. Respondents requested declaratory and
injunctive relief for the class, as well as damages and attorney's
fees for themselves.

   ***

                       II

The Fourth Amendment requires that searches and seizures be
reasonable. A search or seizure is ordinarily unreasonable in
the absence of individualized suspicion of wrongdoing. While
such suspicion is not an "irreducible" component of
reasonableness, we have recognized only limited circumstances
in which the usual rule does not apply. We have [] upheld brief,
suspicionless seizures of motorists at a fixed Border Patrol
checkpoint designed to intercept illegal aliens and at a sobriety
checkpoint aimed at removing drunk drivers from the road. In
addition we [have] suggested that a similar type of roadblock
338 | INDIANAPOLIS V. EDMOND (2000)

with the purpose of verifying drivers' licenses and vehicle
registrations would be permissible. In none of these cases,
however, did we indicate approval of a checkpoint program
whose primary purpose was to detect evidence of ordinary
criminal wrongdoing.

                      III

It is well established that a vehicle stop at a highway checkpoint
effectuates a seizure within the meaning of the Fourth
Amendment. The fact that officers walk a narcotics-detection
dog around the exterior of each car at the Indianapolis
checkpoints does not transform the seizure into a search. Just
as in Place,1 an exterior sniff of an automobile does not require
entry into the car and is not designed to disclose any
information other than the presence or absence of narcotics.
Like the dog sniff in Place, a sniff by a dog that simply walks
around a car is "much less intrusive than a typical search."
Rather, what principally distinguishes these checkpoints from
those we have previously approved is their primary purpose.

   ***
   We have never approved a checkpoint program whose
primary purpose was to detect evidence of ordinary criminal
wrongdoing. Rather, our checkpoint cases have recognized
only limited exceptions to the general rule that a seizure must
be accompanied by some measure of individualized suspicion.
[E]ach of the checkpoint programs that we have approved was
                                      INDIANAPOLIS V. EDMOND (2000) | 339

designed primarily to serve purposes closely related to the
problems of policing the border or the necessity of ensuring
roadway safety. Because the primary purpose of the
Indianapolis narcotics checkpoint program is to uncover
evidence of ordinary criminal wrongdoing, the program
contravenes the Fourth Amendment.

   ***
   The primary purpose of the Indianapolis narcotics
checkpoints is in the end to advance "the general interest in
crime control." We decline to suspend the usual requirement
of individualized suspicion where the police seek to employ
a checkpoint primarily for the ordinary enterprise of
investigating crimes. We cannot sanction stops justified only
by the generalized and ever-present possibility that
interrogation and inspection may reveal that any given
motorist has committed some crime.
   ***
   It goes without saying that our holding today does nothing
to alter the constitutional status of the sobriety and border
checkpoints that we approved in Sitz and Martinez-Fuerte.
The constitutionality of such checkpoint programs still
depends on a balancing of the competing interests at stake
and the effectiveness of the program. When law enforcement
authorities pursue primarily general crime control purposes at
checkpoints such as here, however, stops can only be justified
by some quantum of individualized suspicion.
   Our holding also does not affect the validity of border
340 | INDIANAPOLIS V. EDMOND (2000)

searches or searches at places like airports and government
buildings, where the need for such measures to ensure public
safety can be particularly acute. Nor does our opinion speak
to other intrusions aimed primarily at purposes beyond the
general interest in crime control. Our holding also does not
impair the ability of police officers to act appropriately upon
information that they properly learn during a checkpoint stop
justified by a lawful primary purpose, even where such action
may result in the arrest of a motorist for an offense unrelated
to that purpose. Finally, we caution that the purpose inquiry
in this context is to be conducted only at the programmatic
level and is not an invitation to probe the minds of individual
officers acting at the scene.

   Because the primary purpose of the Indianapolis
checkpoint program is ultimately indistinguishable from the
general interest in crime control, the checkpoints violate the
Fourth Amendment. The judgment of the Court of Appeals
is, accordingly, affirmed.

   Chief Justice REHNQUIST, with whom Justice
THOMAS joins, and with whom Justice SCALIA joins as to
Part I, dissenting. [OMITTED]

   * * *
   In the next case, the Court considered a police checkpoint
designed to find witnesses of a recent crime--a hit-and-run
crash. Like Indianapolis v. Edmond, and unlike Michigan v.
Sitz, the case involved stopping vehicles without any purpose of
protecting the public from immediate hazards presented by their
                                       INDIANAPOLIS V. EDMOND (2000) | 341

drivers. However, unlike Edmond, police did not hope to find
evidence of wrongdoing by the drivers; instead, they hoped to
learn whether the drivers had seen wrongdoing by someone else.
ILLINOIS V. LIDSTER
(2004)

              Supreme Court of the United States

  Illinois v. Robert S. Lidster

              Decided Jan. 13, 2004 - 540 U.S. 419

   Justice BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court.
   This Fourth Amendment case focuses upon a highway
checkpoint where police stopped motorists to ask them for
information about a recent hit-and-run accident. We hold that
the police stops were reasonable, hence, constitutional.

                       I

The relevant background is as follows: On Saturday, August
23, 1997, just after midnight, an unknown motorist traveling
eastbound on a highway in Lombard, Illinois, struck and killed
a 70-year-old bicyclist. The motorist drove off without
identifying himself. About one week later at about the same
                                                 ILLINOIS V. LIDSTER (2004) | 343

time of night and at about the same place, local police set up
a highway checkpoint designed to obtain more information
about the accident from the motoring public.

   Police cars with flashing lights partially blocked the
eastbound lanes of the highway. The blockage forced traffic
to slow down, leading to lines of up to 15 cars in each lane.
As each vehicle drew up to the checkpoint, an officer would
stop it for 10 to 15 seconds, ask the occupants whether they
had seen anything happen there the previous weekend, and
hand each driver a flyer. The flyer said "ALERT ... FATAL
HIT & RUN ACCIDENT" and requested "ASSISTANCE
IN IDENTIFYING THE VEHICLE AND DRIVER
INVOLVED IN THIS ACCIDENT WHICH KILLED A
70 YEAR OLD BICYCLIST."

   Robert Lidster, the respondent, drove a minivan toward
the checkpoint. As he approached the checkpoint, his van
swerved, nearly hitting one of the officers. The officer smelled
alcohol on Lidster's breath. He directed Lidster to a side street
where another officer administered a sobriety test and then
arrested Lidster. Lidster was tried and convicted in Illinois state
court of driving under the influence of alcohol.

   Lidster challenged the lawfulness of his arrest and
conviction on the ground that the government had obtained
much of the relevant evidence through use of a checkpoint
stop that violated the Fourth Amendment. The trial court
rejected that challenge. But an Illinois appellate court reached
344 | ILLINOIS V. LIDSTER (2004)

the opposite conclusion. The Illinois Supreme Court agreed
with the appellate court.

   [W]e granted certiorari. We now reverse the Illinois
Supreme Court's determination.

                       II

The Illinois Supreme Court basically held that our decision in
Edmond governs the outcome of this case. We do not agree.
Edmond involved a checkpoint at which police stopped
vehicles to look for evidence of drug crimes committed by
occupants of those vehicles.

   The checkpoint stop here differs significantly from that in
Edmond. The stop's primary law enforcement purpose was not
to determine whether a vehicle's occupants were committing a
crime, but to ask vehicle occupants, as members of the public,
for their help in providing information about a crime in all
likelihood committed by others. The police expected the
information elicited to help them apprehend, not the vehicle's
occupants, but other individuals.

   ***

                      III

***
   The relevant public concern was grave. Police were
                                                 ILLINOIS V. LIDSTER (2004) | 345

investigating a crime that had resulted in a human death. No
one denies the police's need to obtain more information at that
time. And the stop's objective was to help find the perpetrator
of a specific and known crime, not of unknown crimes of a
general sort.

   The stop advanced this grave public concern to a significant
degree. The police appropriately tailored their checkpoint
stops to fit important criminal investigatory needs. The stops
took place about one week after the hit-and-run accident, on
the same highway near the location of the accident, and at
about the same time of night. And police used the stops to
obtain information from drivers, some of whom might well
have been in the vicinity of the crime at the time it occurred.

   Most importantly, the stops interfered only minimally with
liberty of the sort the Fourth Amendment seeks to protect.
Viewed objectively, each stop required only a brief wait in
line--a very few minutes at most. Contact with the police
lasted only a few seconds. Police contact consisted simply of a
request for information and the distribution of a flyer. Viewed
subjectively, the contact provided little reason for anxiety or
alarm. The police stopped all vehicles systematically. And there
is no allegation here that the police acted in a discriminatory
or otherwise unlawful manner while questioning motorists
during stops.

   For these reasons we conclude that the checkpoint stop was
constitutional.

   The judgment of the Illinois Supreme Court is [r]eversed.
346 | ILLINOIS V. LIDSTER (2004)

       Notes, Comments, and
                Questions

The Court made clear in Indianapolis v. Edmond that police
may not establish checkpoints to investigate whether drivers
are transporting illegal drugs. Consider a department that
responds as follows:

   Police post signs with text like "Drug Checkpoint Ahead"
on public highways. Then, after observing drivers who
promptly exit the highway after passing the sign, officers
investigate the drivers for drug activity. Lawful? Why or why
not?

   See, e.g., United States v. Williams, 359 F.3d 1019 (8th Cir.
2004) (holding that because "there was no checkpoint,"
Edmond did not apply); United States v. Neff, 681 F.3d 1134
(10th Cir. 2012) (holding that the fake-checkpoint ruse was
lawful but that "standing alone," a driver's choice to exit after
seeing the sign "is insufficient to justify even a brief
investigatory detention of a vehicle"); compare State v. Mack,
66 S.W.3d 706 (Mo. 2002) (finding that "it is reasonable to
conclude that drivers with drugs would `take the bait' and
exit" and holding that stop was reasonable in part because "the
checkpoint was set up in an isolated and sparsely populated
area offering no services to motorists and was conducted on
an evening that would otherwise have little traffic"); with id.
at 710 (Stith, J., dissenting) (arguing that seizure was
unreasonable under Edmond).
                                                 ILLINOIS V. LIDSTER (2004) | 347

   If a driver exiting the highway immediately after passing
a "drug checkpoint ahead" sign is not sufficient to provide
reasonable suspicion to justify a vehicle stop (as the Tenth
Circuit held), what else should be necessary to justify the stop?
In other words, what else must an officer observe after the car
exits?

   This tactic has attracted attention from the surveilled
community. See, e.g., Steve Elliot, "Cops Set Up Fake `Drug
Checkpoint' Signs; Detain and Search Drivers Who React,"
Toke Signals (Jan. 28, 2014); TJ Green, "Fake Drug
Checkpoints Are Becoming More Devious," Weed Blog (May
3, 2012).
PROTECTIVE SWEEPS

Warrant Exception: Protective
Sweeps

Our final case for this chapter concerns "protective sweeps,"
which police may conduct along with an arrest to protect
themselves and others from potential attackers who may be
lying in wait. Students should carefully note how the
protective sweeps doctrine differs from that regulating searches
incident to lawful arrests.
MARYLAND V. BUIE
(1990)

              Supreme Court of the United States

 Maryland v. Jerome Edward
                  Buie

             Decided Feb. 28, 1990 - 494 U.S. 325

   Justice WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.
   A "protective sweep" is a quick and limited search of
premises, incident to an arrest and conducted to protect the
safety of police officers or others. It is narrowly confined to
a cursory visual inspection of those places in which a person
might be hiding. In this case we must decide what level of
justification is required by the Fourth and Fourteenth
Amendments before police officers, while effecting the arrest
of a suspect in his home pursuant to an arrest warrant, may
conduct a warrantless protective sweep of all or part of the
premises. The Court of Appeals of Maryland held that a
running suit seized in plain view during such a protective
350 | MARYLAND V. BUIE (1990)

sweep should have been suppressed at respondent's armed
robbery trial because the officer who conducted the sweep did
not have probable cause to believe that a serious and
demonstrable potentiality for danger existed. We conclude that
the Fourth Amendment would permit the protective sweep
undertaken here if the searching officer "possesse[d] a
reasonable belief based on `specific and articulable facts which,
taken together with the rational inferences from those facts,
reasonably warrant[ed]' the officer in believing" that the area
swept harbored an individual posing a danger to the officer or
others. We accordingly vacate the judgment below and remand
for application of this standard.

                       I

On February 3, 1986, two men committed an armed robbery
of a Godfather's Pizza restaurant in Prince George's County,
Maryland. One of the robbers was wearing a red running suit.
That same day, Prince George's County police obtained arrest
warrants for respondent Jerome Edward Buie and his
suspected accomplice in the robbery, Lloyd Allen. Buie's house
was placed under police surveillance.

   On February 5, the police executed the arrest warrant for
Buie. They first had a police department secretary telephone
Buie's house to verify that he was home. The secretary spoke
to a female first, then to Buie himself. Six or seven officers
proceeded to Buie's house. Once inside, the officers fanned
                                                  MARYLAND V. BUIE (1990) | 351

out through the first and second floors. Corporal James Rozar
announced that he would "freeze" the basement so that no
one could come up and surprise the officers. With his service
revolver drawn, Rozar twice shouted into the basement,
ordering anyone down there to come out. When a voice asked
who was calling, Rozar announced three times: "this is the
police, show me your hands." Eventually, a pair of hands
appeared around the bottom of the stairwell and Buie emerged
from the basement. He was arrested, searched, and handcuffed
by Rozar. Thereafter, Detective Joseph Frolich entered the
basement "in case there was someone else" down there. He
noticed a red running suit lying in plain view on a stack of
clothing and seized it.

   The trial court denied Buie's motion to suppress the
running suit, stating in part: "The man comes out from a
basement, the police don't know how many other people are
down there. He is charged with a serious offense." The State
introduced the running suit into evidence at Buie's trial. A jury
convicted Buie of robbery with a deadly weapon and using a
handgun in the commission of a felony.

   ***

                       II

It is not disputed that until the point of Buie's arrest the police
had the right, based on the authority of the arrest warrant,
to search anywhere in the house that Buie might have been
352 | MARYLAND V. BUIE (1990)

found, including the basement. "If there is sufficient evidence
of a citizen's participation in a felony to persuade a judicial
officer that his arrest is justified, it is constitutionally
reasonable to require him to open his doors to the officers of
the law." There is also no dispute that if Detective Frolich's
entry into the basement was lawful, the seizure of the red
running suit, which was in plain view and which the officer
had probable cause to believe was evidence of a crime, was also
lawful under the Fourth Amendment. The issue in this case
is what level of justification the Fourth Amendment required
before Detective Frolich could legally enter the basement to see
if someone else was there.

   Petitioner, the State of Maryland, argues that, under a
general reasonableness balancing test, police should be
permitted to conduct a protective sweep whenever they make
an in-home arrest for a violent crime.

                      III

It goes without saying that the Fourth Amendment bars only
unreasonable searches and seizures. Our cases show that in
determining reasonableness, we have balanced the intrusion
on the individual's Fourth Amendment interests against its
promotion of legitimate governmental interests. Under this
test, a search of the house or office is generally not reasonable
without a warrant issued on probable cause. There are other
                                                 MARYLAND V. BUIE (1990) | 353

contexts, however, where the public interest is such that
neither a warrant nor probable cause is required.

   Possessing an arrest warrant and probable cause to believe
Buie was in his home, the officers were entitled to enter and to
search anywhere in the house in which Buie might be found.
Once he was found, however, the search for him was over, and
there was no longer that particular justification for entering
any rooms that had not yet been searched.

   ***
   We should emphasize that such a protective sweep, aimed
at protecting the arresting officers, if justified by the
circumstances, is nevertheless not a full search of the premises,
but may extend only to a cursory inspection of those spaces
where a person may be found. The sweep lasts no longer than
is necessary to dispel the reasonable suspicion of danger and
in any event no longer than it takes to complete the arrest and
depart the premises.

                      IV

The type of search we authorize today is far removed from
the "top-to-bottom" search involved in Chimel; moreover, it
is decidedly not "automati[c]," but may be conducted only
when justified by a reasonable, articulable suspicion that the
house is harboring a person posing a danger to those on the
arrest scene.
354 | MARYLAND V. BUIE (1990)

                      V

We conclude that by requiring a protective sweep to be
justified by probable cause to believe that a serious and
demonstrable potentiality for danger existed, the Court of
Appeals of Maryland applied an unnecessarily strict Fourth
Amendment standard. The Fourth Amendment permits a
properly limited protective sweep in conjunction with an in-
home arrest when the searching officer possesses a reasonable
belief based on specific and articulable facts that the area to be
swept harbors an individual posing a danger to those on the
arrest scene. ...

   Justice BRENNAN, with whom Justice MARSHALL
joins, dissenting.

   While the Fourth Amendment protects a person's privacy
interests in a variety of settings, "physical entry of the home
is the chief evil against which the wording of the Fourth
Amendment is directed." The Court discounts the nature of
the intrusion because it believes that the scope of the intrusion
is limited. The Court explains that a protective sweep's scope
is "narrowly confined to a cursory visual inspection of those
places in which a person might be hiding" and confined in
duration to a period "no longer than is necessary to dispel
the reasonable suspicion of danger and in any event no longer
than it takes to complete the arrest and depart the premises."
But these spatial and temporal restrictions are not particularly
limiting. A protective sweep would bring within police
                                                 MARYLAND V. BUIE (1990) | 355

purview virtually all personal possessions within the house not
hidden from view in a small enclosed space. Police officers
searching for potential ambushers might enter every room
including basements and attics; open up closets, lockers,
chests, wardrobes, and cars; and peer under beds and behind
furniture. The officers will view letters, documents, and
personal effects that are on tables or desks or are visible inside
open drawers; books, records, tapes, and pictures on shelves;
and clothing, medicines, toiletries and other paraphernalia not
carefully stored in dresser drawers or bathroom cupboards.
While perhaps not a "full-blown" or "top-to-bottom" search,
a protective sweep is much closer to it than to a "limited
patdown for weapons" or a "`frisk' of an automobile."

   In light of the special sanctity of a private residence and the
highly intrusive nature of a protective sweep, I firmly believe
that police officers must have probable cause to fear that their
personal safety is threatened by a hidden confederate of an
arrestee before they may sweep through the entire home.
Given the state-court determination that the officers searching
Buie's home lacked probable cause to perceive such a danger
and therefore were not lawfully present in the basement, I
would affirm the state court's decision to suppress the
incriminating evidence. I respectfully dissent.
356 | MARYLAND V. BUIE (1990)

       Notes, Comments, and
                Questions

When comparing lawful "protective sweeps" with searches
incident to lawful arrest, students should note (1) the physical
scope of a protective sweep will often extend beyond the area
in which a SILA is permissible, (2) because sweeps are
permitted only to protect against dangers to those present
during the arrest, police may search only areas in which an
officer may reasonably suspect a person could be found, and
(3) the searches must be "cursory inspections" of those spaces.

   An open question related to prospective sweeps concerns
whether police may conduct them upon entering a house with
consent--or in other contexts unrelated to arrests.52 Federal
courts have reached divergent results.

   Imagine police are investigating a brutal murder of a gang
member and suspect that a rival gang is responsible. They
obtain consent to enter the home of a witness in a "high-
crime" neighborhood. May they "sweep" the house upon
entry? Why or why not?

   Consider a slightly modified version of the problem
presented above. Here, police are investigating an allegation of
insider trading that violates federal securities law. They obtain
consent to enter the home of a witness in an exclusive gated
community. May they "sweep" the house upon entry? Why or
why not?

   For courts permitting sweeps absent arrests, see, e.g., United
                                                 MARYLAND V. BUIE (1990) | 357

States v. Fadual, 16 F. Supp. 3d 270 (S.D.N.Y. 2014)(holding
that "under certain circumstances, law enforcement officers
may engage in a protective sweep where they gained entry
through consent in the first instance" but that the sweep at
issue was not lawful); United States v. Miller, 430 F.3d 93, 95
(2d Cir. 2005) (allowing sweeps made by the police pursuant
to "lawful process, such as an order permitting or directing the
officer to enter for the purpose of protecting a third party");
United States v. Gould, 364 F.3d 578 (5th Cir. 2004) (allowing
sweep of mobile home entered by police with consent). For
courts holding sweeps unlawful absent an arrest, see, e.g.,
United States v. Torres-Castro, 470 F.3d 992 (10th Cir.
2006)("FollowingBuie,we held that such `protective sweeps'
are only permitted incident to an arrest."); United States v.
Waldner,425 F.3d 514, 517 (8th Cir. 2005)(declining the
invitation to "extendBuie further"); United States v. Reid, 226
F.3d 1020, 1027 (9th Cir. 2000) (holding search cannot be
justified as protective sweep because when it occurred suspect
"wasnotunder arrest").

SEARCHES OF
STUDENTS AND PUBLIC
EMPLOYEES

Warrant Exception: Searches
      of Students & Public
             Employees

Although law enforcement officers conduct the bulk of the
searches and seizures covered in this book, other government
agents also perform searches and seizures outside the context
of normal policing. In this chapter, we consider searches of
public school students and public employees.

   In public schools, teachers and other school officials must
conduct searches to promote safety and to foster an
environment conducive to education. Yet students do not
forfeit all rights at school, and some searches of students and
their effects are unreasonable. (Note that because the Fourth
Amendment regulates only state actors, private school
students are not protected against "unreasonable" school
searches, unless the government is somehow involved.)
NEW JERSEY V. T.L.O.
(1985)

              Supreme Court of the United States

       New Jersey v. T.L.O.

              Decided Jan. 15, 1985 - 469 U.S. 325

   Justice WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.
   We granted certiorari in this case to examine the
appropriateness of the exclusionary rule as a remedy for
searches carried out in violation of the Fourth Amendment
by public school authorities. Our consideration of the proper
application of the Fourth Amendment to the public schools,
however, has led us to conclude that the search that gave rise to
the case now before us did not violate the Fourth Amendment.
Accordingly, we here address only the questions of the proper
standard for assessing the legality of searches conducted by
public school officials and the application of that standard to
the facts of this case.
                                               NEW JERSEY V. T.L.O. (1985) | 363

                       I

On March 7, 1980, a teacher at Piscataway High School in
Middlesex County, N.J., discovered two girls smoking in a
lavatory. One of the two girls was the respondent T.L.O., who
at that time was a 14-year-old high school freshman. Because
smoking in the lavatory was a violation of a school rule, the
teacher took the two girls to the Principal's office, where they
met with Assistant Vice Principal Theodore Choplick. In
response to questioning by Mr. Choplick, T.L.O.'s companion
admitted that she had violated the rule. T.L.O., however,
denied that she had been smoking in the lavatory and claimed
that she did not smoke at all.

   Mr. Choplick asked T.L.O. to come into his private office
and demanded to see her purse. Opening the purse, he found a
pack of cigarettes, which he removed from the purse and held
before T.L.O. as he accused her of having lied to him. As he
reached into the purse for the cigarettes, Mr. Choplick also
noticed a package of cigarette rolling papers. In his experience,
possession of rolling papers by high school students was closely
associated with the use of marihuana. Suspecting that a closer
examination of the purse might yield further evidence of drug
use, Mr. Choplick proceeded to search the purse thoroughly.
The search revealed a small amount of marihuana, a pipe, a
number of empty plastic bags, a substantial quantity of money
in one-dollar bills, an index card that appeared to be a list
364 | NEW JERSEY V. T.L.O. (1985)

of students who owed T.L.O. money, and two letters that
implicated T.L.O. in marihuana dealing.

   Mr. Choplick notified T.L.O.'s mother and the police, and
turned the evidence of drug dealing over to the police. At the
request of the police, T.L.O.'s mother took her daughter to
police headquarters, where T.L.O. confessed that she had been
selling marihuana at the high school.

   ***

                       II

In determining whether the search at issue in this case violated
the Fourth Amendment, we are faced initially with the
question whether that Amendment's prohibition on
unreasonable searches and seizures applies to searches
conducted by public school officials. We hold that it does.

   ***
   Against the child's interest in privacy must be set the
substantial interest of teachers and administrators in
maintaining discipline in the classroom and on school
grounds. Maintaining order in the classroom has never been
easy, but in recent years, school disorder has often taken
particularly ugly forms: drug use and violent crime in the
schools have become major social problems. Even in schools
that have been spared the most severe disciplinary problems,
the preservation of order and a proper educational
environment requires close supervision of schoolchildren, as
                                               NEW JERSEY V. T.L.O. (1985) | 365

well as the enforcement of rules against conduct that would be
perfectly permissible if undertaken by an adult. "Events calling
for discipline are frequent occurrences and sometimes require
immediate, effective action." Accordingly, we have recognized
that maintaining security and order in the schools requires a
certain degree of flexibility in school disciplinary procedures,
and we have respected the value of preserving the informality
of the student-teacher relationship.

   How, then, should we strike the balance between the
schoolchild's legitimate expectations of privacy and the
school's equally legitimate need to maintain an environment
in which learning can take place? It is evident that the school
setting requires some easing of the restrictions to which
searches by public authorities are ordinarily subject. The
warrant requirement, in particular, is unsuited to the school
environment: requiring a teacher to obtain a warrant before
searching a child suspected of an infraction of school rules
(or of the criminal law) would unduly interfere with the
maintenance of the swift and informal disciplinary procedures
needed in the schools. Just as we have in other cases dispensed
with the warrant requirement when "the burden of obtaining
a warrant is likely to frustrate the governmental purpose
behind the search," we hold today that school officials need
not obtain a warrant before searching a student who is under
their authority.

   The school setting also requires some modification of the
level of suspicion of illicit activity needed to justify a search.
366 | NEW JERSEY V. T.L.O. (1985)

Ordinarily, a search--even one that may permissibly be carried
out without a warrant--must be based upon "probable cause"
to believe that a violation of the law has occurred. However,
"probable cause" is not an irreducible requirement of a valid
search. The fundamental command of the Fourth
Amendment is that searches and seizures be reasonable, and
although "both the concept of probable cause and the
requirement of a warrant bear on the reasonableness of a
search, ... in certain limited circumstances neither is required."
Thus, we have in a number of cases recognized the legality
of searches and seizures based on suspicions that, although
"reasonable," do not rise to the level of probable cause. Where
a careful balancing of governmental and private interests
suggests that the public interest is best served by a Fourth
Amendment standard of reasonableness that stops short of
probable cause, we have not hesitated to adopt such a standard.

   We join the majority of courts that have examined this issue
in concluding that the accommodation of the privacy interests
of schoolchildren with the substantial need of teachers and
administrators for freedom to maintain order in the schools
does not require strict adherence to the requirement that
searches be based on probable cause to believe that the subject
of the search has violated or is violating the law. Rather, the
legality of a search of a student should depend simply on the
reasonableness, under all the circumstances, of the search.
Determining the reasonableness of any search involves a
twofold inquiry: first, one must consider "whether the ...
                                               NEW JERSEY V. T.L.O. (1985) | 367

action was justified at its inception[;]" second, one must
determine whether the search as actually conducted "was
reasonably related in scope to the circumstances which
justified the interference in the first place." Under ordinary
circumstances, a search of a student by a teacher or other
school official will be "justified at its inception" when there are
reasonable grounds for suspecting that the search will turn up
evidence that the student has violated or is violating either the
law or the rules of the school. Such a search will be permissible
in its scope when the measures adopted are reasonably related
to the objectives of the search and not excessively intrusive in
light of the age and sex of the student and the nature of the
infraction.

   ***
   Because the search resulting in the discovery of the evidence
of marihuana dealing by T.L.O. was reasonable, the New
Jersey Supreme Court's decision to exclude that evidence from
T.L.O.'s juvenile delinquency proceedings on Fourth
Amendment grounds was erroneous. Accordingly, the
judgment of the Supreme Court of New Jersey is [r]eversed.
   Justice BRENNAN, with whom Justice MARSHALL
joins, concurring in part and dissenting in part.
   ***
   I do not, however, otherwise join the Court's opinion.
Today's decision sanctions school officials to conduct full-scale
searches on a "reasonableness" standard whose only definite
content is that it is not the same test as the "probable cause"
368 | NEW JERSEY V. T.L.O. (1985)

standard found in the text of the Fourth Amendment. In
adopting this unclear, unprecedented, and unnecessary
departure from generally applicable Fourth Amendment
standards, the Court carves out a broad exception to standards
that this Court has developed over years of considering Fourth
Amendment problems. Its decision is supported neither by
precedent nor even by a fair application of the "balancing test"
it proclaims in this very opinion.

   ***
   And it may be that the real force underlying today's decision
is the belief that the Court purports to reject--the belief that
the unique role served by the schools justifies an exception
to the Fourth Amendment on their behalf. If so, the
methodology of today's decision may turn out to have as little
influence in future cases as will its result, and the Court's
departure from traditional Fourth Amendment doctrine will
be confined to the schools.
   On my view, the presence of the word "unreasonable" in
the text of the Fourth Amendment does not grant a shifting
majority of this Court the authority to answer all Fourth
Amendment questions by consulting its momentary vision of
the social good. Full-scale searches unaccompanied by
probable cause violate the Fourth Amendment. I do not
pretend that our traditional Fourth Amendment doctrine
automatically answers all of the difficult legal questions that
occasionally arise. I do contend, however, that this Court has
an obligation to provide some coherent framework to resolve
                                               NEW JERSEY V. T.L.O. (1985) | 369

such questions on the basis of more than a conclusory
recitation of the results of a "balancing test." The Fourth
Amendment itself supplies that framework and, because the
Court today fails to heed its message, I must respectfully
dissent.

   * * *
   Based on the standards set forth in T.L.O. and Redding,
consider these potential actions by a school district:
   May a school search the mobile phone of a student who was
caught texting in class? Does it matter if the teachers search only
to see who else was texting with the student or instead search
the photos and other data on the phone? See Amy Vorenberg,
Indecent Exposure: Do Warrantless Searches of a Student's Cell
Phone Violate the Fourth Amendment?, 17 Berkeley J. Crim. L.
62 (2012).
   What about random locker searches aimed at finding drugs?
What about requiring students to use clear backpacks or to walk
through metal detectors when entering the school building?
   We now turn to searches of public employees. Supervisors of
public employees have a duty to monitor the work of subordinates
for the public interest. Beyond reducing waste, fraud, and abuse,
supervisors have the day-to-day responsibility of managing staff
so that offices accomplish their goals. It remains unclear what
privacy rights public employees maintain at work.
   In the context of a public employee whose electronic
communications were searched by supervisors, the Court in 2010
avoided resolving important questions about public employee
370 | NEW JERSEY V. T.L.O. (1985)

privacy. The Court found the searches at issue "reasonable," in
part, because the employee's behavior was egregious and the
response of the employer unsurprising. Students should note what
issues are not decided by the Court, in addition to noting the
holdings.

       Notes, Comments, and
                Questions

On the same day as Skinner, the Court decided National
Treasury Employees Union v. Von Raab, 489 U.S. 656 (1989),
another case about drug testing public employees. A U.S.
Customs Service program required drug testing of employees
who sought promotion to jobs involving seizing illegal drugs
or which required employees to carry firearms or handle
classified materials. Again, the Court found the collection of
urine samples to be a "search." Again, the Court upheld the
policy, holding that it was "reasonable" for the government
to mandate the tests because of its "compelling interest in
ensuring that front-line interdiction personnel are physically
fit, and have unimpeachable integrity and judgment."
Comparing the practice to hypothetical searches of workers at
"the United States Mint ... when they leave the workplace every
day," the Court concluded that the "operational realities" of
the Customs Service justified the testing.

   By contrast, in Chandler v. Miller, 520 U.S. 305 (1997),
the Court struck down a Georgia law requiring that candidates
                                                NEW JERSEY V. T.L.O. (1985) | 371

for certain state offices submit to drug tests. The state stressed
"the incompatibility of unlawful drug use with holding high
state office" and argued that "the use of illegal drugs draws
into question an official's judgment and integrity; jeopardizes
the discharge of public functions, including antidrug law
enforcement efforts; and undermines public confidence and
trust in elected officials." The Court was not persuaded,
concluding, "[n]othing in the record hints that the hazards
respondents broadly describe are real and not simply
hypothetical for Georgia's polity." The Court noted that
political candidates "are subject to relentless scrutiny--by their
peers, the public, and the press." The Justices stated that the
suspicionless searches needed to track lower-profile
employees--like those approved in Skinner and Von
Raab--were not necessary for voters to vet candidates for
election.

  Drug Testing of Public School
                 Students

The Court has repeatedly applied the reasoning of Skinner
and Von Raab to public school policies that mandate the drug
testing of certain students.

DISTRICT V. ACTON
(1995)

              Supreme Court of the United States

Vernonia School District 47J v.
           Wayne Acton

             Decided June 26, 1995 - 515 U.S. 646

   Justice SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court.
   The Student Athlete Drug Policy adopted by School
District 47J in the town of Vernonia, Oregon, authorizes
random urinalysis drug testing of students who participate in
the District's school athletics programs. We granted certiorari
to decide whether this violates the Fourth and Fourteenth
Amendments to the United States Constitution.
                    VERNONIA SCHOOL DISTRICT V. ACTON (1995) | 373

                       I

                         A

Petitioner Vernonia School District 47J (District) operates one
high school and three grade schools in the logging community
of Vernonia, Oregon. As elsewhere in small-town America,
school sports play a prominent role in the town's life, and
student athletes are admired in their schools and in the
community.

   ***
   Initially, the District responded to the drug problem by
offering special classes, speakers, and presentations designed to
deter drug use. It even brought in a specially trained dog to
detect drugs, but the drug problem persisted. At that point,
District officials began considering a drug-testing program.
They held a parent "input night" to discuss the proposed
Student Athlete Drug Policy (Policy), and the parents in
attendance gave their unanimous approval. The school board
approved the Policy for implementation in the fall of 1989.
Its expressed purpose is to prevent student athletes from using
drugs, to protect their health and safety, and to provide drug
users with assistance programs.

                         B

The Policy applies to all students participating in
374 | VERNONIA SCHOOL DISTRICT V. ACTON (1995)

interscholastic athletics. Students wishing to play sports must
sign a form consenting to the testing and must obtain the
written consent of their parents. Athletes are tested at the
beginning of the season for their sport. In addition, once each
week of the season the names of the athletes are placed in
a "pool" from which a student, with the supervision of two
adults, blindly draws the names of 10% of the athletes for
random testing. Those selected are notified and tested that
same day, if possible.

   ***

                         C

In the fall of 1991, respondent James Acton, then a seventh
grader, signed up to play football at one of the District's grade
schools. He was denied participation, however, because he and
his parents refused to sign the testing consent forms. The
Actons filed suit, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief from
enforcement of the Policy on the grounds that it violated the
Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States
Constitution. After a bench trial, the District Court entered
an order denying the claims on the merits and dismissing the
action. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth
Circuit reversed, holding that the Policy violated both the
Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. We granted certiorari.
                    VERNONIA SCHOOL DISTRICT V. ACTON (1995) | 375

                       II

As the text of the Fourth Amendment indicates, the ultimate
measure of the constitutionality of a governmental search is
"reasonableness." [W]hether a particular search meets the
reasonableness standard "`is judged by balancing its intrusion
on the individual's Fourth Amendment interests against its
promotion of legitimate governmental interests.'" Where a
search is undertaken by law enforcement officials to discover
evidence of criminal wrongdoing, this Court has said that
reasonableness generally requires the obtaining of a judicial
warrant [supported by probable cause]. A search unsupported
by probable cause can be constitutional, we have said, "when
special needs, beyond the normal need for law enforcement,
make the warrant and probable-cause requirement
impracticable." 

                      III

The first factor to be considered is the nature of the privacy
interest upon which the search here at issue intrudes. Central,
in our view, to the present case is the fact that the subjects of
the Policy are (1) children, who (2) have been committed to the
temporary custody of the State as schoolmaster.

   Fourth Amendment rights, no less than First and
Fourteenth Amendment rights, are different in public schools
than elsewhere; the "reasonableness" inquiry cannot disregard
376 | VERNONIA SCHOOL DISTRICT V. ACTON (1995)

the schools' custodial and tutelary responsibility for children.
For their own good and that of their classmates, public school
children are routinely required to submit to various physical
examinations, and to be vaccinated against various diseases.

   Legitimate privacy expectations are even less with regard to
student athletes. School sports are not for the bashful. They
require "suiting up" before each practice or event, and
showering and changing afterwards. Public school locker
rooms, the usual sites for these activities, are not notable for
the privacy they afford. The locker rooms in Vernonia are
typical: No individual dressing rooms are provided; shower
heads are lined up along a wall, unseparated by any sort of
partition or curtain; not even all the toilet stalls have doors. As
the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit has
noted, there is "an element of `communal undress' inherent in
athletic participation."

   There is an additional respect in which school athletes have
a reduced expectation of privacy. By choosing to "go out for
the team," they voluntarily subject themselves to a degree of
regulation even higher than that imposed on students
generally. In Vernonia's public schools, they must submit to
a preseason physical exam (James testified that his included
the giving of a urine sample), they must acquire adequate
insurance coverage or sign an insurance waiver, maintain a
minimum grade point average, and comply with any "rules
of conduct, dress, training hours and related matters as may
be established for each sport by the head coach and athletic
                    VERNONIA SCHOOL DISTRICT V. ACTON (1995) | 377

director with the principal's approval." Somewhat like adults
who choose to participate in a "closely regulated industry,"
students who voluntarily participate in school athletics have
reason to expect intrusions upon normal rights and privileges,
including privacy.

   ***

                      VI

Taking into account all the factors we have considered
above--the decreased expectation of privacy, the relative
unobtrusiveness of the search, and the severity of the need met
by the search--we conclude Vernonia's Policy is reasonable
and hence constitutional.

   We caution against the assumption that suspicionless drug
testing will readily pass constitutional muster in other
contexts. The most significant element in this case is the first
we discussed: that the Policy was undertaken in furtherance
of the government's responsibilities, under a public school
system, as guardian and tutor of children entrusted to its care.
Just as when the government conducts a search in its capacity
as employer (a warrantless search of an absent employee's desk
to obtain an urgently needed file, for example), the relevant
question is whether that intrusion upon privacy is one that
a reasonable employer might engage in; so also when the
government acts as guardian and tutor the relevant question
is whether the search is one that a reasonable guardian and
378 | VERNONIA SCHOOL DISTRICT V. ACTON (1995)

tutor might undertake. Given the findings of need made by the
District Court, we conclude that in the present case it is.

   We may note that the primary guardians of Vernonia's
schoolchildren appear to agree. The record shows no objection
to this districtwide program by any parents other than the
couple before us here--even though, as we have described,
a public meeting was held to obtain parents' views. We find
insufficient basis to contradict the judgment of Vernonia's
parents, its school board, and the District Court, as to what
was reasonably in the interest of these children under the
circumstances.

   We [] vacate the judgment, and remand the case to the
Court of Appeals for further proceedings consistent with this
opinion.

   Justice O'CONNOR, with whom Justice STEVENS and
Justice SOUTER join, dissenting.

   The population of our Nation's public schools, grades 7
through 12, numbers around 18 million. By the reasoning of
today's decision, the millions of these students who participate
in interscholastic sports, an overwhelming majority of whom
have given school officials no reason whatsoever to suspect
they use drugs at school, are open to an intrusive bodily search.

   In justifying this result, the Court dispenses with a
requirement of individualized suspicion on considered policy
grounds. First, it explains that precisely because every student
athlete is being tested, there is no concern that school officials
might act arbitrarily in choosing whom to test. Second, a
                    VERNONIA SCHOOL DISTRICT V. ACTON (1995) | 379

broad-based search regime, the Court reasons, dilutes the
accusatory nature of the search. In making these policy
arguments, of course, the Court sidesteps powerful,
countervailing privacy concerns. Blanket searches, because
they can involve "thousands or millions" of searches, "pos[e] a
greater threat to liberty" than do suspicion-based ones, which
"affec[t] one person at a time." Searches based on
individualized suspicion also afford potential targets
considerable control over whether they will, in fact, be
searched because a person can avoid such a search by not acting
in an objectively suspicious way. And given that the surest
way to avoid acting suspiciously is to avoid the underlying
wrongdoing, the costs of such a regime, one would think, are
minimal.

   But whether a blanket search is "better" than a regime based
on individualized suspicion is not a debate in which we should
engage. In my view, it is not open to judges or government
officials to decide on policy grounds which is better and which
is worse. For most of our constitutional history, mass,
suspicionless searches have been generally considered per se
unreasonable within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.
And we have allowed exceptions in recent years only where
it has been clear that a suspicion-based regime would be
ineffectual. Because that is not the case here, I dissent.

   * * *
   Seven years after deciding Vernonia, the Court considered a
public school drug testing program that went beyond athletes
380 | VERNONIA SCHOOL DISTRICT V. ACTON (1995)

and included participants in activities such as the debate team,
band, and Future Farmers of America. While the district policy
stated that students involved in any extracurricular activity
could be tested, the record reflected that in practice testing
was limited to participants in "competitive extracurricular
activities." In Board of Education, Pottawatomie County v.
Earls (2002), concerning an Dartmouth-bound honors
student in the school choir who declined to be drug tests,
the Supreme Court majority declared that submission to drug
tests can be imposed as a condition for participation in
extracurricular activities.

       Notes, Comments, and
                Questions

Since the Court decided Vernonia and Earls, public schools
have continued to explore how much of the student
population can be subjected to mandatory drug testing.
Although courts have not yet approved a policy mandating the
testing of all students at a public school, school districts have
been largely successful in requiring testing of broad portions of
the student population.

   Consider these examples:
   Some schools have required students to submit to drug
testing if they wish to park on school grounds. See, e.g., Joy v.
Penn-Harris-Madison School Corp., 212 F.3d 1052 (7th Cir.
2000). Lawful? Why or why not?
                    VERNONIA SCHOOL DISTRICT V. ACTON (1995) | 381

   A public technical college adopted a policy requiring that all
students at the college submit to drug tests. See Kittle-Aikeley v.
Strong, 844 F.3d 727 (8th Cir. 2016) (en banc). Lawful? Why
or why not? What if the policy applied only to students in
certain academic programs?

   In the case of the technical college, the Eighth Circuit
upheld mandatory drug testing of students enrolled in "safety-
sensitive programs." Dissenting judges would have allowed
testing of all students because there was no reason "to assume
that [the college's] students pursuing an education in its non-
safety-sensitive programs are not likewise fully impacted by
the same illicit drug-abuse crisis" that justified the testing of
students in safety-sensitive programs. Other courts could reach
different results in similar cases.

   According to a national survey of school districts, many
public schools operate drug testing programs that involve
random testing of all students, seemingly in excess of what the
Court has allowed. See Chris Ringwalt et al., "Random Drug
Testing in US Public School Districts," 98 Am. J. Pub. Health
826 (May 2008) ("28% randomly tested all students"). Further
litigation on this issue seems likely.

       Notes, Comments, and
                Questions

Re: the Supreme Court's rejection of warrantless drug testing
of pregnant women at a public hospital in Ferguson v. City of
382 | VERNONIA SCHOOL DISTRICT V. ACTON (1995)

Charleston (2000): Although no one today would recommend
use of crack cocaine by pregnant women, it turns out that
much of the science behind the so-called "crack baby"
epidemic has been debunked. Predictions like that of "a bio-
underclass, a generation of physically damaged cocaine babies
whose biological inferiority is stamped at birth"--from a 1989
column in the Washington Post--or a flood of 4 million kids
whose "neurological, emotional and learning problems will
severely test teachers and schools"--from a 1990 article in the
New York Times--appear alarmist in hindsight. See Vann R.
Newkirk II, "What the `Crack Baby' Panic Reveals about the
Opioid Epidemic," Atlantic (July 16, 2017) (noting the greater
empathy extended to pregnant women using opiates than was
shown to crack-addicted mothers). Legal scholars noted that in
the late 1980s, a trend emerged wherein prosecutors used laws
previously used to punish abuse of children after birth--such
as involuntary manslaughter and delivery of drugs to a
minor--to prosecute pregnant drug users. See, e.g., D. M.
McGinnis, Comment, "Prosecution of Mothers of Drug-
Exposed Babies: Constitutional and Criminal Theory," 139
U. Pa. L. Rev. 505 (1990).

   In our next chapter, we consider our final selection of
exceptions to the warrant requirement.
PART XVIII

FOURTH
AMENDMENT:
WARRANT
EXCEPTIONS (PART
9)

In this chapter, we conclude our review of exceptions to the
warrant requirement. In particular, we will examine: (1)
inventory searches and (2) DNA tests of arrested persons.
INVENTORY SEARCHES

Warrant Exception: Inventory
              Searches

When police impound an illegally parked car, they may tow
it to a government parking lot. Similarly, police may tow the
car of a driver who is arrested for a traffic violation. These
are just two of the many ways in which government agents
can lawfully take possession of property. Another common
scenario arises when police store the effects of a person who is
jailed, keeping them until the person is released. The Court has
held that government officials may search property that comes
into their possession in circumstances such as these, as long
as they follow proper procedures. South Dakota v. Opperman
(1976).

       Notes, Comments, and
                Questions

In Illinois v. Lafayette, 462 U.S. 640 (1983), the Court applied
Opperman to a police search of the "purse-type shoulder bag"
of "an arrested person [who] arrive[d] at a police station."
386 | INVENTORY SEARCHES

Because the search could not be deemed "incident" to the
arrest, the Court considered "whether, consistent with the
Fourth Amendment, it is reasonable for police to search the
personal effects of a person under lawful arrest as part of the
routine administrative procedure at a police stationhouse
incident to booking and jailing the suspect." The Court found
the question fairly straightforward and resolved it as follows:

   "At the stationhouse, it is entirely proper for police to
remove and list or inventory property found on the person or
in the possession of an arrested person who is to be jailed. A
range of governmental interests support an inventory process.
It is not unheard of for persons employed in police activities to
steal property taken from arrested persons; similarly, arrested
persons have been known to make false claims regarding what
was taken from their possession at the stationhouse. A
standardized procedure for making a list or inventory as soon
as reasonable after reaching the stationhouse not only deters
false claims but also inhibits theft or careless handling of
articles taken from the arrested person. Arrested persons have
also been known to injure themselves--or others--with belts,
knives, drugs or other items on their person while being
detained. Dangerous instrumentalities--such as razor blades,
bombs, or weapons--can be concealed in innocent-looking
articles taken from the arrestee's possession. The bare recital of
these mundane realities justifies reasonable measures by police
to limit these risks--either while the items are in police
                                                    INVENTORY SEARCHES | 387

possession or at the time they are returned to the arrestee upon
his release."

   Because the Court found such searches to be reasonable
regardless of whether officials feared any particular bag
possessed by an arrestee, the Court held that neither probable
cause or any other form of individualized suspicion was needed
for inventory searches of an arrestee's belongings prior to
incarceration, "in accordance with established inventory
procedures."

   By contrast, in Florida v. Wells, 495 U.S. 1 (1990), the
Court found that because the highway patrol lacked
"standardized criteria" or an "established routine" with respect
to opening closed containers while inventorying a car, officers
violated the Fourth Amendment when opening a locked
suitcase found in the trunk of an impounded car. The Court
said such criteria were needed because of "the principle that an
inventory search must not be a ruse for a general rummaging
in order to discover incriminating evidence." In sum,
departments have wide latitude to set inventory policies and
to search cars, bags, and other items pursuant to such policies.
But without a preexisting policy, searches lose the
presumption of reasonableness.

   A former student of your authors once told a story about
Gant drawn from the student's experience as a police officer.53
He began by describing how police reacted to the Court's
decision in Gant.

   "Post-Gant, law enforcement agencies scurried to train
388 | INVENTORY SEARCHES

officers on search of automobiles incident to lawful arrest. A
tool once frequently and heavily relied on, [SILA] was no
longer an option for officers looking to get into vehicles
without the availability of the automobile exception outlined
in Carroll. This was particularly frustrating on pretext stops
where officers would arrest local drug dealers and criminals for
driver's license violations or other mundane crimes to get into
vehicles where evidence of the more serious, and sometimes
violent, crimes were concealed."

   Police adjusted their tactics: "The response was shoring up
vehicle tow, impound, and inventory policies." In other words,
because police could not search nearly as many cars incident to
arrest, police increased the number of cars they decided to tow
after arrests.

   Here is where the story gets exciting: "In 2010, Officers ...
stopped a vehicle after complaints of careless and imprudent
driving. The driver, 20, did not have a driver's license. Officer
attempts to contact the vehicle owner to remove it from the
side of the road were unsuccessful. Pursuant to department
policy, officers contacted a tow truck and conducted an
inventory search where they located the owner of the vehicle,
mother of the driver, dead in the trunk."

   As the student summed up, "Sometimes there IS a body in
the trunk."
ADMINISTRATIVE
SEARCHES

       Warrant Exception:
    Administrative Searches

Our next warrant exception concerns "administrative
searches," which involve government functions largely (if not
entirely) unknown when the Fourth Amendment was ratified.
For example, fire code and housing code inspections are
important to the safety of densely populated cities. On the
other hand, some might question whether inspectors should
be allowed to search their homes without a warrant, perhaps
even without probable cause.

       Notes, Comments, and
                Questions

Consider a city zoning law that restricts who may live in a
certain residence on the basis of family status. For example,
the city code might state that no more than three unrelated
persons may live in a house zoned for "single-family"
390 | ADMINISTRATIVE SEARCHES

occupancy.54 In such a house, an adult could live with her four
children, but four unrelated roommates could not share the
house (even though the four roomates would constitute one
fewer total person than the alternative group of occupants).
In a neighborhood near a university campus, students might
occasionally rent houses (with two or three names on a lease)
and use them in a way that violates the code (for example,
six students living together). If a neighborhood
busybody--concerned with a perceived threat to property
values or simply interested in policing how neighbors
behave--calls city officials with vague reports of
overoccupancy, may a judge issue a warrant allowing city
officials to inspect every house in the neighborhood to see who
lives there and whether they are related to one another? May
such warrants issue every year--allowing searches of houses in
"single-family" neighborhoods near campus--even if no one
complains?

   In See v. City of Seattle, 387 U.S. 541 (1967), decided the
same day as Camara, the Court held that the rule of Camara
applied to commercial warehouses. "As we explained
inCamara,a search of private houses is presumptively
unreasonable if conducted without a warrant. The
businessman, like the occupant of a residence, has a
constitutional right to go about his business free from
unreasonable official entries upon his private commercial
property."

   Two decades later, however, the Court was less protective
                                             ADMINISTRATIVE SEARCHES | 391

of a business owner's right to avoid warrantless administrative
searches. In New York v. Burger, 482 U.S. 691 (1987), the
Court considered a different kind of business premises--a
junkyard. After stating (somewhat implausibly) that the
junkyard was a "closely regulated industry," the Court held
that proprietors of such businesses have lowered expectations
of privacy. That finding, combined with the state interest in
supervising such industries (in this case, to combat car theft
by preventing stolen parts from being bought and sold at
junkyards), made the warrantless search reasonable. Students
should note that the Burger Court went even further than the
Court's decision in Camara. In Camara, the Court required
inspectors to obtain a warrant, which if suspiciously similar
to the detested "general warrants" of old was at least issued
by a judge. In Burger, the Court held that New York's statute
allowing for the inspection of junkyards was a
"constitutionally adequate substitute for a warrant."

   In a dissent joined in full by Justice Marshall and in part
by Justice O'Connor, Justice Brennan argued that "Burger's
vehicle-dismantling business is not closely regulated (unless
most New York City businesses are)." Objecting to the Court's
acceptance of the New York statute in lieu of a warrant, he
argued that "the Court also perceives careful guidance and
control of police discretion in a statute that is patently
insufficient to eliminate the need for a warrant." Accordingly,
he concluded that the decision "renders virtually meaningless
392 | ADMINISTRATIVE SEARCHES

the general rule that a warrant is required for administrative
searches of commercial property."

   The Court revisited administrative searches in City of Los
Angeles v. Patel, 135 S. Ct. 2443 (2015), deciding by a 5-4
vote that certain regulations of Los Angeles hotels violated
the Fourth Amendment. In particular, the city required "hotel
operators to record and keep specific information about their
guests on the premises for a 90-day period" and to make the
records "available to any officer of the Los Angeles Police
Department for inspection ... at a time and in a manner that
minimizes any interference with the operation of the
business." Refusal to make the records available was a crime.
Hotel operators brought a facial challenge to the regulation
and prevailed.

   The majority noted that it did not strike down the
provisions of the regulation requiring that the records be kept,
nor did it prevent officers from viewing the records by consent
or by obtaining a proper administrative warrant (or with some
other exception to the warrant requirement). Instead, the
Court struck down only the provision forcing hotel owners to
show the records on demand to any officer without a warrant,
on pain of criminal prosecution--without even the
opportunity for a precompliance judicial review. The Court
rejected the city's argument that the regulation was valid under
prior precedents related to "closely regulated industries."
Perhaps retreating a bit from the broad definition of such
industries in Burger, the Patel Court stated, "Over the past 45
                                             ADMINISTRATIVE SEARCHES | 393

years, the Court has identified only four industries that `have
such a history of government oversight that no reasonable
expectation of privacy ... could exist for a proprietor over the
stock of such an enterprise.'" Those industries are "liquor
sales," "firearms dealing," "mining," and--of
course--"running an automobile junkyard."

   In a dissent joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justice
Thomas, Justice Scalia wrote: "[T]he Court today concludes
that Los Angeles's ordinance is `unreasonable' inasmuch as
it permits police to flip through a guest register to ensure it
is being filled out without first providing an opportunity for
the motel operator to seek judicial review. Because I believe
that such a limited inspection of a guest register is eminently
reasonable under the circumstances presented, I dissent." He
noted "that the motel operators who conspire with drug
dealers and procurers may demand precompliance judicial
review simply as a pretext to buy time for making fraudulent
entries in their guest registers."

   Justice Alito dissented as well, joined by Justice Thomas.
Objecting in particular to the Court's finding that the
regulation was facially invalid--as opposed to invalid in
limited cases--he presented five examples of circumstances in
which he believed it would be reasonable for the city to enforce
the law as written. Here is one:

   "Example Two. A murderer has kidnapped a woman with
the intent to rape and kill her and there is reason to believe
he is holed up in a certain motel. The Fourth Amendment's
394 | ADMINISTRATIVE SEARCHES

reasonableness standard accounts for exigent circumstances.
When the police arrive, the motel operator folds her arms and
says the register is locked in a safe. Invoking [the challenged
regulation], the police order the operator to turn over the
register. She refuses. The Fourth Amendment does not protect
her from arrest."

       DNA Tests of Arrestees

We conclude with a case challenging a Maryland policy under
which police collected DNA from arrestees as part of "routine
booking procedure."
DNA TESTS OF
ARRESTEES

              Supreme Court of the United States

 Maryland v. Alonzo Jay King

              Decided June 3, 2013 - 569 U.S. 435

   Justice KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court.
   In 2003 a man concealing his face and armed with a gun
broke into a woman's home in Salisbury, Maryland. He raped
her. The police were unable to identify or apprehend the
assailant based on any detailed description or other evidence
they then had, but they did obtain from the victim a sample of
the perpetrator's DNA.
   In 2009 Alonzo King was arrested in Wicomico County,
Maryland, and charged with first- and second-degree assault
for menacing a group of people with a shotgun. As part of
a routine booking procedure for serious offenses, his DNA
sample was taken by applying a cotton swab or filter
paper--known as a buccal swab--to the inside of his cheeks.
The DNA was found to match the DNA taken from the
396 | DNA TESTS OF ARRESTEES

Salisbury rape victim. King was tried and convicted for the
rape. Additional DNA samples were taken from him and used
in the rape trial, but there seems to be no doubt that it was the
DNA from the cheek sample taken at the time he was booked
in 2009 that led to his first having been linked to the rape and
charged with its commission.

   ***

                       II

                         A

The Act authorizes Maryland law enforcement authorities to
collect DNA samples from "an individual who is charged with
... a crime of violence or an attempt to commit a crime of
violence; or ... burglary or an attempt to commit burglary."
....If "all qualifying criminal charges are determined to be
unsupported by probable cause ... the DNA sample shall be
immediately destroyed." DNA samples are also destroyed if "a
criminal action begun against the individual ... does not result
in a conviction," "the conviction is finally reversed or vacated
and no new trial is permitted," or "the individual is granted an
unconditional pardon."

   ***
   Respondent's DNA was collected in this case using a
common procedure known as a "buccal swab." "Buccal cell
collection involves wiping a small piece of filter paper or a
                                               DNA TESTS OF ARRESTEES | 397

cotton swab similar to a Q-tip against the inside cheek of an
individual's mouth to collect some skin cells." The procedure
is quick and painless. The swab touches inside an arrestee's
mouth, but it requires no "surgical intrusio[n] beneath the
skin," and it poses no "threa[t] to the health or safety" of
arrestees.

                         B

Respondent's identification as the rapist resulted in part
through the operation of a national project to standardize
collection and storage of DNA profiles. Authorized by
Congress and supervised by the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, the Combined DNA Index System (CODIS)
connects DNA laboratories at the local, state, and national
level. All 50 States require the collection of DNA from felony
convicts, and respondent does not dispute the validity of that
practice. Twenty-eight States and the Federal Government
have adopted laws similar to the Maryland Act authorizing
the collection of DNA from some or all arrestees. At issue is
a standard, expanding technology already in widespread use
throughout the Nation.

                      III

It can be agreed that using a buccal swab on the inner tissues of
a person's cheek in order to obtain DNA samples is a search.
398 | DNA TESTS OF ARRESTEES

Virtually any "intrusio[n] into the human body" will work
an invasion of "`cherished personal security' that is subject
to constitutional scrutiny." The fact than an intrusion is
negligible is of central relevance to determining
reasonableness, although it is still a search as the law defines
that term.

   ***
   The Maryland DNA Collection Act provides that, in order
to obtain a DNA sample, all arrestees charged with serious
crimes must furnish the sample on a buccal swab applied, as
noted, to the inside of the cheeks. The arrestee is already in
valid police custody for a serious offense supported by
probable cause. The DNA collection is not subject to the
judgment of officers whose perspective might be "colored by
their primary involvement in `the often competitive enterprise
of ferreting out crime.'" "[T]here are virtually no facts for a
neutral magistrate to evaluate." Here, the search effected by the
buccal swab of respondent falls within the category of cases
this Court has analyzed by reference to the proposition that
the "touchstone of the Fourth Amendment is reasonableness,
not individualized suspicion."
   ***An assessment of reasonableness to determine the
lawfulness of requiring this class of arrestees to provide a DNA
sample is central to the instant case.
                                               DNA TESTS OF ARRESTEES | 399

                      IV

                         A

The legitimate government interest served by the Maryland
DNA Collection Act is one that is well established: the need
for law enforcement officers in a safe and accurate way to
process and identify the persons and possessions they must
take into custody.

   ***
   The task of identification necessarily entails searching
public and police records based on the identifying information
provided by the arrestee to see what is already known about
him. A DNA profile is useful to the police because it gives
them a form of identification to search the records already
in their valid possession. In this respect the use of DNA for
identification is no different than matching an arrestee's face
to a wanted poster of a previously unidentified suspect; or
matching tattoos to known gang symbols to reveal a criminal
affiliation; or matching the arrestee's fingerprints to those
recovered from a crime scene. Finding occurrences of the
arrestee's CODIS profile in outstanding cases is consistent
with this common practice. It uses a different form of
identification than a name or fingerprint, but its function is
the same.
   ***
   Finally, in the interests of justice, the identification of an
400 | DNA TESTS OF ARRESTEES

arrestee as the perpetrator of some heinous crime may have
the salutary effect of freeing a person wrongfully imprisoned
for the same offense. "[P]rompt [DNA] testing ... would speed
up apprehension of criminals before they commit additional
crimes, and prevent the grotesque detention of ... innocent
people."

   Because proper processing of arrestees is so important and
has consequences for every stage of the criminal process, the
Court has recognized that the "governmental interests
underlying a station-house search of the arrestee's person and
possessions may in some circumstances be even greater than
those supporting a search immediately following arrest."

   ***
   In sum, there can be little reason to question "the legitimate
interest of the government in knowing for an absolute
certainty the identity of the person arrested, in knowing
whether he is wanted elsewhere, and in ensuring his
identification in the event he flees prosecution." To that end,
courts have confirmed that the Fourth Amendment allows
police to take certain routine "administrative steps incident
to arrest--i.e., ... book[ing], photograph[ing], and
fingerprint[ing]." DNA identification of arrestees, of the type
approved by the Maryland statute here at issue, is "no more
than an extension of methods of identification long used in
dealing with persons under arrest." In the balance of
reasonableness required by the Fourth Amendment, therefore,
the Court must give great weight both to the significant
                                               DNA TESTS OF ARRESTEES | 401

government interest at stake in the identification of arrestees
and to the unmatched potential of DNA identification to
serve that interest.

                      V

                         A

By comparison to this substantial government interest and the
unique effectiveness of DNA identification, the intrusion of a
cheek swab to obtain a DNA sample is a minimal one.

   The reasonableness of any search must be considered in
the context of the person's legitimate expectations of privacy.
The expectations of privacy of an individual taken into police
custody "necessarily [are] of a diminished scope." A search of
the detainee's person when he is booked into custody may
"`involve a relatively extensive exploration,'" including
"requir[ing] at least some detainees to lift their genitals or
cough in a squatting position."

   ***
   In light of the context of a valid arrest supported by
probable cause respondent's expectations of privacy were not
offended by the minor intrusion of a brief swab of his cheeks.
By contrast, that same context of arrest gives rise to significant
state interests in identifying respondent not only so that the
proper name can be attached to his charges but also so that
the criminal justice system can make informed decisions
402 | DNA TESTS OF ARRESTEES

concerning pretrial custody. Upon these considerations the
Court concludes that DNA identification of arrestees is a
reasonable search that can be considered part of a routine
booking procedure. When officers make an arrest supported
by probable cause to hold for a serious offense and they bring
the suspect to the station to be detained in custody, taking
and analyzing a cheek swab of the arrestee's DNA is, like
fingerprinting and photographing, a legitimate police booking
procedure that is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.

   The judgment of the Court of Appeals of Maryland is
reversed.

   Justice SCALIA, with whom Justice GINSBURG, Justice
SOTOMAYOR, and Justice KAGAN join, dissenting.

   The Fourth Amendment forbids searching a person for
evidence of a crime when there is no basis for believing the
person is guilty of the crime or is in possession of incriminating
evidence. That prohibition is categorical and without
exception; it lies at the very heart of the Fourth Amendment.
Whenever this Court has allowed a suspicionless search, it has
insisted upon a justifying motive apart from the investigation
of crime.

   It is obvious that no such noninvestigative motive exists in
this case. The Court's assertion that DNA is being taken, not
to solve crimes, but to identify those in the State's custody,
taxes the credulity of the credulous. [T]he Court elaborates at
length the ways that the search here served the special purpose
of "identifying" King. But that seems to me quite
                                               DNA TESTS OF ARRESTEES | 403

wrong--unless what one means by "identifying" someone is
"searching for evidence that he has committed crimes
unrelated to the crime of his arrest."

   [I]f anything was "identified" at the moment that the DNA
database returned a match, it was not King--his identity was
already known. (The docket for the original criminal charges
lists his full name, his race, his sex, his height, his weight, his
date of birth, and his address.) Rather, what the August 4
match "identified" was the previously-taken sample from the
earlier crime. That sample was genuinely mysterious to
Maryland. King was not identified by his association with the
sample; rather, the sample was identified by its association with
King. The Court effectively destroys its own "identification"
theory when it acknowledges that the object of this search
was "to see what [was] already known about [King]." No
minimally competent speaker of English would say, upon
noticing a known arrestee's similarity "to a wanted poster of a
previously unidentified suspect," that the arrestee had thereby
been identified. It was the previously unidentified suspect who
had been identified--just as, here, it was the previously
unidentified rapist.

   That taking DNA samples from arrestees has nothing to do
with identifying them is confirmed not just by actual practice
(which the Court ignores) but by the enabling statute itself
(which the Court also ignores). The Maryland Act at issue has
a section helpfully entitled "Purpose of collecting and testing
DNA samples." (One would expect such a section to play a
404 | DNA TESTS OF ARRESTEES

somewhat larger role in the Court's analysis of the Act's
purpose--which is to say, at least some role.) That provision
lists five purposes for which DNA samples may be tested. By
this point, it will not surprise the reader to learn that the
Court's imagined purpose is not among them.

   So, to review: DNA testing does not even begin until after
arraignment and bail decisions are already made. The samples
sit in storage for months, and take weeks to test. When they
are tested, they are checked against the Unsolved Crimes
Collection--rather than the Convict and Arrestee Collection,
which could be used to identify them. The Act forbids the
Court's purpose (identification), but prescribes as its purpose
what our suspicionless-search cases forbid ("official
investigation into a crime"). Against all of that, it is safe to say
that if the Court's identification theory is not wrong, there is
no such thing as error.

   I therefore dissent, and hope that today's incursion upon
the Fourth Amendment [] will some day be repudiated.

       Notes, Comments, and
                Questions

The dissent points out that the police did not really use the
DNA to identify King; they used it to identify the source of
sample obtained elsewhere; that is, they used the DNA test of
King to match him to the pre-existing sample. In recent years,
police have used DNA evidence to create profiles and search
                                               DNA TESTS OF ARRESTEES | 405

for family matches in ancestry DNA databases. What outcome
under the Fourth Amendment?

   Imagine a small community where two children are
murdered. Police believe they have a serial killer and obtain
a confession for one of the murders from a local boy with
developmental disabilities. DNA evidence proves the two
victims had the same killer, but the evidence also exonerates
the boy. The police want to obtain DNA samples from every
male resident in the small town to find the murderer. What
outcome under the Fourth Amendment? What if the police
convince the entire male population to consent to giving DNA
evidence; one man has a friend give DNA evidence on his
behalf. Then later the friend comes forward to confess the
subterfuge. Analyze whether the police can require a DNA
test from the man who sent the friend in his place. (Note:
This question is based on a real case from England, in which
Colin Pitchfork was eventually proven to have murdered two
victims: Lynda Mann and Dawn Ashworth.)

(2013)
PART XIX

FOURTH
AMENDMENT:
STOP AND FRISK

Stop & Frisk: Another Form of
       Warrantless Search

This chapter concerns the law enforcement tactic known as
"stop and frisk." Although such conduct is less invasive than
an arrest, the "stop" is nonetheless a seizure that must be
"reasonable" to be lawful under the Fourth Amendment. The
"frisk" is a search that also must be reasonable to be lawful.

   Our reading will review (1) the basic definition of "stop
and frisk" and the Court's justification for allowing it absent
probable cause, (2) the difference between a stop and frisk
and a full arrest (which requires probable cause), and (3) what
police may do during a "Terry stop," as these stops and frisks
have come to be known.

   We begin with Terry v. Ohio, which sets forth the doctrine
permitting "stop and frisk" in some circumstances and which
has given its name to the practice.
TERRY V. OHIO (1968)

              Supreme Court of the United States

John W. Terry v. State of Ohio

               Decided June 10, 1968 - 392 U.S. 1

   Mr. Chief Justice WARREN delivered the opinion of the
Court.

   This case presents serious questions concerning the role of
the Fourth Amendment in the confrontation on the street
between the citizen and the policeman investigating suspicious
circumstances.

   Petitioner Terry was convicted of carrying a concealed
weapon and sentenced to the statutorily prescribed term of
one to three years in the penitentiary. Following the denial of
a pretrial motion to suppress, the prosecution introduced in
evidence two revolvers and a number of bullets seized from
Terry and a codefendant, Richard Chilton, by Cleveland
Police Detective Martin McFadden. At the hearing on the
motion to suppress this evidence, Officer McFadden testified
that while he was patrolling in plain clothes in downtown
410 | TERRY V. OHIO (1968)

Cleveland at approximately 2:30 in the afternoon of October
31, 1963, his attention was attracted by two men, Chilton
and Terry, standing on the corner of Huron Road and Euclid
Avenue. He had never seen the two men before, and he was
unable to say precisely what first drew his eye to them.
However, he testified that he had been a policeman for 39
years and a detective for 35 and that he had been assigned to
patrol this vicinity of downtown Cleveland for shoplifters and
pickpockets for 30 years. He explained that he had developed
routine habits of observation over the years and that he would
"stand and watch people or walk and watch people at many
intervals of the day." He added: "Now, in this case when I
looked over they didn't look right to me at the time."

   His interest aroused, Officer McFadden took up a post of
observation in the entrance to a store 300 to 400 feet away
from the two men. "I get more purpose to watch them when
I seen their movements," he testified. He saw one of the men
leave the other one and walk southwest on Huron Road, past
some stores. The man paused for a moment and looked in a
store window, then walked on a short distance, turned around
and walked back toward the corner, pausing once again to
look in the same store window. He rejoined his companion
at the corner, and the two conferred briefly. Then the second
man went through the same series of motions, strolling down
Huron Road, looking in the same window, walking on a short
distance, turning back, peering in the store window again, and
returning to confer with the first man at the corner. The two
                                                         TERRY V. OHIO (1968) | 411

men repeated this ritual alternately between five and six times
apiece--in all, roughly a dozen trips. At one point, while the
two were standing together on the corner, a third man
approached them and engaged them briefly in conversation.
This man then left the two others and walked west on Euclid
Avenue. Chilton and Terry resumed their measured pacing,
peering and conferring. After this had gone on for 10 to 12
minutes, the two men walked off together, heading west on
Euclid Avenue, following the path taken earlier by the third
man.

   By this time Officer McFadden had become thoroughly
suspicious. He testified that after observing their elaborately
casual and oft-repeated reconnaissance of the store window on
Huron Road, he suspected the two men of "casing a job, a
stick-up," and that he considered it his duty as a police officer
to investigate further. He added that he feared "they may have
a gun." Thus, Officer McFadden followed Chilton and Terry
and saw them stop in front of Zucker's store to talk to the same
man who had conferred with them earlier on the street corner.
Deciding that the situation was ripe for direct action, Officer
McFadden approached the three men, identified himself as
a police officer and asked for their names. At this point his
knowledge was confined to what he had observed. He was not
acquainted with any of the three men by name or by sight,
and he had received no information concerning them from
any other source. When the men "mumbled something" in
response to his inquiries, Officer McFadden grabbed
412 | TERRY V. OHIO (1968)

petitioner Terry, spun him around so that they were facing
the other two, with Terry between McFadden and the others,
and patted down the outside of his clothing. In the left breast
pocket of Terry's overcoat Officer McFadden felt a pistol. He
reached inside the overcoat pocket, but was unable to remove
the gun. At this point, keeping Terry between himself and
the others, the officer ordered all three men to enter Zucker's
store. As they went in, he removed Terry's overcoat completely,
removed a .38-caliber revolver from the pocket and ordered
all three men to face the wall with their hands raised. Officer
McFadden proceeded to pat down the outer clothing of
Chilton and the third man, Katz. He discovered another
revolver in the outer pocket of Chilton's overcoat, but no
weapons were found on Katz. The officer testified that he only
patted the men down to see whether they had weapons, and
that he did not put his hands beneath the outer garments
of either Terry or Chilton until he felt their guns. So far as
appears from the record, he never placed his hands beneath
Katz' outer garments. Officer McFadden seized Chilton's gun,
asked the proprietor of the store to call a police wagon, and
took all three men to the station, where Chilton and Terry
were formally charged with carrying concealed weapons.

   ***

                       I

The question is whether in all the circumstances of this on-
                                                         TERRY V. OHIO (1968) | 413

the-street encounter, [Terry's] right to personal security was
violated by an unreasonable search and seizure.

   We would be less than candid if we did not acknowledge
that this question thrusts to the fore difficult and troublesome
issues regarding a sensitive area of police activity--issues which
have never before been squarely presented to this Court.
Reflective of the tensions involved are the practical and
constitutional arguments pressed with great vigor on both
sides of the public debate over the power of the police to "stop
and frisk"--as it is sometimes euphemistically
termed--suspicious persons.

   On the one hand, it is frequently argued that in dealing
with the rapidly unfolding and often dangerous situations on
city streets the police are in need of an escalating set of flexible
responses, graduated in relation to the amount of information
they possess. For this purpose it is urged that distinctions
should be made between a "stop" and an "arrest" (or a
"seizure" of a person), and between a "frisk" and a "search."

   On the other side the argument is made that the authority
of the police must be strictly circumscribed by the law of arrest
and search. It is contended with some force that there is
not--and cannot be--a variety of police activity which does
not depend solely upon the voluntary cooperation of the
citizen and yet which stops short of an arrest based upon
probable cause to make such an arrest.

   In this context we approach the issues in this case mindful
of the limitations of the judicial function in controlling the
414 | TERRY V. OHIO (1968)

myriad daily situations in which policemen and citizens
confront each other on the street. No judicial opinion can
comprehend the protean variety of the street encounter, and
we can only judge the facts of the case before us. Nothing
we say today is to be taken as indicating approval of police
conduct outside the legitimate investigative sphere. Under our
decision, courts still retain their traditional responsibility to
guard against police conduct which is over-bearing or
harassing, or which trenches upon personal security without
the objective evidentiary justification which the Constitution
requires.

   Having thus roughly sketched the perimeters of the
constitutional debate over the limits on police investigative
conduct in general and the background against which this case
presents itself, we turn our attention to the quite narrow
question posed by the facts before us: whether it is always
unreasonable for a policeman to seize a person and subject him
to a limited search for weapons unless there is probable cause
for an arrest.

                       II

***
   It is quite plain that the Fourth Amendment governs

"seizures" of the person which do not eventuate in a trip to
the station house and prosecution for crime--"arrests" in
traditional terminology. It must be recognized that whenever
                                                        TERRY V. OHIO (1968) | 415

a police officer accosts an individual and restrains his freedom
to walk away, he has "seized" that person. And it is nothing
less than sheer torture of the English language to suggest that a
careful exploration of the outer surfaces of a person's clothing
all over his or her body in an attempt to find weapons is not
a "search." Moreover, it is simply fantastic to urge that such
a procedure performed in public by a policeman while the
citizen stands helpless, perhaps facing a wall with his hands
raised, is a "petty indignity." It is a serious intrusion upon
the sanctity of the person, which may inflict great indignity
and arouse strong resentment, and it is not to be undertaken
lightly.

   ***
   The distinctions of classical "stop-and-frisk" theory thus
serve to divert attention from the central inquiry under the
Fourth Amendment--the reasonableness in all the
circumstances of the particular governmental invasion of a
citizen's personal security. "Search" and "seizure" are not
talismans. We therefore reject the notions that the Fourth
Amendment does not come into play at all as a limitation
upon police conduct if the officers stop short of something
called a "technical arrest" or a "full-blown search."
   In this case there can be no question, then, that Officer
McFadden "seized" petitioner and subjected him to a "search"
when he took hold of him and patted down the outer surfaces
of his clothing. We must decide whether at that point it was
reasonable for Officer McFadden to have interfered with
416 | TERRY V. OHIO (1968)

petitioner's personal security as he did. And in determining
whether the seizure and search were "unreasonable" our
inquiry is a dual one--whether the officer's action was justified
at its inception, and whether it was reasonably related in scope
to the circumstances which justified the interference in the first
place.

                      III

***
   Applying these principles to this case, we consider first the

nature and extent of the governmental interests involved. One
general interest is of course that of effective crime prevention
and detection. It was this legitimate investigative function
Officer McFadden was discharging when he decided to
approach petitioner and his companions. He had observed
Terry, Chilton, and Katz go through a series of acts, each of
them perhaps innocent in itself, but which taken together
warranted further investigation.

   The crux of this case, however, is not the propriety of
Officer McFadden's taking steps to investigate petitioner's
suspicious behavior, but rather, whether there was justification
for McFadden's invasion of Terry's personal security by
searching him for weapons in the course of that investigation.
We are now concerned with more than the governmental
interest in investigating crime; in addition, there is the more
immediate interest of the police officer in taking steps to assure
                                                         TERRY V. OHIO (1968) | 417

himself that the person with whom he is dealing is not armed
with a weapon that could unexpectedly and fatally be used
against him. Certainly it would be unreasonable to require
that police officers take unnecessary risks in the performance of
their duties.

   ***
   We must still consider, however, the nature and quality of
the intrusion on individual rights which must be accepted if
police officers are to be conceded the right to search for
weapons in situations where probable cause to arrest for crime
is lacking. Even a limited search of the outer clothing for
weapons constitutes a severe, though brief, intrusion upon
cherished personal security, and it must surely be an annoying,
frightening, and perhaps humiliating experience.
   Our evaluation of the proper balance that has to be struck
in this type of case leads us to conclude that there must be
a narrowly drawn authority to permit a reasonable search for
weapons for the protection of the police officer, where he has
reason to believe that he is dealing with an armed and
dangerous individual, regardless of whether he has probable
cause to arrest the individual for a crime. The officer need not
be absolutely certain that the individual is armed; the issue is
whether a reasonably prudent man in the circumstances would
be warranted in the belief that his safety or that of others
was in danger. And in determining whether the officer acted
reasonably in such circumstances, due weight must be given,
not to his inchoate and unparticularized suspicion or "hunch,"
418 | TERRY V. OHIO (1968)

but to the specific reasonable inferences which he is entitled to
draw from the facts in light of his experience.

   ***

                      V

We conclude that the revolver seized from Terry was properly
admitted in evidence against him. At the time he seized
petitioner and searched him for weapons, Officer McFadden
had reasonable grounds to believe that petitioner was armed
and dangerous, and it was necessary for the protection of
himself and others to take swift measures to discover the true
facts and neutralize the threat of harm if it materialized. The
policeman carefully restricted his search to what was
appropriate to the discovery of the particular items which he
sought. Each case of this sort will, of course, have to be decided
on its own facts. We merely hold today that where a police officer
observes unusual conduct which leads him reasonably to conclude
in light of his experience that criminal activity may be afoot
and that the persons with whom he is dealing may be armed
and presently dangerous, where in the course of investigating
this behavior he identifies himself as a policeman and makes
reasonable inquiries, and where nothing in the initial stages of
the encounter serves to dispel his reasonable fear for his own or
others' safety, he is entitled for the protection of himself and
others in the area to conduct a carefully limited search of the
outer clothing of such persons in an attempt to discover weapons
                                                        TERRY V. OHIO (1968) | 419

which might be used to assault him. [Emphasis added to
highlight the lengthy holding] Such a search is a reasonable
search under the Fourth Amendment, and any weapons seized
may properly be introduced in evidence against the person
from whom they were taken.

   Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, dissenting.
   The opinion of the Court disclaims the existence of
"probable cause." If loitering were in issue and that was the
offense charged, there would be "probable cause" shown. But
the crime here is carrying concealed weapons; and there is no
basis for concluding that the officer had "probable cause" for
believing that that crime was being committed. Had a warrant
been sought, a magistrate would, therefore, have been
unauthorized to issue one, for he can act only if there is a
showing of "probable cause." We hold today that the police
have greater authority to make a "seizure" and conduct a
"search" than a judge has to authorize such action. We have
said precisely the opposite over and over again.
   [P]olice officers up to today have been permitted to effect
arrests or searches without warrants only when the facts within
their personal knowledge would satisfy the constitutional
standard of probable cause. At the time of their "seizure"
without a warrant they must possess facts concerning the
person arrested that would have satisfied a magistrate that
"probable cause" was indeed present. The term "probable
cause" rings a bell of certainty that is not sounded by phrases
such as "reasonable suspicion."
420 | TERRY V. OHIO (1968)

   To give the police greater power than a magistrate is to take
a long step down the totalitarian path. Perhaps such a step is
desirable to cope with modern forms of lawlessness. But if it is
taken, it should be the deliberate choice of the people through
a constitutional amendment.

   There have been powerful hydraulic pressures throughout
our history that bear heavily on the Court to water down
constitutional guarantees and give the police the upper hand.
That hydraulic pressure has probably never been greater than
it is today.

   Yet if the individual is no longer to be sovereign, if the police
can pick him up whenever they do not like the cut of his jib, if
they can "seize" and "search" him in their discretion, we enter a
new regime. The decision to enter it should be made only after
a full debate by the people of this country.

       Notes, Comments, and
                Questions

The Court decided in Illinois v. Caballes that when a motorist
is lawfully held for a traffic stop, police use of drug-sniffing
dogs to investigate a vehicle is not a "search." In Rodriguez v.
United States, 135 S. Ct. 1609 (2015), the Court considered
whether police may lengthen a traffic stop for the purpose of
conducting such a dog sniff.

   A police officer pulled over Dennys Rodriguez for driving
                                                         TERRY V. OHIO (1968) | 421

on the shoulder of a Nebraska state highway, which is
unlawful. During the stop, the officer asked Rodriguez why
he had driven on the shoulder and, after receiving an answer,
"gathered Rodriguez's license, registration, and proof of
insurance." He then ran "a records check on Rodriguez"
before returning to question Rodriguez and his passenger.
Next, the officer returned to his car again, ran a records check
on the passenger, and "began writing a warning ticket for
Rodriguez for driving on the shoulder of the road." Rodriguez
made no objection to any of this conduct.

   After writing the warning ticket and presenting it to
Rodriguez (along with other documents the officer had
collected during the stop), the officer asked Rodriguez for
permission to walk a drug dog around Rodriguez's vehicle.
Rodriguez declined, and the officer ordered Rodriguez to stay
put, which he did. The officer brought the dog, and when the
dog "alerted to the presence of drugs," the officer searched the
car and found "a large bag of methamphetamine." Rodriguez
was eventually convicted of "possession with intent to
distribute 50 grams or more of methamphetamine."

   Rodriguez argued that the officer impermissibly extended
the traffic stop--after it was essentially finished--so that he
could conduct the dog sniff. Rodriguez argued further that the
extension constituted an unlawful seizure. The Court agreed.

   In an opinion by Justice Ginsburg, the Court wrote:
   "A seizure for a traffic violation justifies a police
investigation of that violation. `[A] relatively brief encounter,'
422 | TERRY V. OHIO (1968)

a routine traffic stop is `more analogous to a so-called "Terry
stop" ... than to a formal arrest.' Like a Terry stop, the tolerable
duration of police inquiries in the traffic-stop context is
determined by the seizure's `mission'--to address the traffic
violation that warranted the stop and attend to related safety
concerns. Because addressing the infraction is the purpose of
the stop, it may `last no longer than is necessary to effectuate
th[at] purpose.' Authority for the seizure thus ends when tasks
tied to the traffic infraction are--or reasonably should have
been--completed."

   The Court wrote that while activities related to traffic
enforcement--such as checking a driver's license and
registration--are permissible parts of a traffic stop, "[a] dog
sniff, by contrast, is a measure aimed at `detect[ing] evidence
of ordinary criminal wrongdoing.' Candidly, the Government
acknowledged at oral argument that a dog sniff, unlike the
routine measures just mentioned, is not an ordinary incident
of a traffic stop. Lacking the same close connection to roadway
safety as the ordinary inquiries, a dog sniff is not fairly
characterized as part of the officer's traffic mission."

   The Court rejected the prosecution's argument that so long
as the total length of the stop remains reasonable, an officer
may extend it to conduct a dog sniff.

   "The Government argues that an officer may
`incremental[ly]' prolong a stop to conduct a dog sniff so long
as the officer is reasonably diligent in pursuing the traffic-
related purpose of the stop, and the overall duration of the
                                                        TERRY V. OHIO (1968) | 423

stop remains reasonable in relation to the duration of other
traffic stops involving similar circumstances. The
Government's argument, in effect, is that by completing all
traffic-related tasks expeditiously, an officer can earn bonus
time to pursue an unrelated criminal investigation. The
reasonableness of a seizure, however, depends on what the
police in fact do. In this regard, the Government acknowledges
that `an officer always has to be reasonably diligent.' How
could diligence be gauged other than by noting what the
officer actually did and how he did it? If an officer can
complete traffic-based inquiries expeditiously, then that is the
amount of `time reasonably required to complete [the stop's]
mission.' [A] traffic stop `prolonged beyond' that point is
`unlawful.' The critical question, then, is not whether the dog
sniff occurs before or after the officer issues a ticket but
whether conducting the sniff `prolongs'--i.e., adds time
to--`the stop.'"

   In his dissent, Justice Alito first argued that the Court
should have avoided the constitutional question decided in the
case because "the police officer did have reasonable suspicion
[of illegal drug activity], and, as a result, the officer was justified
in detaining the occupants for the short period of time (seven
or eight minutes) that is at issue."55 Then, he argued that
the Court's holding was baseless and impractical, suggesting
that officers will delay completing the permitted activities of a
traffic stop if they wish to conduct dog sniffs.

   "The Court refuses to address the real Fourth Amendment
424 | TERRY V. OHIO (1968)

question: whether the stop was unreasonably prolonged.
Instead, the Court latches onto the fact that Officer Struble
delivered the warning prior to the dog sniff and proclaims that
the authority to detain based on a traffic stop ends when a
citation or warning is handed over to the driver. The Court
thus holds that the Fourth Amendment was violated, not
because of the length of the stop, but simply because of the
sequence in which Officer Struble chose to perform his tasks."

   "The rule that the Court adopts will do little good going
forward. It is unlikely to have any appreciable effect on the
length of future traffic stops. Most officers will learn the
prescribed sequence of events even if they cannot fathom the
reason for that requirement."

   The next case concerns whether during a Terry stop, police
may demand that a suspect identify himself, under threat of
prosecution if the suspect does not comply.

presently dangerous to the officer or to others, it would appear
to be clearly unreasonable to deny the officer the power to
take necessary measures to determine whether the person is in
fact carrying a weapon and to neutralize the threat of physical
harm." The Court held that the "reasonable suspicion"
standard struck a sensible compromise between individual
liberty and law enforcement realities.

   In dissent, Justice Douglas warned, "To give the police
greater power than a magistrate is to take a long step down
the totalitarian path." He argued that "if the individual is no
longer to be sovereign, if the police can pick him up whenever
they do not like the cut of his jib, if they can `seize' and `search'
him in their discretion, we enter a new regime. The decision to
enter it should be made only after a full debate by the people
of this country."

   In the subsequent half century, the debate over stop-and-
frisk tactics has remained heated. Opponents of the practice
have argued that it visits humiliation on suspects for limited
benefit and that police apply the tactic in a racially biased
manner. For example, a federal court in New York found that
the NYPD unconstitutionally focused disproportionately on
black and Hispanic suspects when stopping and frisking New
Yorkers. See Floyd v. City of New York, 959 F. Supp. 2d 540
(S.D.N.Y. 2013). The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit
initially stayed the ruling of the district court pending appeal,
but the city dropped the appeal after the election of a mayor
who campaigned on a promise to comply with the district
426 | TERRY V. OHIO (1968)

court. See J. David Goodman, "De Blasio Drops Challenge to
Law on Police Profiling," N.Y. Times (March 5, 2014).

   The case in favor of stop-and-frisk was articulated by Heidi
Grossman, New York City's lead attorney in the Floyd trial.
She said, "Our defense is that we go to where the crime is. And
once we go to where the crime is, we have our police officers
keep their eyes open, make observations; and only when they
make observations, do they go and make reasonable suspicion
stops." She added that when police conduct stop-and-frisk in
areas with high minority populations, "the majority of victims
are black and Hispanics in the area. They are begging for help,
and they want to be able to walk to and from work in a safe
way. And so it is incumbent upon us to have our officers go
out there and do their job, and keep the city safe." See "The
Argument for Stop-and-Frisk," NPR (May 22, 2013).

   For the perspective of some New Yorkers who have been
repeatedly stopped and frisked and find the experience
intensely unpleasant, see Julie Dressner & Edwin Martinez,
Op-Doc: Season 1, "The Scars of Stop-and-Frisk," N.Y. Times
(June 12, 2012); Ross Tuttle & Erin Schneider, "Stopped-and-
Frisked: `For Being a F**king Mutt,'" The Nation (Oct. 8,
2012) (secret recording by teen of himself being stopped, along
with interview of anonymous police officer about department
practices).

   What are the best (most convincing) arguments in favor of
allowing police to stop and frisk suspects without probable
cause?

   In our next chapter, we will study how the Court has
defined "reasonable suspicion." A more demanding
definition--vaguely close to probable cause--would narrow
the set of situations in which police may "stop and frisk"
suspects. A less strict definition--something beyond a mere
hunch but not much further--would give greater discretion to
police.
PART XX

FOURTH
AMENDMENT:
REASONABLE
SUSPICION

     Reasonable Suspicion

In this chapter we review the Court's efforts to define
"reasonable suspicion," which is required for stops and frisks
under Terry v. Ohio. Critics of stop and frisk practices
complain that the Court has set too low a standard, thereby
allowing law enforcement to stop pretty much anyone,
particularly in neighborhoods with high crime rates.
Advocates for stop and frisk counter that a stricter standard
would undermine effective policework.
ILLINOIS V. WARDLOW
(2000)

              Supreme Court of the United States

  Illinois v. William aka Sam
              Wardlow

              Decided Jan. 12, 2000 - 528 U.S. 119

   Chief Justice REHNQUIST delivered the opinion of the
Court.

   Respondent Wardlow fled upon seeing police officers
patrolling an area known for heavy narcotics trafficking. Two
of the officers caught up with him, stopped him and
conducted a protective patdown search for weapons.
Discovering a .38-caliber handgun, the officers arrested
Wardlow. We hold that the officers' stop did not violate the
Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

   On September 9, 1995, Officers Nolan and Harvey were
working as uniformed officers in the special operations section
of the Chicago Police Department. The officers were driving
432 | ILLINOIS V. WARDLOW (2000)

the last car of a four car caravan converging on an area known
for heavy narcotics trafficking in order to investigate drug
transactions. The officers were traveling together because they
expected to find a crowd of people in the area, including
lookouts and customers.

   As the caravan passed 4035 West Van Buren, Officer Nolan
observed respondent Wardlow standing next to the building
holding an opaque bag. Respondent looked in the direction
of the officers and fled. Nolan and Harvey turned their car
southbound, watched him as he ran through the gangway and
an alley, and eventually cornered him on the street. Nolan
then exited his car and stopped respondent. He immediately
conducted a protective patdown search for weapons because in
his experience it was common for there to be weapons in the
near vicinity of narcotics transactions. During the frisk, Officer
Nolan squeezed the bag respondent was carrying and felt a
heavy, hard object similar to the shape of a gun. The officer
then opened the bag and discovered a .38-caliber handgun
with five live rounds of ammunition. The officers arrested
Wardlow.

   The Illinois trial court denied respondent's motion to
suppress, finding the gun was recovered during a lawful stop
and frisk. The Illinois Appellate Court reversed Wardlow's
conviction, concluding that the gun should have been
suppressed. The Illinois Supreme Court held that the stop
and subsequent arrest violated the Fourth Amendment. We
granted certiorari and now reverse.
                                            ILLINOIS V. WARDLOW (2000) | 433

   This case, involving a brief encounter between a citizen and
a police officer on a public street, is governed by the analysis
we first applied in Terry. In Terry, we held that an officer may,
consistent with the Fourth Amendment, conduct a brief,
investigatory stop when the officer has a reasonable, articulable
suspicion that criminal activity is afoot. While "reasonable
suspicion" is a less demanding standard than probable cause
and requires a showing considerably less than preponderance
of the evidence, the Fourth Amendment requires at least a
minimal level of objective justification for making the stop.
The officer must be able to articulate more than an "inchoate
and unparticularized suspicion or `hunch'" of criminal
activity.

   Nolan and Harvey were among eight officers in a four-car
caravan that was converging on an area known for heavy
narcotics trafficking, and the officers anticipated encountering
a large number of people in the area, including drug customers
and individuals serving as lookouts. It was in this context that
Officer Nolan decided to investigate Wardlow after observing
him flee. An individual's presence in an area of expected
criminal activity, standing alone, is not enough to support a
reasonable, particularized suspicion that the person is
committing a crime. But officers are not required to ignore the
relevant characteristics of a location in determining whether
the circumstances are sufficiently suspicious to warrant further
investigation. Accordingly, we have previously noted the fact
434 | ILLINOIS V. WARDLOW (2000)

that the stop occurred in a "high crime area" among the
relevant contextual considerations in a Terry analysis.

   In this case, moreover, it was not merely respondent's
presence in an area of heavy narcotics trafficking that aroused
the officers' suspicion, but his unprovoked flight upon
noticing the police. Our cases have also recognized that
nervous, evasive behavior is a pertinent factor in determining
reasonable suspicion. Headlong flight--wherever it occurs--is
the consummate act of evasion: It is not necessarily indicative
of wrongdoing, but it is certainly suggestive of such. In
reviewing the propriety of an officer's conduct, courts do not
have available empirical studies dealing with inferences drawn
from suspicious behavior, and we cannot reasonably demand
scientific certainty from judges or law enforcement officers
where none exists. Thus, the determination of reasonable
suspicion must be based on commonsense judgments and
inferences about human behavior. We conclude Officer Nolan
was justified in suspecting that Wardlow was involved in
criminal activity, and, therefore, in investigating further.

   ***
   Terry accepts the risk that officers may stop innocent people.
Indeed, the Fourth Amendment accepts that risk in
connection with more drastic police action; persons arrested
and detained on probable cause to believe they have
committed a crime may turn out to be innocent. The Terry
stop is a far more minimal intrusion, simply allowing the
officer to briefly investigate further. If the officer does not learn
                                            ILLINOIS V. WARDLOW (2000) | 435

facts rising to the level of probable cause, the individual must
be allowed to go on his way. But in this case the officers found
respondent in possession of a handgun, and arrested him for
violation of an Illinois firearms statute. No question of the
propriety of the arrest itself is before us.

   The judgment of the Supreme Court of Illinois is reversed,
and the cause is remanded for further proceedings not
inconsistent with this opinion.

   Justice STEVENS, with whom Justice SOUTER, Justice
GINSBURG, and Justice BREYER join, concurring in part
and dissenting in part.

   [The dissent agreed with the majority that flight from police
could sometimes create cause for suspicion and thereby "by
itself, be sufficient to justify a temporary investigative stop of
the kind authorized byTerry." It agreed too that the Court was
correct in not "authorizing the temporary detention of anyone
who flees at the mere sight of a police officer." In other words,
sometimes flight alone justifies a Terry stop, and sometimes
it does not. "Given the diversity and frequency of possible
motivations for flight, it would be profoundly unwise to
endorse eitherper serule." The dissent differed from the
majority in its discussion of why innocent persons might flee
from officers:]

   In addition to these concerns, a reasonable person may
conclude that an officer's sudden appearance indicates nearby
criminal activity. And where there is criminal activity there is
also a substantial element of danger-either from the criminal
436 | ILLINOIS V. WARDLOW (2000)

or from a confrontation between the criminal and the police.
These considerations can lead to an innocent and
understandable desire to quit the vicinity with all speed.

Among some citizens, particularly minorities and those
residing in high crime areas, there is also the possibility that
the fleeing person is entirely innocent, but, with or without
justification, believes that contact with the police can itself be
dangerous, apart from any criminal activity associated with
the officer's sudden presence. For such a person, unprovoked
flight is neither "aberrant" nor "abnormal." Moreover, these
concerns and fears are known to the police officers themselves,
and are validated by law enforcement investigations into their
own practices. Accordingly, the evidence supporting the
reasonableness of these beliefs is too pervasive to be dismissed
as random or rare, and too persuasive to be disparaged as
inconclusive or insufficient.

   ***
   "Unprovoked flight," in short, describes a category of
activity too broad and varied to permit aper sereasonable
inference regarding the motivation for the activity....
   ***
   Nolan was part of an eight-officer, four-car caravan patrol
team. The officers were headed for "one of the areas in the 11th
District [of Chicago] that's high [in] narcotics traffic."The
reason why four cars were in the caravan was that "[n]ormally
in these different areas there's an enormous amount of people,
                                             ILLINOIS V. WARDLOW (2000) | 437

sometimes lookouts, customers."Officer Nolan testified that
he was in uniform on that day, but he did not recall whether
he was driving a marked or an unmarked car. [emphasis
added by editor]

   [The dissent quoted from Alberty v. United States, 162 U.S.
499, 511 (1896), as follows:]

   "[I]t is a matter of common knowledge that men who are
entirely innocent do sometimes fly from the scene of a crime
through fear of being apprehended as the guilty parties, or
from an unwillingness to appear as witnesses. Nor is it true as
an accepted axiom of criminal law that `the wicked flee when
no man pursueth, but the righteous are as bold as a lion.'
Innocent men sometimes hesitate to confront a jury--not
necessarily because they fear that the jury will not protect
them, but because they do not wish their names to appear in
connection with criminal acts, are humiliated at being obliged
to incur the popular odium of an arrest and trial, or because
they do not wish to be put to the annoyance or expense of
defending themselves."

   [The dissent then concluded "that in this case the brief
testimony of the officer who seized respondent does not justify
the conclusion that he had reasonable suspicion to make the
stop." The dissent argued that the officer's testimony was
vague and could not even demonstrate that Wardlow's "flight
was related to his expectation of police focus on him."]

       Notes, Comments, and
438 | ILLINOIS V. WARDLOW (2000)

                Questions

The Court in Wardlow announced that "unprovoked flight"
in a "high crime area"--particularly "an area of heavy narcotics
trafficking"--justifies a Terry stop. It is not certain what other
factors, when combined with flight, are sufficient to constitute
reasonable suspicion. It seems likely, however, that once flight
is part of the analysis, not much additional ground for
suspicion is needed to give officers discretion to stop a suspect.

   How can the officer say that Wardlow ran at the sight of
police when the officer could not remember if whether the
officers where in an unmarked car? Might someone run when
four cars together come up a street in a group? Does the
indicate the presence of police--or a gang?

   What guidance does the Court give on what a "high-crime
area" is? What comes to your mind as you think of high-crime
areas? Would official statistics (for example, records of arrests
organized by neighborhood) provide an accurate picture of
which neighborhoods have the most crime? How do race and
poverty play into our notions of high crime areas? Is a
fraternity house (or a neighborhood of such houses,
nicknamed "Greektown") a high-crime area? Why or why not?

   Consider a college student fleeing a police officer who
arrives at a fraternity party in response to a noise complaint.
May the officer chase the student down and conduct a Terry
stop? Why or why not?

   Now imagine that same college student is walking in a high-
                                            ILLINOIS V. WARDLOW (2000) | 439

poverty, primarily minority neighborhood in the middle of an
afternoon. He sees two police officers walking toward him, and
he runs in the other direction. Does this conduct justify Terry
stop? Why or why not?

   In the next case, the Court found that the information
provided by a tipster did not justify a Terry stop.
FLORIDA V. J.L. (2000)

              Supreme Court of the United States

  Florida v. J.L. 529 U.S. 266
                (2000)

   Justice GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the
[unanimous] Court.

   The question presented in this case is whether an
anonymous tip that a person is carrying a gun is, without
more, sufficient to justify a police officer's stop and frisk of that
person. We hold that it is not.

                       I

On October 13, 1995, an anonymous caller reported to the
Miami-Dade Police that a young black male standing at a
particular bus stop and wearing a plaid shirt was carrying a
gun. So far as the record reveals, there is no audio recording of
the tip, and nothing is known about the informant. Sometime
after the police received the tip--the record does not say how
                                                        FLORIDA V. J.L. (2000) | 441

long--two officers were instructed to respond. They arrived at
the bus stop about six minutes later and saw three black males
"just hanging out [there]." One of the three, respondent J.L.,
was wearing a plaid shirt. Apart from the tip, the officers had
no reason to suspect any of the three of illegal conduct. The
officers did not see a firearm, and J.L. made no threatening or
otherwise unusual movements. One of the officers approached
J.L., told him to put his hands up on the bus stop, frisked him,
and seized a gun from J.L.'s pocket. The second officer frisked
the other two individuals, against whom no allegations had
been made, and found nothing.

   J.L., who was at the time of the frisk "10 days shy of his
16th birth[day]," was charged under state law with carrying a
concealed firearm without a license and possessing a firearm
while under the age of 18. He moved to suppress the gun as
the fruit of an unlawful search, and the trial court granted
his motion. The intermediate appellate court reversed, but the
Supreme Court of Florida quashed that decision and held the
search invalid under the Fourth Amendment. We granted
certiorari and now affirm the judgment of the Florida Supreme
Court.

                       II

Our "stop and frisk" decisions begin with Terry v. Ohio. In
the instant case, the officers' suspicion that J.L. was carrying
a weapon arose not from any observations of their own but
442 | FLORIDA V. J.L. (2000)

solely from a call made from an unknown location by an
unknown caller. Unlike a tip from a known informant whose
reputation can be assessed and who can be held responsible if
her allegations turn out to be fabricated, "an anonymous tip
alone seldom demonstrates the informant's basis of knowledge
or veracity." As we have recognized, however, there are
situations in which an anonymous tip, suitably corroborated,
exhibits "sufficient indicia of reliability to provide reasonable
suspicion to make the investigatory stop." The question we
here confront is whether the tip pointing to J.L. had those
indicia of reliability.

   The tip in the instant case lacked the moderate indicia of
reliability present in [Alabama v.] White and essential to the
Court's decision in that case. The anonymous call concerning
J.L. provided no predictive information and therefore left the
police without means to test the informant's knowledge or
credibility. That the allegation about the gun turned out to be
correct does not suggest that the officers, prior to the frisks,
had a reasonable basis for suspecting J.L. of engaging in
unlawful conduct: The reasonableness of official suspicion
must be measured by what the officers knew before they
conducted their search. All the police had to go on in this case
was the bare report of an unknown, unaccountable informant
who neither explained how he knew about the gun nor
supplied any basis for believing he had inside information
about J.L. If White was a close case on the reliability of
                                                        FLORIDA V. J.L. (2000) | 443

anonymous tips, this one surely falls on the other side of the
line.

   Florida contends that the tip was reliable because its
description of the suspect's visible attributes proved accurate:
There really was a young black male wearing a plaid shirt at the
bus stop. The United States as amicus curiae makes a similar
argument, proposing that a stop and frisk should be permitted
"when (1) an anonymous tip provides a description of a
particular person at a particular location illegally carrying a
concealed firearm, (2) police promptly verify the pertinent
details of the tip except the existence of the firearm, and (3)
there are no factors that cast doubt on the reliability of the
tip...." These contentions misapprehend the reliability needed
for a tip to justify a Terry stop.

   An accurate description of a subject's readily observable
location and appearance is of course reliable in this limited
sense: It will help the police correctly identify the person
whom the tipster means to accuse. Such a tip, however, does
not show that the tipster has knowledge of concealed criminal
activity. The reasonable suspicion here at issue requires that
a tip be reliable in its assertion of illegality, not just in its
tendency to identify a determinate person.

   ***
   Finally, the requirement that an anonymous tip bear
standard indicia of reliability in order to justify a stop in no
way diminishes a police officer's prerogative, in accord with
Terry, to conduct a protective search of a person who has
444 | FLORIDA V. J.L. (2000)

already been legitimately stopped. We speak in today's decision
only of cases in which the officer's authority to make the initial
stop is at issue. In that context, we hold that an anonymous
tip lacking indicia of reliability of the kind contemplated in
Adams and White does not justify a stop and frisk whenever
and however it alleges the illegal possession of a firearm.

   The judgment of the Florida Supreme Court is affirmed.

FOURTH AMENDMENT
FLOWCHART EXERCISE

       Fourth Amendment
       Flowchart Exercise

Flowcharts can help students visualize what they have learned.
The goal is not to memorize the example chart presented here
but instead to create a new chart that helps one to connect
material from throughout the book. Your authors recommend
that when students make their own charts, they add additional
detail, such as case names or chapter numbers. For example,
in the box asking whether there was a "search" or "seizure" at
all, students might add information related to dog sniffs, aerial
surveillance, the open fields doctrine, thermal imaging, garbage
collection, and other items included in the early chapters of
this book.
446 | FOURTH AMENDMENT FLOWCHART EXERCISE

   In the box asking if there was a valid warrant, students
might add information related to the particularity
requirement, as well as other sources of challenges to validity.

   This chart focuses on the Fourth Amendment. Later in the
book, a different sample chart focuses on the Miranda Rule.

   These charts have two primary purposes. One is that when
the charts are finished, they can serve as study aids. The other
is that the creation of the charts--even if students never review
them after finishing them--forces students to consider
material more carefully than they otherwise might, which
helps with learning and with retention of information. Also,
fellow students can help spot misunderstandings that, were
they not in a chart, would remain uncorrected. Study group
members might wish to bring charts to share with classmates.
                   FOURTH AMENDMENT FLOWCHART EXERCISE | 447

   Note that the "Fourth Amendment violation" box asks
students to consider what remedy might be available to the
person whose rights were violated. A separate chart devoted
to remedies (such as the exclusionary rule) would be worth
creating after students cover that material.
PART XXI

INTERROGATIONS:
DUE PROCESS AND
THE
VOLUNTARINESS
REQUIREMENT

      Due Process and the
 Voluntariness Requirement

In this chapter we begin our study of how the Court has used
the Constitution to regulate interrogations. Over the next
several chapters, we will review three main lines of cases: (1)
those decided under the Due Process Clauses of the
Fourteenth Amendment and the Fifth Amendment, which
the Court has used to require that only "voluntary"
confessions be admitted as evidence, (2) those decided under
the Self-Incrimination Clause of the Fifth Amendment, which
the Court has used as the basis for the Miranda Rule, and
(3) those decided under the Assistance of Counsel Clause of
450 | INTERROGATIONS: DUE PROCESS AND THE
VOLUNTARINESS REQUIREMENT

the Sixth Amendment, which the Court has used to prohibit
certain questioning of defendants for whom the right to
counsel has "attached."

   We begin with cases enforcing the voluntariness
requirement under the Due Process Clauses. Our first case,
Brown v. Mississippi, appeared in the reading for our first
chapter and students may wish to quickly reread the facts of
the case if they do not remember them. In that chapter, Brown
was presented to provide background on why the Supreme
Court might feel the need to supervise the criminal justice
systems of the states. Now, we consider it again to learn the
substantive law governing interrogations.
BROWN V. MISSISSIPPI
(1936)

              Supreme Court of the United States.

    Ed Brown v. Mississippi

             Decided Feb. 17, 1936 - 297 U.S. 278

   Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the
[unanimous] Court.

   The question in this case is whether convictions, which rest
solely upon confessions shown to have been extorted by
officers of the state by brutality and violence, are consistent
with the due process of law required by the Fourteenth
Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.

   Petitioners were indicted for the murder of one Raymond
Stewart, whose death occurred on March 30, 1934. They were
indicted on April 4, 1934, and were then arraigned and
pleaded not guilty. Counsel were appointed by the court to
defend them. Trial was begun the next morning and was
concluded on the following day, when they were found guilty
and sentenced to death.
452 | BROWN V. MISSISSIPPI (1936)

   Aside from the confessions, there was no evidence sufficient
to warrant the submission of the case to the jury. After a
preliminary inquiry, testimony as to the confessions was
received over the objection of defendants' counsel. Defendants
then testified that the confessions were false and had been
procured by physical torture.

   [D]efendants filed in the Supreme Court a "suggestion of
error" explicitly challenging the proceedings of the trial, in the
use of the confessions and with respect to the alleged denial of
representation by counsel, as violating the due process clause
of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the
United States. The state court entertained the suggestion of
error, considered the federal question, and decided it against
defendants' contentions.

   The grounds of the decision were (1) that immunity from
self-incrimination is not essential to due process of law; and
(2) that the failure of the trial court to exclude the confessions
after the introduction of evidence showing their
incompetency, in the absence of a request for such exclusion,
did not deprive the defendants of life or liberty without due
process of law; and that even if the trial court had erroneously
overruled a motion to exclude the confessions, the ruling
would have been mere error reversible on appeal, but not a
violation of constitution right.

   The state court said: "After the state closed its case on the
merits, the appellants, for the first time, introduced evidence
from which it appears that the confessions were not made
                                             BROWN V. MISSISSIPPI (1936) | 453

voluntarily but were coerced." There is no dispute as to the
facts upon this point. It is sufficient to say that in pertinent
respects the transcript reads more like pages torn from some
medieval account than a record made within the confines of
a modern civilization which aspires to an enlightened
constitutional government.

   [The Court then quoted portions of the state court
dissent:]

   "[T]he solemn farce of hearing the free and voluntary
confessions was gone through with, and these two sheriffs and
one other person then present were the three witnesses used
in court to establish the so-called confessions, which were
received by the court and admitted in evidence over the
objections of the defendants duly entered of record as each of
the said three witnesses delivered their alleged testimony. There
was thus enough before the court when these confessions were
first offered to make known to the court that they were not,
beyond all reasonable doubt, free and voluntary; and the
failure of the court then to exclude the confessions is sufficient
to reverse the judgment, under every rule of procedure that
has heretofore been prescribed, and hence it was not necessary
subsequently to renew the objections by motion or
otherwise."

   "The defendants were brought to the courthouse ... and the
so-called trial was opened, and was concluded on the next day,
... and resulted in a pretended conviction with death sentences.
The evidence upon which the conviction was obtained was
454 | BROWN V. MISSISSIPPI (1936)

the so-called confessions. Without this evidence, a peremptory
instruction to find for the defendants would have been
inescapable."

   [T]he trial [] is a mere pretense where the state authorities
have contrived a conviction resting solely upon confessions
obtained by violence. The due process clause requires "that
state action, whether through one agency or another, shall
be consistent with the fundamental principles of liberty and
justice which lie at the base of all our civil and political
institutions." It would be difficult to conceive of methods
more revolting to the sense of justice than those taken to
procure the confessions of these petitioners, and the use of
the confessions thus obtained as the basis for conviction and
sentence was a clear denial of due process.

   In the instant case, the trial court was fully advised by the
undisputed evidence of the way in which the confessions had
been procured. The trial court knew that there was no other
evidence upon which conviction and sentence could be based.
Yet it proceeded to permit conviction and to pronounce
sentence. The conviction and sentence were void for want of
the essential elements of due process, and the proceeding thus
vitiated could be challenged in any appropriate manner. It was
challenged before the Supreme Court of the State by the
express invocation of the Fourteenth Amendment. That court
entertained the challenge, considered the federal question thus
presented, but declined to enforce petitioners' constitutional
right. The court thus denied a federal right fully established
                                             BROWN V. MISSISSIPPI (1936) | 455

and specially set up and claimed, and the judgment must be
reversed.

   * * *
   The Court has stated that "when a confession challenged as
involuntary is sought to be used against a criminal defendant
at his trial ... the prosecution must prove at least by a
preponderance of the evidence that the confession was
voluntary." Lego v. Twomey, 404 U.S. 477, 489 (1972); see also
Bram v. United States, 168 U.S. 532, 555 (1897) (recalling with
approval English precedent to the effect "that it was the duty
of the prosecutor to satisfy the trial judge that the confession
had not been obtained by improper means, and that, where it
was impossible to collect from the proof whether such was the
case or not, the confession ought not to be received").
   Unfortunately, while the facts in Brown v. Mississippi are
horrific, it was not the only case in which the Court found
it necessary to reverse a conviction based upon an involuntary
confession. Indeed, in reciting the facts of the next case, the
Court referred to "the usual pattern" of testimony concerning
the treatment of a suspect.
   Coercive interrogations were by no means limited to the
American South. Further, to find that a confession was not
voluntary, the Court does not require evidence of physical
mistreatment of a suspect. Continuous interrogation that
does not permit the suspect to eat or sleep, or implied threats
can also make a confession considered to be not voluntary.
456 | BROWN V. MISSISSIPPI (1936)

       Notes, Comments, and
                Questions

For a case in which coercive conduct was alleged but the Court
nonetheless affirmed a conviction, students should see Lisbena
v. California, 314 U.S. 219 (1941). In a dissent joined by
Justice Douglas, Justice Black wrote, "The testimony of the
officers to whom the confession was given is enough, standing
alone, to convince me that it could not have been free and
voluntary." In particular, the dissent noted that "an
investigator, `slapped' the defendant whose left ear was
thereafter red and swollen" and that squads of questioners
took turns interviewing the defendant, in a manner similar
to other cases we have seen. The majority, however, deferred
to state court findings "as concerns the petitioner's claims of
physical violence, threats or implied promises of leniency."
Despite referring to "the violations of law involved in the
treatment of the petitioner," the Court declined to find a Due
Process violation. Instead, it called the case "close to the line"
and held that the defendant "exhibited a self-possession, a
coolness, and an acumen throughout his questioning, and at
his trial, which negatives the view that he had so lost his
freedom of action that the statements made were not his but
were the result of the deprivation of his free choice to admit, to
deny, or to refuse to answer."

   These days, a promise of lenient treatment does not
automatically render the ensuing confession involuntary.
                                             BROWN V. MISSISSIPPI (1936) | 457

Instead, it is a factor to consider as part of the "totality-of-the-
circumstances" test the Court applies to Due Process claims.

   In part because the Court found it difficult to regulate
interrogations effectively using only the Due Process Clauses,
the Justices were inspired to create the Miranda Rule, which
imposes additional requirements on police. We turn to
Miranda in our next chapter.
PART XXII

INTERROGATIONS:
THE MIRANDA
RULE

        The Miranda Rule

In Miranda v. Arizona, the Court created an entirely new
method of regulating police interrogations of suspects. Rather
than search the records of each case for evidence of
voluntariness, the Court set forth a procedure under which
law enforcement officers must--at least sometimes--inform
suspects of certain constitutional rights and the potential
consequences of waiving those rights. Under the new rule, the
Court would presume confessions were obtained involuntarily
if officers failed to follow the new procedure, and such a
presumption would lead to exclusion of confessions from
evidence at trial. Over the next several chapters, we will explore
(1) the basics of the Miranda Rule, (2) how the Court has
defined important terms like "custody" and "interrogation,"
(3) what constitutes an effective "waiver" of rights under
Miranda, and (4) what exceptions apply to the rule that
460 | INTERROGATIONS: THE MIRANDA RULE

evidence obtained in violation of Miranda is excluded from
evidence.

   Even more than Terry v. Ohio--which all lawyers and
criminal justice students should be able to
summarize--Miranda v. Arizona is a case that friends and
acquaintances will expect lawyers and criminal justice students
to understand. It is probably the most famous criminal
procedure case ever decided, and students should form their
own opinions about the doctrine it created.
MIRANDA V. ARIZONA
(1966)

              Supreme Court of the United States

Ernesto A. Miranda v. State of
               Arizona

             Decided June 13, 1966 - 384 U.S. 436

   Mr. Chief Justice WARREN delivered the opinion of the
Court.

   The cases before us raise questions which go to the roots
of our concepts of American criminal jurisprudence: the
restraints society must observe consistent with the Federal
Constitution in prosecuting individuals for crime. More
specifically, we deal with the admissibility of statements
obtained from an individual who is subjected to custodial
police interrogation and the necessity for procedures which
assure that the individual is accorded his privilege under the
Fifth Amendment to the Constitution not to be compelled to
incriminate himself.
462 | MIRANDA V. ARIZONA (1966)

   We dealt with certain phases of this problem recently in
Escobedo v. State of Illinois, 378 U.S. 478 (1964). There, as
in the four cases before us, law enforcement officials took the
defendant into custody and interrogated him in a police
station for the purpose of obtaining a confession. The police
did not effectively advise him of his right to remain silent or of
his right to consult with his attorney. Rather, they confronted
him with an alleged accomplice who accused him of having
perpetrated a murder. When the defendant denied the
accusation and said "I didn't shoot Manuel, you did it," they
handcuffed him and took him to an interrogation room.
There, while handcuffed and standing, he was questioned for
four hours until he confessed. During this interrogation, the
police denied his request to speak to his attorney, and they
prevented his retained attorney, who had come to the police
station, from consulting with him. At his trial, the State, over
his objection, introduced the confession against him. We held
that the statements thus made were constitutionally
inadmissible. This case has been the subject of judicial
interpretation and spirited legal debate since it was decided
two years ago.

   We start here, as we did in Escobedo, with the premise that
our holding is not an innovation in our jurisprudence, but
is an application of principles long recognized and applied in
other settings. We have undertaken a thorough re-examination
of the Escobedo decision and the principles it announced, and
we reaffirm it. That case was but an explication of basic rights
                                              MIRANDA V. ARIZONA (1966) | 463

that are enshrined in our Constitution--that "No person ...
shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against
himself," and that "the accused shall ... have the Assistance
of Counsel"--rights which were put in jeopardy in that case
through official overbearing. These precious rights were fixed
in our Constitution only after centuries of persecution and
struggle. And in the words of Chief Justice Marshall, they
were secured "for ages to come, and ... designed to approach
immortality as nearly as human institutions can approach it."

   Our holding will be spelled out with some specificity in the
pages which follow but briefly stated it is this: the prosecution
may not use statements, whether exculpatory or inculpatory,
stemming from custodial interrogation of the defendant
unless it demonstrates the use of procedural safeguards
effective to secure the privilege against self-incrimination. By
custodial interrogation, we mean questioning initiated by law
enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody
or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any
significant way. As for the procedural safeguards to be
employed, unless other fully effective means are devised to
inform accused persons of their right of silence and to assure a
continuous opportunity to exercise it, the following measures
are required. Prior to any questioning, the person must be
warned that he has a right to remain silent, that any statement
he does make may be used as evidence against him, and that
he has a right to the presence of an attorney, either retained
or appointed. The defendant may waive effectuation of these
464 | MIRANDA V. ARIZONA (1966)

rights, provided the waiver is made voluntarily, knowingly and
intelligently. If, however, he indicates in any manner and at any
stage of the process that he wishes to consult with an attorney
before speaking there can be no questioning. Likewise, if the
individual is alone and indicates in any manner that he does
not wish to be interrogated, the police may not question him.
The mere fact that he may have answered some questions or
volunteered some statements on his own does not deprive him
of the right to refrain from answering any further inquiries
until he has consulted with an attorney and thereafter consents
to be questioned.

                       I

The constitutional issue we decide in each of these cases is
the admissibility of statements obtained from a defendant
questioned while in custody or otherwise deprived of his
freedom of action in any significant way. In each, the
defendant was questioned by police officers, detectives, or a
prosecuting attorney in a room in which he was cut off from
the outside world. In none of these cases was the defendant
given a full and effective warning of his rights at the outset
of the interrogation process. In all the cases, the questioning
elicited oral admissions, and in three of them, signed
statements as well which were admitted at their trials. They
all thus share salient features--incommunicado interrogation
of individuals in a police-dominated atmosphere, resulting in
                                              MIRANDA V. ARIZONA (1966) | 465

self-incriminating statements without full warnings of
constitutional rights.

   An understanding of the nature and setting of this in-
custody interrogation is essential to our decisions today. The
difficulty in depicting what transpires at such interrogations
stems from the fact that in this country they have largely taken
place incommunicado. From extensive factual studies
undertaken in the early 1930's, including the famous
Wickersham Report to Congress by a Presidential
Commission, it is clear that police violence and the "third
degree" flourished at that time. In a series of cases decided
by this Court long after these studies, the police resorted to
physical brutality--beatings, hanging, whipping--and to
sustained and protracted questioning incommunicado in
order to extort confessions. The Commission on Civil Rights
in 1961 found much evidence to indicate that `some
policemen still resort to physical force to obtain confessions."
The use of physical brutality and violence is not,
unfortunately, relegated to the past or to any part of the
country. Only recently in Kings County, New York, the police
brutally beat, kicked and placed lighted cigarette butts on the
back of a potential witness under interrogation for the purpose
of securing a statement incriminating a third party.

   The examples given above are undoubtedly the exception
now, but they are sufficiently widespread to be the object of
concern. Unless a proper limitation upon custodial
interrogation is achieved--such as these decisions will
466 | MIRANDA V. ARIZONA (1966)

advance--there can be no assurance that practices of this
nature will be eradicated in the foreseeable future.

   Again we stress that the modern practice of in-custody
interrogation is psychologically rather than physically
oriented. As we have stated before, "this Court has recognized
that coercion can be mental as well as physical, and that the
blood of the accused is not the only hallmark of an
unconstitutional inquisition." Interrogation still takes place
in privacy. Privacy results in secrecy and this in turn results
in a gap in our knowledge as to what in fact goes on in the
interrogation rooms. A valuable source of information about
present police practices, however, may be found in various
police manuals and texts which document procedures
employed with success in the past, and which recommend
various other effective tactics. These texts are used by law
enforcement agencies themselves as guides. It should be noted
that these texts professedly present the most enlightened and
effective means presently used to obtain statements through
custodial interrogation. By considering these texts and other
data, it is possible to describe procedures observed and noted
around the country.

   The officers are told by the manuals that the "principal
psychological factor contributing to a successful interrogation
is privacy--being alone with the person under interrogation."
To highlight the isolation and unfamiliar surroundings, the
manuals instruct the police to display an air of confidence in
the suspect's guilt and from outward appearance to maintain
                                              MIRANDA V. ARIZONA (1966) | 467

only an interest in confirming certain details. The guilt of the
subject is to be posited as a fact. The interrogator should direct
his comments toward the reasons why the subject committed
the act, rather than court failure by asking the subject whether
he did it. Like other men, perhaps the subject has had a bad
family life, had an unhappy childhood, had too much to drink,
had an unrequited desire for women. The officers are
instructed to minimize the moral seriousness of the offense,
to cast blame on the victim or on society. These tactics are
designed to put the subject in a psychological state where his
story is but an elaboration of what the police purport to know
already--that he is guilty. Explanations to the contrary are
dismissed and discouraged. The texts thus stress that the major
qualities an interrogator should possess are patience and
perseverance. The manuals suggest that the suspect be offered
legal excuses for his actions in order to obtain an initial
admission of guilt.

   When the techniques described above prove unavailing, the
texts recommend they be alternated with a show of some
hostility. One ploy often used has been termed the "friendly-
unfriendly" or Mutt and Jeff [good cop-bad cop] act:

   "... In this technique, two agents are employed. Mutt, the
relentless investigator, who knows the subject is guilty and is
not going to waste any time. He's sent a dozen men away for
this crime and he's going to send the subject away for the full
term. Jeff, on the other hand, is obviously a kindhearted man.
He has a family himself. He has a brother who was involved
468 | MIRANDA V. ARIZONA (1966)

in a little scrape like this. He disapproves of Mutt and his
tactics and will arrange to get him off the case if the subject will
cooperate. He can't hold Mutt off for very long. The subject
would be wise to make a quick decision. The technique is
applied by having both investigators present while Mutt acts
out his role. Jeff may stand by quietly and demur at some of
Mutt's tactics. When Jeff makes his plea for cooperation, Mutt
is not present in the room."

   The interrogators sometimes are instructed to induce a
confession out of trickery. The technique here is quite effective
in crimes which require identification or which run in series.
In the identification situation, the interrogator may take a
break in his questioning to place the subject among a group
of men in a line-up. "The witness or complainant (previously
coached, if necessary) studies the line-up and confidently
points out the subject as the guilty party." Then the
questioning resumes "as though there were now no doubt
about the guilt of the subject."

   The manuals also contain instructions for police on how
to handle the individual who refuses to discuss the matter
entirely, or who asks for an attorney or relatives. The examiner
is to concede him the right to remain silent. "This usually has
a very undermining effect. First of all, he is disappointed in
his expectation of an unfavorable reaction on the part of the
interrogator. Secondly, a concession of this right to remain
silent impresses the subject with the apparent fairness of his
interrogator." After this psychological conditioning, however,
                                              MIRANDA V. ARIZONA (1966) | 469

the officer is told to point out the incriminating significance of
the suspect's refusal to talk:

   "Joe, you have a right to remain silent. That's your privilege
and I'm the last person in the world who'll try to take it away
from you. If that's the way you want to leave this, O.K. But let
me ask you this. Suppose you were in my shoes and I were in
yours and you called me in to ask me about this and I told you,
`I don't want to answer any of your questions.' You'd think I
had something to hide, and you'd probably be right in thinking
that. That's exactly what I'll have to think about you, and so
will everybody else. So let's sit here and talk this whole thing
over."

   Few will persist in their initial refusal to talk, it is said, if this
monologue is employed correctly.

   From these representative samples of interrogation
techniques, the setting prescribed by the manuals and observed
in practice becomes clear. In essence, it is this: To be alone with
the subject is essential to prevent distraction and to deprive
him of any outside support. The aura of confidence in his
guilt undermines his will to resist. He merely confirms the
preconceived story the police seek to have him describe.
Patience and persistence, at times relentless questioning, are
employed. To obtain a confession, the interrogator must
"patiently maneuver himself or his quarry into a position from
which the desired objective may be attained." When normal
procedures fail to produce the needed result, the police may
resort to deceptive stratagems such as giving false legal advice.
470 | MIRANDA V. ARIZONA (1966)

It is important to keep the subject off balance, for example, by
trading on his insecurity about himself or his surroundings.
The police then persuade, trick, or cajole him out of exercising
his constitutional rights.

   Even without employing brutality, the "third
degree"[extreme physical conditions such as sleep deprivation]
or the specific stratagems described above, the very fact of
custodial interrogation exacts a heavy toll on individual liberty
and trades on the weakness of individuals.

   In these cases [before us], we might not find the defendants'
statements to have been involuntary in traditional terms. Our
concern for adequate safeguards to protect precious Fifth
Amendment rights is, of course, not lessened in the slightest.
In each of the cases, the defendant was thrust into an
unfamiliar atmosphere and run through menacing police
interrogation procedures.

   It is obvious that such an interrogation environment is
created for no purpose other than to subjugate the individual
to the will of his examiner. This atmosphere carries its own
badge of intimidation. To be sure, this is not physical
intimidation, but it is equally destructive of human dignity.
The current practice of incommunicado interrogation is at
odds with one of our Nation's most cherished
principles--that the individual may not be compelled to
incriminate himself. Unless adequate protective devices are
employed to dispel the compulsion inherent in custodial
                                              MIRANDA V. ARIZONA (1966) | 471

surroundings, no statement obtained from the defendant can
truly be the product of his free choice.

   From the foregoing, we can readily perceive an intimate
connection between the privilege against self-incrimination
and police custodial questioning. It is fitting to turn to history
and precedent underlying the Self-Incrimination Clause to
determine its applicability in this situation.

                       II

We sometimes forget how long it has taken to establish the
privilege against self-incrimination, the sources from which it
came and the fervor with which it was defended. Its roots go
back into ancient times.

   The question in these cases is whether the privilege is fully
applicable during a period of custodial interrogation. In this
Court, the privilege has consistently been accorded a liberal
construction. We are satisfied that all the principles embodied
in the privilege apply to informal compulsion exerted by law-
enforcement officers during in-custody questioning. An
individual swept from familiar surroundings into police
custody, surrounded by antagonistic forces, and subjected to
the techniques of persuasion described above cannot be
otherwise than under compulsion to speak. As a practical
matter, the compulsion to speak in the isolated setting of the
police station may well be greater than in courts or other
472 | MIRANDA V. ARIZONA (1966)

official investigations, where there are often impartial observers
to guard against intimidation or trickery.

                      III

Today, then, there can be no doubt that the Fifth Amendment
privilege is available outside of criminal court proceedings and
serves to protect persons in all settings in which their freedom
of action is curtailed in any significant way from being
compelled to incriminate themselves. We have concluded that
without proper safeguards the process of in-custody
interrogation of persons suspected or accused of crime
contains inherently compelling pressures which work to
undermine the individual's will to resist and to compel him
to speak where he would not otherwise do so freely. In order
to combat these pressures and to permit a full opportunity
to exercise the privilege against self-incrimination, the accused
must be adequately and effectively apprised of his rights and
the exercise of those rights must be fully honored.

   ***
   At the outset, if a person in custody is to be subjected to
interrogation, he must first be informed in clear and
unequivocal terms that he has the right to remain silent. For
those unaware of the privilege, the warning is needed simply
to make them aware of it--the threshold requirement for an
intelligent decision as to its exercise. More important, such a
warning is an absolute prerequisite in overcoming the inherent
                                              MIRANDA V. ARIZONA (1966) | 473

pressures of the interrogation atmosphere. It is not just the
subnormal or woefully ignorant who succumb to an
interrogator's imprecations, whether implied or expressly
stated, that the interrogation will continue until a confession
is obtained or that silence in the face of accusation is itself
damning and will bode ill when presented to a jury. Further,
the warning will show the individual that his interrogators are
prepared to recognize his privilege should he choose to exercise
it.

   The Fifth Amendment privilege is so fundamental to our
system of constitutional rule and the expedient of giving an
adequate warning as to the availability of the privilege so
simple, we will not pause to inquire in individual cases whether
the defendant was aware of his rights without a warning being
given. Assessments of the knowledge the defendant possessed,
based on information as to his age, education, intelligence,
or prior contact with authorities, can never be more than
speculation; a warning is a clearcut fact. More important,
whatever the background of the person interrogated, a
warning at the time of the interrogation is indispensable to
overcome its pressures and to insure that the individual knows
he is free to exercise the privilege at that point in time.

   The warning of the right to remain silent must be
accompanied by the explanation that anything said can and
will be used against the individual in court. This warning is
needed in order to make him aware not only of the privilege,
but also of the consequences of forgoing it. It is only through
474 | MIRANDA V. ARIZONA (1966)

an awareness of these consequences that there can be any
assurance of real understanding and intelligent exercise of the
privilege. Moreover, this warning may serve to make the
individual more acutely aware that he is faced with a phase of
the adversary system--that he is not in the presence of persons
acting solely in his interest.

   ***
   The presence of counsel at the interrogation may serve
several significant subsidiary functions as well. If the accused
decides to talk to his interrogators, the assistance of counsel
can mitigate the dangers of untrustworthiness. With a lawyer
present the likelihood that the police will practice coercion is
reduced, and if coercion is nevertheless exercised the lawyer can
testify to it in court. The presence of a lawyer can also help
to guarantee that the accused gives a fully accurate statement
to the police and that the statement is rightly reported by the
prosecution at trial.
   An individual need not make a pre-interrogation request for
a lawyer. While such request affirmatively secures his right to
have one, his failure to ask for a lawyer does not constitute
a waiver. No effective waiver of the right to counsel during
interrogation can be recognized unless specifically made after
the warnings we here delineate have been given. The accused
who does not know his rights and therefore does not make a
request may be the person who most needs counsel.
   Accordingly we hold that an individual held for
interrogation must be clearly informed that he has the right to
                                              MIRANDA V. ARIZONA (1966) | 475

consult with a lawyer and to have the lawyer with him during
interrogation under the system for protecting the privilege we
delineate today. As with the warnings of the right to remain
silent and that anything stated can be used in evidence against
him, this warning is an absolute prerequisite to interrogation.
No amount of circumstantial evidence that the person may
have been aware of this right will suffice to stand in its stead.
Only through such a warning is there ascertainable assurance
that the accused was aware of this right.

   If an individual indicates that he wishes the assistance of
counsel before any interrogation occurs, the authorities cannot
rationally ignore or deny his request on the basis that the
individual does not have or cannot afford a retained attorney.
The financial ability of the individual has no relationship to
the scope of the rights involved here. The privilege against
self-incrimination secured by the Constitution applies to all
individuals. The need for counsel in order to protect the
privilege exists for the indigent as well as the affluent. In fact,
were we to limit these constitutional rights to those who can
retain an attorney, our decisions today would be of little
significance. The cases before us as well as the vast majority of
confession cases with which we have dealt in the past involve
those unable to retain counsel. While authorities are not
required to relieve the accused of his poverty, they have the
obligation not to take advantage of indigence in the
administration of justice. Denial of counsel to the indigent at
the time of interrogation while allowing an attorney to those
476 | MIRANDA V. ARIZONA (1966)

who can afford one would be no more supportable by reason
or logic than the similar situation at trial and on appeal struck
down in Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335 (1963), and
Douglas v. California, 372 U.S. 353 (1963).

   In order fully to apprise a person interrogated of the extent
of his rights under this system then, it is necessary to warn
him not only that he has the right to consult with an attorney,
but also that if he is indigent a lawyer will be appointed to
represent him. Without this additional warning, the
admonition of the right to consult with counsel would often
be understood as meaning only that he can consult with a
lawyer if he has one or has the funds to obtain one. The
warning of a right to counsel would be hollow if not couched
in terms that would convey to the indigent--the person most
often subjected to interrogation--the knowledge that he too
has a right to have counsel present. As with the warnings of the
right to remain silent and of the general right to counsel, only
by effective and express explanation to the indigent of this right
can there be assurance that he was truly in a position to exercise
it.

   Once warnings have been given, the subsequent procedure
is clear. If the individual indicates in any manner, at any time
prior to or during questioning, that he wishes to remain silent,
the interrogation must cease. At this point he has shown that
he intends to exercise his Fifth Amendment privilege; any
statement taken after the person invokes his privilege cannot
be other than the product of compulsion, subtle or otherwise.
                                              MIRANDA V. ARIZONA (1966) | 477

Without the right to cut off questioning, the setting of in-
custody interrogation operates on the individual to overcome
free choice in producing a statement after the privilege has
been once invoked. If the individual states that he wants an
attorney, the interrogation must cease until an attorney is
present. At that time, the individual must have an opportunity
to confer with the attorney and to have him present during
any subsequent questioning. If the individual cannot obtain
an attorney and he indicates that he wants one before speaking
to police, they must respect his decision to remain silent.

   ***
   If the interrogation continues without the presence of an
attorney and a statement is taken, a heavy burden rests on
the government to demonstrate that the defendant knowingly
and intelligently waived his privilege against self-incrimination
and his right to retained or appointed counsel. This Court
has always set high standards of proof for the waiver of
constitutional rights, and we reassert these standards as applied
to in-custody interrogation. Since the State is responsible for
establishing the isolated circumstances under which the
interrogation takes place and has the only means of making
available corroborated evidence of warnings given during
incommunicado interrogation, the burden is rightly on its
shoulders.
   An express statement that the individual is willing to make
a statement and does not want an attorney followed closely by
a statement could constitute a waiver. But a valid waiver will
478 | MIRANDA V. ARIZONA (1966)

not be presumed simply from the silence of the accused after
warnings are given or simply from the fact that a confession
was in fact eventually obtained. Moreover, where in-custody
interrogation is involved, there is no room for the contention
that the privilege is waived if the individual answers some
questions or gives some information on his own prior to
invoking his right to remain silent when interrogated.

   Whatever the testimony of the authorities as to waiver of
rights by an accused, the fact of lengthy interrogation or
incommunicado incarceration before a statement is made is
strong evidence that the accused did not validly waive his
rights. In these circumstances the fact that the individual
eventually made a statement is consistent with the conclusion
that the compelling influence of the interrogation finally
forced him to do so. It is inconsistent with any notion of a
voluntary relinquishment of the privilege. Moreover, any
evidence that the accused was threatened, tricked, or cajoled
into a waiver will, of course, show that the defendant did not
voluntarily waive his privilege. The requirement of warnings
and waiver of rights is a fundamental with respect to the Fifth
Amendment privilege and not simply a preliminary ritual to
existing methods of interrogation.

   The warnings required and the waiver necessary in
accordance with our opinion today are, in the absence of a
fully effective equivalent, prerequisites to the admissibility of
any statement made by a defendant.

   The principles announced today deal with the protection
                                              MIRANDA V. ARIZONA (1966) | 479

which must be given to the privilege against self-incrimination
when the individual is first subjected to police interrogation
while in custody at the station or otherwise deprived of his
freedom of action in any significant way. It is at this point
that our adversary system of criminal proceedings commences,
distinguishing itself at the outset from the inquisitorial system
recognized in some countries. Under the system of warnings
we delineate today or under any other system which may be
devised and found effective, the safeguards to be erected about
the privilege must come into play at this point.

   Our decision is not intended to hamper the traditional
function of police officers in investigating crime. When an
individual is in custody on probable cause, the police may, of
course, seek out evidence in the field to be used at trial against
him. Such investigation may include inquiry of persons not
under restraint. General on-the-scene questioning as to facts
surrounding a crime or other general questioning of citizens in
the fact-finding process is not affected by our holding. It is an
act of responsible citizenship for individuals to give whatever
information they may have to aid in law enforcement. In such
situations the compelling atmosphere inherent in the process
of in-custody interrogation is not necessarily present.

   ***
   In announcing these principles, we are not unmindful of
the burdens which law enforcement officials must bear, often
under trying circumstances. We also fully recognize the
obligation of all citizens to aid in enforcing the criminal laws.
480 | MIRANDA V. ARIZONA (1966)

This Court, while protecting individual rights, has always
given ample latitude to law enforcement agencies in the
legitimate exercise of their duties. The limits we have placed
on the interrogation process should not constitute an undue
interference with a proper system of law enforcement. As we
have noted, our decision does not in any way preclude police
from carrying out their traditional investigatory functions.
Although confessions may play an important role in some
convictions, the cases before us present graphic examples of
the overstatement of the "need" for confessions. In each case
authorities conducted interrogations ranging up to five days in
duration despite the presence, through standard investigating
practices, of considerable evidence against each defendant.

                      V

Because of the nature of the problem and because of its
recurrent significance in numerous cases, we have to this point
discussed the relationship of the Fifth Amendment privilege
to police interrogation without specific concentration on the
facts of the cases before us. In each instance, we have
concluded that statements were obtained from the defendant
under circumstances that did not meet constitutional
standards for protection of the privilege.

   Mr. Justice HARLAN, whom Mr. Justice STEWART and
Mr. Justice WHITE join, dissenting.

   I believe the decision of the Court represents poor
                                              MIRANDA V. ARIZONA (1966) | 481

constitutional law and entails harmful consequences for the
country at large. How serious these consequences may prove
to be only time can tell. But the basic flaws in the Court's
justification seem to me readily apparent now once all sides of
the problem are considered.

   At the outset, it is well to note exactly what is required by
the Court's new constitutional code of rules for confessions.
The foremost requirement, upon which later admissibility of
a confession depends, is that a fourfold warning be given to
a person in custody before he is questioned, namely, that he
has a right to remain silent, that anything he says may be used
against him, that he has a right to have present an attorney
during the questioning, and that if indigent he has a right to a
lawyer without charge. To forgo these rights, some affirmative
statement of rejection is seemingly required, and threats,
tricks, or cajolings to obtain this waiver are forbidden. If before
or during questioning the suspect seeks to invoke his right
to remain silent, interrogation must be forgone or cease; a
request for counsel brings about the same result until a lawyer
is procured. Finally, there are a miscellany of minor directives,
for example, the burden of proof of waiver is on the State,
admissions and exculpatory statements are treated just like
confessions, withdrawal of a waiver is always permitted, and so
forth.

   While the fine points of this scheme are far less clear than
the Court admits, the tenor is quite apparent. The new rules
are not designed to guard against police brutality or other
482 | MIRANDA V. ARIZONA (1966)

unmistakably banned forms of coercion. Those who use third-
degree tactics and deny them in court are equally able and
destined to lie as skillfully about warnings and waivers. Rather,
the thrust of the new rules is to negate all pressures, to
reinforce the nervous or ignorant suspect, and ultimately to
discourage any confession at all. The aim in short is toward
"voluntariness" in a utopian sense, or to view it from a
different angle, voluntariness with a vengeance.

   ***
   How much harm this decision will inflict on law
enforcement cannot fairly be predicted with accuracy.
Evidence on the role of confessions is notoriously incomplete.
We do know that some crimes cannot be solved without
confessions, that ample expert testimony attests to their
importance in crime control, and that the Court is taking a real
risk with society's welfare in imposing its new regime on the
country. The social costs of crime are too great to call the new
rules anything but a hazardous experimentation.
   Mr. Justice WHITE, with whom Mr. Justice HARLAN
and Mr. Justice STEWART join, dissenting.
   The proposition that the privilege against self-incrimination
forbids in-custody interrogation without the warnings
specified in the majority opinion and without a clear waiver
of counsel has no significant support in the history of the
privilege or in the language of the Fifth Amendment.
   ***
   The obvious underpinning of the Court's decision is a
                                              MIRANDA V. ARIZONA (1966) | 483

deep-seated distrust of all confessions. As the Court declares
that the accused may not be interrogated without counsel
present, absent a waiver of the right to counsel, and as the
Court all but admonishes the lawyer to advise the accused
to remain silent, the result adds up to a judicial judgment
that evidence from the accused should not be used against
him in any way, whether compelled or not. This is the not so
subtle overtone of the opinion--that it is inherently wrong
for the police to gather evidence from the accused himself.
And this is precisely the nub of this dissent. I see nothing
wrong or immoral, and certainly nothing unconstitutional, in
the police's asking a suspect whom they have reasonable cause
to arrest whether or not he killed his wife or in confronting
him with the evidence on which the arrest was based, at least
where he has been plainly advised that he may remain
completely silent. Until today, "the admissions or confessions
of the prisoner, when voluntarily and freely made, have always
ranked high in the scale of incriminating evidence."
Particularly when corroborated, as where the police have
confirmed the accused's disclosure of the hiding place of
implements or fruits of the crime, such confessions have the
highest reliability and significantly contribute to the certitude
with which we may believe the accused is guilty. Moreover, it is
by no means certain that the process of confessing is injurious
to the accused. To the contrary it may provide psychological
relief and enhance the prospects for rehabilitation.

   The rule announced today will measurably weaken the
484 | MIRANDA V. ARIZONA (1966)

ability of the criminal law to perform these tasks. It is a
deliberate calculus to prevent interrogations, to reduce the
incidence of confessions and pleas of guilty and to increase the
number of trials. Criminal trials, no matter how efficient the
police are, are not sure bets for the prosecution, nor should
they be if the evidence is not forthcoming. Under the present
law, the prosecution fails to prove its case in about 30% of
the criminal cases actually tried in the federal courts. But it
is something else again to remove from the ordinary criminal
case all those confessions which heretofore have been held to
be free and voluntary acts of the accused and to thus establish a
new constitutional barrier to the ascertainment of truth by the
judicial process. There is, in my view, every reason to believe
that a good many criminal defendants who otherwise would
have been convicted on what this Court has previously
thought to be the most satisfactory kind of evidence will now
under this new version of the Fifth Amendment, either not be
tried at all or will be acquitted if the State's evidence, minus the
confession, is put to the test of litigation.

   In some unknown number of cases the Court's rule will
return a killer, a rapist or other criminal to the streets and
to the environment which produced him, to repeat his crime
whenever it pleases him. As a consequence, there will not be a
gain, but a loss, in human dignity***

       Notes, Comments, and
                Questions

Most students are familiar with the Miranda warnings, even
before reading the case. Prior to a custodial interrogation,
officers must inform suspects of the following:

 1. You have the right to remain silent
 2. Anything you say can be used against you
 3. You have the right to an attorney
 4. An attorney will be provided by the government if you

      cannot pay

Review section I of the opinion to see where these specific
warnings originated.

   The Court finds the Constitutional basis in the 5th
Amendment; an element of informal compulsion exists in any
form of custodial interrogation, and specified warnings are
needed to dispel the inherent pressure of custodial
interrogation. Does the Court have the power to promulgate
constitutional prophylactic rules?

   The Miranda warnings are really a way to avoid the
difficulties of case-by-case determination of compulsion. How
well do you think Miranda warnings work in practice to (1)
reduce the compulsion suspects feel during custodial
interrogations; and (2) reduce courts necessity to make case-by-
case determinations of compulsion.
486 | MIRANDA V. ARIZONA (1966)

   As you can imagine, suspects continue to confess, despite
receiving appropriate Miranda warnings. Why do you think
this is?
HOW WELL MUST
OFFICERS ADMINISTER
THE MIRANDA
WARNINGS?

    How Well Must Officers
    Administer the Miranda

             Warnings?

One issue not settled by Miranda was how closely police
interrogators would be required to deliver the precise warnings
set forth by the Miranda majority. Would word-for-word
accuracy--or at least warnings materially identical to those
provided by the Court--be necessary? Because police officers
are human, perfect accuracy would not be a fair standard. The
real question was how far officers could stray from the Court's
language while still having their warnings count for purposes
of getting confessions into evidence under Miranda.

   The next case presented the Court with another deviation
from the warning language set forth in Miranda.
DUCKWORTH V. EAGAN
(1989)

              Supreme Court of the United States

   Jack R. Duckworth v. Gary
           James Eagan

             Decided June 26, 1989 - 492 U.S. 195

   Chief Justice REHNQUIST delivered the opinion of the
Court.

   Respondent confessed to stabbing a woman nine times after
she refused to have sexual relations with him, and he was
convicted of attempted murder. Before confessing, respondent
was given warnings by the police, which included the advice
that a lawyer would be appointed "if and when you go to
court." The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh
Circuit held that such advice did not comply with the
requirements of Miranda v. Arizona. We disagree and reverse.

   Late on May 16, 1982, respondent contacted a Chicago
police officer he knew to report that he had seen the naked
                                           DUCKWORTH V. EAGAN (1989) | 489

body of a dead woman lying on a Lake Michigan beach.
Respondent denied any involvement in criminal activity. He
then took several Chicago police officers to the beach, where
the woman was crying for help. When she saw respondent, the
woman exclaimed: "Why did you stab me? Why did you stab
me?" Respondent told the officers that he had been with the
woman earlier that night, but that they had been attacked by
several men who abducted the woman in a van.

   The next morning, after realizing that the crime had been
committed in Indiana, the Chicago police turned the
investigation over to the Hammond, Indiana, Police
Department. Respondent repeated to the Hammond police
officers his story that he had been attacked on the lakefront,
and that the woman had been abducted by several men. After
he filled out a battery complaint at a local police station,
respondent agreed to go to the Hammond police headquarters
for further questioning.

   At about 11 a.m., the Hammond police questioned
respondent. Before doing so, the police read to respondent
a waiver form, entitled "Voluntary Appearance; Advice of
Rights," and they asked him to sign it. The form provided:

   "Before we ask you any questions, you must understand
your rights. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you
say can be used against you in court. You have a right to talk
to a lawyer for advice before we ask you any questions, and to
have him with you during questioning. You have this right to
the advice and presence of a lawyer even if you cannot afford to
490 | DUCKWORTH V. EAGAN (1989)

hire one. We have no way of giving you a lawyer, but one will
be appointed for you, if you wish, if and when you go to court.
If you wish to answer questions now without a lawyer present,
you have the right to stop answering questions at any time. You
also have the right to stop answering at any time until you've
talked to a lawyer."

   Respondent signed the form and repeated his exculpatory
explanation for his activities of the previous evening.

   Respondent was then placed in the "lock up" at the
Hammond police headquarters. Some 29 hours later, at about
4 p.m. on May 18, the police again interviewed respondent.
Before this questioning, one of the officers read the following
waiver form to respondent:

   [The waiver form presented the Miranda warnings in a
standard way.]

   Respondent read the form back to the officers and signed
it. He proceeded to confess to stabbing the woman. The next
morning, respondent led the officers to the Lake Michigan
beach where they recovered the knife he had used in the
stabbing and several items of clothing.

   ***
   In Miranda itself, the Court said that "[t]he warnings
required and the waiver necessary in accordance with our
opinion today are, in the absence of a fully effective equivalent,
prerequisites to the admissibility of any statement made by a
defendant."
   We think the initial warnings given to respondent touched
                                           DUCKWORTH V. EAGAN (1989) | 491

all of the bases required by Miranda. The police told
respondent that he had the right to remain silent, that
anything he said could be used against him in court, that he
had the right to speak to an attorney before and during
questioning, that he had "this right to the advice and presence
of a lawyer even if [he could] not afford to hire one," and
that he had the "right to stop answering at any time until
[he] talked to a lawyer." As noted, the police also added that
they could not provide respondent with a lawyer, but that
one would be appointed "if and when you go to court." The
Court of Appeals thought this "if and when you go to court"
language suggested that "only those accused who can afford an
attorney have the right to have one present before answering
any questions," and "implie[d] that if the accused does not
`go to court,' i.e.[,] the government does not file charges, the
accused is not entitled to [counsel] at all."

   In our view, the Court of Appeals misapprehended the
effect of the inclusion of "if and when you go to court"
language in Miranda warnings. First, this instruction
accurately described the procedure for the appointment of
counsel in Indiana. Under Indiana law, counsel is appointed at
the defendant's initial appearance in court, and formal charges
must be filed at or before that hearing. We think it must be
relatively commonplace for a suspect, after receiving Miranda
warnings, to ask when he will obtain counsel. The "if and
when you go to court" advice simply anticipates that question.
Second, Miranda does not require that attorneys be
492 | DUCKWORTH V. EAGAN (1989)

producible on call, but only that the suspect be informed, as
here, that he has the right to an attorney before and during
questioning, and that an attorney would be appointed for him
if he could not afford one. The Court in Miranda emphasized
that it was not suggesting that "each police station must have a
`station house lawyer' present at all times to advise prisoners."
If the police cannot provide appointed counsel, Miranda
requires only that the police not question a suspect unless he
waives his right to counsel. Here, respondent did just that.

   Justice MARSHALL, with whom Justice BRENNAN
joins, and with whom Justice BLACKMUN and Justice
STEVENS join, dissenting.

   The majority holds today that a police warning advising a
suspect that he is entitled to an appointed lawyer only "if and
when he goes to court" satisfies the requirements of Miranda
v. Arizona. The majority reaches this result by seriously
mischaracterizing that decision. Under Miranda, a police
warning must "clearly infor[m]" a suspect taken into custody
"that if he cannot afford an attorney one will be appointed
for him prior to any questioning if he so desires." A warning
qualified by an "if and when you go to court" caveat does
nothing of the kind; instead, it leads the suspect to believe
that a lawyer will not be provided until some indeterminate
time in the future after questioning. I refuse to acquiesce in
the continuing debasement of this historic precedent and
therefore dissent.

THE ENDURANCE OF
MIRANDA IN THE FACE
OF CRITICISM

The Endurance of Miranda in
      the Face of Criticism

In 2000, the Court considered whether to abolish the Miranda
Rule. Miranda had inspired intense criticism, including from
William H. Rehnquist, who had been an assistant attorney
general in the Nixon administration soon after Miranda was
decided. He wrote in 1969 that "the court is now committed
to the proposition that relevant, competent, uncoerced
statements of the defendant will not be admissible at his trial
unless an elaborate set of warnings be given, which is very likely
to have the effect of preventing a defendant from making any
statement at all." See Victor Li, "50-Year Story of the Miranda
Warning Has the Twists of a Cop Show," ABA Journal (Aug.
2016). Three decades later, Rehnquist was Chief Justice of
the United States, with the ability to shape constitutional law
instead of merely commenting on it.

           United States

             Decided June 26, 2000 - 530 U.S. 428

   Chief Justice REHNQUIST delivered the opinion of the
Court.

   [Examining validity of a congressional statute indicating
that federal law enforcement officers are not obligated to give
Miranda warnings]

   ***
   Whether or not we would agree with Miranda's reasoning
and its resulting rule, were we addressing the issue in the first
instance, the principles of stare decisis weigh heavily against
overruling it now. While "`stare decisis is not an inexorable
command,'" particularly when we are interpreting the
Constitution, "even in constitutional cases, the doctrine
496 | DICKERSON V. UNITED STATES (2000)

carries such persuasive force that we have always required a
departure from precedent to be supported by some `special
justification.'"

   We do not think there is such justification for overruling
Miranda. Miranda has become embedded in routine police
practice to the point where the warnings have become part of
our national culture. While we have overruled our precedents
when subsequent cases have undermined their doctrinal
underpinnings, we do not believe that this has happened to
the Miranda decision. If anything, our subsequent cases have
reduced the impact of the Miranda rule on legitimate law
enforcement while reaffirming the decision's core ruling that
unwarned statements may not be used as evidence in the
prosecution's case in chief.

   The disadvantage of the Miranda rule is that statements
which may be by no means involuntary, made by a defendant
who is aware of his "rights," may nonetheless be excluded and
a guilty defendant go free as a result.....

   In sum, we conclude that Miranda announced a
constitutional rule that Congress may not supersede
legislatively. Following the rule of stare decisis, we decline to
overrule Miranda ourselves. The judgment of the Court of
Appeals is therefore [r]eversed.

                Questions

When given the opportunity, the Court did not overrule
Miranda. Do you agree that Miranda warnings should still be
required? Why or why not?

   Our next chapters explore two important questions left
open by Miranda--how the Court would define "custody"
and how it would define "interrogation." Because the Miranda
Rule applies only during "custodial interrogation," each of
these definitions is essential to applying the rule.
PART XXIII

INTERROGATIONS:
WHAT IS
CUSTODY?

  The Miranda Rule: What Is
              Custody?

The Miranda Rule applies only during "custodial
interrogation." Therefore, unless a suspect is both (1) "in
custody" and (2) being "interrogated," police need not provide
the warnings described in Miranda. In this chapter, we
consider how the Court has defined "custody" in cases
applying the Miranda Rule. We also review some of the
literature evaluating the practical effects of the doctrine on
suspects and police.

   In Miranda, the Court wrote: "By custodial interrogation,
we mean questioning initiated by law enforcement officers
after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise
deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way."
Subsequent cases, however, have strayed from the expansive
500 | INTERROGATIONS: WHAT IS CUSTODY?

definition of "custody" implied by the words "deprived of his
freedom of action in any significant way."

   Students should note that the definition of "custody" under
Miranda differs from the definition of a "seizure" for Fourth
Amendment purposes. In other words, a person can be
"seized" (or "detained") but not be in a situation in which
Miranda warnings are required before police may begin
interrogation. Yet Fourth Amendment law remains a useful
touchstone because if a person is not "seized"--that is, if a
reasonable person in her situation would have felt free to
leave--then it will be difficult to argue that she was "in
custody" for Miranda purposes.

       Notes, Comments, and
                Questions

We have seen the Court's preference for objective tests--those
based upon what a "reasonable" person would have done or
believed in certain circumstances--over subjective tests based
on what a specific person was actually thinking. When
deciding whether Sylvia Mendenhall was detained (Chapter
19), for example, the question was not whether she felt free to
leave but instead was whether a hypothetical reasonable person
in her situation at the airport would have felt free to leave.
Similar analysis pervades decisions about whether consent for
searches was validly obtained.

   Further, the Court has often seemed to adopt a one-size-fits-
                              INTERROGATIONS: WHAT IS CUSTODY? | 501

all concept of the reasonable person. To return to Mendenhall:
The Court considered briefly that she was "22 years old and
had not been graduated from high school ... [and was] a female
and a Negro" interacting with white police officers.
Nonetheless, the Court's "reasonable person" analysis paid
little attention to these factors, finding them "not irrelevant"
but not especially important. Critics have suggested (as they
have in other legal contexts applying "reasonable person"
standards, such as tort law) that the beliefs and behaviors of a
reasonable person will depend significantly on factors such as
race, sex, education, age, and social class, to which the Court
gives little attention.

   In the next case, the Court considered the potential
relevance of someone's age to the question of whether he was
"in custody" for purposes of Miranda. The result differed
from the common one-size-fits-all concept of "reasonable"
that the Court had previously applied in Miranda cases.
J.D.B. V. NORTH
CAROLINA (2011)

     J.D.B. v. North Carolina

             Decided June 16, 2011 - 564 U.S. 261

   Justice SOTOMAYOR delivered the opinion of the Court.
   This case presents the question whether the age of a child
subjected to police questioning is relevant to the custody
analysis of Miranda v. Arizona. It is beyond dispute that
children will often feel bound to submit to police questioning
when an adult in the same circumstances would feel free to
leave. Seeing no reason for police officers or courts to blind
themselves to that commonsense reality, we hold that a child's
age properly informs the Miranda custody analysis.
504 | J.D.B. V. NORTH CAROLINA (2011)

                       I

                         A

Petitioner J.D.B. was a 13-year-old, seventh-grade student
attending class at Smith Middle School in Chapel Hill, North
Carolina when he was removed from his classroom by a
uniformed police officer, escorted to a closed-door conference
room, and questioned by police for at least half an hour.

   This was the second time that police questioned J.D.B. in
the span of a week. Five days earlier, two home break-ins
occurred, and various items were stolen. Police stopped and
questioned J.D.B. after he was seen behind a residence in the
neighborhood where the crimes occurred. That same day,
police also spoke to J.D.B.'s grandmother--his legal
guardian--as well as his aunt.

   Police later learned that a digital camera matching the
description of one of the stolen items had been found at
J.D.B.'s middle school and seen in J.D.B.'s possession.
Investigator DiCostanzo, the juvenile investigator with the
local police force who had been assigned to the case, went
to the school to question J.D.B. Upon arrival, DiCostanzo
informed the uniformed police officer on detail to the school
(a so-called school resource officer), the assistant principal, and
an administrative intern that he was there to question J.D.B.
about the break-ins. Although DiCostanzo asked the school
administrators to verify J.D.B.'s date of birth, address, and
                                        J.D.B. V. NORTH CAROLINA (2011) | 505

parent contact information from school records, neither the
police officers nor the school administrators contacted J.D.B.'s
grandmother.

   The uniformed officer interrupted J.D.B.'s afternoon social
studies class, removed J.D.B. from the classroom, and escorted
him to a school conference room. There, J.D.B. was met by
DiCostanzo, the assistant principal, and the administrative
intern. The door to the conference room was closed. With the
two police officers and the two administrators present, J.D.B.
was questioned for the next 30 to 45 minutes. Prior to the
commencement of questioning, J.D.B. was given neither
Miranda warnings nor the opportunity to speak to his
grandmother. Nor was he informed that he was free to leave
the room.

   Questioning began with small talk--discussion of sports
and J.D.B.'s family life. DiCostanzo asked, and J.D.B. agreed,
to discuss the events of the prior weekend. Denying any
wrongdoing, J.D.B. explained that he had been in the
neighborhood where the crimes occurred because he was
seeking work mowing lawns. DiCostanzo pressed J.D.B. for
additional detail about his efforts to obtain work; asked J.D.B.
to explain a prior incident, when one of the victims returned
home to find J.D.B. behind her house; and confronted J.D.B.
with the stolen camera. The assistant principal urged J.D.B.
to "do the right thing," warning J.D.B. that "the truth always
comes out in the end."

   Eventually, J.D.B. asked whether he would "still be in
506 | J.D.B. V. NORTH CAROLINA (2011)

trouble" if he returned the "stuff." In response, DiCostanzo
explained that return of the stolen items would be helpful,
but "this thing is going to court" regardless. DiCostanzo then
warned that he may need to seek a secure custody order if
he believed that J.D.B. would continue to break into other
homes. When J.D.B. asked what a secure custody order was,
DiCostanzo explained that "it's where you get sent to juvenile
detention before court."

   After learning of the prospect of juvenile detention, J.D.B.
confessed that he and a friend were responsible for the break-
ins. DiCostanzo only then informed J.D.B. that he could
refuse to answer the investigator's questions and that he was
free to leave. Asked whether he understood, J.D.B. nodded
and provided further detail, including information about the
location of the stolen items. Eventually J.D.B. wrote a
statement, at DiCostanzo's request. When the bell rang

                         A

Any police interview of an individual suspected of a crime has
"coercive aspects to it." Only those interrogations that occur
while a suspect is in police custody, however, "heighte[n] the
                                        J.D.B. V. NORTH CAROLINA (2011) | 507

risk" that statements obtained are not the product of the
suspect's free choice.

   By its very nature, custodial police interrogation entails
"inherently compelling pressures." Even for an adult, the
physical and psychological isolation of custodial interrogation
can "undermine the individual's will to resist and ... compel
him to speak where he would not otherwise do so freely."
Indeed, the pressure of custodial interrogation is so immense
that it "can induce a frighteningly high percentage of people
to confess to crimes they never committed." That risk is all
the more troubling--and recent studies suggest, all the more
acute--when the subject of custodial interrogation is a
juvenile.

   Recognizing that the inherently coercive nature of custodial
interrogation "blurs the line between voluntary and
involuntary statements," this Court in Miranda adopted a set
of prophylactic measures designed to safeguard the
constitutional guarantee against self-incrimination.Because
these measures protect the individual against the coercive
nature of custodial interrogation, they are required "`only
where there has been such a restriction on a person's freedom
as to render him "in custody."'" As we have repeatedly
emphasized, whether a suspect is "in custody" is an objective
inquiry.

   The benefit of the objective custody analysis is that it is
"designed to give clear guidance to the police."
508 | J.D.B. V. NORTH CAROLINA (2011)

                         B

The State and its amici contend that a child's age has no place
in the custody analysis, no matter how young the child
subjected to police questioning. We cannot agree. In some
circumstances, a child's age "would have affected how a
reasonable person" in the suspect's position "would perceive
his or her freedom to leave." That is, a reasonable child
subjected to police questioning will sometimes feel pressured
to submit when a reasonable adult would feel free to go. We
think it clear that courts can account for that reality without
doing any damage to the objective nature of the custody
analysis.

   A child's age is far "more than a chronological fact." It is a
fact that "generates commonsense conclusions about behavior
and perception." Such conclusions apply broadly to children
as a class. And, they are self-evident to anyone who was a child
once himself, including any police officer or judge.

   Time and again, this Court has drawn these commonsense
conclusions for itself. We have observed that children
"generally are less mature and responsible than adults," that
they "often lack the experience, perspective, and judgment to
recognize and avoid choices that could be detrimental to
them," that they "are more vulnerable or susceptible to ...
outside pressures" than adults, and so on. Addressing the
specific context of police interrogation, we have observed that
events that "would leave a man cold and unimpressed can
                                        J.D.B. V. NORTH CAROLINA (2011) | 509

overawe and overwhelm a lad in his early teens." Describing
no one child in particular, these observations restate what "any
parent knows"--indeed, what any person knows--about
children generally.

   Our various statements to this effect are far from unique.
The law has historically reflected the same assumption that
children characteristically lack the capacity to exercise mature
judgment and possess only an incomplete ability to
understand the world around them. Like this Court's own
generalizations, the legal disqualifications placed on children as
a class--e.g., limitations on their ability to alienate property,
enter a binding contract enforceable against them, and marry
without parental consent--exhibit the settled understanding
that the differentiating characteristics of youth are universal.

   ***
   Reviewing the question de novo today, we hold that so long
as the child's age was known to the officer at the time of police
questioning, or would have been objectively apparent to a
reasonable officer, its inclusion in the custody analysis is
consistent with the objective nature of that test. This is not
to say that a child's age will be a determinative, or even a
significant, factor in every case. It is, however, a reality that
courts cannot simply ignore.
   The question remains whether J.D.B. was in custody when
police interrogated him. We remand for the state courts to
address that question, this time taking account of all of the
relevant circumstances of the interrogation, including J.D.B.'s
510 | J.D.B. V. NORTH CAROLINA (2011)

age at the time. The judgment of the North Carolina Supreme
Court is reversed, and the case is remanded for proceedings not
inconsistent with this opinion.

   Justice ALITO, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE,
Justice SCALIA, and Justice THOMAS join, dissenting.

   The Court's decision in this case may seem on first
consideration to be modest and sensible, but in truth it is
neither. It is fundamentally inconsistent with one of the main
justifications for the Miranda rule: the perceived need for a
clear rule that can be easily applied in all cases. And today's
holding is not needed to protect the constitutional rights of
minors who are questioned by the police.

   Miranda's prophylactic regime places a high value on clarity
and certainty. Dissatisfied with the highly fact-specific
constitutional rule against the admission of involuntary
confessions, the Miranda Court set down rigid standards that
often require courts to ignore personal characteristics that may
be highly relevant to a particular suspect's actual susceptibility
to police pressure. This rigidity, however, has brought with
it one of Miranda's principal strengths--"the ease and clarity
of its application" by law enforcement officials and courts. A
key contributor to this clarity, at least up until now, has been
Miranda's objective reasonable-person test for determining
custody.

   ***
   Today's decision shifts the Miranda custody determination
from a one-size-fits-all reasonable-person test into an inquiry
                                         J.D.B. V. NORTH CAROLINA (2011) | 511

that must account for at least one individualized
characteristic--age--that is thought to correlate with
susceptibility to coercive pressures. Age, however, is in no way
the only personal characteristic that may correlate with
pliability, and in future cases the Court will be forced to
choose between two unpalatable alternatives. It may choose to
limit today's decision by arbitrarily distinguishing a suspect's
age from other personal characteristics--such as intelligence,
education, occupation, or prior experience with law
enforcement--that may also correlate with susceptibility to
coercive pressures. Or, if the Court is unwilling to draw these
arbitrary lines, it will be forced to effect a fundamental
transformation of the Miranda custody test--from a clear,
easily applied prophylactic rule into a highly fact-intensive
standard resembling the voluntariness test that the Miranda
Court found to be unsatisfactory.

   For at least three reasons, there is no need to go down this
road. First, many minors subjected to police interrogation are
near the age of majority, and for these suspects the one-size-fits-
all Miranda custody rule may not be a bad fit. Second, many of
the difficulties in applying the Miranda custody rule to minors
arise because of the unique circumstances present when the
police conduct interrogations at school. The Miranda custody
rule has always taken into account the setting in which
questioning occurs, and accounting for the school setting in
such cases will address many of these problems. Third, in cases
like the one now before us, where the suspect is especially
512 | J.D.B. V. NORTH CAROLINA (2011)

young, courts applying the constitutional voluntariness
standard can take special care to ensure that incriminating
statements were not obtained through coercion. Safeguarding
the constitutional rights of minors does not require the
extreme makeover of Miranda that today's decision may
portend.

       Notes, Comments, and
                Questions

The dissent in J.D.B raised concerns that the majority's
decision will lead to a slippery slope. Should the court consider
factors like race, sex, and socioeconomic status in the Miranda
analysis? What are potential pros and cons of such an
approach?

   The next case provides a stark example of the difference
between "custody" under Miranda and the definition of a
Fourth Amendment "seizure." The Court has long held that
when police stop a car, the driver is "seized" and can later
object if the stop was unlawful. See Delaware v. Prouse, 440
U.S. 648, 653 (1979). In 2007, the Court announced the
additional holding that everyone in the car--including
passengers--is "seized" during a vehicle stop. See Brendlin v.
California, 551 U.S. 249 (2007). The Court explained: "We
think that in these circumstances any reasonable passenger
would have understood the police officers to be exercising
control to the point that no one in the car was free to depart
                                         J.D.B. V. NORTH CAROLINA (2011) | 513

without police permission. A traffic stop necessarily curtails
the travel a passenger has chosen just as much as it halts the
driver, diverting both from the stream of traffic to the side
of the road, and the police activity that normally amounts to
intrusion on `privacy and personal security' does not normally
(and did not here) distinguish between passenger and driver."

   Nonetheless, the Court held in Berkemer v. McCarty
(1984)--in an opinion by Justice Marshall, normally among
the Justices most supportive of expanding the scope of the
Miranda Rule--that police need not recite Miranda warnings
before questioning a driver during a vehicle stop. (The opinion
was nearly unanimous. Justice Stevens wrote separately that
the Court should not have reached the issue. No Justice
disagreed on the merits.)

Notes, Comments, and Questions
THE PRACTICAL
CONSEQUENCES OF
THE MIRANDA RULE

The Practical Consequences
       of the Miranda Rule

Before exploring more of the Miranda doctrine--defining
"interrogation," learning what counts as a "waiver" of
Miranda rights, and so on--we pause here to consider the
practical effects of the doctrine. The Miranda Rule is now
more than 50 years old, and debate rages on straightforward
questions such as: (1) does the rule reduce the ability of police
to obtain voluntary confessions,56 (2) does it provide any real
benefits to suspects, or to society as a whole, such as by
promoting meaningful free choice and protecting the dignity
of suspects under interrogation, (3) has it affected the crime
rate?

   For example, Professor Paul Cassell has argued that Miranda
has increased the crime rate while providing no compelling
benefits to compensate.57 Challenging a perceived academic
consensus that Miranda's practical effects on crime-fighting
   THE PRACTICAL CONSEQUENCES OF THE MIRANDA RULE | 515

have been "negligible," Professor Cassell offers an empirical
analysis of the number of confessions police never obtain
because of Miranda. He includes a corresponding analysis of
lost convictions--as well as lenient plea bargains necessitated
by missing evidence. He begins with the "common sense"
premise that "[s]urely fewer persons will confess if police must
warn them of their right to silence, obtain affirmative waivers
from them, and end the interrogation if they ask for a lawyer or
for questioning to stop." He also quotes the Miranda dissent
of Justice White: "In some unknown number of cases the
Court's rule will return a killer, a rapist or other criminal to the
streets and to the environment which produced him, to repeat
his crime whenever it pleases him."

   While acknowledging that any empirical analysis must be
a "sound estimate" rather than an exact calculation, Cassell
argues that the costs are severe--well in excess of the
insignificant harms commonly imagined by scholars and
judges.58 He concludes that each year, Miranda results in tens
of thousands of "lost cases" for violent crimes, along with tens
of thousands more for property crimes. His numbers are based
on an estimated loss of 3.8 percent of convictions in serious
cases.

   Replying to Cassell, Professor Stephen Schulhofer reached
the opposite conclusion.59 After adjusting for what he
describes as Cassell's faulty data analysis and biased selection
of samples, Schulhofer concludes, "For all practical purposes,
Miranda's empirically detectable harm to law enforcement
516 | THE PRACTICAL CONSEQUENCES OF THE MIRANDA RULE

shrinks virtually to zero." Schulhofer then offers a robust
defense of Miranda's benefits, noting that "[t]o carry the day,
an alternative to Miranda not only must promise more
convictions, but also must preserve justice and respect for
constitutional values in the 99% (or perhaps only 96.2%) of
convictions that will be obtained successfully under either
regime--and in all the arrests that will not produce
convictions under either regime."60

   Noting that--according to his own analysis--police have
managed to obtain confessions under Miranda at rates similar
to those of the old days, Schulhofer confronts the question of
why then we should care about Miranda. That is, if it doesn't
reduce confessions, why bother? He replies that the Court's
goal in Miranda was not "to reduce or eliminate confessions,"
recalling that the Court explicitly established a procedure "to
ensure that confessions could continue to be elicited and
used."61 "Miranda's stated objective was not to eliminate
confessions, but to eliminate compelling pressure in the
interrogation process."62 In other words, under Miranda,
police still get confessions, but they get them by tricking
suspects (and exploiting their overconfidence) instead of by
"pressure and fear." That difference, to Schulhofer, honors
the Self-Incrimination Clause of the Fifth Amendment while
imposing "detectable social costs [that] are vanishingly
small."63

   A decade later, Professors George C. Thomas III and
Richard A. Leo reviewed "two generations of scholarship" and
   THE PRACTICAL CONSEQUENCES OF THE MIRANDA RULE | 517

concluded that Miranda has "exerted a negligible effect" on the
ability of police to obtain confessions.64 They argued, as well,
that Miranda's "practical benefits--as a procedural safeguard
against compulsion, coercion, false confessions, or any of the
pernicious interrogation techniques that the Warren Court
excoriated in the Miranda decision"--are similarly
negligible.65 They offered several potentially overlapping
explanations for their findings of negligible effects. First,
suspects know of their rights from television and elsewhere, yet
overwhelming majorities "waive their rights and thus appear
to consent to interrogation."66 (They analogized Miranda
warnings to those on cigarette packages.) Second, police have
learned to recite the Miranda warnings in a way that
encourages cooperation. Third, Supreme Court decisions have
limited the effects of the Miranda Rule (for example, by
making it easy for prosecutors to demonstrate "waiver").
Indeed, police and prosecutors now largely support Miranda
and report that it does not interfere with their work.

   The broad consensus is that Miranda is not a serious
impediment to policework, meaning that suspects regularly
confess to serious crimes despite being explicitly informed (1)
that they need not do so and (2) that doing so could cause
them harm in court. Students interested in how police obtain
confessions should see an article titled Ordinary Police
Interrogation in the United States: The Destruction of
Meaning and Persons: A Psychoanalytic-Ethical
Investigation.67 The authors describe a suspect who falsely
518 | THE PRACTICAL CONSEQUENCES OF THE MIRANDA RULE

confessed to murdering his sister. The interrogation was
videotaped, allowing analysis of how an innocent person
(conclusive evidence of his innocence was later discovered) was
pressured to confess by lawful police tactics. The authors
argue, "The goal of interrogation is not to gather information.
It is to obtain confessions."68 That is, once police decide
during an investigation who they believe committed the crime,
the purpose of interrogation is to get the admissions needed to
convict the suspect.

   One author attended a training seminar for police
interrogators, learning techniques such as how to "evade
informing suspects of their rights during interrogation by
giving suspects the impression that they have been arrested
without in fact placing them under arrest." He reports, "Reid
seminar attendees are told to walk into interviews with thick
folders, videocassettes, or similar props spilling out to make
subjects believe interrogators have evidence against them."
After describing several other techniques effective against the
innocent and guilty alike, the authors state, "The interrogator,
armed and trained with these powerful rhetorical tools
developed and refined over seventy years of systematic study
and placed in the position of power and authority over the
suspect, not surprisingly often extracts admissions of criminal
conduct. But such admissions do not end the
interrogation."69 Because police prefer confessions that match
other evidence, interrogators follow the initial admissions with
   THE PRACTICAL CONSEQUENCES OF THE MIRANDA RULE | 519

leading questions designed to conform the suspect's story to
what is already known about a crime.

   A discussion of best practices for interrogations is beyond
the scope of this chapter. It will suffice to state that if
questioners seek to learn the truth during questioning--as
opposed to confirming existing beliefs and obtaining evidence
for trial--the process described in Ordinary Police
Interrogation would be avoided.70

   Regardless of one's views on the ultimate practical effects
of Miranda, one cannot deny that Supreme Court doctrine
affects the number of confessions admitted as evidence against
defendants. In our next chapter, we review how the Court has
defined "interrogation" under Miranda.

(2010)

              Supreme Court of the United States

Mary Berghuis v. Van Chester
              Thomkins

              Decided June 1, 2010 - 560 U.S. 370
   Justice KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court.
   ***

                       I

                         A

On January 10, 2000, a shooting occurred outside a mall in
Southfield, Michigan. Among the victims was Samuel Morris,
who died from multiple gunshot wounds. The other victim,
Frederick France, recovered from his injuries and later testified.
524 | BERGHUIS V. THOMKINS (2010)

Thompkins, who was a suspect, fled. About one year later he
was found in Ohio and arrested there.

   Two Southfield police officers traveled to Ohio to
interrogate Thompkins, then awaiting transfer to Michigan.
The interrogation began around 1:30 p.m. and lasted about
three hours. The interrogation was conducted in a room that
was 8 by 10 feet, and Thompkins sat in a chair that resembled a
school desk (it had an arm on it that swings around to provide
a surface to write on). At the beginning of the interrogation,
one of the officers, Detective Helgert, presented Thompkins
with a form derived from the Miranda rule. It stated:

   "NOTIFICATION OF CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS
AND STATEMENT

   "1. You have the right to remain silent.
   "2. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a
court of law.
   "3. You have a right to talk to a lawyer before answering any
questions and you have the right to have a lawyer present with
you while you are answering any questions.
   "4. If you cannot afford to hire a lawyer, one will be
appointed to represent you before any questioning, if you wish
one.
   "5. You have the right to decide at any time before or during
questioning to use your right to remain silent and your right to
talk with a lawyer while you are being questioned."
   Helgert asked Thompkins to read the fifth warning out
loud. Thompkins complied. Helgert later said this was to
                                          BERGHUIS V. THOMKINS (2010) | 525

ensure that Thompkins could read, and Helgert concluded
that Thompkins understood English. Helgert then read the
other four Miranda warnings out loud and asked Thompkins
to sign the form to demonstrate that he understood his rights.
Thompkins declined to sign the form. The record contains
conflicting evidence about whether Thompkins then verbally
confirmed that he understood the rights listed on the form.

   Officers began an interrogation. At no point during the
interrogation did Thompkins say that he wanted to remain
silent, that he did not want to talk with the police, or that he
wanted an attorney. Thompkins was "[l]argely" silent during
the interrogation, which lasted about three hours. He did give
a few limited verbal responses, however, such as "yeah," "no,"
or "I don't know." And on occasion he communicated by
nodding his head. Thompkins also said that he "didn't want a
peppermint" that was offered to him by the police and that the
chair he was "sitting in was hard."

   About 2 hours and 45 minutes into the interrogation,
Helgert asked Thompkins, "Do you believe in God?"
Thompkins made eye contact with Helgert and said "Yes,"
as his eyes "well[ed] up with tears." Helgert asked, "Do you
pray to God?" Thompkins said "Yes." Helgert asked, "Do you
pray to God to forgive you for shooting that boy down?"
Thompkins answered "Yes" and looked away. Thompkins
refused to make a written confession, and the interrogation
ended about 15 minutes later.

   Thompkins was charged with first-degree murder, assault
526 | BERGHUIS V. THOMKINS (2010)

with intent to commit murder, and certain firearms-related
offenses. He moved to suppress the statements made during
the interrogation. He argued that he had invoked his Fifth
Amendment right to remain silent, requiring police to end
the interrogation at once, that he had not waived his right
to remain silent, and that his inculpatory statements were
involuntary. The trial court denied the motion.

   The jury found Thompkins guilty on all counts. He was
sentenced to life in prison without parole.

                         B

***

                      III

All concede that the warning given in this case was in full
compliance with the [Miranda] requirements. The dispute
centers on the response--or nonresponse--from the suspect.

                         A

Thompkins makes various arguments that his answers to
questions from the detectives were inadmissible. He first
contends that he "invoke[d] his privilege" to remain silent by
not saying anything for a sufficient period of time, so the
                                          BERGHUIS V. THOMKINS (2010) | 527

interrogation should have "cease[d]" before he made his
inculpatory statements.

   This argument is unpersuasive. In the context of invoking
the Miranda right to counsel, the Court [has] held that a
suspect must do so "unambiguously." If an accused makes a
statement concerning the right to counsel "that is ambiguous
or equivocal" or makes no statement, the police are not
required to end the interrogation, or ask questions to clarify
whether the accused wants to invoke his or her Miranda rights.

   The Court has not yet stated whether an invocation of the
right to remain silent can be ambiguous or equivocal, but there
is no principled reason to adopt different standards for
determining when an accused has invoked the Miranda right
to remain silent and the Miranda right to counsel. Both
protect the privilege against compulsory self-incrimination by
requiring an interrogation to cease when either right is
invoked.

   There is good reason to require an accused who wants to
invoke his or her right to remain silent to do so
unambiguously. A requirement of an unambiguous
invocation of Miranda rights results in an objective inquiry
that "avoid[s] difficulties of proof and ... provide[s] guidance
to officers" on how to proceed in the face of ambiguity. If an
ambiguous act, omission, or statement could require police
to end the interrogation, police would be required to make
difficult decisions about an accused's unclear intent and face
the consequence of suppression "if they guess wrong."
528 | BERGHUIS V. THOMKINS (2010)

Suppression of a voluntary confession in these circumstances
would place a significant burden on society's interest in
prosecuting criminal activity. Treating an ambiguous or
equivocal act, omission, or statement as an invocation of
Miranda rights "might add marginally to Miranda's goal of
dispelling the compulsion inherent in custodial
interrogation." But "as Miranda holds, full comprehension of
the rights to remain silent and request an attorney are
sufficient to dispel whatever coercion is inherent in the
interrogation process."

   Thompkins did not say that he wanted to remain silent or
that he did not want to talk with the police. Had he made
either of these simple, unambiguous statements, he would
have invoked his "`right to cut off questioning.'" Here he did
neither, so he did not invoke his right to remain silent.

                         B

We next consider whether Thompkins waived his right to
remain silent. ...

   The prosecution [] does not need to show that a waiver of
Miranda rights was express. An "implicit waiver" of the "right
to remain silent" is sufficient to admit a suspect's statement
into evidence. If the State establishes that a Miranda warning
was given and the accused made an uncoerced statement, this
showing, standing alone, is insufficient to demonstrate "a valid
waiver" of Miranda rights. The prosecution must make the
                                          BERGHUIS V. THOMKINS (2010) | 529

additional showing that the accused understood these rights.
Where the prosecution shows that a Miranda warning was
given and that it was understood by the accused, an accused's
uncoerced statement establishes an implied waiver of the right
to remain silent.

   ***
   The record in this case shows that Thompkins waived his
right to remain silent. First, there is no contention that
Thompkins did not understand his rights; and from this it
follows that he knew what he gave up when he spoke. There
was more than enough evidence in the record to conclude
that Thompkins understood his Miranda rights. Thompkins
received a written copy of the Miranda warnings; Detective
Helgert determined that Thompkins could read and
understand English; and Thompkins was given time to read
the warnings. Thompkins, furthermore, read aloud the fifth
warning, which stated that "you have the right to decide at any
time before or during questioning to use your right to remain
silent and your right to talk with a lawyer while you are being
questioned." He was thus aware that his right to remain silent
would not dissipate after a certain amount of time and that
police would have to honor his right to be silent and his right
to counsel during the whole course of interrogation. Those
rights, the warning made clear, could be asserted at any time.
Helgert, moreover, read the warnings aloud.
   Second, Thompkins' answer to Detective Helgert's
question about whether Thompkins prayed to God for
530 | BERGHUIS V. THOMKINS (2010)

forgiveness for shooting the victim is a "course of conduct
indicating waiver" of the right to remain silent. If Thompkins
wanted to remain silent, he could have said nothing in
response to Helgert's questions, or he could have
unambiguously invoked his Miranda rights and ended the
interrogation. The fact that Thompkins made a statement
about three hours after receiving a Miranda warning does not
overcome the fact that he engaged in a course of conduct
indicating waiver. Police are not required to rewarn suspects
from time to time. Thompkins' answer to Helgert's question
about praying to God for forgiveness for shooting the victim
was sufficient to show a course of conduct indicating waiver.
This is confirmed by the fact that before then Thompkins
had given sporadic answers to questions throughout the
interrogation.

   Third, there is no evidence that Thompkins' statement was
coerced. Thompkins does not claim that police threatened or
injured him during the interrogation or that he was in any way
fearful.

   ***

                         D

In sum, a suspect who has received and understood the
Miranda warnings, and has not invoked his Miranda rights,
waives the right to remain silent by making an uncoerced
statement to the police. Thompkins did not invoke his right
                                           BERGHUIS V. THOMKINS (2010) | 531

to remain silent and stop the questioning. Understanding his
rights in full, he waived his right to remain silent by making a
voluntary statement to the police. The police, moreover, were
not required to obtain a waiver of Thompkins' right to remain
silent before interrogating him. The state court's decision
rejecting Thompkins' Miranda claim was thus correct.

                      IV

[The Court held that Thomkins could not show prejudice
from ineffective assistance of counsel.]

   The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the
case is remanded with instructions to deny the petition.

   Justice SOTOMAYOR, with whom Justice STEVENS,
Justice GINSBURG, and Justice BREYER join, dissenting.

   The Court concludes today that a criminal suspect waives
his right to remain silent if, after sitting tacit and
uncommunicative through nearly three hours of police
interrogation, he utters a few one-word responses. The Court
also concludes that a suspect who wishes to guard his right
to remain silent against such a finding of "waiver" must,
counterintuitively, speak--and must do so with sufficient
precision to satisfy a clear-statement rule that construes
ambiguity in favor of the police. Both propositions mark a
substantial retreat from the protection against compelled self-
incrimination that Miranda v. Arizona has long provided
during custodial interrogation.
532 | BERGHUIS V. THOMKINS (2010)

   This Court's decisions subsequent to Miranda have
emphasized the prosecution's "heavy burden" in proving
waiver. We have also reaffirmed that a court may not presume
waiver from a suspect's silence or from the mere fact that a
confession was eventually obtained.

   Even in concluding that Miranda does not invariably
require an express waiver of the right to silence or the right to
counsel, this Court in Butler made clear that the prosecution
bears a substantial burden in establishing an implied waiver.

   It is undisputed here that Thompkins never expressly
waived his right to remain silent. His refusal to sign even an
acknowledgment that he understood his Miranda rights
evinces, if anything, an intent not to waive those rights. That
Thompkins did not make the inculpatory statements at issue
until after approximately 2 hours and 45 minutes of
interrogation serves as "strong evidence" against waiver.
Miranda and Butler expressly preclude the possibility that the
inculpatory statements themselves are sufficient to establish
waiver.

   ***
   Today's decision turns Miranda upside down. Criminal
suspects must now unambiguously invoke their right to
remain silent--which, counterintuitively, requires them to
speak. At the same time, suspects will be legally presumed
to have waived their rights even if they have given no clear
expression of their intent to do so. Those results, in my view,
find no basis in Miranda or our subsequent cases and are
                                          BERGHUIS V. THOMKINS (2010) | 533

inconsistent with the fair-trial principles on which those
precedents are grounded. Today's broad new rules are all the
more unfortunate because they are unnecessary to the
disposition of the case before us. I respectfully dissent.

PART XXV

INTERROGATIONS:
THE MIRANDA
RULE: EXCEPTIONS

The Miranda Rule: Exceptions

In Miranda v. Arizona, the Court summarized its holding as
follows: "[T]he prosecution may not use statements, whether
exculpatory or inculpatory, stemming from custodial
interrogation of the defendant unless it demonstrates the use
of procedural safeguards effective to secure the privilege
against self-incrimination." The Court then explained that
"unless other fully effective means are devised to inform
accused persons of their right of silence and to assure a
continuous opportunity to exercise it," police would be
required to provide certain information--the Miranda
warnings--to suspects.

   We have learned that this holding spawned controversy
about the meaning of "custody" and "interrogation," as well
as over when a suspect's waiver of rights has been "made
voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently."

   In this chapter, we will review three exceptions that the
536 | INTERROGATIONS: THE MIRANDA RULE: EXCEPTIONS

Court has created to the Miranda Rule. Under each of these
exceptions, a prosecutor may use statements against a
defendant even though (1) those statements were obtained
through custodial interrogation and (2) police either did not
provide the Miranda warnings or did so but did not obtain
a valid waiver. The three exceptions are known as the
"impeachment exception," the "emergency exception" (also
known as the "public safety exception"), and the "routine
booking exception." We begin with impeachment.

   In the next case, the Court articulated what is known as the
"emergency" or "public safety" exception to the Miranda Rule.
Students reading this case should consider two questions.
First, is such an exception justified? Second, if so, do the facts
presented constitute an "emergency" to which the exception
should apply?
NEW YORK V. QUARLES
(1984)

              Supreme Court of the United States

      New York v. Benjamin
               Quarles

             Decided June 12, 1984 - 467 U.S. 649

   Justice REHNQUIST delivered the opinion of the Court.
   Respondent Benjamin Quarles was charged in the New
York trial court with criminal possession of a weapon. The
trial court suppressed the gun in question, and a statement
made by respondent, because the statement was obtained by
police before they read respondent his "Miranda rights." That
ruling was affirmed on appeal through the New York Court
of Appeals. We granted certiorari and we now reverse. We
conclude that under the circumstances involved in this case,
overriding considerations of public safety justify the officer's
failure to provide Miranda warnings before he asked questions
devoted to locating the abandoned weapon.
538 | NEW YORK V. QUARLES (1984)

   On September 11, 1980, at approximately 12:30 a.m.,
Officer Frank Kraft and Officer Sal Scarring were on road
patrol in Queens, N.Y., when a young woman approached
their car. She told them that she had just been raped by a
black male, approximately six feet tall, who was wearing a black
jacket with the name "Big Ben" printed in yellow letters on the
back. She told the officers that the man had just entered an A
& P supermarket located nearby and that the man was carrying
a gun.

   The officers drove the woman to the supermarket, and
Officer Kraft entered the store while Officer Scarring radioed
for assistance. Officer Kraft quickly spotted respondent, who
matched the description given by the woman, approaching
a checkout counter. Apparently upon seeing the officer,
respondent turned and ran toward the rear of the store, and
Officer Kraft pursued him with a drawn gun. When
respondent turned the corner at the end of an aisle, Officer
Kraft lost sight of him for several seconds, and upon regaining
sight of respondent, ordered him to stop and put his hands
over his head.

   Although more than three other officers had arrived on the
scene by that time, Officer Kraft was the first to reach
respondent. He frisked him and discovered that he was
wearing a shoulder holster which was then empty. After
handcuffing him, Officer Kraft asked him where the gun was.
Respondent nodded in the direction of some empty cartons
and responded, "the gun is over there." Officer Kraft thereafter
                                           NEW YORK V. QUARLES (1984) | 539

retrieved a loaded .38-caliber revolver from one of the cartons,
formally placed respondent under arrest, and read him his
Miranda rights from a printed card. Respondent indicated
that he would be willing to answer questions without an
attorney present. Officer Kraft then asked respondent if he
owned the gun and where he had purchased it. Respondent
answered that he did own it and that he had purchased it in
Miami, Fla.

   In the subsequent prosecution of respondent for criminal
possession of a weapon, the judge excluded the statement, "the
gun is over there," and the gun because the officer had not
given respondent the warnings required by our decision in
Miranda v. Arizona before asking him where the gun was
located. The judge excluded the other statements about
respondent's ownership of the gun and the place of purchase,
as evidence tainted by the prior Miranda violation. The
Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of New York
affirmed without opinion.

   ***
   In this case we have before us no claim that respondent's
statements were actually compelled by police conduct which
overcame his will to resist. Thus the only issue before us is
whether Officer Kraft was justified in failing to make available
to respondent the procedural safeguards associated with the
privilege against compulsory self-incrimination since
Miranda.
   The New York Court of Appeals was undoubtedly correct
540 | NEW YORK V. QUARLES (1984)

in deciding that the facts of this case come within the ambit
of the Miranda decision as we have subsequently interpreted
it. We agree that respondent was in police custody because we
have noted that "the ultimate inquiry is simply whether there
is a `formal arrest or restraint on freedom of movement' of
the degree associated with a formal arrest." Here Quarles was
surrounded by at least four police officers and was handcuffed
when the questioning at issue took place. As the New York
Court of Appeals observed, there was nothing to suggest that
any of the officers were any longer concerned for their own
physical safety. The New York Court of Appeals' majority
declined to express an opinion as to whether there might be an
exception to the Miranda rule if the police had been acting to
protect the public, because the lower courts in New York had
made no factual determination that the police had acted with
that motive.

   We hold that on these facts there is a "public safety"
exception to the requirement that Miranda warnings be given
before a suspect's answers may be admitted into evidence, and
that the availability of that exception does not depend upon
the motivation of the individual officers involved. In a
kaleidoscopic situation such as the one confronting these
officers, where spontaneity rather than adherence to a police
manual is necessarily the order of the day, the application of
the exception which we recognize today should not be made
to depend on post hoc findings at a suppression hearing
concerning the subjective motivation of the arresting officer.
                                            NEW YORK V. QUARLES (1984) | 541

Undoubtedly most police officers, if placed in Officer Kraft's
position, would act out of a host of different, instinctive, and
largely unverifiable motives--their own safety, the safety of
others, and perhaps as well the desire to obtain incriminating
evidence from the suspect.

   Whatever the motivation of individual officers in such a
situation, we do not believe that the doctrinal underpinnings
of Miranda require that it be applied in all its rigor to a
situation in which police officers ask questions reasonably
prompted by a concern for the public safety.

   The police in this case, in the very act of apprehending a
suspect, were confronted with the immediate necessity of
ascertaining the whereabouts of a gun which they had every
reason to believe the suspect had just removed from his empty
holster and discarded in the supermarket. So long as the gun
was concealed somewhere in the supermarket, with its actual
whereabouts unknown, it obviously posed more than one
danger to the public safety: an accomplice might make use of
it, a customer or employee might later come upon it.

   ***
   We conclude that the need for answers to questions in a
situation posing a threat to the public safety outweighs the
need for the prophylactic rule protecting the Fifth
Amendment's privilege against self-incrimination. We decline
to place officers such as Officer Kraft in the untenable position
of having to consider, often in a matter of seconds, whether
it best serves society for them to ask the necessary questions
542 | NEW YORK V. QUARLES (1984)

without the Miranda warnings and render whatever probative
evidence they uncover inadmissible, or for them to give the
warnings in order to preserve the admissibility of evidence they
might uncover but possibly damage or destroy their ability
to obtain that evidence and neutralize the volatile situation
confronting them.

   In recognizing a narrow exception to the Miranda rule in
this case, we acknowledge that to some degree we lessen the
desirable clarity of that rule.***

   The exception which we recognize today, far from
complicating the thought processes and the on-the-scene
judgments of police officers, will simply free them to follow
their legitimate instincts when confronting situations
presenting a danger to the public safety.

   We hold that the Court of Appeals in this case erred in
excluding the statement, "the gun is over there," and the gun
because of the officer's failure to read respondent his Miranda
rights before attempting to locate the weapon. Accordingly we
hold that it also erred in excluding the subsequent statements
as illegal fruits of a Miranda violation. We therefore reverse
and remand for further proceedings not inconsistent with this
opinion.

   Justice O'CONNOR, concurring in the judgment in part
and dissenting in part.

   Today, the Court concludes that overriding considerations
of public safety justify the admission of evidence--oral
statements and a gun--secured without the benefit of
                                           NEW YORK V. QUARLES (1984) | 543

[Miranda] warnings. Were the Court writing from a clean
slate, I could agree with its holding. But Miranda is now the
law and, in my view, the Court has not provided sufficient
justification for departing from it or for blurring its now clear
strictures. Accordingly, I would require suppression of the
initial statement taken from respondent in this case. On the
other hand, nothing in Miranda or the privilege itself requires
exclusion of nontestimonial evidence derived from informal
custodial interrogation, and I therefore agree with the Court
that admission of the gun in evidence is proper.

   ***
   In my view, a "public safety" exception unnecessarily blurs
the edges of the clear line heretofore established and makes
Miranda's requirements more difficult to understand. In some
cases, police will benefit because a reviewing court will find
that an exigency excused their failure to administer the
required warnings. But in other cases, police will suffer
because, though they thought an exigency excused their
noncompliance, a reviewing court will view the "objective"
circumstances differently and require exclusion of admissions
thereby obtained.
   ***
   The Court concedes, as it must, both that respondent was
in "custody" and subject to "interrogation" and that his
statement "the gun is over there" was compelled within the
meaning of our precedent. In my view, since there is nothing
about an exigency that makes custodial interrogation any less
544 | NEW YORK V. QUARLES (1984)

compelling, a principled application of Miranda requires that
respondent's statement be suppressed.

   Justice MARSHALL, with whom Justice BRENNAN and
Justice STEVENS join, dissenting.

   The police in this case arrested a man suspected of
possessing a firearm in violation of New York law. Once the
suspect was in custody and found to be unarmed, the arresting
officer initiated an interrogation. Without being advised of
his right not to respond, the suspect incriminated himself by
locating the gun. The majority concludes that the State may
rely on this incriminating statement to convict the suspect of
possessing a weapon. I disagree. The arresting officers had no
legitimate reason to interrogate the suspect without advising
him of his rights to remain silent and to obtain assistance of
counsel. By finding on these facts justification for unconsented
interrogation, the majority abandons the clear guidelines
enunciated in Miranda v. Arizona and condemns the
American judiciary to a new era of post hoc inquiry into the
propriety of custodial interrogations. More significantly and
in direct conflict with this Court's longstanding interpretation
of the Fifth Amendment, the majority has endorsed the
introduction of coerced self-incriminating statements in
criminal prosecutions. I dissent.

   The majority's entire analysis rests on the factual
assumption that the public was at risk during Quarles'
interrogation. This assumption is completely in conflict with
the facts as found by New York's highest court. Before the
                                           NEW YORK V. QUARLES (1984) | 545

interrogation began, Quarles had been "reduced to a condition
of physical powerlessness." Contrary to the majority's
speculations, Quarles was not believed to have, nor did he
in fact have, an accomplice to come to his rescue. When the
questioning began, the arresting officers were sufficiently
confident of their safety to put away their guns. As Officer
Kraft acknowledged at the suppression hearing, "the situation
was under control." Based on Officer Kraft's own testimony,
the New York Court of Appeals found: "Nothing suggests
that any of the officers was by that time concerned for his own
physical safety." The Court of Appeals also determined that
there was no evidence that the interrogation was prompted by
the arresting officers' concern for the public's safety.

   ***
   In this case, there was convincing, indeed almost
overwhelming, evidence to support the New York court's
conclusion that Quarles' hidden weapon did not pose a risk
either to the arresting officers or to the public. The majority
ignores this evidence and sets aside the factual findings of the
New York Court of Appeals. More cynical observers might
well conclude that a state court's findings of fact "deserv[e]
a `high measure of deference,'" only when deference works
against the interests of a criminal defendant.
   ***
   ***This case is illustrative of the chaos the "public-safety"
exception will unleash. The circumstances of Quarles' arrest
have never been in dispute. After the benefit of briefing and
546 | NEW YORK V. QUARLES (1984)

oral argument, the New York Court of Appeals, as previously
noted, concluded that there was "no evidence in the record
before us that there were exigent circumstances posing a risk to
the public safety." Upon reviewing the same facts and hearing
the same arguments, a majority of this Court has come to
precisely the opposite conclusion: "So long as the gun was
concealed somewhere in the supermarket, with its actual
whereabouts unknown, it obviously posed more than one
danger to the public safety...." If after plenary review two
appellate courts so fundamentally differ over the threat to
public safety presented by the simple and uncontested facts of
this case, one must seriously question how law enforcement
officers will respond to the majority's new rule in the
confusion and haste of the real world.

   Though unfortunate, the difficulty of administering the
"public-safety" exception is not the most profound flaw in the
majority's decision. The majority has lost sight of the fact that
Miranda v. Arizona and our earlier custodial-interrogation
cases all implemented a constitutional privilege against self-
incrimination. The rules established in these cases were
designed to protect criminal defendants against prosecutions
based on coerced self-incriminating statements. The majority
today turns its back on these constitutional considerations,
and invites the government to prosecute through the use of
what necessarily are coerced statements.

   ***
   Whether society would be better off if the police warned
                                           NEW YORK V. QUARLES (1984) | 547

suspects of their rights before beginning an interrogation or
whether the advantages of giving such warnings would
outweigh their costs did not inform the Miranda decision.
On the contrary, the Miranda Court was concerned with the
proscriptions of the Fifth Amendment, and, in particular,
whether the Self-Incrimination Clause permits the
government to prosecute individuals based on statements
made in the course of custodial interrogations.

   ***The irony of the majority's decision is that the public's
safety can be perfectly well protected without abridging the
Fifth Amendment. If a bomb is about to explode or the public
is otherwise imminently imperiled, the police are free to
interrogate suspects without advising them of their
constitutional rights. Such unconsented questioning may take
place not only when police officers act on instinct but also
when higher faculties lead them to believe that advising a
suspect of his constitutional rights might decrease the
likelihood that the suspect would reveal life-saving
information. If trickery is necessary to protect the public, then
the police may trick a suspect into confessing. While the
Fourteenth Amendment sets limits on such behavior, nothing
in the Fifth Amendment or our decision in Miranda v. Arizona
proscribes this sort of emergency questioning. All the Fifth
Amendment forbids is the introduction of coerced statements
at trial.

   The majority should not be permitted to elude the
Amendment's absolute prohibition simply by calculating
548 | NEW YORK V. QUARLES (1984)

special costs that arise when the public's safety is at issue.
Indeed, were constitutional adjudication always conducted in
such an ad hoc manner, the Bill of Rights would be a most
unreliable protector of individual liberties.

       Notes, Comments, and
                Questions

In her opinion concurring in part, Justice O'Connor wrote
that she would not have excluded Quarles's gun from evidence,
even if his initial statement about the gun had been excluded
as she thought Miranda required. Because the majority in this
case found that a Miranda Rule exception applied, the Court
did not decide whether a Miranda violation could lead to the
exclusion of physical evidence found as a result of statements
obtained after interrogation. We will review how the Court
decided this issue later this semester when we turn out
attention to the exclusionary rule.

   In Justice Marshall's dissent, he writes that the majority has
permitted the use of "coerced statements" against a criminal
defendant. But if the statements were truly the result of
coercion, then the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment should bar the statements as involuntary. Indeed,
the majority opinion states, "In this case we have before us
no claim that respondent's statements were actually compelled
by police conduct which overcame his will to resist." The
disconnect between the dissent and majority opinions
                                           NEW YORK V. QUARLES (1984) | 549

illustrates a fundamental disagreement about the Miranda
doctrine. In the eyes of the dissent, statements obtained in
violation of Miranda are "coerced," and their admission
violates the Fifth Amendment. The majority, by contrast,
reasons that Miranda merely created a "presumption" that
such statements are involuntary, a presumption created by the
Court for its convenience, as well as to promote adherence
to constitutional commands. A statement that is presumed
compelled can be admitted against a defendant in appropriate
circumstances--assuming of course that no actual compulsion
is found--without offending the Self-Incrimination Clause.

PART XXVI

INTERROGATIONS:
SIXTH
AMENDMENT: THE
MASSIAH RULE

 The Sixth Amendment: The
         Massiah Doctrine

The text of the Sixth Amendment says nothing about
interrogations. But it does have at least one useful hint about
its applicability--the phrase "in all criminal prosecutions." If
there is no "prosecution," there is no Sixth Amendment. The
Court has clarified that "prosecution" is not limited to trials,
and it has also stated that mere arrest isn't enough. There must
be some sort of formal proceeding.

   The Sixth Amendment provides, "In all criminal
prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to have the
Assistance of Counsel for his defence." The Court has held
that once a defendant's right to counsel has "attached"--a
concept we will examine later--additional rules restrict
552 | INTERROGATIONS: SIXTH AMENDMENT: THE MASSIAH RULE

interrogations. These rules differ from the Miranda Rule in
important ways. For example, the Assistance of Counsel
Clause applies regardless of whether a suspect is in custody.
Further, the restrictions imposed under the Clause apply to
undercover agents as well as to interrogators whom suspects
know to be police officers.

   The cases beginning with Massiah v. United States compose
the third and final interrogation doctrine included in this
book. Students should recall that the Due Process Clauses, the
Miranda Rule, and the Massiah doctrine impose overlapping
commands that police must obey during their investigations of
crime.

  Winston Massiah v. United
                States

             Decided May 18, 1964 - 377 U.S. 201

   Mr. Justice STEWART delivered the opinion of the Court.
   ***In July a superseding indictment was returned, charging
the petitioner and a man named Colson with the same
substantive offense, and in separate counts charging the
petitioner, Colson, and others with having conspired to
possess narcotics aboard a United States vessel, and to import,
conceal, and facilitate the sale of narcotics. The petitioner,
who had retained a lawyer, pleaded not guilty and was released
on bail, along with Colson.
   A few days later, and quite without the petitioner's
knowledge, Colson decided to cooperate with the government
agents in their continuing investigation of the narcotics
554 | MASSIAH V. UNITED STATES (1964)

activities in which the petitioner, Colson, and others had
allegedly been engaged. Colson permitted an agent named
Murphy to install a Schmidt radio transmitter under the front
seat of Colson's automobile, by means of which Murphy,
equipped with an appropriate receiving device, could overhear
from some distance away conversations carried on in Colson's
car.

   On the evening of November 19, 1959, Colson and the
petitioner held a lengthy conversation while sitting in Colson's
automobile, parked on a New York street. By prearrangement
with Colson, and totally unbeknown to the petitioner, the
agent Murphy sat in a car parked out of sight down the street
and listened over the radio to the entire conversation. The
petitioner made several incriminating statements during the
course of this conversation. At the petitioner's trial these
incriminating statements were brought before the jury
through Murphy's testimony, despite the insistent objection of
defense counsel. The jury convicted the petitioner of several
related narcotics offenses, and the convictions were affirmed by
the Court of Appeals.

   ***We do not question that in this case, as in many cases,
it was entirely proper to continue an investigation of the
suspected criminal activities of the defendant and his alleged
confederates, even though the defendant had already been
indicted. All that we hold is that the defendant's own
incriminating statements, obtained by federal agents under the
                                     MASSIAH V. UNITED STATES (1964) | 555

circumstances here disclosed, could not constitutionally be
used by the prosecution as evidence against him at his trial.

   Mr. Justice WHITE, with whom Mr. Justice CLARK and
Mr. Justice HARLAN join, dissenting. [omitted]

       Notes, Comments, and
                Questions

Because under Massiah police cannot use undercover agents to
question a suspect whose right to counsel has "attached," two
suspects in the same jail can have different rules apply to them.
If one has been arrested but not yet indicted or brought before
a judge, chances are that Miranda applies to her and Massiah
does not. In that case, because undercover questioning is not
"interrogation" under Miranda, a secret informant could
freely question the suspect, with only the Due Process Clauses
regulating the tactics. A cellmate who had been indicted--or
for whom adversary proceedings had otherwise
commenced--would be protected by Massiah doctrine, which
applies regardless of whether a suspect is in custody.

   In Brewer v. Williams, the Court was forced to decide
whether to apply the Massiah doctrine in the case of a murder
of a ten-year-old child. Perhaps because the straightforward
application of the rule would lead to such an unappealing
outcome--the state's inability to punish a killer whose guilt
was seemingly in little doubt--the case caused sharp
disagreements among the Justices.

    Lou V. Brewer v. Robert
        Anthony Williams

            Decided March 23, 1977 - 430 U.S. 387

   Mr. Justice STEWART delivered the opinion of the Court.
   An Iowa trial jury found the respondent, Robert Williams,
guilty of murder. The judgment of conviction was affirmed
in the Iowa Supreme Court by a closely divided vote. In a
subsequent habeas corpus proceeding a Federal District Court
ruled that under the United States Constitution Williams is
entitled to a new trial, and a divided Court of Appeals for the
Eighth Circuit agreed. The question before us is whether the
District Court and the Court of Appeals were wrong.
                                              BREWER V. WILLIAMS (1977) | 557

                       I

On the afternoon of December 24, 1968, a 10-year-old girl
named Pamela Powers went with her family to the YMCA in
Des Moines, Iowa, to watch a wrestling tournament in which
her brother was participating. When she failed to return from
a trip to the washroom, a search for her began. The search was
unsuccessful.

   Robert Williams, who had recently escaped from a mental
hospital, was a resident of the YMCA. Soon after the girl's
disappearance Williams was seen in the YMCA lobby carrying
some clothing and a large bundle wrapped in a blanket. He
obtained help from a 14-year-old boy in opening the street
door of the YMCA and the door to his automobile parked
outside. When Williams placed the bundle in the front seat
of his car the boy "saw two legs in it and they were skinny
and white." Before anyone could see what was in the bundle
Williams drove away. His abandoned car was found the
following day in Davenport, Iowa, roughly 160 miles east of
Des Moines. A warrant was then issued in Des Moines for his
arrest on a charge of abduction.

   On the morning of December 26, a Des Moines lawyer
named Henry McKnight went to the Des Moines police
station and informed the officers present that he had just
received a long-distance call from Williams, and that he had
advised Williams to turn himself in to the Davenport police.
Williams did surrender that morning to the police in
558 | BREWER V. WILLIAMS (1977)

Davenport, and they booked him on the charge specified in the
arrest warrant and gave him the warnings required by Miranda
v. Arizona. The Davenport police then telephoned their
counterparts in Des Moines to inform them that Williams had
surrendered. McKnight, the lawyer, was still at the Des Moines
police headquarters, and Williams conversed with McKnight
on the telephone. In the presence of the Des Moines chief
of police and a police detective named Leaming, McKnight
advised Williams that Des Moines police officers would be
driving to Davenport to pick him up, that the officers would
not interrogate him or mistreat him, and that Williams was
not to talk to the officers about Pamela Powers until after
consulting with McKnight upon his return to Des Moines.
As a result of these conversations, it was agreed between
McKnight and the Des Moines police officials that Detective
Leaming and a fellow officer would drive to Davenport to pick
up Williams, that they would bring him directly back to Des
Moines, and that they would not question him during the trip.

   In the meantime Williams was arraigned before a judge in
Davenport on the outstanding arrest warrant. The judge
advised him of his Miranda rights and committed him to jail.
Before leaving the courtroom, Williams conferred with a
lawyer named Kelly, who advised him not to make any
statements until consulting with McKnight back in Des
Moines.

   Detective Leaming and his fellow officer arrived in
Davenport about noon to pick up Williams and return him to
                                              BREWER V. WILLIAMS (1977) | 559

Des Moines. Soon after their arrival they met with Williams
and Kelly, who, they understood, was acting as Williams'
lawyer. Detective Leaming repeated the Miranda warnings,
and told Williams:

   "[W]e both know that you're being represented here by Mr.
Kelly and you're being represented by Mr. McKnight in Des
Moines, and ... I want you to remember this because we'll be
visiting between here and Des Moines."

   Williams then conferred again with Kelly alone, and after
this conference Kelly reiterated to Detective Leaming that
Williams was not to be questioned about the disappearance
of Pamela Powers until after he had consulted with McKnight
back in Des Moines. When Leaming expressed some
reservations, Kelly firmly stated that the agreement with
McKnight was to be carried out that there was to be no
interrogation of Williams during the automobile journey to
Des Moines. Kelly was denied permission to ride in the police
car back to Des Moines with Williams and the two officers.

   The two detectives, with Williams in their charge, then set
out on the 160-mile drive. At no time during the trip did
Williams express a willingness to be interrogated in the absence
of an attorney. Instead, he stated several times that "[w]hen I
get to Des Moines and see Mr. McKnight, I am going to tell
you the whole story." Detective Leaming knew that Williams
was a former mental patient, and knew also that he was deeply
religious.

   The detective and his prisoner soon embarked on a wide-
560 | BREWER V. WILLIAMS (1977)

ranging conversation covering a variety of topics, including the
subject of religion. Then, not long after leaving Davenport and
reaching the interstate highway, Detective Leaming delivered
what has been referred to in the briefs and oral arguments
as the "Christian burial speech." Addressing Williams as
"Reverend," the detective said: "I want to give you something
to think about while we're traveling down the road. ... Number
one, I want you to observe the weather conditions, it's raining,
it's sleeting, it's freezing, driving is very treacherous, visibility
is poor, it's going to be dark early this evening. They are
predicting several inches of snow for tonight, and I feel that
you yourself are the only person that knows where this little
girl's body is, that you yourself have only been there once, and
if you get a snow on top of it you yourself may be unable
to find it. And, since we will be going right past the area on
the way into Des Moines, I feel that we could stop and locate
the body, that the parents of this little girl should be entitled
to a Christian burial for the little girl who was snatched away
from them on Christmas [E]ve and murdered. And I feel we
should stop and locate it on the way in rather than waiting
until morning and trying to come back out after a snow storm
and possibly not being able to find it at all."

   Williams asked Detective Leaming why he thought their
route to Des Moines would be taking them past the girl's body,
and Leaming responded that he knew the body was in the
area of Mitchellville a town they would be passing on the way
to Des Moines. Leaming then stated: "I do not want you to
                                              BREWER V. WILLIAMS (1977) | 561

answer me. I don't want to discuss it any further. Just think
about it as we're riding down the road."

   As the car approached Grinnell, a town approximately 100
miles west of Davenport, Williams asked whether the police
had found the victim's shoes. When Detective Leaming replied
that he was unsure, Williams directed the officers to a service
station where he said he had left the shoes; a search for them
proved unsuccessful. As they continued towards Des Moines,
Williams asked whether the police had found the blanket, and
directed the officers to a rest area where he said he had disposed
of the blanket. Nothing was found. The car continued towards
Des Moines, and as it approached Mitchellville, Williams said
that he would show the officers where the body was. He then
directed the police to the body of Pamela Powers.

   Williams was indicted for first-degree murder. Before trial,
his counsel moved to suppress all evidence relating to or
resulting from any statements Williams had made during the
automobile ride from Davenport to Des Moines. After an
evidentiary hearing the trial judge denied the motion. He
found that "an agreement was made between defense counsel
and the police officials to the effect that the Defendant was
not to be questioned on the return trip to Des Moines," and
that the evidence in question had been elicited from Williams
during "a critical stage in the proceedings requiring the
presence of counsel on his request." The judge ruled, however,
that Williams had "waived his right to have an attorney present
during the giving of such information."
562 | BREWER V. WILLIAMS (1977)

   ***There can be no doubt in the present case that judicial
proceedings had been initiated against Williams before the
start of the automobile ride from Davenport to Des Moines. A
warrant had been issued for his arrest, he had been arraigned
on that warrant before a judge in a Davenport courtroom, and
he had been committed by the court to confinement in jail.
The State does not contend otherwise.

   There can be no serious doubt, either, that Detective
Leaming deliberately and designedly set out to elicit
information from Williams just as surely as and perhaps more
effectively than if he had formally interrogated him. Detective
Leaming was fully aware before departing for Des Moines that
Williams was being represented in Davenport by Kelly and in
Des Moines by McKnight. Yet he purposely sought during
Williams' isolation from his lawyers to obtain as much
incriminating information as possible. Indeed, Detective
Leaming conceded as much when he testified at Williams' trial:

   "Q. In fact, Captain, whether he was a mental patient or
not, you were trying to get all the information you could
before he got to his lawyer, weren't you?

   "A. I was sure hoping to find out where that little girl was,
yes, sir.

   "Q. Well, I'll put it this way: You was [sic] hoping to get
all the information you could before Williams got back to
McKnight, weren't you?

   "A. Yes, sir."
   The state courts clearly proceeded upon the hypothesis that
                                              BREWER V. WILLIAMS (1977) | 563

Detective Leaming's "Christian burial speech" had been
tantamount to interrogation. Both courts recognized that
Williams had been entitled to the assistance of counsel at the
time he made the incriminating statements. Yet no such
constitutional protection would have come into play if there
had been no interrogation.

   The circumstances of this case are thus constitutionally
indistinguishable from those presented in Massiah v. United
States. That the incriminating statements were elicited
surreptitiously in the Massiah case, and otherwise here, is
constitutionally irrelevant. Rather, the clear rule of Massiah
is that once adversary proceedings have commenced against
an individual, he has a right to legal representation when the
government interrogates him. It thus requires no wooden or
technical application of the Massiah doctrine to conclude that
Williams was entitled to the assistance of counsel guaranteed
to him by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments.

   ***

                      IV

The crime of which Williams was convicted was senseless and
brutal, calling for swift and energetic action by the police to
apprehend the perpetrator and gather evidence with which he
could be convicted. No mission of law enforcement officials is
more important. Yet "[d]isinterested zeal for the public good
does not assure either wisdom or right in the methods it
564 | BREWER V. WILLIAMS (1977)

pursues." Although we do not lightly affirm the issuance of a
writ of habeas corpus in this case, so clear a violation of the
Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments as here occurred cannot
be condoned. The pressures on state executive and judicial
officers charged with the administration of the criminal law
are great, especially when the crime is murder and the victim
a small child. But it is precisely the predictability of those
pressures that makes imperative a resolute loyalty to the
guarantees that the Constitution extends to us all. The
judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.

   Mr. Justice MARSHALL, concurring.
   I concur wholeheartedly in my Brother STEWART's
opinion for the Court, but add these words in light of the
dissenting opinions filed today. The dissenters have, I believe,
lost sight of the fundamental constitutional backbone of our
criminal law. They seem to think that Detective Leaming's
actions were perfectly proper, indeed laudable, examples of
"good police work." In my view, good police work is
something far different from catching the criminal at any price.
It is equally important that the police, as guardians of the law,
fulfill their responsibility to obey its commands scrupulously.
For "in the end life and liberty can be as much endangered
from illegal methods used to convict those thought to be
criminals as from the actual criminals themselves."
   Mr. Justice STEVENS, concurring.
   Underlying the surface issues in this case is the question
whether a fugitive from justice can rely on his lawyer's advice
                                              BREWER V. WILLIAMS (1977) | 565

given in connection with a decision to surrender voluntarily.
The defendant placed his trust in an experienced Iowa trial
lawyer who in turn trusted the Iowa law enforcement
authorities to honor a commitment made during negotiations
which led to the apprehension of a potentially dangerous
person. Under any analysis, this was a critical stage of the
proceeding in which the participation of an independent
professional was of vital importance to the accused and to
society. At this stage as in countless others in which the law
profoundly affects the life of the individual the lawyer is the
essential medium through which the demands and
commitments of the sovereign are communicated to the
citizen. If, in the long run, we are seriously concerned about
the individual's effective representation by counsel, the State
cannot be permitted to dishonor its promise to this lawyer.

   Mr. Chief Justice BURGER, dissenting.
   The result in this case ought to be intolerable in any society
which purports to call itself an organized society. It continues
the Court by the narrowest margin on the much-criticized
course of punishing the public for the mistakes and misdeeds
of law enforcement officers, instead of punishing the officer
directly, if in fact he is guilty of wrongdoing. It mechanically
and blindly keeps reliable evidence from juries whether the
claimed constitutional violation involves gross police
misconduct or honest human error.
   Williams is guilty of the savage murder of a small child; no
member of the Court contends he is not. While in custody,
566 | BREWER V. WILLIAMS (1977)

and after no fewer than five warnings of his rights to silence
and to counsel, he led police to the concealed body of his
victim. The Court concedes Williams was not threatened or
coerced and that he spoke and acted voluntarily and with full
awareness of his constitutional rights. In the face of all this, the
Court now holds that because Williams was prompted by the
detective's statement--not interrogation but a statement--the
jury must not be told how the police found the body.

   Today's holding fulfills Judge (later Mr. Justice) Cardozo's
grim prophecy that someday some court might carry the
exclusionary rule to the absurd extent that its operative effect
would exclude evidence relating to the body of a murder
victim because of the means by which it was found.

   [Chief Justice Burger's dissent then raised two main points.
First, he argued that Williams's statements were voluntary.
Second, he urged that the exclusionary rule should not be
applied to "non-egregious police conduct."]

   Mr. Justice WHITE, with whom Mr. Justice
BLACKMUN and Mr. Justice REHNQUIST join,
dissenting.

   The respondent in this case killed a 10-year-old child. The
majority sets aside his conviction, holding that certain
statements of unquestioned reliability were unconstitutionally
obtained from him, and under the circumstances probably
makes it impossible to retry him. Because there is nothing in
the Constitution or in our previous cases which requires the
Court's action, I dissent.

       Notes, Comments, and
                Questions

Compare the outcome in Williams to Rhode Island v. Innis.
Why are the outcomes different in these cases?

   The Court in Williams took the defendant's guilt for
granted, which one can understand because Williams was seen
leaving the YMCA with a body and eventually led police to
the hidden body of the victim. Subsequent research, however,
suggests another possibility--that a different YMCA resident
killed Pamela Powers and put her body in Williams's room,
after which Williams panicked and tried to hide the evidence.
For a discussion of the facts, see Tom N. McInnis, Nix v.
Williams and the Inevitable Discovery Exception: Creation of
a Legal Safety Net, 28 St. Louis U. Pub. L. Rev. 397, 417-27
(2009). While Williams may well be guilty, his guilt is not as
obvious as the Justices seemed to believe. The title of Professor
McInnis's article refers to this case as "Nix v. Williams," the
name under which we will see the case again later in the
semester.

Flowcharts can help students visualize what they have learned.
The goal is not to memorize the example chart presented here
but instead to create a new chart that helps one to connect
material from throughout the book. Your authors recommend
that when students make their own charts, they add additional
detail, such as case names or chapter numbers. For example,
in the box asking whether a statement was "voluntary," such
as Brown v. Mississippi, which is a particularly helpful case
because its facts are so close to the line separating a voluntary
confession from an inadmissible, involuntary confession.

   This chart focuses on the Miranda Rule. A separate chart
might depict Sixth Amendment law set forth in Massiah and
related cases.

                     ----- [ Insert chart ] -----
   These charts have two primary purposes. One is that when
the charts are finished, they can serve as study aids. The other
is that the creation of the charts--even if students never review
                         INTERROGATIONS FLOWCHART EXERCISE | 569

them after finishing them--forces students to consider
material more carefully than they otherwise might, which
helps with learning and with retention of information. Also,
fellow students can help spot misunderstandings that, were
they not in a chart, would remain uncorrected. Study group
members might wish to bring charts to share with classmates.
INTERROGATIONS
REVIEW

      Interrogation Review

The Fifth and Sixth Amendments:
    Constitutional Regulation of
              Interrogation

Before moving to the next chapter, students may wish to
review what we have learned about how police interrogation
practices are regulated by constitutional law.

   Instructions: For each problem, indicate which if any
doctrines likely prohibit the conduct described. The answer
choices are: (1) Miranda Rule, (2) Massiah doctrine, (3)
voluntariness requirement, (4) multiple doctrines (indicate
which ones), and (5) none (i.e., the suspect has no good
arguments based on interrogation law presented so far in this
book). Jot down your reasoning briefly. If you are not sure,
note why.

   Each problem is independent of all other ones.
   1) Police suspect someone of dealing drugs but lack good
                                                INTERROGATIONS REVIEW | 571

evidence. Officers hide a microphone in the pocket of an
undercover agent disguised as a drug buyer. The suspect
welcomes the undercover agent into the suspect's home.
However, when the undercover agent asks about drugs, the
suspect says, "You must be confused. I don't have anything
to do with drugs." Frustrated, the agent brandishes a pistol
and shouts, "Tell me the truth or I'll shoot." The suspect says,
"Fine, fine. I sell weed. How much do you need?"

   2) A suspect has been indicted for tax evasion. Unable to
make bail, the suspect returns to jail. Police plant an
undercover agent in the suspect's cell, disguised as a fellow
inmate. The agent asks the suspect about tax evasion and
learns important details about the suspect's crimes.

   3) A suspect has been indicted for embezzlement. Released
on bail, the suspect goes home. Police send an undercover
agent to the suspect's home. (The agent is a co-conspirator
who, without the suspect's knowledge, has decided to
cooperate with prosecutors.) The agent records the suspect
describing the embezzlement scheme.

   4) A suspect has been indicted for cocaine distribution.
Released on bail, the suspect goes to a favorite public park and
begins calling friends, sharing the good news about the bail
hearing. Police have hidden a microphone on the underside
of the suspect's favorite park bench. Using that device, police
overhear the suspect tell friends about continuing illegal
activity.

   5) A suspect is arrested for robbery. While driving the
572 | INTERROGATIONS REVIEW

suspect to the police station, officers converse with one
another. One officer says, "Can you believe this guy? I can't
believe I'm stuck in a car with someone who robbed a gas
station mini mart, a boy scout troop, and a church. What a
piece of human garbage!" Impulsively, the suspect responds,
"Listen, I'm not perfect, but I definitely didn't rob any boy
scouts."
PART XXVII

INTRODUCTION TO
THE
EXCLUSIONARY
RULE

        Introduction to the
        Exclusionary Rule

In the reading assignment for the first chapter, students were
encouraged to consider two questions when reading cases:
"First, were someone's rights (usually constitutional rights)
violated? Second, if so, so what?" We have thus far focused
mostly on the first question, examining how the Court has
construed the rights guaranteed by the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth,
and Fourteenth Amendments. Yet the second question has
arisen from time to time as the Justices debated whether
certain behavior by state agents justified the exclusion of
evidence. For example, the public safety exception to the
Miranda Rule (Chapter 28) rests upon a judgment by the
Court that police efforts to manage an ongoing
574 | INTRODUCTION TO THE EXCLUSIONARY RULE

"emergency"--or, to be less dramatic, a plausible urgent threat
to public safety--are not the sort of activity that should hinder
prosecution. Similarly, the opinions in Brewer v. Williams
(Chapter 29) clashed over the propriety of excluding evidence
against an accused murderer that police obtained through
questionable interrogation techniques. Further, lurking
behind the facts and legal analysis of nearly every case included
in this book so far has been a defendant's desire to prevent
evidence from being offered by prosecutors. Recall, for
example, Terry v. Ohio (Chapter 20), in which the Court held
that police may conduct certain searches and seizures without
probable cause. John Terry did not bring his case to the
Supreme Court because of his interest in Fourth Amendment
jurisprudence; instead, he hoped that the Court might
somehow prevent the state of Ohio from sending him to
prison for carrying the concealed weapon that Officer
McFadden found when frisking Terry in Zucker's store that
Cleveland afternoon.

   Terry's desired outcome--the exclusion of evidence--is the
same as most of the parties we have seen complaining about
state action of one kind or another. Yes, there are exceptions,
such as Muehler v. Mena (2005), a lawsuit brought by a
woman not found to have committed any crime who objected
to how police treated her while executing a search warrant. She
wanted money, not a ruling about evidence. We will turn later
to the doctrine governing when money damages are available
as a remedy for constitutional harms.
                    INTRODUCTION TO THE EXCLUSIONARY RULE | 575

   For now, and for the bulk of this unit, we turn to the
"exclusionary rule," a term that covers various doctrines
through which the Court has prohibited certain uses of
unlawfully-obtained evidence.

   Underlying all debate on the exclusionary rule, one finds
two facts. Although not always explicitly acknowledged, these
facts pervade the Justices' reasoning in exclusionary rule cases.
First, when courts prevent prosecutors from using relevant,
reliable evidence against criminal defendants, courts impede
the fight against crime. One can debate the extent of the
impediment--critics of the exclusionary rule tend to imagine
higher hurdles than those described by supporters of the
doctrine. Yet no honest defender of the exclusionary rule can
deny that, in at least some cases, guilty defendants--sometimes
guilty of terrible crimes--go free because of the Court's
criminal procedure jurisprudence. In the words of Justice
Cardozo during his time on the Court of Appeals of New
York, "The criminal is to go free because the constable has
blundered."

   Second, remedies other than the exclusionary rule have not
been effective in preventing police from violating the rights
announced in Supreme Court opinions--that is, the rights
described in books like this one. Other remedies exist,
including money damages, internal police department
discipline, and oversight by elected officials. Again, one can
debate the extent of the problem. Opponents of the
exclusionary rule tend to see less police misconduct than do
576 | INTRODUCTION TO THE EXCLUSIONARY RULE

the rule's supporters, and exclusionary rule opponents tend to
have greater faith in the professionalism and goodwill of police
department leaders and the politicians to whom they report.
Yet police departments--from top leaders to officers on the
street--worry about losing evidence to the exclusionary rule
and govern their behavior, at least in part, to avoid that judicial
remedy.

   In short, the exclusionary rule promotes police conformity
with Supreme Court criminal procedure decisions, and it does
so at the cost of evidence otherwise available to convict accused
criminals. As Judge Friendly put it, "The basis for excluding
real evidence obtained by an unconstitutional search is not at
all that use of the evidence may result in unreliable factfinding.
The evidence is likely to be the most reliable that could
possibly be obtained; exclusion rather than admission creates
the danger of a verdict erroneous on the true facts. The sole
reason for exclusion is that experience has demonstrated this
to be the only effective method for deterring the police from
violating the Constitution."71

   Some might quibble with Judge Friendly's statement that
the "sole reason" for the exclusionary rule is to deter police
misconduct. For example, perhaps apart from deterrence,
exclusion is justified because courts will lose respect from the
people if they allow agents of the state to prosecute the accused
using evidence obtained illegally. That said, deterrence is the
primary justification offered by the Court, especially in recent
                   INTRODUCTION TO THE EXCLUSIONARY RULE | 577

decades. Students should consider which justifications, if any,
they find persuasive.
WEEKS V. UNITED
STATES (1914)

              Supreme Court of the United States

   Fremont Weeks v. United
                States

           Decided February 24, 1914 - 232 U.S. 383

   Mr. Justice Day delivered the opinion of the [unanimous]
court:

   ***
   The defendant was arrested by a police officer, so far as the
record shows, without warrant, at the Union Station in Kansas
City, Missouri, where he was employed by an express company.
Other police officers had gone to the house of the defendant,
and being told by a neighbor where the key was kept, found
it and entered the house. They searched the defendant's room
and took possession of various papers and articles found there,
which were afterwards turned over to the United States
marshal. Later in the same day police officers returned with the
580 | WEEKS V. UNITED STATES (1914)

marshal, who thought he might find additional evidence, and,
being admitted by someone in the house, probably a boarder,
in response to a rap, the marshal searched the defendant's
room and carried away certain letters and envelops found in
the drawer of a chiffonier. Neither the marshal nor the police
officer had a search warrant.

   [The defendant filed a petition requesting return of his
"private papers, books, and other property" and stating that
the use of his personal items at trial would violate his Fourth
and Fifth Amendment rights.]

   ***Upon the introduction of such papers during the trial,
the defendant objected on the ground that the papers had
been obtained without a search warrant, and by breaking open
his home, in violation of the 4th and 5th Amendments to
the Constitution of the United States, which objection was
overruled by the court.

   ***
   [The Court recounted the origin and history of the Fourth
Amendment.]
   The effect of the 4th Amendment is to put the courts of
the United States and Federal officials, in the exercise of their
power and authority, under limitations and restraints as to the
exercise of such power and authority, and to forever secure the
people, their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against all
unreasonable searches and seizures under the guise of law. This
protection reaches all alike, whether accused of crime or not,
and the duty of giving to it force and effect is obligatory upon
                                         WEEKS V. UNITED STATES (1914) | 581

all intrusted under our Federal system with the enforcement
of the laws. The tendency of those who execute the criminal
laws of the country to obtain conviction by means of unlawful
seizures and enforced confessions, the latter often obtained
after subjecting accused persons to unwarranted practices
destructive of rights secured by the Federal Constitution,
should find no sanction in the judgments of the courts, which
are charged at all times with the support of the Constitution,
and to which people of all conditions have a right to appeal for
the maintenance of such fundamental rights.

   ***If letters and private documents can thus be seized
and held and used in evidence against a citizen accused
of an offense, the protection of the 4th Amendment,
declaring his right to be secure against such searches
and seizures, is of no value, and, so far as those thus
placed are concerned, might as well be stricken from the
Constitution. [emphasis added by editor] The efforts of the
courts and their officials to bring the guilty to punishment,
praiseworthy as they are, are not to be aided by the sacrifice
of those great principles established by years of endeavor and
suffering which have resulted in their embodiment in the
fundamental law of the land. The United States marshal could
only have invaded the house of the accused when armed with
a warrant issued as required by the Constitution, upon sworn
information, and describing with reasonable particularity the
thing for which the search was to be made. Instead, he acted
without sanction of law, doubtless prompted by the desire to
582 | WEEKS V. UNITED STATES (1914)

bring further proof to the aid of the government, and under
color of his office undertook to make a seizure of private papers
in direct violation of the constitutional prohibition against
such action. ...To sanction such proceedings would be to
affirm by judicial decision a manifest neglect, if not an open
defiance, of the prohibitions of the Constitution, intended for
the protection of the people against such unauthorized action.

   ***
   We therefore reach the conclusion that the letters in
question were taken from the house of the accused by an
official of the United States, acting under color of his office, in
direct violation of the constitutional rights of the defendant;
that having made a seasonable application for their return,
which was heard and passed upon by the court, there was
involved in the order refusing the application a denial of the
constitutional rights of the accused, and that the court should
have restored these letters to the accused.
   ***

       Notes, Comments, and
                Questions

A few years after deciding Weeks, the Court confronted an
attempt by federal officials to avoid the new exclusionary rule.
In Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States, 251 U.S. 385
(1920), federal agents raided an office unlawfully and seized
books and records. After being ordered to return the illegally-
                                        WEEKS V. UNITED STATES (1914) | 583

gotten items, the government retained photographs and copies
of some of the documents. Government lawyers then sought
to subpoena the original documents (once again in the hands
of their owners) on the basis of information learned while the
documents were in the possession of federal agents. The Court
reacted as follows:

   "The proposition could not be presented more nakedly. It
is that although of course its seizure was an outrage which
the Government now regrets, it may study the papers before
it returns them, copy them, and then may use the knowledge
that it has gained to call upon the owners in a more regular
form to produce them; that the protection of the Constitution
covers the physical possession but not any advantages that the
Government can gain over the object of its pursuit by doing
the forbidden act."

   "The essence of a provision forbidding the acquisition of
evidence in a certain way is that not merely evidence so
acquired shall not be used before the Court but that it shall
not be used at all. Of course this does not mean that the facts
thus obtained become sacred and inaccessible. If knowledge
of them is gained from an independent source they may be
proved like any others, but the knowledge gained by the
Government's own wrong cannot be used by it in the way
proposed."

   The rule stated in Silverthorne Lumber has sometimes been
called the "fruit of the poisonous tree" doctrine. The analogy
is that if the evidence or knowledge obtained through the
584 | WEEKS V. UNITED STATES (1914)

original constitutional violation is a poisonous tree, then
evidence obtained as a result of that wrong is a poisonous
fruit which must also be excluded from evidence. The case of
Kyllo v. United States (Chapter 3) provides an example. If, as
the Court found, the thermal imaging of Kyllo's house was
an unlawful search, then a search warrant obtained by officers
who recited information learned during the illegal imaging
could not justify the subsequent police entry into the house.
The marijuana seized from Kyllo's house was poisonous fruit
of the thermal imaging.

   In the next case, the Court considered whether to apply the
rule of Weeks to state courts. The Court had already decided
that the Fourth Amendment's protections against
unreasonable searches and seizures were "incorporated"
against the states through the Fourteenth Amendment. The
issue was whether the exclusionary rule would also be imposed
on the states.
WOLF V. COLORADO
(1949)

              Supreme Court of the United States

   Wolf v. Colorado,338 U.S.
               25(1949)

   MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of
the Court.

   The precise question for consideration is this: does a
conviction by a State court for a State offense deny the "due
process of law" required by the Fourteenth Amendment, solely
because evidence that was admitted at the trial was obtained
under circumstances which would have rendered it
inadmissible in a prosecution for violation of a federal law in
a court of the United States because there deemed to be an
infraction of the Fourth Amendment as applied inWeeks v.
United States,232 U. S. 383? The Supreme Court of Colorado
has sustained convictions in which such evidence was
586 | WOLF V. COLORADO (1949)

admitted, 117 Col. 279, 187 P.2d 926; 117 Col. 321, 187 P.2d
928, and we brought the cases here. 333 U.S. 879.

   Unlike the specific requirements and restrictions placed by
the Bill of Rights (Amendments I to VIII) upon the
administration of criminal justice by federal authority, the
Fourteenth Amendment did not subject criminal justice in
the States to specific limitations. The notion that the "due
process of law" guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment is
shorthand for the first eight amendments of the Constitution,
and thereby incorporates them, has been rejected by this Court
again and again, after impressive consideration.See, e.g.,
Hurtado v. California,110 U. S. 516;Twining v. New
Jersey,211 U. S. 78;Brown v. Mississippi,297 U. S. 278;Palko
v. Connecticut,302 U. S. 319. Only the other day, the Court
reaffirmed this rejection after thorough reexamination of the
scope and function of the Due Process Clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment.Adamson v. California,332 U. S. 46.
The issue is closed.

   For purposes of ascertaining the restrictions which the Due
Process Clause imposed upon the States in the enforcement of
their criminal law, we adhere to the views expressed inPalko v.
Connecticut, supra,302 U. S. 319. That decision speaks to us
with the great weight of the authority, particularly in matters
of civil liberty, of a court that included Mr. Chief Justice
Hughes, Mr. Justice Brandeis, Mr. Justice Stone and Mr.
Justice Cardozo, to name only the dead. In rejecting the
suggestion that the Due Process Clause incorporated the
                                                WOLF V. COLORADO (1949) | 587

original Bill of Rights, Mr. Justice Cardozo reaffirmed on
behalf of that Court a different but deeper and more pervasive
conception of the Due Process Clause. This Clause exacts
from the States for the lowliest and the most outcast all that is
"implicit in the concept of ordered liberty." 302 U.S. at302 U.
S. 325.

   Due process of law thus conveys neither formal nor fixed
nor narrow requirements. It is the compendious expression for
all those rights which the courts must enforce because they are
basic to our free society. ***

   The security of one's privacy against arbitrary intrusion by
the police -- which is at the core of the Fourth Amendment --
is basic to a free society. It is therefore implicit in "the concept
of ordered liberty," and, as such, enforceable against the States
through the Due Process

   Clause. The knock at the door, whether by day or by night,
as a prelude to a search, without authority of law but solely
on the authority of the police, did not need the commentary
of recent history to be condemned as inconsistent with the
conception of human rights enshrined in the history and the
basic constitutional documents of English-speaking peoples.

   Accordingly, we have no hesitation in saying that, were a
State affirmatively to sanction such police incursion into
privacy, it would run counter to the guaranty of the
Fourteenth Amendment. But the ways of enforcing such a
basic right raise questions of a different order. How such
arbitrary conduct should be checked, what remedies against
588 | WOLF V. COLORADO (1949)

it should be afforded, the means by which the right should
be made effective, are all questions that are not to be so
dogmatically answered as to preclude the varying solutions
which spring from an allowable range of judgment on issues
not susceptible of quantitative solution.

   InWeeks v. United States, supra,this Court held that, in a
federal prosecution the Fourth Amendment barred the use of
evidence secured through an illegal search and seizure. This
ruling was made for the first time in 1914. It was not derived
from the explicit requirements of the Fourth Amendment; it
was not based on legislation expressing Congressional policy
in the enforcement of the Constitution. The decision was a
matter of judicial implication. Since then, it has been
frequently applied, and we stoutly adhere to it. But the
immediate question is whether the basic right to protection
against arbitrary intrusion by the police demands the exclusion
of logically relevant evidence obtained by an unreasonable
search and seizure because, in a federal prosecution for a
federal crime, it would be excluded. As a matter of inherent
reason, one would suppose this to be an issue as to which
men with complete devotion to the protection of the right
of privacy might give different answers. When we find that,
in fact, most of the English-speaking world does not regard
as vital to such protection the exclusion of evidence thus
obtained, we must hesitate to treat this remedy as an essential
ingredient of the right. The contrariety of views of the States
is particularly impressive in view of the careful reconsideration
                                               WOLF V. COLORADO (1949) | 589

which they have given the problem in the light of
theWeeksdecision.

   "I. Before theWeeksdecision, 27 States had passed on the
admissibility of evidence obtained by unlawful search and
seizure."

   " (a) Of these, 26 States opposed theWeeksdoctrine....
   " (b) Of these, 1 State anticipated theWeeksdoctrine....
   "II. Since theWeeksdecision, 47 States all told have passed
on theWeeksdoctrine....
   " (a) Of these, 20 passed on it for the first time."...
   "~ (1) Of the foregoing States, 6 followed
theWeeksdoctrine....
   "~ (2) Of the foregoing States, 14 rejected
theWeeksdoctrine. ...
   " (b) Of these, 26 States reviewed prior decisions contrary to
theWeeksdoctrine."...
   "~ (1) Of these, 10 States have followedWeeks, overruling or
distinguishing their prior decisions. ...
   "~ (2) Of these, 16 States adhered to their prior decisions
againstWeeks....
   " (c) Of these, 1 State repudiated its prior formulation of
theWeeksdoctrine....
   "III. As of today, 31 States reject theWeeksdoctrine, 16
States are in agreement with it....
   "IV. Of 10 jurisdictions within the United Kingdom and
the British Commonwealth of Nations which have passed on
590 | WOLF V. COLORADO (1949)

the question, none has held evidence obtained by illegal search
and seizure inadmissible....

   The jurisdictions which have rejected theWeeksdoctrine
have not left the right to privacy without other means of
protection. Indeed, the exclusion of evidence is a remedy
which directly serves only to protect those upon whose person
or premises something incriminating has been found. We
cannot, therefore, regard it as a departure from basic standards
to remand such persons, together with those who emerge
scatheless from a search, to the remedies of private action and
such protection as the internal discipline of the police, under
the eyes of an alert public opinion, may afford. Granting that,
in practice the exclusion of evidence may be an effective way
of deterring unreasonable searches, it is not for this Court to
condemn as falling below the minimal standards assured by
the Due Process Clause a State's reliance upon other methods
which, if consistently enforced, would be equally effective.
Weighty testimony against such an insistence on our own view
is furnished by the opinion of Mr. Justice (then Judge)
Cardozo inPeople v. Defore,242 N.Y. 13, 150 N.E. 585. We
cannot brush aside the experience of States which deem the
incidence of such conduct by the police too slight to call for a
deterrent remedy not by way of disciplinary measures, but by
overriding the relevant rules of evidence. There are, moreover,
reasons for excluding evidence unreasonably obtained by the
federal police which are less compelling in the case of police
under State or local authority. The public opinion of a
                                                WOLF V. COLORADO (1949) | 591

community can far more effectively be exerted against
oppressive conduct on the part of police directly responsible
to the community itself than can local opinion, sporadically
aroused, be brought to bear upon remote authority pervasively
exerted throughout the country.

   We hold, therefore, that, in a prosecution in a State court for
a State crime, the Fourteenth Amendment does not forbid the
admission of evidence obtained by an unreasonable search and
seizure. ***
ROCHIN V. CALIFORNIA
(1952)

              Supreme Court of the United States

 Rochin v. California, 342 U.S.
              165 (1952)

   MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of
the Court.

   Having "some information that [the petitioner here] was
selling narcotics," three deputy sheriffs of the County of Los
Angeles, on the morning of July 1, 1949, made for the two-
story dwelling house in which Rochin lived with his mother,
common law wife, brothers and sisters. Finding the outside
door open, they entered and then forced open the door to
Rochin's room on the second floor. Inside they found
petitioner sitting partly dressed on the side of the bed, upon
which his wife was lying. On a "night stand" beside the bed,
the deputies spied two capsules. When asked "Whose stuff is
this?", Rochin seized the capsules and put them in his mouth.
                                            ROCHIN V. CALIFORNIA (1952) | 593

A struggle ensued in the course of which the three officers
"jumped upon him" and attempted to extract the capsules.
The force they applied proved unavailing against Rochin's
resistance. He was handcuffed and taken to a hospital. At the
direction of one of the officers, a doctor forced an emetic
solution through a tube into Rochin's stomach against his
will. This "stomach pumping" produced vomiting. In the
vomited matter were found two capsules which proved to
contain morphine.

   Rochin was brought to trial before a California Superior
Court, sitting without a jury, on the charge of possessing "a
preparation of morphine" in violation of the California
Health and Safety Code 1947, § 11500. Rochin was convicted
and sentenced to sixty days' imprisonment. The chief evidence
against him was the two capsules. They were admitted over
petitioner's objection, although the means of obtaining them
was frankly set forth in the testimony by one of the deputies,
substantially as here narrated.

   On appeal, the District Court of Appeal affirmed the
conviction, despite the finding that the officers "were guilty of
unlawfully breaking into and entering defendant's room, and
were guilty of unlawfully assaulting and battering defendant
while in the room," and "were guilty of unlawfully assaulting,
battering, torturing and falsely imprisoning the defendant at
the alleged hospital."101 Cal. App. 2d 140, 143, 225 P.2d 1,
3. One of the three judges, while finding that "the record in
this case reveals a shocking series of violations of constitutional
594 | ROCHIN V. CALIFORNIA (1952)

rights", concurred only because he felt bound by decisions
of his Supreme Court. These, he asserted, "have been looked
upon by law enforcement officers as an encouragement, if not
an invitation, to the commission of such lawless acts."***

   The vague contours of the Due Process Clause do not leave
judges at large. We may not draw on our merely personal and
private notions and disregard the limits that bind judges in
their judicial function. Even though the concept of due
process of law is not final and fixed, these limits are derived
from considerations that are fused in the whole nature of or
judicial process.SeeCardozo, The Nature of the Judicial
Process; The Growth of the Law; The Paradoxes of Legal
Science. These are considerations deeply rooted in reason and
in the compelling traditions of the legal profession. The Due
Process Clause places upon this Court the duty of exercising
a judgment, within the narrow confines of judicial power in
reviewing State convictions, upon interests of society pushing
in opposite directions.

   ***
   Applying these general considerations to the circumstances
of the present case, we are compelled to conclude that the
proceedings by which this conviction was obtained do more
than offend some fastidious squeamishness or private
sentimentalism about combatting crime too energetically. This
is conduct that shocks the conscience. Illegally breaking into
the privacy of the petitioner, the struggle to open his mouth
and remove what was there, the forcible extraction of his
                                            ROCHIN V. CALIFORNIA (1952) | 595

stomach's contents -- this course of proceeding by agents of
government to obtain evidence is bound to offend even
hardened sensibilities. They are methods too close to the rack
and the screw to permit of constitutional differentiation.

   ***On the facts of this case, the conviction of the petitioner
has been obtained by methods that offend the Due Process
Clause. The judgment below must be reversed.

   Reversed.
   MR. JUSTICE BLACK, concurring.
   Adamson v. California,332 U. S. 46,332 U. S. 68-123, sets
out reasons for my belief that state, as well as federal, courts
and law enforcement officers must obey the Fifth
Amendment's command that "No person . . . shall be
compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself."
I think a person is compelled to be a witness against himself
not only when he is compelled to testify, but also when as
here, incriminating evidence is forcibly taken from him by
a contrivance of modern science.... California convicted this
petitioner by using against him evidence obtained in this
manner, and I agree with MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS that the
case should be reversed on this ground.
   In the view of a majority of the Court, however, the Fifth
Amendment imposes no restraint of any kind on the states.
They nevertheless hold that California's use of this evidence
violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment. Since they hold as I do in this case, I regret my
inability to accept their interpretation without protest. But
596 | ROCHIN V. CALIFORNIA (1952)

I believe that faithful adherence to the specific guarantees in
the Bill of Rights insures a more permanent protection of
individual liberty than that which can be afforded by the
nebulous standards stated by the majority.

MAPP V. OHIO (1961)

              Supreme Court of the United States

      Dollree Mapp v. Ohio

             Decided June 19, 1961 - 367 U.S. 643

   Mr. Justice CLARK delivered the opinion of the Court.
   Appellant stands convicted of knowingly having had in her
possession and under her control certain lewd and lascivious
books, pictures, and photographs in violation of § 2905.34
of Ohio's Revised Code. As officially stated in the syllabus
to its opinion, the Supreme Court of Ohio found that her
conviction was valid though "based primarily upon the
introduction in evidence of lewd and lascivious books and
pictures unlawfully seized during an unlawful search of
defendant's home ...."
   On May 23, 1957, three Cleveland police officers arrived at
appellant's residence in that city pursuant to information that
"a person [was] hiding out in the home, who was wanted for
questioning in connection with a recent bombing, and that
there was a large amount of [gambling] paraphernalia being
598 | MAPP V. OHIO (1961)

hidden in the home." Miss Mapp and her daughter by a former
marriage lived on the top floor of the two-family dwelling.
Upon their arrival at that house, the officers knocked on the
door and demanded entrance but appellant, after telephoning
her attorney, refused to admit them without a search warrant.
They advised their headquarters of the situation and
undertook a surveillance of the house.

   The officers again sought entrance some three hours later
when four or more additional officers arrived on the scene.
When Miss Mapp did not come to the door immediately, at
least one of the several doors to the house was forcibly opened
and the policemen gained admittance. Meanwhile Miss
Mapp's attorney arrived, but the officers, having secured their
own entry, and continuing in their defiance of the law, would
permit him neither to see Miss Mapp nor to enter the house.
It appears that Miss Mapp was halfway down the stairs from
the upper floor to the front door when the officers, in this
highhanded manner, broke into the hall. She demanded to
see the search warrant. A paper, claimed to be a warrant, was
held up by one of the officers. She grabbed the "warrant" and
placed it in her bosom. A struggle ensued in which the officers
recovered the piece of paper and as a result of which they
handcuffed appellant because she had been "belligerent" in
resisting their official rescue of the "warrant" from her person.
Running roughshod over appellant, a policeman "grabbed"
her, "twisted [her] hand," and she "yelled [and] pleaded with
him" because "it was hurting." Appellant, in handcuffs, was
                                                         MAPP V. OHIO (1961) | 599

then forcibly taken upstairs to her bedroom where the officers
searched a dresser, a chest of drawers, a closet and some
suitcases. They also looked into a photo album and through
personal papers belonging to the appellant. The search spread
to the rest of the second floor including the child's bedroom,
the living room, the kitchen and a dinette. The basement of
the building and a trunk found therein were also searched. The
obscene materials for possession of which she was ultimately
convicted were discovered in the course of that widespread
search.

   At the trial no search warrant was produced by the
prosecution, nor was the failure to produce one explained or
accounted for. At best, "There is, in the record, considerable
doubt as to whether there ever was any warrant for the search
of defendant's home." The Ohio Supreme Court believed a
"reasonable argument" could be made that the conviction
should be reversed "because the `methods' employed to obtain
the [evidence] were such as to `offend "a sense of justice,"'" but
the court found determinative the fact that the evidence had
not been taken "from defendant's person by the use of brutal
or offensive physical force against defendant."

   The State says that even if the search were made without
authority, or otherwise unreasonably, it is not prevented from
using the unconstitutionally seized evidence at trial, citing
Wolf v. People of State of Colorado, 338 U.S. 25 (1949), in
which this Court did indeed hold "that in a prosecution in
a State court for a State crime the Fourteenth Amendment
600 | MAPP V. OHIO (1961)

does not forbid the admission of evidence obtained by an
unreasonable search and seizure." On this appeal, it is urged
once again that we review that holding.

                       I

[T]he Court in [Weeks v. United States] clearly stated that use
of [] seized evidence involved "a denial of the constitutional
rights of the accused." Thus, in the year 1914, in the Weeks
case, this Court "for the first time" held that "in a federal
prosecution the Fourth Amendment barred the use of
evidence secured through an illegal search and seizure." This
Court has ever since required of federal law officers a strict
adherence to that command which this Court has held to be a
clear, specific, and constitutionally required--even if judicially
implied--deterrent safeguard without insistence upon which
the Fourth Amendment would have been reduced to "a form
of words." It meant, quite simply, that "conviction by means
of unlawful seizures and enforced confessions ... should find
no sanction in the judgments of the courts ...," and that such
evidence "shall not be used at all."

   There are in the cases of this Court some passing references
to the Weeks rule as being one of evidence. But the plain and
unequivocal language of Weeks--and its later paraphrase in
Wolf--to the effect that the Weeks rule is of constitutional
origin, remains entirely undisturbed.
                                                          MAPP V. OHIO (1961) | 601

                       II

In 1949, 35 years after Weeks was announced, this Court, in
Wolf v. People of State of Colorado, again for the first time,
discussed the effect of the Fourth Amendment upon the States
through the operation of the Due Process Clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment. It said:

   "[W]e have no hesitation in saying that were a State
affirmatively to sanction such police incursion into privacy
it would run counter to the guaranty of the Fourteenth
Amendment."

   Nevertheless, after declaring that the "security of one's
privacy against arbitrary intrusion by the police" is "implicit in
`the concept of ordered liberty' and as such enforceable against
the States through the Due Process Clause" and announcing
that it "stoutly adhere[d]" to the Weeks decision, the Court
decided that the Weeks exclusionary rule would not then be
imposed upon the States as "an essential ingredient of the
right." The Court's reasons ... were bottomed on factual
considerations.

   While they are not basically relevant to a decision that the
exclusionary rule is an essential ingredient of the Fourth
Amendment as the right it embodies is vouchsafed against the
States by the Due Process Clause, we will consider the current
validity of the factual grounds upon which Wolf was based.

   The Court in Wolf first stated that "[t]he contrariety of
views of the States" on the adoption of the exclusionary rule
602 | MAPP V. OHIO (1961)

of Weeks was "particularly impressive"; and, in this connection
that it could not "brush aside the experience of States which
deem the incidence of such conduct by the police too slight
to call for a deterrent remedy ... by overriding the [States']
relevant rules of evidence." While in 1949, prior to the Wolf
case, almost two-thirds of the States were opposed to the use
of the exclusionary rule, now, despite the Wolf case, more than
half of those since passing upon it, by their own legislative or
judicial decision, have wholly or partly adopted or adhered to
the Weeks rule. Significantly, among those now following the
rule is California, which, according to its highest court, was
"compelled to reach that conclusion because other remedies
have completely failed to secure compliance with the
constitutional provisions ...." In connection with this
California case, we note that the second basis elaborated in
Wolf in support of its failure to enforce the exclusionary
doctrine against the States was that "other means of
protection" have been afforded "the right to privacy." The
experience of California that such other remedies have been
worthless and futile is buttressed by the experience of other
States. The obvious futility of relegating the Fourth
Amendment of the protection of other remedies has,
moreover, been recognized by this Court since Wolf.

   ***
   It, therefore, plainly appears that the factual considerations
supporting the failure of the Wolf Court to include the Weeks
exclusionary rule when it recognized the enforceability of the
                                                         MAPP V. OHIO (1961) | 603

right to privacy against the States in 1949, while not basically
relevant to the constitutional consideration, could not, in any
analysis, now be deemed controlling.

                      III

Some five years after Wolf, in answer to a plea made here Term
after Term that we overturn its doctrine on applicability of the
Weeks exclusionary rule, this Court indicated that such should
not be done until the States had "adequate opportunity to
adopt or reject the [Weeks] rule."

   Today we once again examine Wolf's constitutional
documentation of the right to privacy free from unreasonable
state intrusion, and, after its dozen years on our books, are
led by it to close the only courtroom door remaining open to
evidence secured by official lawlessness in flagrant abuse of that
basic right, reserved to all persons as a specific guarantee against
that very same unlawful conduct. We hold that all evidence
obtained by searches and seizures in violation of the
Constitution is, by that same authority, inadmissible in a state
court.

                      IV

Since the Fourth Amendment's right of privacy has been
declared enforceable against the States through the Due
604 | MAPP V. OHIO (1961)

Process Clause of the Fourteenth, it is enforceable against them
by the same sanction of exclusion as is used against the Federal
Government. Were it otherwise, then just as without the
Weeks rule the assurance against unreasonable federal searches
and seizures would be "a form of words," valueless and
undeserving of mention in a perpetual charter of inestimable
human liberties, so too, without that rule the freedom from
state invasions of privacy would be so ephemeral and so neatly
severed from its conceptual nexus with the freedom from all
brutish means of coercing evidence as not to merit this Court's
high regard as a freedom "implicit in the concept of ordered
liberty." ....To hold otherwise is to grant the right but in reality
to withhold its privilege and enjoyment. Only last year the
Court itself recognized that the purpose of the exclusionary
rule "is to deter--to compel respect for the constitutional
guaranty in the only effectively available way--by removing
the incentive to disregard it."

   Indeed, we are aware of no restraint, similar to that rejected
today, conditioning the enforcement of any other basic
constitutional right. The right to privacy, no less important
than any other right carefully and particularly reserved to the
people, would stand in marked contrast to all other rights
declared as "basic to a free society." This Court has not
hesitated to enforce as strictly against the States as it does
against the Federal Government the rights of free speech and
of a free press, the rights to notice and to a fair, public trial,
including, as it does, the right not to be convicted by use of
                                                         MAPP V. OHIO (1961) | 605

a coerced confession, however logically relevant it be, and
without regard to its reliability. And nothing could be more
certain that that when a coerced confession is involved, "the
relevant rules of evidence" are overridden without regard to
"the incidence of such conduct by the police," slight or
frequent. Why should not the same rule apply to what is
tantamount to coerced testimony by way of unconstitutional
seizure of goods, papers, effect, documents, etc.?

   ***

                      V

Moreover, our holding that the exclusionary rule is an essential
part of both the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments is not
only the logical dictate of prior cases, but it also makes very
good sense. There is no war between the Constitution and
common sense. Presently, a federal prosecutor may make no
use of evidence illegally seized, but a State's attorney across
the street may, although he supposedly is operating under the
enforceable prohibitions of the same Amendment. Thus the
State, by admitting evidence unlawfully seized, serves to
encourage disobedience to the Federal Constitution which it is
bound to uphold. ***

   There are those who say, as did Justice (then Judge)
Cardozo, that under our constitutional exclusionary doctrine
"[t]he criminal is to go free because the constable has
blundered." In some cases this will undoubtedly be the result.
606 | MAPP V. OHIO (1961)

But [] "there is another consideration--the imperative of
judicial integrity." The criminal goes free, if he must, but it is
the law that sets him free. Nothing can destroy a government
more quickly than its failure to observe its own laws, or worse,
its disregard of the charter of its own existence. As Mr. Justice
Brandeis, dissenting, said in Olmstead v. United States, 277
U.S.438, 485 (1928): "Our government is the potent, the
omnipresent teacher. For good or for ill, it teaches the whole
people by its example. ... If the government becomes a
lawbreaker, it breeds contempt for law; it invites every man to
become a law unto himself; it invites anarchy." ***

   The ignoble shortcut to conviction left open to the State
tends to destroy the entire system of constitutional restraints
on which the liberties of the people rest. Having once
recognized that the right to privacy embodied in the Fourth
Amendment is enforceable against the States, and that the
right to be secure against rude invasions of privacy by state
officers is, therefore, constitutional in origin, we can no longer
permit that right to remain an empty promise. Because it is
enforceable in the same manner and to like effect as other basic
rights secured by the Due Process Clause, we can no longer
permit it to be revocable at the whim of any police officer who,
in the name of law enforcement itself, chooses to suspend its
enjoyment. Our decision, founded on reason and truth, gives
to the individual no more than that which the Constitution
guarantees him, to the police officer no less than that to which
honest law enforcement is entitled, and, to the courts, that
                                                         MAPP V. OHIO (1961) | 607

judicial integrity so necessary in the true administration of
justice.

   The judgment of the Supreme Court of Ohio is reversed
and the cause remanded for further proceedings not
inconsistent with this opinion. Reversed and remanded.

   Mr. Justice BLACK, concurring. [omitted]
   Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, concurring.
   We held in Wolf v. People of State of Colorado that the
Fourth Amendment was applicable to the States by reason of
the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. But a
majority held that the exclusionary rule of the Weeks case was
not required of the States, that they could apply such sanctions
as they chose. That position had the necessary votes to carry
the day. But with all respect it was not the voice of reason
or principle. As stated in the Weeks case, if evidence seized
in violation of the Fourth Amendment can be used against
an accused, "his right to be secure against such searches and
seizures, is of no value, and ... might as well be stricken from
the Constitution."
   When we allowed States to give constitutional sanction to
the "shabby business" of unlawful entry into a home, we did
indeed rob the Fourth Amendment of much meaningful
force. There are, of course, other theoretical remedies. One is
disciplinary action within the hierarchy of the police system,
including prosecution of the police officer for a crime. Yet,
"[s]elf-scrutiny is a lofty ideal, but its exaltation reaches new
heights if we expect a District Attorney to prosecute himself
608 | MAPP V. OHIO (1961)

or his associates for well-meaning violations of the search and
seizure clause during a raid the District Attorney or his
associates have ordered."

   The only remaining remedy, if exclusion of the evidence
is not required, is an action of trespass by the homeowner
against the offending officer. Mr. Justice Murphy showed how
onerous and difficult it would be for the citizen to maintain
that action and how meagre the relief even if the citizen
prevails. The truth is that trespass actions against officers who
make unlawful searches and seizures are mainly illusory
remedies.

   Without judicial action making the exclusionary rule
applicable to the States, Wolf v. People of State of Colorado
in practical effect reduced the guarantee against unreasonable
searches and seizures to "a dead letter."

   Memorandum of Mr. Justice STEWART.
   Agreeing fully with Part I of Mr. Justice HARLAN'S
dissenting opinion, I express no view as to the merits of the
constitutional issue which the Court today decides. I would,
however, reverse the judgment in this case, because I am
persuaded that the provision of § 2905.34 of the Ohio Revised
Code, upon which the petitioner's conviction was based, is,
in the words of Mr. Justice HARLAN, not "consistent with
the rights of free thought and expression assured against state
action by the Fourteenth Amendment."
   Mr. Justice HARLAN, whom Mr. Justice
                                                         MAPP V. OHIO (1961) | 609

FRANKFURTER and Mr. Justice WHITTAKER join,
dissenting.

   In overruling the Wolf case the Court, in my opinion, has
forgotten the sense of judicial restraint which, with due regard
for stare decisis, is one element that should enter into deciding
whether a past decision of this Court should be overruled.
Apart from that I also believe that the Wolf rule represents
sounder Constitutional doctrine than the new rule which now
replaces it.

   ***
   In this posture of things, I think it fair to say that five
members of this Court have simply "reached out" to overrule
Wolf. With all respect for the views of the majority, and
recognizing that stare decisis carries different weight in
Constitutional adjudication than it does in nonconstitutional
decision, I can perceive no justification for regarding this case
as an appropriate occasion for re-examining Wolf.
   The action of the Court finds no support in the rule that
decision of Constitutional issues should be avoided wherever
possible. For in overruling Wolf the Court, instead of passing
upon the validity of Ohio's § 2905.34, has simply chosen
between two Constitutional questions. Moreover, I submit
that it has chosen the more difficult and less appropriate of the
two questions. The Ohio statute which, as construed by the
State Supreme Court, punishes knowing possession or control
of obscene material, irrespective of the purposes of such
possession or control (with exceptions not here applicable) and
610 | MAPP V. OHIO (1961)

irrespective of whether the accused had any reasonable
opportunity to rid himself of the material after discovering
that it was obscene, surely presents a Constitutional question
which is both simpler and less far-reaching than the question
which the Court decides today. It seems to me that justice
might well have been done in this case without overturning a
decision on which the administration of criminal law in many
of the States has long justifiably relied.

   ***In my view this Court should continue to forbear from
fettering the States with an adamant rule which may embarrass
them in coping with their own peculiar problems in criminal
law enforcement.

   I do not believe that the Fourteenth Amendment empowers
this Court to mould state remedies effectuating the right to
freedom from "arbitrary intrusion by the police" to suit its
own notions of how things should be done.***

       Notes, Comments, and
                Questions

Dollree Mapp, who objected so vigorously to the search of
her home in 1957, lived until 2014.72 Her obituary reported
that after being convicted of drug possession in New York in
1971, "she pursued a series of appeals, claiming that the search
warrant used in her arrest had been wrongly issued and that the
police had targeted her because of her role in Mapp v. Ohio."

   The Justices debated two main questions in Mapp v. Ohio:
                                                          MAPP V. OHIO (1961) | 611

First, would imposing the exclusionary rule on the states be
good policy? Second, does the Court have authority under the
Constitution to impose it?

   Scholars writing under the banner of "originalism" have
argued that the Court lacked authority to hold as it did in
Mapp. See, e.g., John O. McGinnis & Michael B. Rappaport,
Reconciling Originalism and Precedent, 103 Nw. U. L. Rev.
803, 806, 850-53 (2009) ("under our theory, the Supreme
Court could appropriately discard a substantial portion of
current constitutional criminal procedure, such as the
exclusionary rule"); Stephen G. Calabresi, "Introduction," in
Originalism: A Quarter-Century of Debate (Stephen G.
Calabresi, ed. 2007), at 1, 39-40 (listing, among "good
consequences that would flow from adopting originalism,"
that "[w]e would be better off if criminals never got out of jail
because of the idiocy of the exclusionary rule"); but see Akhil
Reed Amar, "Panel on Originalism and Precedent," in id., at
210-11 ("And yet none of the supposedly originalist justices on
the Supreme Court reject the exclusionary rule. Even Justices
Scalia and Thomas exclude evidence pretty regularly, and do
not ever quite tell us why they do so when it means
abandoning the original meaning of the Fourth
Amendment.").

   In a provocative essay, Judge Guido Calabresi argues that
the exclusionary rule has perverse effects, including
encouraging false testimony by police. In particular, he
suggests that because finding a constitutional violation--such
612 | MAPP V. OHIO (1961)

as an illegal search--often requires a judge to free a dangerous
criminal, judges err on the side of finding no violation.
"Judges--politicians' claims to the contrary
notwithstanding--are not in the business of letting people
out on technicalities. If anything, judges are in the business of
keeping people who are guilty in on technicalities. ... [Judges
do] not like the idea of dangerous criminals being released
into society. This means that in any close case, a judge will
decide that the search, the seizure, or the invasion of privacy
was reasonable. That case then becomes precedent for the next
case."73 After acknowledging that alternative methods of
"controlling the police in this area simply do not work," Judge
Calabresi proposes an odd scheme by which convicted
defendants could win reduced sentences by proving after trial
that the prosecution used illegally-obtained evidence to
convict them.74

   Professor Yale Kamisar presented a more straightforward
defense of the exclusionary rule, arguing that the rule's survival
should not depend on an "empirical evaluation of its efficacy
in deterring police misconduct."75 Instead, the "imperative
of judicial integrity,"76 requires the exclusion of evidence
obtained in violation of the constitution.

   Professor Kamisar next recounted an anecdote that helped
him to appreciate the importance of Mapp, which he recalled
as having "caused much grumbling in police ranks" in
Minnesota.77 In response to the grumbling, the state's
attorney general reminded police officers that "the language of
                                                          MAPP V. OHIO (1961) | 613

the Fourth Amendment is identical to the [search and seizure
provision] of the Minnesota State Constitution" and that in
terms of substantive law--that is, what police are and are not
allowed to do--"Mapp did not alter one word of either the
state or national constitutions," nor had it reduced lawful
"police powers one iota."78 Professor Kamisar reported also
that after the attorney general's speech, "proponents of the
exclusionary rule quoted [his] remarks and made explicit what
those remarks implied: If the police feared that evidence they
were gathering in the customary manner would now be
excluded by the courts, the police must have been violating the
guarantee against unreasonable search and seizure all along."

   Professor Kamisar then recounted how a police officer
reacted to the insinuation of longstanding officer misbehavior:

   "No officer lied upon the witness stand. If you were asked
how you got your evidence you told the truth. You had broken
down a door or pried a window open ... often we picked locks.
... The Supreme Court of Minnesota sustained this time after
time. ... [The] judiciary okayed it; they knew what the facts
were."79

   In other words, Professor Kamisar wrote, the "police
departments ... reacted to the adoption of the exclusionary rule
as if the guarantees against unreasonable search and seizure had
just been written."80

   Noting that police in other jurisdictions reacted in the same
way he had observed in Minnesota, Professor Kamisar quoted
the chief of the Los Angeles Police Department, who "warned
614 | MAPP V. OHIO (1961)

that his department's `ability to prevent the commission of
crime has been greatly diminished' because henceforth his
officers would be unable to take `affirmative action' unless and
until they possessed `sufficient information to constitute
probable cause.'"81 Similarly, the commissioner of police in
New York City reported that in the wake of Mapp,
"[r]etraining sessions had to be held from the very top
administrators down to each of the thousands of foot
patrolmen and detectives engaged in the daily basic
enforcement function." These sessions covered information
not taught to the officers when they first joined the force;
the NYPD "was immediately caught up in the entire problem
of reevaluating our procedures ... and modifying, amending
and creating new policies and new instructions for the
implementation of Mapp."82

   If one takes the contemporary statements of police
department leaders at face value, Mapp inspired far greater
attention to search and seizure law than had previously existed
in police departments across the United States.

   In our next chapter, we review more recent case law. The
Court has limited the application of the exclusionary rule to
cases involving particularly egregious official misconduct. This
causes less evidence--and fewer cases--to be lost because of
judicial intervention. It also, however, decreases the deterrent
effect of the rule.
PART XXVIII

WHEN DOES THE
EXCLUSIONARY
RULE APPLY?

When Does the Exclusionary
            Rule Apply?

The exclusionary rule has lasted more than a century in federal
court and more than half a century in the courts of the states.
Time has not dulled the controversy created by the rule.
Although recent Supreme Court opinions devote relatively
little time to debating the constitutional underpinnings of the
rule, the Justices continue to argue over the rule's utility. In
particular, twenty-first century exclusionary rule cases have
contested the costs (measured in the loss of relevant, reliable
evidence) and benefits (measured in deterrence of official
misconduct, particularly the kind that violates constitutional
rights). Recent cases have narrowed the scope of the
rule--applying it to less misconduct than was covered in the
decades after Mapp v. Ohio--but have not abolished it.
Defendants retain powerful incentives to seek the exclusion of
616 | WHEN DOES THE EXCLUSIONARY RULE APPLY?

evidence, especially in cases of brazen police misconduct and
when there are clear violations of well-established rights.

   In our next case, the Court considered whether violations of
the knock-and-announce rule--covered in Chapter 7--justify
the exclusion of evidence found during a police search.
HUDSON V. MICHIGAN
(2006)

              Supreme Court of the United States

     Booker T. Hudson, Jr. v.
              Michigan

             Decided June 15, 2006 - 547 U.S. 586

   Justice SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court.
   We decide whether violation of the "knock-and-announce"
rule requires the suppression of all evidence found in the
search.

                       I

Police obtained a warrant authorizing a search for drugs and
firearms at the home of petitioner Booker Hudson. They
discovered both. Large quantities of drugs were found,
including cocaine rocks in Hudson's pocket. A loaded gun was
lodged between the cushion and armrest of the chair in which
618 | HUDSON V. MICHIGAN (2006)

he was sitting. Hudson was charged under Michigan law with
unlawful drug and firearm possession.

   This case is before us only because of the method of entry
into the house. When the police arrived to execute the warrant,
they announced their presence, but waited only a short
time--perhaps "three to five seconds"--before turning the
knob of the unlocked front door and entering Hudson's
home. Hudson moved to suppress all the inculpatory
evidence, arguing that the premature entry violated his Fourth
Amendment rights.

   ***

                       II

[It was undisputed that the entry was a knock-and-announce
violation.]

                      III

                         A

In Weeks v. United States, we adopted the federal exclusionary
rule for evidence that was unlawfully seized from a home
without a warrant in violation of the Fourth Amendment.
We began applying the same rule to the States, through the
Fourteenth Amendment, in Mapp v. Ohio.
                                             HUDSON V. MICHIGAN (2006) | 619

   Suppression of evidence, however, has always been our last
resort, not our first impulse. The exclusionary rule generates
"substantial social costs," which sometimes include setting the
guilty free and the dangerous at large. We have therefore been
"cautio[us] against expanding" it and "have repeatedly
emphasized that the rule's `costly toll' upon truth-seeking and
law enforcement objectives presents a high obstacle for those
urging [its] application." We have rejected "[i]ndiscriminate
application" of the rule and have held it to be applicable only
"where its remedial objectives are thought most efficaciously
served"--that is, "where its deterrence benefits outweigh its
`substantial social costs.'"

   ***
   One of those interests is the protection of human life and
limb, because an unannounced entry may provoke violence
in supposed self-defense by the surprised resident. Another
interest is the protection of property. Breaking a house (as
the old cases typically put it) absent an announcement would
penalize someone who "`did not know of the process, of
which, if he had notice, it is to be presumed that he would
obey it ....'" The knock-and-announce rule gives individuals
"the opportunity to comply with the law and to avoid the
destruction of property occasioned by a forcible entry." And
thirdly, the knock-and-announce rule protects those elements
of privacy and dignity that can be destroyed by a sudden
entrance. It gives residents the "opportunity to prepare
themselves for" the entry of the police. "The brief interlude
620 | HUDSON V. MICHIGAN (2006)

between announcement and entry with a warrant may be the
opportunity that an individual has to pull on clothes or get out
of bed." In other words, it assures the opportunity to collect
oneself before answering the door.

   What the knock-and-announce rule has never protected,
however, is one's interest in preventing the government from
seeing or taking evidence described in a warrant. Since the
interests that were violated in this case have nothing to do
with the seizure of the evidence, the exclusionary rule is
inapplicable.***

   Next to these "substantial social costs" we must consider the
deterrence benefits, existence of which is a necessary condition
for exclusion. (It is not, of course, a sufficient condition: "[I]t
does not follow that the Fourth Amendment requires
adoption of every proposal that might deter police
misconduct.") To begin with, the value of deterrence depends
upon the strength of the incentive to commit the forbidden
act. Viewed from this perspective, deterrence of knock-and-
announce violations is not worth a lot. Violation of the
warrant requirement sometimes produces incriminating
evidence that could not otherwise be obtained. But ignoring
knock-and-announce can realistically be expected to achieve
absolutely nothing except the prevention of destruction of
evidence and the avoidance of life-threatening resistance by
occupants of the premises--dangers which, if there is even
"reasonable suspicion" of their existence, suspend the knock-
                                             HUDSON V. MICHIGAN (2006) | 621

and-announce requirement anyway. Massive deterrence is
hardly required.

   In sum, the social costs of applying the exclusionary rule to
knock-and-announce violations are considerable; the incentive
to such violations is minimal to begin with, and the extant
deterrences against them are substantial--incomparably
greater than the factors deterring warrantless entries when
Mapp was decided. Resort to the massive remedy of
suppressing evidence of guilt is unjustified.

   For the foregoing reasons we affirm the judgment of the
Michigan Court of Appeals.

   Justice KENNEDY, concurring in part and concurring in
the judgment. [omitted]

   Justice BREYER, with whom Justice STEVENS, Justice
SOUTER, and Justice GINSBURG join, dissenting.

   In Wilson v. Arkansas (Chapter 7), a unanimous Court held
that the Fourth Amendment normally requires law
enforcement officers to knock and announce their presence
before entering a dwelling. Today's opinion holds that
evidence seized from a home following a violation of this
requirement need not be suppressed.

   As a result, the Court destroys the strongest legal incentive
to comply with the Constitution's knock-and-announce
requirement. And the Court does so without significant
support in precedent. At least I can find no such support in the
many Fourth Amendment cases the Court has decided in the
622 | HUDSON V. MICHIGAN (2006)

near century since it first set forth the exclusionary principle in
Weeks v. United States.

   Today's opinion is thus doubly troubling. It represents a
significant departure from the Court's precedents. And it
weakens, perhaps destroys, much of the practical value of the
Constitution's knock-and-announce protection.

   It is not surprising [] that after looking at virtually every
pertinent Supreme Court case decided since Weeks, I can find
no precedent that might offer the majority support for its
contrary conclusion. ***

   Neither can the majority justify its failure to respect the
need for deterrence, as set forth consistently in the Court's
prior case law, through its claim of "`substantial social
costs'"--at least if it means that those "`social costs'" are
somehow special here. The only costs it mentions are those
that typically accompany any use of the Fourth Amendment's
exclusionary principle. In fact, the "no-knock" warrants that
are provided by many States, by diminishing uncertainty, may
make application of the knock-and-announce principle less
"`cost[ly]'" on the whole than application of comparable
Fourth Amendment principles, such as determining whether
a particular warrantless search was justified by exigency. The
majority's "substantial social costs" argument is an argument
against the Fourth Amendment's exclusionary principle itself.
And it is an argument that this Court, until now, has
consistently rejected.

   The Court in Hudson v. Michigan reasoned that the police
would have found the evidence anyway (even without the
Fourth Amendment violation), and Justice Kennedy
concurred that there was no evidence of widespread knock-
and-announce violations across the land. Although the
decision answered only a fairly narrow question--the
availability of the exclusionary rule in knock-and-announce
cases--its reasoning foreshadowed a further reduction of the
scope of the exclusionary rule.

   The next cases answer the question of whether ordinary
negligence by police--if it results in a violation of
constitutional rights--is sufficient to trigger the exclusionary
rule, or if instead more culpable misconduct is required.
ARIZONA V. EVANS
(1995)

              Supreme Court of the United States

  Arizona v. Evans, 514 U.S. 1
                 (1995)

   CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST delivered the opinion of
the Court.

   This case presents the question whether evidence seized in
violation of the Fourth Amendment by an officer who acted
in reliance on a police record indicating the existence of an
outstanding arrest warrant-a record that is later determined to
be erroneous-must be suppressed by virtue of the exclusionary
rule regardless of the source of the error. The Supreme Court
of Arizona held that the exclusionary rule required
suppression of evidence even if the erroneous information
resulted from an error committed by an employee of the office
of the Clerk of Court. We disagree.

   In January 1991, Phoenix police officer Bryan Sargent
                                                  ARIZONA V. EVANS (1995) | 625

observed respondent Isaac Evans driving the wrong way on
a one-way street in front of the police station. The officer
stopped respondent and asked to see his driver's license. After
respondent told him that his license had been suspended, the
officer entered respondent's name into a computer data
terminal located in his patrol car. The computer inquiry
confirmed that respondent's license had been suspended and
also indicated that there was an outstanding misdemeanor
warrant for his arrest. Based upon the outstanding warrant,
Officer Sargent placed respondent under arrest. While being
handcuffed, respondent dropped a hand-rolled cigarette that
the officers determined smelled of marijuana. Officers
proceeded to search his car and discovered a bag of marijuana
under the passenger's seat.

   The State charged respondent with possession of marijuana.
When the police notified the Justice Court that they had
arrested him, the Justice Court discovered that the arrest
warrant previously had been quashed and so advised the
police. Respondent argued that because his arrest was based on
a warrant that had been quashed 17 days prior to his arrest, the
marijuana seized incident to the arrest should be suppressed as
the fruit of an unlawful arrest. Respondent also argued that
"[t]he `good faith' exception to the exclusionary rule [was]
inapplicable ... because it was police error, not judicial error,
which caused the invalid arrest." App. 5.

   At the suppression hearing, the Chief Clerk of the Justice
Court testified that a Justice of the Peace had issued the arrest
626 | ARIZONA V. EVANS (1995)

warrant on December 13, 1990, because respondent had failed
to appear to answer for several traffic violations. On December
19, 1990, respondent appeared before apro temJustice of the
Peace who entered a notation in respondent's file to "quash
warrant."Id.,at 13.

   The Chief Clerk also testified regarding the standard court
procedure for quashing a warrant. Under that procedure a
justice court clerk calls and informs the warrant section of the
Sheriff's Office when a warrant has been quashed. The Sheriff's
Office then removes the warrant from its computer records.
After calling the Sheriff's Office, the clerk makes a note in
the individual's file indicating the clerk who made the phone
call and the person at the Sheriff's Office to whom the clerk
spoke. The Chief Clerk testified that there was no indication
in respondent's file that a clerk had called and notified the
Sheriff's Office that his arrest warrant had been quashed. A
records clerk from the Sheriff's Office also testified that the
Sheriff's Office had no record of a telephone call informing
it that respondent's arrest warrant had been quashed.Id.,at
42-43.

   At the close of testimony, respondent argued that the
evidence obtained as a result of the arrest should be suppressed
because "the purposes of the exclusionary rule would be served
here by making the clerks for the court, or the clerk for the
Sheriff's office, whoever is responsible for this mistake, to be
more careful about making sure that warrants are removed
from the records."Id.,at 47. The trial court granted the
                                                  ARIZONA V. EVANS (1995) | 627

motion to suppress because it concluded that the State had
been at fault for failing to quash the warrant. Presumably
because it could find no "distinction between State action,
whether it happens to be the police department or not,"id.,at
52, the trial court made no factual finding as to whether the
Justice Court or Sheriff's Office was responsible for the
continued presence of the quashed warrant in the police
records.***

   Applying the reasoning ofLeonto the facts of this case, we
conclude that the decision of the Arizona Supreme Court
must be reversed. The Arizona Supreme Court determined
that it could not "support the distinction drawn ... between
clerical errors committed by law enforcement personnel and
similar mistakes by court employees," 177 Ariz., at 203, 866
P. 2d, at 871, and that "even assuming ... that responsibility
for the error rested with the justice court, it does not follow
that the exclusionary rule should be inapplicable to these
facts,"ibid.

   This holding is contrary to the reasoning ofLeon, supra;
Massachusettsv.Sheppard, supra;and,Krull, supra.If court
employees were responsible for the erroneous computer
record, the exclusion of evidence at trial would not sufficiently
deter future errors so as to warrant such a severe sanction.
First, as we noted inLeon,the exclusionary rule was historically
designed as a means of deterring police misconduct, not
mistakes by court employees. SeeLeon, supra,at 916; see
alsoKrull, supra,at 350. Second, respondent offers no evidence
628 | ARIZONA V. EVANS (1995)

that court employees are inclined to ignore or subvert the
Fourth Amendment or that lawlessness among these actors
requires application of the extreme sanction of exclusion.
SeeLeon, supra,at 916, and n. 14; see alsoKrull, supra,at
350-351. To the contrary, the Chief Clerk of the Justice Court
testified at the suppression hearing that this type of error
occurred once every three or four years. App. 37.

   Finally, and most important, there is no basis for believing
that application of the exclusionary rule in these circumstances
will have a significant effect on court employees responsible for
informing the police that a warrant has been quashed. Because
court clerks are not adjuncts to the law enforcement team
engaged in the often competitive enterprise of ferreting out
crime, seeJohnsonv.United States,333 U. S. 10, 14 (1948),
they have no stake in the outcome of particular criminal
prosecutions. Cf.Leon, supra,at 917;Krull, supra,at 352. The
threat of exclusion of evidence could not be expected to deter
such individuals from failing to inform police officials that
a warrant had been quashed. Cf.Leon, supra,at 917;Krull,
supra,at 352.

   If it were indeed a court clerk who was responsible for the
erroneous entry on the police computer, application of the
exclusionary rule also could not be expected to alter the
behavior of the arresting officer. ***

   The judgment of the Supreme Court of Arizona is therefore
reversed, and the case is remanded to that court for
proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
                                                  ARIZONA V. EVANS (1995) | 629

   It is so ordered.
   JUSTICE O'CONNOR, with whom JUSTICE SOUTER
and JUSTICE BREYER join, concurring.
   The evidence in this case strongly suggests that it was a
court employee's departure from established recordkeeping
procedures that caused the record of respondent's arrest
warrant to remain in the computer system after the warrant
had been quashed. Prudently, then, the Court limits itself to
the question whether a court employee's departure from such
established procedures is the kind of error to which the
exclusionary rule should apply. The Court holds that it is not
such an error, and I agree with that conclusion and join the
Court's opinion. The Court's holding reaffirms that the
exclusionary rule imposes significant costs on society's law
enforcement interests and thus should apply only where its
deterrence purposes are "most efficaciously served,"***
   JUSTICE STEVENS, dissenting.
   ***The Court seems to assume that the Fourth Amendment
and particularly the exclusionary rule, which effectuates the
Amendment's commands-has the limited purpose of deterring
police misconduct. Both the constitutional text and the
history of its adoption and interpretation identify a more
majestic conception. The Amendment protects the
fundamental "right of the people to be secure in their persons,
houses, papers, and effects," againstallofficial searches and
seizures that are unreasonable. The Amendment is a constraint
on the power of the sovereign, not merely on some of its
630 | ARIZONA V. EVANS (1995)

agents. SeeOlmsteadv.United States,277 U. S. 438, 472-479
(1928) (Brandeis, J., dissenting). The remedy for its violation
imposes costs on that sovereign, motivating it to train all of its
personnel to avoid future violations. See Stewart, The Road
toMapp v. Ohioand Beyond: The Origins, Development and
Future of the Exclusionary Rule in Search-and Seizure Cases,
83 Colum. L. Rev. 1365, 1400 (1983).

   The exclusionary rule is not fairly characterized as an
"extreme sanction,"ante,at 11 (internal quotation marks
omitted). As Justice Stewart cogently explained, the
implementation of this constitutionally mandated sanction
merely places the government in the same position as if it had
not conducted the illegal search and seizure in the first place.
Given the undisputed fact in this case that the Constitution
prohibited the warrantless arrest of respondent, there is
nothing "extreme" about the Arizona Supreme Court's
conclusion that the State should not be permitted to profit
from its negligent misconduct.

   ***
   ***[O]ne consequence of the Court's holding seems
immediately obvious. Its most serious impact will be on the
otherwise innocent citizen who is stopped for a minor traffic
infraction and is wrongfully arrested based on erroneous
information in a computer data base. I assume the police
officer who reasonably relies on the computer information
would be immune from liability in a § 1983 action. Of course,
the Court has held thatrespondeat superioris unavailable as

course, such an error led to the fortuitous detection of
respondent's unlawful possession of marijuana, and the
suppression of the fruit of the error would prevent the
prosecution of his crime. That cost, however, must be weighed
against the interest in protecting other, wholly innocent
citizens from unwarranted indignity. In my judgment, the cost

HERRING V. UNITED
STATES (2009)

              Supreme Court of the United States

     Bennie Dean Herring v.
           United States

              Decided Jan. 14, 2009 - 555 U.S. 135

   Chief Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the
Court.

   The Fourth Amendment forbids "unreasonable searches
and seizures," and this usually requires the police to have
probable cause or a warrant before making an arrest. What
if an officer reasonably believes there is an outstanding arrest
warrant, but that belief turns out to be wrong because of a
negligent bookkeeping error by another police employee? The
parties here agree that the ensuing arrest is still a violation
of the Fourth Amendment, but dispute whether contraband
found during a search incident to that arrest must be excluded
in a later prosecution.
                                     HERRING V. UNITED STATES (2009) | 633

   Our cases establish that such suppression is not an
automatic consequence of a Fourth Amendment violation.
Instead, the question turns on the culpability of the police and
the potential of exclusion to deter wrongful police conduct.
Here the error was the result of isolated negligence attenuated
from the arrest. We hold that in these circumstances the jury
should not be barred from considering all the evidence.

                       I

On July 7, 2004, Investigator Mark Anderson learned that
Bennie Dean Herring had driven to the Coffee County
Sheriff's Department to retrieve something from his
impounded truck. Herring was no stranger to law
enforcement, and Anderson asked the county's warrant clerk,
Sandy Pope, to check for any outstanding warrants for
Herring's arrest. When she found none, Anderson asked Pope
to check with Sharon Morgan, her counterpart in neighboring
Dale County. After checking Dale County's computer
database, Morgan replied that there was an active arrest
warrant for Herring's failure to appear on a felony charge.
Pope relayed the information to Anderson and asked Morgan
to fax over a copy of the warrant as confirmation. Anderson
and a deputy followed Herring as he left the impound lot,
pulled him over, and arrested him. A search incident to the
arrest revealed methamphetamine in Herring's pocket, and a
pistol (which as a felon he could not possess) in his vehicle.
634 | HERRING V. UNITED STATES (2009)

   There had, however, been a mistake about the warrant. The
Dale County sheriff's computer records are supposed to
correspond to actual arrest warrants, which the office also
maintains. But when Morgan went to the files to retrieve the
actual warrant to fax to Pope, Morgan was unable to find it.
She called a court clerk and learned that the warrant had been
recalled five months earlier. Normally when a warrant is
recalled the court clerk's office or a judge's chambers calls
Morgan, who enters the information in the sheriff's computer
database and disposes of the physical copy. For whatever
reason, the information about the recall of the warrant for
Herring did not appear in the database. Morgan immediately
called Pope to alert her to the mixup, and Pope contacted
Anderson over a secure radio. This all unfolded in 10 to 15
minutes, but Herring had already been arrested and found
with the gun and drugs, just a few hundred yards from the
sheriff's office.

   Herring was indicted in the District Court for the Middle
District of Alabama for illegally possessing the gun and drugs.
He moved to suppress the evidence on the ground that his
initial arrest had been illegal because the warrant had been
rescinded.

   ***
   In analyzing the applicability of the [exclusionary] rule, we
must consider the actions of all the police officers involved.
The Coffee County officers did nothing improper. Indeed, the
                                     HERRING V. UNITED STATES (2009) | 635

error was noticed so quickly because Coffee County requested
a faxed confirmation of the warrant.

   ***
   The fact that a Fourth Amendment violation
occurred--i.e., that a search or arrest was unreasonable--does
not necessarily mean that the exclusionary rule applies. Indeed,
exclusion "has always been our last resort, not our first
impulse," and our precedents establish important principles
that constrain application of the exclusionary rule.
   First, the exclusionary rule is not an individual right and
applies only where it "`result[s] in appreciable deterrence.'"
We have repeatedly rejected the argument that exclusion is a
necessary consequence of a Fourth Amendment violation.
Instead we have focused on the efficacy of the rule in deterring
Fourth Amendment violations in the future.
   In addition, the benefits of deterrence must outweigh the
costs. "We have never suggested that the exclusionary rule must
apply in every circumstance in which it might provide
marginal deterrence." ***
   We [have] held that a mistake made by a judicial employee
could not give rise to exclusion for three reasons: The
exclusionary rule was crafted to curb police rather than judicial
misconduct; court employees were unlikely to try to subvert
the Fourth Amendment; and "most important, there [was]
no basis for believing that application of the exclusionary rule
in [those] circumstances" would have any significant effect in
deterring the errors.
636 | HERRING V. UNITED STATES (2009)

   ***
   We do not suggest that all recordkeeping errors by the police
are immune from the exclusionary rule. In this case, however,
the conduct at issue was not so objectively culpable as to
require exclusion. If the police have been shown to be reckless
in maintaining a warrant system, or to have knowingly made
false entries to lay the groundwork for future false arrests,
exclusion would certainly be justified under our cases should
such misconduct cause a Fourth Amendment violation.
Petitioner's fears that our decision will cause police
departments to deliberately keep their officers ignorant are
thus unfounded.
   Petitioner's claim that police negligence automatically
triggers suppression cannot be squared with the principles
underlying the exclusionary rule, as they have been explained
in our cases. In light of our repeated holdings that the
deterrent effect of suppression must be substantial and
outweigh any harm to the justice system, we conclude that
when police mistakes are the result of negligence such as that
described here, rather than systemic error or reckless disregard
of constitutional requirements, any marginal deterrence does
not "pay its way." In such a case, the criminal should not "go
free because the constable has blundered." The judgment of
the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit is affirmed.
   Justice GINSBURG, with whom Justice STEVENS,
Justice SOUTER, and Justice BREYER join, dissenting.
   Petitioner Bennie Dean Herring was arrested, and subjected
                                     HERRING V. UNITED STATES (2009) | 637

to a search incident to his arrest, although no warrant was
outstanding against him, and the police lacked probable cause
to believe he was engaged in criminal activity. The arrest and
ensuing search therefore violated Herring's Fourth
Amendment right "to be secure ... against unreasonable
searches and seizures." The Court of Appeals so determined,
and the Government does not contend otherwise. The
exclusionary rule provides redress for Fourth Amendment
violations by placing the government in the position it would
have been in had there been no unconstitutional arrest and
search. The rule thus strongly encourages police compliance
with the Fourth Amendment in the future. The Court,
however, holds the rule inapplicable because careless
recordkeeping by the police--not flagrant or deliberate
misconduct--accounts for Herring's arrest.

   I would not so constrict the domain of the exclusionary rule
and would hold the rule dispositive of this case: "[I]f courts are
to have any power to discourage [police] error of [the kind here
at issue], it must be through the application of the exclusionary
rule." The unlawful search in this case was contested in court
because the police found methamphetamine in Herring's
pocket and a pistol in his truck. But the "most serious impact"
of the Court's holding will be on innocent persons
"wrongfully arrested based on erroneous information
[carelessly maintained] in a computer data base."

   The sole question presented [] is whether evidence the
police obtained through the unlawful search should have been
638 | HERRING V. UNITED STATES (2009)

suppressed. In my view, the Court's opinion underestimates
the need for a forceful exclusionary rule and the gravity of
recordkeeping errors in law enforcement.

   The Court states that the exclusionary rule is not a
defendant's right; rather, it is simply a remedy applicable only
when suppression would result in appreciable deterrence that
outweighs the cost to the justice system.

   ***
   Other [judges] have described "a more majestic conception"
of the Fourth Amendment and its adjunct, the exclusionary
rule. Protective of the fundamental "right of the people to
be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects," the
Amendment "is a constraint on the power of the sovereign,
not merely on some of its agents." I share that vision of the
Amendment.
   The exclusionary rule is "a remedy necessary to ensure that"
the Fourth Amendment's prohibitions "are observed in fact."
The rule's service as an essential auxiliary to the Amendment
earlier inclined the Court to hold the two inseparable.
   ***The exclusionary rule, it bears emphasis, is often the only
remedy effective to redress a Fourth Amendment violation.
Civil liability will not lie for "the vast majority of [F]ourth
[A]mendment violations--the frequent infringements
motivated by commendable zeal, not condemnable malice."
Criminal prosecutions or administrative sanctions against the
offending officers and injunctive relief against widespread
violations are an even farther cry.

   ***
   Inaccuracies in expansive, interconnected collections of
electronic information raise grave concerns for individual
liberty. "The offense to the dignity of the citizen who is
arrested, handcuffed, and searched on a public street simply
because some bureaucrat has failed to maintain an accurate
computer data base" is evocative of the use of general warrants
that so outraged the authors of our Bill of Rights.
   Negligent recordkeeping errors by law enforcement
threaten individual liberty, are susceptible to deterrence by the
exclusionary rule, and cannot be remedied effectively through
other means. Such errors present no occasion to further erode
the exclusionary rule. The rule "is needed to make the Fourth
Amendment something real; a guarantee that does not carry
with it the exclusion of evidence obtained by its violation is
a chimera." In keeping with the rule's "core concerns,"
suppression should have attended the unconstitutional search
in this case.
   For the reasons stated, I would reverse the judgment of the
Eleventh Circuit.
   Justice BREYER, with whom Justice SOUTER joins,
dissenting.
   I agree with Justice GINSBURG and join her dissent. I
write separately to note one additional supporting factor that
I believe important. In Arizona v. Evans, we held that
recordkeeping errors made by a court clerk do not trigger the
exclusionary rule, so long as the police reasonably relied upon
640 | HERRING V. UNITED STATES (2009)

the court clerk's recordkeeping. The rationale for our decision
was premised on a distinction between judicial errors and
police errors.

   Distinguishing between police recordkeeping errors and
judicial ones not only is consistent with our precedent, but
also is far easier for courts to administer than the Court's case-
by-case, multifactored inquiry into the degree of police
culpability. I therefore would apply the exclusionary rule when
police personnel are responsible for a recordkeeping error that
results in a Fourth Amendment violation.

       Notes, Comments, and
                Questions

Many criminal procedure issues are litigated concurrently in
multiple forums. For example, when deciding Miranda v.
Arizona, the Court also resolved additional cases presenting
the same question about custodial interrogation. Because most
cases never reach the Supreme Court, it is common for two
cases to present the same issue, for the Court to take only one
of them, and for the Court's decision of that case to resolve
the other case. For example, imagine that on the same day that
police scanned the home of Danny Lee Kyllo, other officers
conducting an unrelated investigation scanned a different
home, and the resident of that home sought exclusion of items
found during an ensuing search. If the Court decided Kyllo v.
United States (Chapter 3) while the second case was pending,
                                     HERRING V. UNITED STATES (2009) | 641

the defendant in the second case could rely upon the holding
of Kyllo. In other words, the Court's decision that thermal
imaging of a home is a "search" would apply to all pending
cases in which the issue was presented, and the judge in the
second case would know that the second defendant's home
had been "searched" for Fourth Amendment purposes.

       Notes, Comments, and
                Questions

In Byrd v. United States, 138 S. Ct. 1518 (2018), the Court
addressed whether rental car drivers who are not on a rental
agreement (for example, someone given the keys by the person
who is authorized to drive) have standing to object to a search
of the car. The Court distinguished Rakas by emphasizing
the reasonable expectation of privacy test. In Byrd, the
unauthorized driver was the only person in the car and had
a reasonable expectation of privacy in the contents of the car
sufficient to have standing.

   In Minnesota v. Olson, 495 U.S. 91 (1990), the Court
considered the "warrantless, nonconsensual entry into a house
where respondent Robert Olson was an overnight guest." The
question was whether the entry, along with Olson's
subsequent arrest, violated Olson's Fourth Amendment
rights. The Court decided yes and allowed Olson to exclude
evidence found during the illegal search and seizure. Rejecting
the state's argument that Olson had no reasonable expectation
642 | HERRING V. UNITED STATES (2009)

of privacy because the searched location was not his "home,"
the Court concluded "that Olson's status as an overnight guest
is alone enough to show that he had an expectation of privacy
in the home that society is prepared to recognize as
reasonable." The Court noted that one's expectation of
privacy while staying as an overnight guest must equal, if not
exceed, that enjoyed by a person using a telephone booth. See
Katz v. United States (Chapter 2).

       Notes, Comments, and
                Questions

Would a guest who was present for dinner or an afternoon
barbecue have standing? Why or why not? That individual
would have more connection to the home than in Carter but
less than Minnesota v. Olson.

   In Brendlin v. California, 551 U.S. 249 (2007), the Court
applied the holdings of Olson and Carter to the case of a
passenger riding in a car stopped by police. Prior precedent
made clear that a driver whose car is subjected to a traffic stop
is "seized within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment" and
could challenge the admissibility of evidence found during an
unlawful stop. The question was whether a passenger in the
same car could also exclude evidence. Quoting language from
United States v. Mendenhall (Chapter 19) stating that "a
seizure occurs if `in view of all of the circumstances
surrounding the incident, a reasonable person would have
                                     HERRING V. UNITED STATES (2009) | 643

believed that he was not free to leave,'" the Brendlin Court
found that a vehicle "stop necessarily curtails the travel a
passenger has chosen just as much as it halts the driver," and
it rejected "any notion that a [reasonable] passenger would feel
free to leave, or to terminate the personal encounter any other
way, without advance permission."

   The Court held that passengers could invoke the
exclusionary rule with respect to evidence found during
unlawful vehicle stops, noting that the opposite result would
encourage bad police behavior. "The fact that evidence
uncovered as a result of an arbitrary traffic stop would still
be admissible against any passengers would be a powerful
incentive to run the kind of `roving patrols' that would still
violate the driver's Fourth Amendment right."

   Because Brendlin argued that his rights were violated by the
unlawful stop of the car--as opposed to by the search of the
car--his claim was not barred by the rule of Rakas v. Illinois.
EXCLUSIONARY RULE:
EXCEPTIONS

         Exceptions to the
        Exclusionary Rule

Even if a criminal defendant has standing to invoke the
exclusionary rule, not all evidence found as a result of police
violating the defendant's constitutional rights will be excluded.
The following cases build upon the limitations to the
exclusionary rule described in the previous chapter.

       Notes, Comments, and
                Questions

In Nix v. Williams, 467 U.S. 431 (1984), the Court considered
once again the conviction of Robert Williams for the murder
of 10-year-old Pamela Powers, who disappeared from a YMCA
building in Des Moines, Iowa on Christmas Eve in 1968. The
case returned to the Court because after the decision in Brewer
v. Williams (Chapter 29), Iowa prosecutors retried Williams.
In the second trial, prosecutors did not offer evidence of the
                                   EXCLUSIONARY RULE: EXCEPTIONS | 645

statements Williams made during his car ride, the ones elicited
by the "Christian Burial Speech." They did, however, offer
physical evidence found as a result of Williams's statements,
including the body of Powers.

   Building on the independent source exception described in
Murray, the Nix Court created what has become known as
the "inevitable discovery" exception to the exclusionary rule.
When considering whether to adopt the new
exception--which had already been approved by several lower
courts--the Supreme Court first reviewed the justification for
the exclusionary rule:

   "The core rationale consistently advanced by this Court for
extending the exclusionary rule to evidence that is the fruit of
unlawful police conduct has been that this admittedly drastic
and socially costly course is needed to deter police from
violations of constitutional and statutory protections. This
Court has accepted the argument that the way to ensure such
protections is to exclude evidence seized as a result of such
violations notwithstanding the high social cost of letting
persons obviously guilty go unpunished for their crimes. On
this rationale, the prosecution is not to be put in a better
position than it would have been in if no illegality had
transpired."

   The Court then revisited the grounds supporting the
independent source doctrine and applied them to the slightly
different situation presented in Nix.

   "The independent source doctrine teaches us that the
646 | EXCLUSIONARY RULE: EXCEPTIONS

interest of society in deterring unlawful police conduct and the
public interest in having juries receive all probative evidence
of a crime are properly balanced by putting the police in the
same, not a worse, position that they would have been in if no
police error or misconduct had occurred. When the challenged
evidence has an independent source, exclusion of such
evidence would put the police in a worse position than they
would have been in absent any error or violation. There is
a functional similarity between these two doctrines in that
exclusion of evidence that would inevitably have been
discovered would also put the government in a worse position,
because the police would have obtained that evidence if no
misconduct had taken place. Thus, while the independent
source exception would not justify admission of evidence in
this case, its rationale is wholly consistent with and justifies our
adoption of the ultimate or inevitable discovery exception to
the exclusionary rule."

   After Powers disappeared from the YMCA, police found
some of her clothing near a rest stop in Grinell, Iowa. Next,
police "initiated a large-scale search. Two hundred volunteers
divided into teams began the search 21 miles east of Grinnell,
covering an area several miles to the north and south of
Interstate 80. They moved westward from Poweshiek County,
in which Grinnell was located, into Jasper County. Searchers
were instructed to check all roads, abandoned farm buildings,
ditches, culverts, and any other place in which the body of a
                                   EXCLUSIONARY RULE: EXCEPTIONS | 647

small child could be hidden." Before the volunteers found the
body, Williams led police to the hiding spot.

   The Court applied the new inevitable discovery rule as
follows:

   "On this record it is clear that the search parties were
approaching the actual location of the body, and we are
satisfied, along with three courts earlier, that the volunteer
search teams would have resumed the search had Williams not
earlier led the police to the body and the body inevitably would
have been found."

   In dissent, Justices Brennan and Marshall did not object
to the new doctrine in principle. They argued that for the
inevitable discovery exception to apply, the prosecution should
be required to prove by "clear and convincing evidence" that
the requirements had been met. The majority held that
"preponderance of the evidence" was sufficient.

              Supreme Court of the United States

Utah v. Edward Joseph Strieff

            Decided June 20, 2016 - 136 S. Ct. 2056

   Justice THOMAS delivered the opinion of the Court.
   To enforce the Fourth Amendment's prohibition against
"unreasonable searches and seizures," this Court has at times
required courts to exclude evidence obtained by
unconstitutional police conduct. But the Court has also held
that, even when there is a Fourth Amendment violation, this
exclusionary rule does not apply when the costs of exclusion
outweigh its deterrent benefits. In some cases, for example, the
link between the unconstitutional conduct and the discovery
of the evidence is too attenuated to justify suppression. The
question in this case is whether this attenuation doctrine
applies when an officer makes an unconstitutional
investigatory stop; learns during that stop that the suspect is
subject to a valid arrest warrant; and proceeds to arrest the
suspect and seize incriminating evidence during a search
                                                     UTAH V. STREIFF (2016) | 649

incident to that arrest. We hold that the evidence the officer
seized as part of the search incident to arrest is admissible
because the officer's discovery of the arrest warrant attenuated
the connection between the unlawful stop and the evidence
seized incident to arrest.

                       I

In December 2006, someone called the South Salt Lake City
police's drug-tip line to report "narcotics activity" at a
particular residence. Narcotics detective Douglas Fackrell
investigated the tip. Over the course of about a week, Officer
Fackrell conducted intermittent surveillance of the home. He
observed visitors who left a few minutes after arriving at the
house. These visits were sufficiently frequent to raise his
suspicion that the occupants were dealing drugs.

   One of those visitors was respondent Edward Strieff. Officer
Fackrell observed Strieff exit the house and walk toward a
nearby convenience store. In the store's parking lot, Officer
Fackrell detained Strieff, identified himself, and asked Strieff
what he was doing at the residence.

   As part of the stop, Officer Fackrell requested Strieff's
identification, and Strieff produced his Utah identification
card. Officer Fackrell relayed Strieff's information to a police
dispatcher, who reported that Strieff had an outstanding arrest
warrant for a traffic violation. Officer Fackrell then arrested
Strieff pursuant to that warrant. When Officer Fackrell
650 | UTAH V. STREIFF (2016)

searched Strieff incident to the arrest, he discovered a baggie of
methamphetamine and drug paraphernalia.

   The State charged Strieff with unlawful possession of
methamphetamine and drug paraphernalia. Strieff moved to
suppress the evidence, arguing that the evidence was
inadmissible because it was derived from an unlawful
investigatory stop. [T]he prosecutor conceded that Officer
Fackrell lacked reasonable suspicion for the stop but argued
that the evidence should not be suppressed because the
existence of a valid arrest warrant attenuated the connection
between the unlawful stop and the discovery of the
contraband.

   The trial court agreed with the State and admitted the
evidence. The court found that the short time between the
illegal stop and the search weighed in favor of suppressing the
evidence, but that two countervailing considerations made it
admissible. First, the court considered the presence of a valid
arrest warrant to be an "`extraordinary intervening
circumstance.'" Second, the court stressed the absence of
flagrant misconduct by Officer Fackrell, who was conducting a
legitimate investigation of a suspected drug house.

   Strieff conditionally pleaded guilty to reduced charges of
attempted possession of a controlled substance and possession
of drug paraphernalia, but reserved his right to appeal the trial
court's denial of the suppression motion. The Utah Court
of Appeals affirmed. The Utah Supreme Court reversed. We
granted certiorari to resolve disagreement about how the
                                                     UTAH V. STREIFF (2016) | 651

attenuation doctrine applies where an unconstitutional
detention leads to the discovery of a valid arrest warrant.

                       II

                         A

We have [] recognized several exceptions to the [exclusionary]
rule. Three of these exceptions involve the causal relationship
between the unconstitutional act and the discovery of
evidence. First, the independent source doctrine allows trial
courts to admit evidence obtained in an unlawful search if
officers independently acquired it from a separate,
independent source. Second, the inevitable discovery doctrine
allows for the admission of evidence that would have been
discovered even without the unconstitutional source. Third,
and at issue here, is the attenuation doctrine: Evidence is
admissible when the connection between unconstitutional
police conduct and the evidence is remote or has been
interrupted by some intervening circumstance, so that "the
interest protected by the constitutional guarantee that has
been violated would not be served by suppression of the
evidence obtained."

                         B

***
652 | UTAH V. STREIFF (2016)

   Officer Fackrell was at most negligent. In stopping Strieff,
Officer Fackrell made two good-faith mistakes. First, he had
not observed what time Strieff entered the suspected drug
house, so he did not know how long Strieff had been there.
Officer Fackrell thus lacked a sufficient basis to conclude that
Strieff was a short-term visitor who may have been
consummating a drug transaction. Second, because he lacked
confirmation that Strieff was a short-term visitor, Officer
Fackrell should have asked Strieff whether he would speak with
him, instead of demanding that Strieff do so. Officer Fackrell's
stated purpose was to "find out what was going on [in] the
house." Nothing prevented him from approaching Strieff
simply to ask. But these errors in judgment hardly rise to a
purposeful or flagrant violation of Strieff's Fourth
Amendment rights.

   While Officer Fackrell's decision to initiate the stop was
mistaken, his conduct thereafter was lawful. The officer's
decision to run the warrant check was a "negligibly
burdensome precautio[n]" for officer safety. And Officer
Fackrell's actual search of Strieff was a lawful search incident to
arrest.

   Moreover, there is no indication that this unlawful stop was
part of any systemic or recurrent police misconduct. To the
contrary, all the evidence suggests that the stop was an isolated
instance of negligence that occurred in connection with a bona
fide investigation of a suspected drug house. Officer Fackrell
saw Strieff leave a suspected drug house. And his suspicion
                                                     UTAH V. STREIFF (2016) | 653

about the house was based on an anonymous tip and his
personal observations.

   Applying these factors, we hold that the evidence discovered
on Strieff's person was admissible because the unlawful stop
was sufficiently attenuated by the pre-existing arrest warrant.
Although the illegal stop was close in time to Strieff's arrest,
that consideration is outweighed by two factors supporting the
State. The outstanding arrest warrant for Strieff's arrest is a
critical intervening circumstance that is wholly independent of
the illegal stop. The discovery of that warrant broke the causal
chain between the unconstitutional stop and the discovery of
evidence by compelling Officer Fackrell to arrest Strieff. And,
it is especially significant that there is no evidence that Officer
Fackrell's illegal stop reflected flagrantly unlawful police
misconduct.

   We hold that the evidence Officer Fackrell seized as part of
his search incident to arrest is admissible because his discovery
of the arrest warrant attenuated the connection between the
unlawful stop and the evidence seized from Strieff incident to
arrest. The judgment of the Utah Supreme Court, accordingly,
is reversed.

   Justice SOTOMAYOR, with whom Justice GINSBURG
joins as to Parts I, II, and III, dissenting.

   The Court today holds that the discovery of a warrant for
an unpaid parking ticket will forgive a police officer's violation
of your Fourth Amendment rights. Do not be soothed by
the opinion's technical language: This case allows the police
654 | UTAH V. STREIFF (2016)

to stop you on the street, demand your identification, and
check it for outstanding traffic warrants--even if you are doing
nothing wrong. If the officer discovers a warrant for a fine you
forgot to pay, courts will now excuse his illegal stop and will
admit into evidence anything he happens to find by searching
you after arresting you on the warrant. Because the Fourth
Amendment should prohibit, not permit, such misconduct, I

                       II

It is tempting in a case like this, where illegal conduct by an
officer uncovers illegal conduct by a civilian, to forgive the
officer. After all, his instincts, although unconstitutional, were
correct. But a basic principle lies at the heart of the Fourth
Amendment: Two wrongs don't make a right. When "lawless
police conduct" uncovers evidence of lawless civilian conduct,
this Court has long required later criminal trials to exclude the
illegally obtained evidence. For example, if an officer breaks
into a home and finds a forged check lying around, that check
may not be used to prosecute the homeowner for bank fraud.
We would describe the check as "`fruit of the poisonous tree.'"
Fruit that must be cast aside includes not only evidence
directly found by an illegal search but also evidence "come at
by exploitation of that illegality."

   This "exclusionary rule" removes an incentive for officers
to search us without proper justification. It also keeps courts
                                                     UTAH V. STREIFF (2016) | 655

from being "made party to lawless invasions of the
constitutional rights of citizens by permitting unhindered
governmental use of the fruits of such invasions." When courts
admit only lawfully obtained evidence, they encourage "those
who formulate law enforcement polices, and the officers who
implement them, to incorporate Fourth Amendment ideals
into their value system." But when courts admit illegally
obtained evidence as well, they reward "manifest neglect if not
an open defiance of the prohibitions of the Constitution."

   ***The officer did not ask Strieff to volunteer his name only
to find out, days later, that Strieff had a warrant against him.
The officer illegally stopped Strieff and immediately ran a
warrant check. The officer's discovery of a warrant was not
some intervening surprise that he could not have anticipated.
Utah lists over 180,000 misdemeanor warrants in its database,
and at the time of the arrest, Salt Lake County had a "backlog
of outstanding warrants" so large that it faced the "potential
for civil liability." The officer's violation was also calculated
to procure evidence. His sole reason for stopping Strieff, he
acknowledged, was investigative--he wanted to discover
whether drug activity was going on in the house Strieff had just
exited.

   The warrant check, in other words, was not an "intervening
circumstance" separating the stop from the search for drugs.
It was part and parcel of the officer's illegal "expedition for
evidence in the hope that something might turn up." Under
our precedents, because the officer found Strieff's drugs by
656 | UTAH V. STREIFF (2016)

exploiting his own constitutional violation, the drugs should
be excluded.

   ***
   But the Fourth Amendment does not tolerate an officer's
unreasonable searches and seizures just because he did not
know any better. Even officers prone to negligence can learn
from courts that exclude illegally obtained evidence. Indeed,
they are perhaps the most in need of the education, whether
by the judge's opinion, the prosecutor's future guidance, or an
updated manual on criminal procedure. If the officers are in
doubt about what the law requires, exclusion gives them an
"incentive to err on the side of constitutional behavior."
   Most striking about the Court's opinion is its insistence
that the event here was "isolated," with "no indication that
this unlawful stop was part of any systemic or recurrent police
misconduct." Respectfully, nothing about this case is isolated.
   Outstanding warrants are surprisingly common. When a
person with a traffic ticket misses a fine payment or court
appearance, a court will issue a warrant. The States and Federal
Government maintain databases with over 7.8 million
outstanding warrants, the vast majority of which appear to
be for minor offenses. Even these sources may not track the
"staggering" numbers of warrants, "`drawers and drawers'"
full, that many cities issue for traffic violations and ordinance
infractions. The county in this case has had a "backlog" of
such warrants. The Department of Justice recently reported
that in the town of Ferguson, Missouri, with a population
                                                     UTAH V. STREIFF (2016) | 657

of 21,000, 16,000 people had outstanding warrants against
them.

   Justice Department investigations across the country have
illustrated how these astounding numbers of warrants can be
used by police to stop people without cause. In a single year
in New Orleans, officers "made nearly 60,000 arrests, of which
about 20,000 were of people with outstanding traffic or
misdemeanor warrants from neighboring parishes for such
infractions as unpaid tickets." In the St. Louis metropolitan
area, officers "routinely" stop people--on the street, at bus
stops, or even in court--for no reason other than "an officer's
desire to check whether the subject had a municipal arrest
warrant pending." In Newark, New Jersey, officers stopped
52,235 pedestrians within a 4-year period and ran warrant
checks on 39,308 of them. The Justice Department analyzed
these warrant-checked stops and reported that "approximately
93% of the stops would have been considered unsupported by
articulated reasonable suspicion."

   I do not doubt that most officers act in "good faith" and
do not set out to break the law. That does not mean these
stops are "isolated instance[s] of negligence," however. Many
are the product of institutionalized training procedures. The
majority does not suggest what makes this case "isolated" from
these and countless other examples. Nor does it offer guidance
for how a defendant can prove that his arrest was the result of
"widespread" misconduct. Surely it should not take a federal
658 | UTAH V. STREIFF (2016)

investigation of Salt Lake County before the Court would
protect someone in Strieff's position.

                      IV

Writing only for myself, and drawing on my professional
experiences, I would add that unlawful "stops" have severe
consequences much greater than the inconvenience suggested
by the name. This Court has given officers an array of
instruments to probe and examine you. When we condone
officers' use of these devices without adequate cause, we give
them reason to target pedestrians in an arbitrary manner. We
also risk treating members of our communities as second-class
citizens.

   Although many Americans have been stopped for speeding
or jaywalking, few may realize how degrading a stop can be
when the officer is looking for more. This Court has allowed
an officer to stop you for whatever reason he wants--so long
as he can point to a pretextual justification after the fact. That
justification must provide specific reasons why the officer
suspected you were breaking the law but it may factor in your
ethnicity, where you live, what you were wearing, and how
you behaved. The officer does not even need to know which
law you might have broken so long as he can later point to
any possible infraction--even one that is minor, unrelated, or
ambiguous.

   The indignity of the stop is not limited to an officer telling
                                                     UTAH V. STREIFF (2016) | 659

you that you look like a criminal. The officer may next ask for
your "consent" to inspect your bag or purse without telling
you that you can decline. Regardless of your answer, he may
order you to stand "helpless, perhaps facing a wall with [your]
hands raised." If the officer thinks you might be dangerous,
he may then "frisk" you for weapons. This involves more than
just a pat down. As onlookers pass by, the officer may "`feel
with sensitive fingers every portion of [your] body. A thorough
search [may] be made of [your] arms and armpits, waistline
and back, the groin and area about the testicles, and entire
surface of the legs down to the feet.'"

   The officer's control over you does not end with the stop. If
the officer chooses, he may handcuff you and take you to jail
for doing nothing more than speeding, jaywalking, or "driving
[your] pickup truck ... with [your] 3-year-old son and 5-year-
old daughter ... without [your] seatbelt fastened." At the jail,
he can fingerprint you, swab DNA from the inside of your
mouth, and force you to "shower with a delousing agent"
while you "lift [your] tongue, hold out [your] arms, turn
around, and lift [your] genitals." Even if you are innocent,
you will now join the 65 million Americans with an arrest
record and experience the "civil death" of discrimination by
employers, landlords, and whoever else conducts a background
check. And, of course, if you fail to pay bail or appear for court,
a judge will issue a warrant to render you "arrestable on sight"
in the future.

   This case involves a suspicionless stop, one in which the
660 | UTAH V. STREIFF (2016)

officer initiated this chain of events without justification. As
the Justice Department notes, many innocent people are
subjected to the humiliations of these unconstitutional
searches. The white defendant in this case shows that anyone's
dignity can be violated in this manner. But it is no secret that
people of color are disproportionate victims of this type of
scrutiny. For generations, black and brown parents have given
their children "the talk"--instructing them never to run down
the street; always keep your hands where they can be seen; do
not even think of talking back to a stranger--all out of fear of
how an officer with a gun will react to them.

   By legitimizing the conduct that produces this double
consciousness, this case tells everyone, white and black, guilty
and innocent, that an officer can verify your legal status at any
time. It says that your body is subject to invasion while courts
excuse the violation of your rights. It implies that you are not
a citizen of a democracy but the subject of a carceral state, just
waiting to be cataloged.

   We must not pretend that the countless people who are
routinely targeted by police are "isolated." They are the
canaries in the coal mine whose deaths, civil and literal, warn us
that no one can breathe in this atmosphere. They are the ones
who recognize that unlawful police stops corrode all our civil
liberties and threaten all our lives. Until their voices matter too,
our justice system will continue to be anything but.

   I dissent.

applied the exclusionary rule to evidence obtained as a result of
Miranda Rule violations.

EXCLUSIONARY
RULE:
SUPPRESSION
HEARINGS AND
MONETARY
DAMAGES

  The Basics of Suppression
      Hearings and Money
              Damages

Having studied the Court's precedent on when the
exclusionary rule applies, we will now turn to an overview
of how suppression hearings work. In addition, this chapter
reviews the availability of monetary damages to victims of
constitutional violations related to criminal procedure law.
THE BASICS OF
SUPPRESSION
HEARINGS

  The Basics of Suppression
              Hearings

When a defendant seeks to exclude evidence allegedly obtained
in violation of the constitution, the judge normally decides
the suppression motion by preponderance of the evidence.83
With most court motions, the burden of persuasion is on the
moving party, meaning that a tie is resolved in favor of the
non-moving party. Accordingly, a defendant arguing that a
magistrate issued a search warrant without probable cause
would have the burden of proof. There are, however,
situations in which the prosecution bears the burden of proof.
When a confession is challenged as involuntary, for example,
"the prosecution must prove at least by a preponderance of the
evidence that the confession was voluntary."84

   When defendants seek exclusion of evidence on
constitutional grounds, the standard procedure is for the judge
to hold a "suppression hearing" outside the presence of the
666 | THE BASICS OF SUPPRESSION HEARINGS

jury. Each side may present witnesses. Police officers
commonly testify about what things they observed in advance
of a Terry stop or arrest that justified a seizure under review.
They also explain what evidence provided probable cause to
justify warrantless searches under doctrines such as the
automobile exception and exigent circumstances. Defendants
may testify in support of their suppression motions, and
absent unusual circumstances, their testimony at suppression
hearings may not be used against them at trial.85 Under this
rule, a defendant may testify that a suitcase belonged to him
in order to establish standing to object to an unlawful search
of the suitcase, without providing the prosecution a damaging
admission usable to prove guilt. If the judge finds for the
defendant, then the excluded evidence cannot be shown to
the jury. In cases where the prosecution's primary evidence is
challenged as unlawfully obtained--for example, a gun seized
from a defendant who is then charged with unlawfully
possessing it--a suppression ruling in the defendant's favor
can result in the dismissal of the charges. A defendant who
loses her pre-trial suppression motion may, if subsequently
convicted, raise her suppression arguments again on appeal.

   Our next case explains how courts resolve allegations that a
search warrant was issued on the basis of false statements made
by police officers to the issuing magistrate.

       Notes, Comments, and
                Questions

The details of suppression motion practice differ markedly
among jurisdictions and even among judges in the same
courthouse. Students who eventually practice criminal law
must study carefully the rules and preferences of the judges
before whom they appear. The overwhelming bulk of criminal
cases never go to trial, and suppression hearings are often the
most important court proceeding in a case.

   One risk of which defense counsel must be aware concerns
the use of suppression hearing testimony against a defendant
should a case eventually go to trial. While such testimony
cannot be used during the prosecution's case in chief (that is,
cannot be used substantively to prove the defendant's guilt),
see Simmons v. United States, 390 U.S. 377, 390 (1968), it can
be used to impeach the defendant should her trial testimony
contradict what she said at the hearing. See, e.g., United States
v. Beltran-Gutierrez, 19 F.3d 1287, 1290-91 (9th Cir. 1994);
United States v. Geraldo, 271 F.3d 1112, 1116 (D.C. Cir.
2001).
INTRODUCTION TO
MONETARY DAMAGES

     An Introduction to the
    Availability of Monetary

              Damages

Much as members of the public commonly overestimate the
role of the exclusionary rule in freeing guilty defendants on
"technicalities," public opinion also overestimates the
availability of money damages to the victims of police
misconduct. For multiple reasons, persons who suffer
unlawful searches and seizures--as well as those who
experience violations of their rights related to
interrogations--rarely recover money.

   First, many people under police investigation--the people
most likely to undergo searches, seizures, and interrogations,
whether lawful or unlawful--are criminals. Imagine, for
example, that police violate the "knock-and-announce" rule
and break down a suspect's door unlawfully. Then, while
executing a valid search warrant, police find cocaine. Under
the rule of Hudson v. Michigan (Chapter 32), the knock-and-
announce violation would not stop prosecutors from using
                         INTRODUCTION TO MONETARY DAMAGES | 669

the seized drugs at trial to convict the suspect of illegal
possession. In theory, the convicted defendant could then sue
police for damages related to the breaking of his door. A
lawsuit against state officials could be brought under "Section
1983," as 42 U.S.C. § 1983 is commonly known. A suit against
federal officials could be brought under the remedy provided
in Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents, 403 U.S. 388
(1971), which provides a civil remedy (known as a "Bivens
action") for certain constitutional violations by federal agents.
See also Hernandez v. Mesa, No. 17-1678 (U.S. Feb. 25, 2020)
(holding that family of a Mexican victim of unreasonable
cross-border shooting by U.S. Border Patrol agent cannot
bring Bivens action).

   In practice, however, the defendant would likely have
trouble finding a lawyer willing to take the case. In order to
make his case to jurors, the convicted criminal
defendant--now a civil plaintiff--would need to describe the
incident, which involves police finding cocaine at his home.
Further, the plaintiff's testimony could be impeached with
evidence of the drug conviction.86 Jurors have been known to
disfavor claims brought by convicted felons.

   While a prevailing plaintiff in a "constitutional tort" case
against state officials is entitled to reasonable attorney's fees
paid by the defendant,87 a plaintiff who loses must pay his
own lawyer. Therefore, unless the victim of police misconduct
has money for legal bills, he must convince a lawyer to take his
case on a contingent fee basis, which a lawyer is likely to do
670 | INTRODUCTION TO MONETARY DAMAGES

only if she expects to win. In addition, if the actual damages
awarded to prevailing plaintiffs are low, lawyers may not profit
unless they win a high percentage of their cases. A lawyer who
represents an indigent civil rights plaintiff on a contingency
basis often pays up front for expenses such as travel,
depositions, and expert witnesses. If the client loses, the lawyer
may never be repaid for expenses in the tens of thousands of
dollars. If the client wins, then the lawyer must hope that the
judge's definition of a "reasonable fee" is fair, which may not
always be true.88 Unless a lawyer is taking the rare civil rights
case on the side of a different kind of practice, the lawyer can
make a living only if occasional clients win sizeable judgments.
But juries have been known to award trivial sums, even in
cases of serious misconduct.89 While some cases do yield large
judgments,90 the overwhelming majority of practicing lawyers
have no interest in representing civil rights plaintiffs who are
unable to pay hourly bills. Many would-be plaintiffs with
credible claims of unlawful searches and seizures, including
police brutality and wrongful shootings, often cannot find
lawyers to bring their cases.

   Second, even if a plaintiff wins a court ruling that police
violated his constitutional rights, he may be denied monetary
compensation under the doctrine of "qualified immunity."
Under qualified immunity, a defendant need not pay
monetary damages unless her conduct violated clearly
established statutory or constitutional rights of which a
reasonable person would have known. In other words, even
                          INTRODUCTION TO MONETARY DAMAGES | 671

if a court finds that the defendant violated the plaintiff's
constitutional rights, the plaintiff cannot recover unless the
defendant's behavior violated "clearly established" law.
KISELA V. HUGHES
(2018)

              Supreme Court of the United States

Andrew Kisela v. Amy Hughes

            Decided April 2, 2018 - 138 S. Ct. 1148

   PER CURIAM.
   Petitioner Andrew Kisela, a police officer in Tucson,
Arizona, shot respondent Amy Hughes. Kisela and two other
officers had arrived on the scene after hearing a police radio
report that a woman was engaging in erratic behavior with a
knife. They had been there but a few minutes, perhaps just a
minute. When Kisela fired, Hughes was holding a large kitchen
knife, had taken steps toward another woman standing nearby,
and had refused to drop the knife after at least two commands
to do so. The question is whether at the time of the shooting
Kisela's actions violated clearly established law.
   The record, viewed in the light most favorable to Hughes,
shows the following. In May 2010, somebody in Hughes'
neighborhood called 911 to report that a woman was hacking
                                                  KISELA V. HUGHES (2018) | 673

a tree with a kitchen knife. Kisela and another police officer,
Alex Garcia, heard about the report over the radio in their
patrol car and responded. A few minutes later the person who
had called 911 flagged down the officers; gave them a
description of the woman with the knife; and told them the
woman had been acting erratically. About the same time, a
third police officer, Lindsay Kunz, arrived on her bicycle.

   Garcia spotted a woman, later identified as Sharon
Chadwick, standing next to a car in the driveway of a nearby
house. A chain-link fence with a locked gate separated
Chadwick from the officers. The officers then saw another
woman, Hughes, emerge from the house carrying a large knife
at her side. Hughes matched the description of the woman
who had been seen hacking a tree. Hughes walked toward
Chadwick and stopped no more than six feet from her.

   All three officers drew their guns. At least twice they told
Hughes to drop the knife. Viewing the record in the light
most favorable to Hughes, Chadwick said "take it easy" to
both Hughes and the officers. Hughes appeared calm, but she
did not acknowledge the officers' presence or drop the knife.
The top bar of the chain-link fence blocked Kisela's line of
fire, so he dropped to the ground and shot Hughes four times
through the fence. Then the officers jumped the fence,
handcuffed Hughes, and called paramedics, who transported
her to a hospital. There she was treated for non-life-
threatening injuries. Less than a minute had transpired from
674 | KISELA V. HUGHES (2018)

the moment the officers saw Chadwick to the moment Kisela
fired shots.

   All three of the officers later said that at the time of the
shooting they subjectively believed Hughes to be a threat to
Chadwick. After the shooting, the officers discovered that
Chadwick and Hughes were roommates, that Hughes had a
history of mental illness, and that Hughes had been upset with
Chadwick over a $20 debt. In an affidavit produced during
discovery, Chadwick said that a few minutes before the
shooting her boyfriend had told her Hughes was threatening
to kill Chadwick's dog, named Bunny. Chadwick "came home
to find" Hughes "somewhat distressed," and Hughes was in
the house holding Bunny "in one hand and a kitchen knife in
the other." Hughes asked Chadwick if she "wanted [her] to use
the knife on the dog." The officers knew none of this, though.
Chadwick went outside to get $20 from her car, which is when
the officers first saw her. In her affidavit Chadwick said that she
did not feel endangered at any time. Based on her experience
as Hughes' roommate, Chadwick stated that Hughes
"occasionally has episodes in which she acts inappropriately,"
but "she is only seeking attention."

   Hughes sued Kisela, alleging that Kisela had used excessive
force in violation of the Fourth Amendment. The District
Court granted summary judgment to Kisela, but the Court
of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed. Kisela then filed
a petition for certiorari in this Court. That petition is now
granted.
                                                  KISELA V. HUGHES (2018) | 675

   Here, the Court need not, and does not, decide whether
Kisela violated the Fourth Amendment when he used deadly
force against Hughes. For even assuming a Fourth
Amendment violation occurred--a proposition that is not at
all evident--on these facts Kisela was at least entitled to
qualified immunity.

   "Qualified immunity attaches when an official's
conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or
constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would
have known." "Because the focus is on whether the
officer had fair notice that her conduct was unlawful,
reasonableness is judged against the backdrop of the law
at the time of the conduct." [EMPHASIS ADDED BY
EDITOR]

   Although "this Court's caselaw does not require a case
directly on point for a right to be clearly established, existing
precedent must have placed the statutory or constitutional
question beyond debate." "In other words, immunity protects
all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate
the law." This Court has "`repeatedly told courts--and the
Ninth Circuit in particular--not to define clearly established
law at a high level of generality.'"

   "[S]pecificity is especially important in the Fourth
Amendment context, where the Court has recognized that it
is sometimes difficult for an officer to determine how the
relevant legal doctrine, here excessive force, will apply to the
factual situation the officer confronts." Use of excessive force
676 | KISELA V. HUGHES (2018)

is an area of the law "in which the result depends very much
on the facts of each case," and thus police officers are entitled
to qualified immunity unless existing precedent "squarely
governs" the specific facts at issue. Precedent involving similar
facts can help move a case beyond the otherwise "hazy border
between excessive and acceptable force" and thereby provide
an officer notice that a specific use of force is unlawful.

   "Of course, general statements of the law are not inherently
incapable of giving fair and clear warning to officers." But the
general rules [] "do not by themselves create clearly established
law outside an `obvious case.'" Where constitutional guidelines
seem inapplicable or too remote, it does not suffice for a court
simply to state that an officer may not use unreasonable and
excessive force, deny qualified immunity, and then remit the
case for a trial on the question of reasonableness. An officer
"cannot be said to have violated a clearly established right
unless the right's contours were sufficiently definite that any
reasonable official in the defendant's shoes would have
understood that he was violating it." That is a necessary part
of the qualified-immunity standard, and it is a part of the
standard that the Court of Appeals here failed to implement in
a correct way.

   Kisela says he shot Hughes because, although the officers
themselves were in no apparent danger, he believed she was
a threat to Chadwick. Kisela had mere seconds to assess the
potential danger to Chadwick. He was confronted with a
woman who had just been seen hacking a tree with a large
                                                  KISELA V. HUGHES (2018) | 677

kitchen knife and whose behavior was erratic enough to cause
a concerned bystander to call 911 and then flag down Kisela
and Garcia. Kisela was separated from Hughes and Chadwick
by a chain-link fence; Hughes had moved to within a few feet
of Chadwick; and she failed to acknowledge at least two
commands to drop the knife. Those commands were loud
enough that Chadwick, who was standing next to Hughes,
heard them. This is far from an obvious case in which any
competent officer would have known that shooting Hughes to
protect Chadwick would violate the Fourth Amendment.

   [T]he petition for certiorari is granted; the judgment of the
Court of Appeals is reversed; and the case is remanded for
further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

   Justice SOTOMAYOR, with whom Justice GINSBURG
joins, dissenting.

   Officer Andrew Kisela shot Amy Hughes while she was
speaking with her roommate, Sharon Chadwick, outside of
their home. The record, properly construed at this stage, shows
that at the time of the shooting: Hughes stood stationary
about six feet away from Chadwick, appeared "composed and
content" and held a kitchen knife down at her side with the
blade facing away from Chadwick. Hughes was nowhere near
the officers, had committed no illegal act, was suspected of no
crime, and did not raise the knife in the direction of Chadwick
or anyone else. Faced with these facts, the two other
responding officers held their fire, and one testified that he
"wanted to continue trying verbal command[s] and see if that
678 | KISELA V. HUGHES (2018)

would work." But not Kisela. He thought it necessary to use
deadly force, and so, without giving a warning that he would
open fire, he shot Hughes four times, leaving her seriously
injured.

   If this account of Kisela's conduct sounds unreasonable,
that is because it was. And yet, the Court today insulates that
conduct from liability under the doctrine of qualified
immunity, holding that Kisela violated no "clearly established"
law. I disagree. Viewing the facts in the light most favorable to
Hughes, as the Court must at summary judgment, a jury could
find that Kisela violated Hughes' clearly established Fourth
Amendment rights by needlessly resorting to lethal force. In
holding otherwise, the Court misapprehends the facts and
misapplies the law, effectively treating qualified immunity as an
absolute shield. I therefore respectfully dissent.

                       I

This case arrives at our doorstep on summary judgment, so
we must "view the evidence ... in the light most favorable to"
Hughes, the nonmovant, "with respect to the central facts of
this case." The majority purports to honor this well-settled
principle, but its efforts fall short. Although the majority sets
forth most of the relevant events that transpired, it
conspicuously omits several critical facts and draws premature
inferences that bear on the qualified-immunity inquiry. Those
errors are fatal to its analysis, because properly construing all
                                                  KISELA V. HUGHES (2018) | 679

of the facts in the light most favorable to Hughes, and drawing
all inferences in her favor, a jury could find that the following
events occurred on the day of Hughes' encounter with the
Tucson police.

   On May 21, 2010, Kisela and Officer-in-Training Alex
Garcia received a "`check welfare'" call about a woman
chopping away at a tree with a knife. They responded to the
scene, where they were informed by the person who had placed
the call (not Chadwick) that the woman with the knife had
been acting "erratically." A third officer, Lindsay Kunz, later
joined the scene. The officers observed Hughes, who matched
the description given to the officers of the woman alleged to
have been cutting the tree, emerge from a house with a kitchen
knife in her hand. Hughes exited the front door and
approached Chadwick, who was standing outside in the
driveway.

   Hughes then stopped about six feet from Chadwick,
holding the kitchen knife down at her side with the blade
pointed away from Chadwick. Hughes and Chadwick
conversed with one another; Hughes appeared "composed and
content," and did not look angry. At no point during this
exchange did Hughes raise the kitchen knife or verbally
threaten to harm Chadwick or the officers. Chadwick later
averred that, during the incident, she was never in fear of
Hughes and "was not the least bit threatened by the fact that
[Hughes] had a knife in her hand" and that Hughes "never
acted in a threatening manner." The officers did not observe
680 | KISELA V. HUGHES (2018)

Hughes commit any crime, nor was Hughes suspected of
committing one.

   Nevertheless, the officers hastily drew their guns and
ordered Hughes to drop the knife. The officers gave that order
twice, but the commands came "in quick succession." The
evidence in the record suggests that Hughes may not have
heard or understood the officers' commands and may not have
been aware of the officers' presence at all. Although the officers
were in uniform, they never verbally identified themselves as
law enforcement officers.

   Kisela did not wait for Hughes to register, much less
respond to, the officers' rushed commands. Instead, Kisela
immediately and unilaterally escalated the situation. Without
giving any advance warning that he would shoot, and without
attempting less dangerous methods to deescalate the situation,
he dropped to the ground and shot four times at Hughes (who
was stationary) through a chain-link fence. After being shot,
Hughes fell to the ground, screaming and bleeding from her
wounds. She looked at the officers and asked, "`Why'd you
shoot me?'" Hughes was immediately transported to the
hospital, where she required treatment for her injuries. Kisela
alone resorted to deadly force in this case. Confronted with the
same circumstances as Kisela, neither of his fellow officers took
that drastic measure.

   ***Because Kisela plainly lacked any legitimate interest
justifying the use of deadly force against a woman who posed
no objective threat of harm to officers or others, had
                                                   KISELA V. HUGHES (2018) | 681

committed no crime, and appeared calm and collected during
the police encounter, he was not entitled to qualified
immunity.

   In sum, precedent existing at the time of the shooting clearly
established the unconstitutionality of Kisela's conduct. The
majority's decision, no matter how much it says otherwise,
ultimately rests on a faulty premise: that those cases are not
identical to this one. But that is not the law, for our cases have
never required a factually identical case to satisfy the "clearly
established" standard. It is enough that governing law places
"the constitutionality of the officer's conduct beyond debate."
Because, taking the facts in the light most favorable to Hughes,
it is "beyond debate" that Kisela's use of deadly force was
objectively unreasonable, he was not entitled to summary
judgment on the basis of qualified immunity.

                      III

This unwarranted summary reversal is symptomatic of "a
disturbing trend regarding the use of this Court's resources"
in qualified-immunity cases. As I have previously noted, this
Court routinely displays an unflinching willingness "to
summarily reverse courts for wrongly denying officers the
protection of qualified immunity" but "rarely intervene[s]
where courts wrongly afford officers the benefit of qualified
immunity in these same cases." Such a one-sided approach to
qualified immunity transforms the doctrine into an absolute
682 | KISELA V. HUGHES (2018)

shield for law enforcement officers, gutting the deterrent effect
of the Fourth Amendment.

   The majority today exacerbates that troubling asymmetry.
Its decision is not just wrong on the law; it also sends an
alarming signal to law enforcement officers and the public.
It tells officers that they can shoot first and think later, and
it tells the public that palpably unreasonable conduct will go
unpunished. Because there is nothing right or just under the
law about this, I respectfully dissent.

       Notes, Comments, and
                Questions

Our next case involves serious violations of the Court's rule set
forth in Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), which requires
that prosecutors provide material exculpatory evidence in their
possession to the defense. Although this book does not explore
the Brady rule, students should recognize its importance to
avoiding wrongful convictions. Our next case illustrates the
impediments in the path of a defendant who seeks monetary
damages after winning release from prison by proving a Brady
violation.

   A bit of background will help students understand the
plaintiff's cause of action. Because prosecutors (much like
judges) normally enjoy absolute immunity from Section 1983
liability for actions taken during and in preparation for trial,
see Buckley v. Fitzsimmons, 509 U.S. 259 (1993), plaintiff

John Thompson alleged that district attorney Harry Connick
failed to train his prosecutors adequately about their duty
under Brady to produce evidence. Only especially egregious
failures to train can justify civil liability.

     Connick v. Thompson,

            Decided March 29, 2011 -- 563 U.S. 51

   Justice THOMAS delivered the opinion of the Court.
   The Orleans Parish District Attorney's Office now concedes
that, in prosecuting respondent John Thompson for
attempted armed robbery, prosecutors failed to disclose
evidence that should have been turned over to the defense
under Brady v. Maryland. Thompson was convicted. Because
of that conviction Thompson elected not to testify in his own
defense in his later trial for murder, and he was again
convicted. Thompson spent 18 years in prison, including 14
years on death row. One month before Thompson's scheduled
execution, his investigator discovered the undisclosed evidence
from his armed robbery trial. The reviewing court determined
that the evidence was exculpatory, and both of Thompson's
convictions were vacated.
                                          CONNICK V. THOMPSON (2011) | 685

   After his release from prison, Thompson sued petitioner
Harry Connick, in his official capacity as the Orleans Parish
District Attorney, for damages. Thompson alleged that
Connick had failed to train his prosecutors adequately about
their duty to produce exculpatory evidence and that the lack of
training had caused the nondisclosure in Thompson's robbery
case. The jury awarded Thompson $14 million, and the Court
of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed by an evenly divided
en banc court. We granted certiorari to decide whether a
district attorney's office may be held liable under § 1983 for
failure to train based on a single Brady violation. We hold that
it cannot.

                       I

                         A

In early 1985, John Thompson was charged with the murder
of Raymond T. Liuzza, Jr. in New Orleans. Publicity
following the murder charge led the victims of an unrelated
armed robbery to identify Thompson as their attacker. The
district attorney charged Thompson with attempted armed
robbery.

   As part of the robbery investigation, a crime scene
technician took from one of the victims' pants a swatch of
fabric stained with the robber's blood. Approximately one
week before Thompson's armed robbery trial, the swatch was
686 | CONNICK V. THOMPSON (2011)

sent to the crime laboratory. Two days before the trial, assistant
district attorney Bruce Whittaker received the crime lab's
report, which stated that the perpetrator had blood type B.
There is no evidence that the prosecutors ever had
Thompson's blood tested or that they knew what his blood
type was. Whittaker claimed he placed the report on assistant
district attorney James Williams' desk, but Williams denied
seeing it. The report was never disclosed to Thompson's
counsel.

   Williams tried the armed robbery case with assistant district
attorney Gerry Deegan. On the first day of trial, Deegan
checked all of the physical evidence in the case out of the police
property room, including the blood-stained swatch. Deegan
then checked all of the evidence but the swatch into the
courthouse property room. The prosecutors did not mention
the swatch or the crime lab report at trial, and the jury
convicted Thompson of attempted armed robbery.

   A few weeks later, Williams and special prosecutor Eric
Dubelier tried Thompson for the Liuzza murder. Because of
the armed robbery conviction, Thompson chose not to testify
in his own defense. He was convicted and sentenced to death.
In the 14 years following Thompson's murder conviction,
state and federal courts reviewed and denied his challenges to
the conviction and sentence. The State scheduled Thompson's
execution for May 20, 1999.

   In late April 1999, Thompson's private investigator
discovered the crime lab report from the armed robbery
                                          CONNICK V. THOMPSON (2011) | 687

investigation in the files of the New Orleans Police Crime
Laboratory. Thompson was tested and found to have blood
type O, proving that the blood on the swatch was not his.
Thompson's attorneys presented this evidence to the district
attorney's office, which, in turn, moved to stay the execution
and vacate Thompson's armed robbery conviction. The
Louisiana Court of Appeals then reversed Thompson's
murder conviction, concluding that the armed robbery
conviction unconstitutionally deprived Thompson of his right
to testify in his own defense at the murder trial. In 2003, the
district attorney's office retried Thompson for Liuzza's
murder. The jury found him not guilty.

                         B

Thompson then brought this action against the district
attorney's office, Connick, Williams, and others, alleging that
their conduct caused him to be wrongfully convicted,
incarcerated for 18 years, and nearly executed. The only claim
that proceeded to trial was Thompson's claim under § 1983
that the district attorney's office had violated Brady by failing
to disclose the crime lab report in his armed robbery trial.
Thompson alleged liability under two theories: (1) the Brady
violation was caused by an unconstitutional policy of the
district attorney's office; and (2) the violation was caused by
Connick's deliberate indifference to an obvious need to train
688 | CONNICK V. THOMPSON (2011)

the prosecutors in his office in order to avoid such
constitutional violations.

   Before trial, Connick conceded that the failure to produce
the crime lab report constituted a Brady violation.
Accordingly, the District Court instructed the jury that the
"only issue" was whether the nondisclosure was caused by
either a policy, practice, or custom of the district attorney's
office or a deliberately indifferent failure to train the office's
prosecutors.

   Although no prosecutor remembered any specific training
session regarding Brady prior to 1985, it was undisputed at
trial that the prosecutors were familiar with the general Brady
requirement that the State disclose to the defense evidence
in its possession that is favorable to the accused. Prosecutors
testified that office policy was to turn crime lab reports and
other scientific evidence over to the defense. They also testified
that, after the discovery of the undisclosed crime lab report
in 1999, prosecutors disagreed about whether it had to be
disclosed under Brady absent knowledge of Thompson's
blood type.

   The jury rejected Thompson's claim that an
unconstitutional office policy caused the Brady violation, but
found the district attorney's office liable for failing to train
the prosecutors. The jury awarded Thompson $14 million in
damages, and the District Court added more than $1 million
in attorney's fees and costs.

   After the verdict, Connick renewed his objection--which
                                          CONNICK V. THOMPSON (2011) | 689

he had raised on summary judgment--that he could not have
been deliberately indifferent to an obvious need for more or
different Brady training because there was no evidence that he
was aware of a pattern of similar Brady violations. The District
Court rejected this argument.

   A panel of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit
affirmed.The Court of Appeals sitting en banc vacated the
panel opinion, granted rehearing, and divided evenly, thereby
affirming the District Court. We granted certiorari.

                       II

The Brady violation conceded in this case occurred when one
or more of the four prosecutors involved with Thompson's
armed robbery prosecution failed to disclose the crime lab
report to Thompson's counsel. Under Thompson's failure-
to-train theory, he bore the burden of proving both (1) that
Connick, the policymaker for the district attorney's office, was
deliberately indifferent to the need to train the prosecutors
about their Brady disclosure obligation with respect to
evidence of this type and (2) that the lack of training actually
caused the Brady violation in this case. Connick argues that he
was entitled to judgment as a matter of law because Thompson
did not prove that he was on actual or constructive notice of,
and therefore deliberately indifferent to, a need for more or
different Brady training. We agree.
690 | CONNICK V. THOMPSON (2011)

                         A

Title 42 U.S.C. § 1983 provides in relevant part:
   "Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance,

regulation, custom, or usage, of any State ... subjects, or causes
to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other
person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any
rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution
and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law,
suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress ...."

   A municipality or other local government may be liable
under this section if the governmental body itself "subjects"
a person to a deprivation of rights or "causes" a person "to
be subjected" to such deprivation. But, under § 1983, local
governments are responsible only for "their own illegal acts."
They are not vicariously liable under § 1983 for their
employees' actions.

   Plaintiffs who seek to impose liability on local governments
under § 1983 must prove that "action pursuant to official
municipal policy" caused their injury. Official municipal
policy includes the decisions of a government's lawmakers, the
acts of its policymaking officials, and practices so persistent
and widespread as to practically have the force of law. These are
"action[s] for which the municipality is actually responsible."

   In limited circumstances, a local government's decision not
to train certain employees about their legal duty to avoid
violating citizens' rights may rise to the level of an official
                                           CONNICK V. THOMPSON (2011) | 691

government policy for purposes of § 1983. A municipality's
culpability for a deprivation of rights is at its most tenuous
where a claim turns on a failure to train. To satisfy the statute,
a municipality's failure to train its employees in a relevant
respect must amount to "deliberate indifference to the rights
of persons with whom the [untrained employees] come into
contact." Only then "can such a shortcoming be properly
thought of as a city `policy or custom' that is actionable under
§ 1983."

   "`[D]eliberate indifference' is a stringent standard of fault,
requiring proof that a municipal actor disregarded a known
or obvious consequence of his action." Thus, when city
policymakers are on actual or constructive notice that a
particular omission in their training program causes city
employees to violate citizens' constitutional rights, the city
may be deemed deliberately indifferent if the policymakers
choose to retain that program. The city's "policy of inaction"
in light of notice that its program will cause constitutional
violations "is the functional equivalent of a decision by the city
itself to violate the Constitution." A less stringent standard
of fault for a failure-to-train claim "would result in de facto
respondeat superior liability on municipalities

   ***
   Failure to train prosecutors in their Brady obligations does
not fall within the narrow range of [] single-incident liability.
Attorneys are trained in the law and equipped with the tools to
interpret and apply legal principles, understand constitutional
692 | CONNICK V. THOMPSON (2011)

limits, and exercise legal judgment. Before they may enter the
profession and receive a law license, all attorneys must graduate
from law school or pass a substantive examination; attorneys in
the vast majority of jurisdictions must do both.

   In addition, attorneys in all jurisdictions must satisfy
character and fitness standards to receive a law license and are
personally subject to an ethical regime designed to reinforce
the profession's standards. An attorney who violates his or
her ethical obligations is subject to professional discipline,
including sanctions, suspension, and disbarment.

   In light of this regime of legal training and professional
responsibility, recurring constitutional violations are not the
"obvious consequence" of failing to provide prosecutors with
formal in-house training about how to obey the law.
Prosecutors are not only equipped but are also ethically bound
to know what Brady entails and to perform legal research
when they are uncertain. A district attorney is entitled to rely
on prosecutors' professional training and ethical obligations in
the absence of specific reason, such as a pattern of violations,
to believe that those tools are insufficient to prevent future
constitutional violations in "the usual and recurring situations
with which [the prosecutors] must deal." A licensed attorney
making legal judgments, in his capacity as a prosecutor, about
Brady material simply does not present the same "highly
predictable" constitutional danger as [an] untrained officer.

   We do not assume that prosecutors will always make correct
Brady decisions or that guidance regarding specific Brady
                                          CONNICK V. THOMPSON (2011) | 693

questions would not assist prosecutors. But showing merely
that additional training would have been helpful in making
difficult decisions does not establish municipal liability.
"[P]rov[ing] that an injury or accident could have been
avoided if an [employee] had had better or more training,
sufficient to equip him to avoid the particular injury-causing
conduct" will not suffice.

                             3

The District Court and the Court of Appeals panel
erroneously believed that Thompson had proved deliberate
indifference by showing the "obviousness" of a need for
additional training. They based this conclusion on Connick's
awareness that (1) prosecutors would confront Brady issues
while at the district attorney's office; (2) inexperienced
prosecutors were expected to understand Brady's
requirements; (3) Brady has gray areas that make for difficult
choices; and (4) erroneous decisions regarding Brady evidence
would result in constitutional violations. This is insufficient.

   It does not follow that, because Brady has gray areas and
some Brady decisions are difficult, prosecutors will so
obviously make wrong decisions that failing to train them
amounts to "a decision by the city itself to violate the
Constitution." To prove deliberate indifference, Thompson
needed to show that Connick was on notice that, absent
additional specified training, it was "highly predictable" that
the prosecutors in his office would be confounded by those
694 | CONNICK V. THOMPSON (2011)

gray areas and make incorrect Brady decisions as a result. In
fact, Thompson had to show that it was so predictable that
failing to train the prosecutors amounted to conscious
disregard for defendants' Brady rights. He did not do so.

                      III

We conclude that this case does not fall within the narrow
range of "single-incident" liability. The District Court should
have granted Connick judgment as a matter of law on the
failure-to-train claim because Thompson did not prove a
pattern of similar violations that would "establish that the
`policy of inaction' [was] the functional equivalent of a
decision by the city itself to violate the Constitution." The
judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth
Circuit is reversed.

   Justice SCALIA, with whom Justice ALITO joins,
concurring. [omitted]

   Justice GINSBURG, with whom Justice BREYER, Justice
SOTOMAYOR, and Justice KAGAN join, dissenting.

   In Brady v. Maryland, this Court held that due process
requires the prosecution to turn over evidence favorable to
the accused and material to his guilt or punishment. That
obligation, the parties have stipulated, was dishonored in this
case; consequently, John Thompson spent 18 years in prison,
14 of them isolated on death row, before the truth came to
light: He was innocent of the charge of attempted armed
                                          CONNICK V. THOMPSON (2011) | 695

robbery, and his subsequent trial on a murder charge, by
prosecutorial design, was fundamentally unfair.

   The Court holds that the Orleans Parish District Attorney's
Office (District Attorney's Office or Office) cannot be held
liable, in a civil rights action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, for the
grave injustice Thompson suffered. That is so, the Court tells
us, because Thompson has shown only an aberrant Brady
violation, not a routine practice of giving short shrift to
Brady's requirements. The evidence presented to the jury that
awarded compensation to Thompson, however, points
distinctly away from the Court's assessment. As the trial record
in the § 1983 action reveals, the conceded, long-concealed
prosecutorial transgressions were neither isolated nor atypical.

   From the top down, the evidence showed, members of the
District Attorney's Office, including the District Attorney
himself, misperceived Brady's compass and therefore
inadequately attended to their disclosure obligations.
Throughout the pretrial and trial proceedings against
Thompson, the team of four engaged in prosecuting him for
armed robbery and murder hid from the defense and the court
exculpatory information Thompson requested and had a
constitutional right to receive. The prosecutors did so despite
multiple opportunities, spanning nearly two decades, to set the
record straight. Based on the prosecutors' conduct relating to
Thompson's trials, a fact trier could reasonably conclude that
inattention to Brady was standard operating procedure at the
District Attorney's Office.
696 | CONNICK V. THOMPSON (2011)

   What happened here, the Court's opinion obscures, was
no momentary oversight, no single incident of a lone officer's
misconduct. Instead, the evidence demonstrated that
misperception and disregard of Brady's disclosure
requirements were pervasive in Orleans Parish. That evidence,
I would hold, established persistent, deliberately indifferent
conduct for which the District Attorney's Office bears
responsibility under § 1983.

   ***
   Thompson discovered the prosecutors' misconduct
through a serendipitous series of events. In 1994, nine years
after Thompson's convictions, Deegan, the assistant
prosecutor in the armed robbery trial, learned he was
terminally ill. Soon thereafter, Deegan confessed to his friend
Michael Riehlmann that he had suppressed blood evidence
in the armed robbery case. Deegan did not heed Riehlmann's
counsel to reveal what he had done. For five years, Riehlmann,
himself a former Orleans Parish prosecutor, kept Deegan's
confession to himself.
   On April 16, 1999, the State of Louisiana scheduled
Thompson's execution. In an eleventh-hour effort to save his
life, Thompson's attorneys hired a private investigator. Deep
in the crime lab archives, the investigator unearthed a
microfiche copy of the lab report identifying the robber's
blood type. The copy showed that the report had been
addressed to Whittaker. Thompson's attorneys contacted
Whittaker, who informed Riehlmann that the lab report had
                                          CONNICK V. THOMPSON (2011) | 697

been found. Riehlmann thereupon told Whittaker that
Deegan "had failed to turn over stuff that might have been
exculpatory." Riehlmann prepared an affidavit describing
Deegan's disclosure "that he had intentionally suppressed
blood evidence in the armed robbery trial of John
Thompson."

   Thompson's lawyers presented to the trial court the crime
lab report showing that the robber's blood type was B, and a
report identifying Thompson's blood type as O. This evidence
proved Thompson innocent of the robbery. The court
immediately stayed Thompson's execution and commenced
proceedings to assess the newly discovered evidence.

   Connick sought an abbreviated hearing. A full hearing was
unnecessary, he urged, because the Office had confessed error
and had moved to dismiss the armed robbery charges. The
court insisted on a public hearing. Given "the history of this
case," the court said, it "was not willing to accept the
representations that [Connick] and [his] office made [in their
motion to dismiss]." After a full day's hearing, the court
vacated Thompson's attempted armed robbery conviction and
dismissed the charges. Before doing so, the court admonished:

   "[A]ll day long there have been a number of young Assistant
D.A.'s ... sitting in this courtroom watching this, and I hope
they take home ... and take to heart the message that this kind
of conduct cannot go on in this Parish if this Criminal Justice
System is going to work."

   The District Attorney's Office then initiated grand jury
698 | CONNICK V. THOMPSON (2011)

proceedings against the prosecutors who had withheld the lab
report. Connick terminated the grand jury after just one day.
He maintained that the lab report would not be Brady material
if prosecutors did not know Thompson's blood type. And he
told the investigating prosecutor that the grand jury "w[ould]
make [his] job more difficult." In protest, that prosecutor
tendered his resignation.

   Thereafter, the Louisiana Court of Appeal reversed
Thompson's murder conviction. The unlawfully procured
robbery conviction, the court held, had violated Thompson's
right to testify and thus fully present his defense in the murder
trial. The merits of several Brady claims arising out of the
murder trial, the court observed, had therefore become
"moot."

   Undeterred by his assistants' disregard of Thompson's
rights, Connick retried him for the Liuzza murder.
Thompson's defense was bolstered by evidence earlier
unavailable to him: ten exhibits the prosecution had not
disclosed when Thompson was first tried. The newly
produced items included police reports describing the assailant
in the murder case as having "close cut" hair, the police report
recounting Perkins' meetings with the Liuzza family, audio
recordings of those meetings, and a 35-page supplemental
police report. After deliberating for only 35 minutes, the jury
found Thompson not guilty.

   On May 9, 2003, having served more than 18 years in prison
for crimes he did not commit, Thompson was released.
                                          CONNICK V. THOMPSON (2011) | 699

   On July 16, 2003, Thompson commenced a civil action
under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 alleging that Connick, other officials
of the Orleans Parish District Attorney's Office, and the Office
itself, had violated his constitutional rights by wrongfully
withholding Brady evidence. Thompson sought to hold
Connick and the District Attorney's Office liable for failure
adequately to train prosecutors concerning their Brady
obligations. Such liability attaches, I agree with the Court,
only when the failure "amount[s] to `deliberate indifference to
the rights of persons with whom the [untrained employees]
come into contact.'" I disagree, however, with the Court's
conclusion that Thompson failed to prove deliberate
indifference.

   Having weighed all the evidence, the jury in the § 1983 case
found for Thompson, concluding that the District Attorney's
Office had been deliberately indifferent to Thompson's Brady
rights and to the need for training and supervision to safeguard
those rights. "Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable
to [Thompson], as appropriate in light of the verdic[t]
rendered by the jury," I see no cause to upset the District
Court's determination, affirmed by the Fifth Circuit, that
"ample evidence ... adduced at trial" supported the jury's
verdict.

SIXTH
AMENDMENT:
RIGHT TO
COUNSEL
INTRO TO RIGHT TO
COUNSEL &
INEFFECTIVE

COUNSEL

  Introduction to the Right to
    Counsel and Ineffective
             Assistance

The Sixth Amendment provides, "In all criminal prosecutions,
the accused shall enjoy the right ... to have the Assistance of
Counsel for his defense." For more than a century after the
ratification of the Amendment, this right allowed criminal
defendants to hire their own lawyers but did not require the
government to provide counsel to indigent defendants who
could not afford to hire counsel. In 1932, the Court held that
state court indigent defendants must be provided counsel in
death penalty cases. See Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S. 45 (1932)
(the "Scottsboro Boys" case). Although the Court soon
thereafter required federal courts to provide counsel even in
704 | INTRO TO RIGHT TO COUNSEL &#038; INEFFECTIVE
ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL

non-capital cases, see Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458 (1938),
the Court held in 1942 that for ordinary felony cases, state
courts could decide for themselves whether to appoint counsel
to indigent defendants. See Betts v. Brady, 316 U.S. 455, 473
(1942) ("we cannot say that the [Fourteenth A]mendment
embodies an inexorable command that no trial for any offense,
or in any court, can be fairly conducted and justice accorded a
defendant who is not represented by counsel").

   In 1963, the Court reversed Betts v. Brady in the landmark
case of Gideon v. Wainwright. The story of Clarence Earl
Gideon inspired one of the best known works of legal
journalism--Gideon's Trumpet (1964), by Anthony
Lewis--as well as a movie with the same title starring Henry
Fonda. Gideon asked for counsel when charged with a Florida
crime, and the state judge refused to appoint him a lawyer.
After his conviction, he appealed unsuccessfully in Florida
courts. He then sent a handwritten note to the Supreme
Court, which agreed to take the case.

whereupon the following colloquy took place:
   "The COURT: Mr. Gideon, I am sorry, but I cannot
appoint Counsel to represent you in this case. Under the laws
of the State of Florida, the only time the Court can appoint
Counsel to represent a Defendant is when that person is
charged with a capital offense. I am sorry, but I will have to
706 | GIDEON V. WAINWRIGHT (1963)

deny your request to appoint Counsel to defend you in this
case.

   "The DEFENDANT: The United States Supreme Court
says I am entitled to be represented by Counsel."

   Put to trial before a jury, Gideon conducted his defense
about as well as could be expected from a layman. He made
an opening statement to the jury, cross-examined the State's
witnesses, presented witnesses in his own defense, declined to
testify himself, and made a short argument "emphasizing his
innocence to the charge contained in the Information filed in
this case." The jury returned a verdict of guilty, and petitioner
was sentenced to serve five years in the state prison. Later,
petitioner filed in the Florida Supreme Court this habeas
corpus petition attacking his conviction and sentence on the
ground that the trial court's refusal to appoint counsel for
him denied him rights "guaranteed by the Constitution and
the Bill of Rights by the United States Government." Treating
the petition for habeas corpus as properly before it, the State
Supreme Court, "upon consideration thereof" but without
an opinion, denied all relief. [T]he problem of a defendant's
federal constitutional right to counsel in a state court has been
a continuing source of controversy and litigation in both state
and federal courts. To give this problem another review here,
we granted certiorari. Since Gideon was proceeding in forma
pauperis, we appointed counsel to represent him and
requested both sides to discuss in their briefs and oral
                                          GIDEON V. WAINWRIGHT (1963) | 707

arguments the following: "Should this Court's holding in
Betts v. Brady be reconsidered?"

                       I

The facts upon which Betts claimed that he had been
unconstitutionally denied the right to have counsel appointed
to assist him are strikingly like the facts upon which Gideon
here bases his federal constitutional claim. Betts was indicted
for robbery in a Maryland state court. On arraignment, he
told the trial judge of his lack of funds to hire a lawyer and
asked the court to appoint one for him. Betts was advised that
it was not the practice in that county to appoint counsel for
indigent defendants except in murder and rape cases. He then
pleaded not guilty, had witnesses summoned, cross-examined
the State's witnesses, examined his own, and chose not to
testify himself. He was found guilty by the judge, sitting
without a jury, and sentenced to eight years in prison. Like
Gideon, Betts sought release by habeas corpus, alleging that he
had been denied the right to assistance of counsel in violation
of the Fourteenth Amendment. Betts was denied any relief,
and on review this Court affirmed. It was held that a refusal
to appoint counsel for an indigent defendant charged with
a felony did not necessarily violate the Due Process Clause
of the Fourteenth Amendment, which for reasons given the
Court deemed to be the only applicable federal constitutional
provision.
708 | GIDEON V. WAINWRIGHT (1963)

   Treating due process as "a concept less rigid and more fluid
than those envisaged in other specific and particular provisions
of the Bill of Rights," the Court held that refusal to appoint
counsel under the particular facts and circumstances in the
Betts case was not so "offensive to the common and
fundamental ideas of fairness" as to amount to a denial of
due process. Since the facts and circumstances of the two cases
are so nearly indistinguishable, we think the Betts v. Brady
holding if left standing would require us to reject Gideon's
claim that the Constitution guarantees him the assistance of
counsel. Upon full reconsideration we conclude that Betts v.
Brady should be overruled.

                       II

The Sixth Amendment provides, "In all criminal prosecutions,
the accused shall enjoy the right ... to have the Assistance of
Counsel for his defence." We have construed this to mean that
in federal courts counsel must be provided for defendants
unable to employ counsel unless the right is competently and
intelligently waived. Betts argued that this right is extended
to indigent defendants in state courts by the Fourteenth
Amendment. In response the Court stated that, while the
Sixth Amendment laid down "no rule for the conduct of the
states, the question recurs whether the constraint laid by the
amendment upon the national courts expresses a rule so
fundamental and essential to a fair trial, and so, to due process
                                         GIDEON V. WAINWRIGHT (1963) | 709

of law, that it is made obligatory upon the states by the
Fourteenth Amendment." [T]he Court [in Betts] concluded
that "appointment of counsel is not a fundamental right,
essential to a fair trial." It was for this reason the Betts Court
refused to accept the contention that the Sixth Amendment's
guarantee of counsel for indigent federal defendants was
extended to or, in the words of that Court, "made obligatory
upon the states by the Fourteenth Amendment." Plainly, had
the Court concluded that appointment of counsel for an
indigent criminal defendant was "a fundamental right,
essential to a fair trial," it would have held that the Fourteenth
Amendment requires appointment of counsel in a state court,
just as the Sixth Amendment requires in a federal court.

   We think the Court in Betts had ample precedent for
acknowledging that those guarantees of the Bill of Rights
which are fundamental safeguards of liberty immune from
federal abridgment are equally protected against state invasion
by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. In
many cases [], this Court has looked to the fundamental nature
of original Bill of Rights guarantees to decide whether the
Fourteenth Amendment makes them obligatory on the States.
Explicitly recognized to be of this "fundamental nature" and
therefore made immune from state invasion by the
Fourteenth, or some part of it, are the First Amendment's
freedoms of speech, press, religion, assembly, association, and
petition for redress of grievances. For the same reason, though
not always in precisely the same terminology, the Court has
710 | GIDEON V. WAINWRIGHT (1963)

made obligatory on the States the Fifth Amendment's
command that private property shall not be taken for public
use without just compensation, the Fourth Amendment's
prohibition of unreasonable searches and seizures, and the
Eighth's ban on cruel and unusual punishment.

   We accept Betts v. Brady's assumption, based as it was on
our prior cases, that a provision of the Bill of Rights which is
"fundamental and essential to a fair trial" is made obligatory
upon the States by the Fourteenth Amendment. We think the
Court in Betts was wrong, however, in concluding that the
Sixth Amendment's guarantee of counsel is not one of these
fundamental rights. Ten years before Betts v. Brady, this Court,
after full consideration of all the historical data examined in
Betts, had unequivocally declared that "the right to the aid of
counsel is of this fundamental character."

   The fact is that in deciding as it did--that "appointment
of counsel is not a fundamental right, essential to a fair
trial"--the Court in Betts v. Brady made an abrupt break with
its own well-considered precedents. In returning to these old
precedents, sounder we believe than the new, we but restore
constitutional principles established to achieve a fair system
of justice. Not only these precedents but also reason and
reflection require us to recognize that in our adversary system
of criminal justice, any person hauled into court, who is too
poor to hire a lawyer, cannot be assured a fair trial unless
counsel is provided for him. This seems to us to be an obvious
truth. Governments, both state and federal, quite properly
                                          GIDEON V. WAINWRIGHT (1963) | 711

spend vast sums of money to establish machinery to try
defendants accused of crime. Lawyers to prosecute are
everywhere deemed essential to protect the public's interest in
an orderly society. Similarly, there are few defendants charged
with crime, few indeed, who fail to hire the best lawyers they
can get to prepare and present their defenses. That government
hires lawyers to prosecute and defendants who have the money
hire lawyers to defend are the strongest indications of the wide-
spread belief that lawyers in criminal courts are necessities, not
luxuries. The right of one charged with crime to counsel may
not be deemed fundamental and essential to fair trials in some
countries, but it is in ours. From the very beginning, our state
and national constitutions and laws have laid great emphasis
on procedural and substantive safeguards designed to assure
fair trials before impartial tribunals in which every defendant
stands equal before the law. This noble ideal cannot be realized
if the poor man charged with crime has to face his accusers
without a lawyer to assist him. A defendant's need for a lawyer
is nowhere better stated than in the moving words of Mr.
Justice Sutherland in Powell v. Alabama:

   "The right to be heard would be, in many cases, of little avail
if it did not comprehend the right to be heard by counsel. Even
the intelligent and educated layman has small and sometimes
no skill in the science of law. If charged with crime, he is
incapable, generally, of determining for himself whether the
indictment is good or bad. He is unfamiliar with the rules
of evidence. Left without the aid of counsel he may be put
712 | GIDEON V. WAINWRIGHT (1963)

on trial without a proper charge, and convicted upon
incompetent evidence, or evidence irrelevant to the issue or
otherwise inadmissible. He lacks both the skill and knowledge
adequately to prepare his defense, even though he have a
perfect one. He requires the guiding hand of counsel at every
step in the proceedings against him. Without it, though he be
not guilty, he faces the danger of conviction because he does
not know how to establish his innocence."

   The Court in Betts v. Brady departed from the sound
wisdom upon which the Court's holding in Powell v. Alabama
rested. Florida, supported by two other States, has asked that
Betts v. Brady be left intact. Twenty-two States, as friends of
the Court, argue that Betts was "an anachronism when handed
down" and that it should now be overruled. We agree.

   The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded to the
Supreme Court of Florida for further action not inconsistent
with this opinion.

       Notes, Comments, and
                Questions

After the Court decided Gideon v. Wainwright, the state of
Florida retried Gideon. He was represented by counsel at his
second trial and was acquitted.

   In Argersinger v. Hamlin, 407 U.S. 25 (1972), the Court
extended the rule of Gideon to all cases in which a defendant
faces possible imprisonment, rejecting an argument it should
                                          GIDEON V. WAINWRIGHT (1963) | 713

be limited to cases in which a substantial prison sentence was
possible. "The requirement of counsel may well be necessary
for a fair trial even in a petty offense prosecution. We are by
no means convinced that legal and constitutional questions
involved in a case that actually leads to imprisonment even for
a brief period are any less complex than when a person can be
sent off for six months or more." Id. at 33.91

   Students should note that because the Assistance of
Counsel Clause applies only to "criminal prosecutions," the
holding of Gideon does not provide a right to appointed
counsel in all serious cases, only criminal cases. For example, a
person at risk of deportation in immigration court has no right
to counsel under Gideon, nor does a housing court litigant at
risk of eviction, nor does a civil defendant sued for millions of
dollars.

   Students should also note that the right to trial by jury exists
only if the maximum potential sentence exceeds six months. If
the maximum is exactly six months or less, then the prosecutor
can have a bench trial even if defendant objects. See Duncan v.
Louisiana, 391 U.S. 145 (1968); see also Baldwin v. New York,
399 U.S. 66 (1970). If the statutory maximum is, say, eight
months, then prosecutor can say she won't seek a sentence
in excess of six months to avoid dealing with a jury. If the
defendant is charged with two counts, and each count has
a maximum sentence of four months, that does not exceed
six months for purposes of this rule. The test is whether any
offense has a maximum possible sentence above six months.
714 | GIDEON V. WAINWRIGHT (1963)

(Also, in actual practice, someone convicted on two counts,
each with a maximum sentence of four months, usually serves
four months rather than eight months. Sentences for multiple
counts usually run concurrently instead of consecutively,
absent an unusual statute.)

   Because the "assistance of counsel" would have little value
if the defendant's lawyer literally arrived only for the trial and
provided help at no other time, the Court has held that
defendants have the right to counsel not only at trial but also at
other "critical stages" of the prosecution. These "critical stages"
include: post-indictment line-ups (see United States v. Wade,
chapter 38), preliminary hearings (see Coleman v. Alabama,
399 U.S. 1 (1970)), post-indictment interrogations (see
Massiah, chapter 29), and arraignments (see Hamilton v.
Alabama, 368 U.S. 52 (1961)). Recall also Rothgery v.
Gillespie County (discussed in Chapter 29), in which the
Court held that the right to counsel attaches at a defendant's
first presentation before judicial officer, even if no lawyer is
there for the prosecution.

   By contrast, a defendant has no right to government-funded
counsel after the conclusion of initial (direct) appeals.
Accordingly, for certiorari petitions, habeas corpus petitions,
and similar efforts, the defendant must pay a lawyer, find pro
bono counsel, or proceed pro se.

   Since the Court decided Gideon, states have created systems
for the provision of counsel to indigent criminal defendants.
The quality of these systems varies tremendously from state to
                                          GIDEON V. WAINWRIGHT (1963) | 715

state. Common issues confronted by states include the quality
of appointed counsel--especially in complicated cases, and
most especially in capital cases--as well as funding to pay
lawyers, experts, and other costs. States also diverge in their
definitions of who qualifies as sufficiently indigent for
appointed counsel. For a review of the state of indigent defense
in the states, see the articles collected in the Summer 2010
symposium issue of the Missouri Law Review, entitled "Broke
and Broken: Can We Fix Our State Indigent Defense System?"
Topics include ethical duties lawyers owe to indigent clients,
state constitutional challenges to inadequate indigent defense
systems, and ethical issues provided by excessive caseloads. One
recent example of a state system in crisis occurred in 2016,
when the lead public defender in Missouri attempted to assign
a criminal case to the state's governor, claiming that grievous
underfunding justified the unusual move.92

INEFFECTIVE
ASSISTANCE OF
COUNSEL

    Ineffective Assistance of
               Counsel

The Sixth Amendment right to counsel has never been
interpreted to mean that all defendants have the right to
perfect, or even to very good, counsel. However, if the quality
of counsel falls below the minimum standards of the legal
profession, a convicted defendant may sometimes have a
conviction set aside on the basis of "ineffective assistance of
counsel." In Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984),
the Court set forth the standard for ineffective assistance
claims. Below, Justice Thurgood Marshall described the
standards in the course of disagreeing with the majority
decision announcing these standards.
STRICKLAND V.
WASHINGTON (1984)

   Strickland v. Washington
                 (1984)

   Justice MARSHALL, dissenting.
   The Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments guarantee a person
accused of a crime the right to the aid of a lawyer in preparing
and presenting his defense. It has long been settled that "the
right to counsel is the right to the effective assistance of
counsel." The state and lower federal courts have developed
standards for distinguishing effective from inadequate
assistance. Today, for the first time, this Court attempts to
synthesize and clarify those standards. For the most part, the
majority's efforts are unhelpful. Neither of its two principal
holdings seems to me likely to improve the adjudication of
Sixth Amendment claims. And, in its zeal to survey
comprehensively this field of doctrine, the majority makes
many other generalizations and suggestions that I find
unacceptable. Most importantly, the majority fails to take
adequate account of the fact that the locus of this case is a
718 | STRICKLAND V. WASHINGTON (1984)

capital sentencing proceeding. Accordingly, I join neither the
Court's opinion nor its judgment.

   The opinion of the Court revolves around two holdings.
First, the majority ties the constitutional minima of attorney
performance to a simple "standard of reasonableness." Second,
the majority holds that only an error of counsel that has
sufficient impact on a trial to "undermine confidence in the
outcome" is grounds for overturning a conviction. I disagree
with both of these rulings.

   My objection to the performance standard adopted by the
Court is that it is so malleable that, in practice, it will either
have no grip at all or will yield excessive variation in the manner
in which the Sixth Amendment is interpreted and applied by
different courts. To tell lawyers and the lower courts that
counsel for a criminal defendant must behave "reasonably"
and must act like "a reasonably competent attorney" is to tell
them almost nothing. In essence, the majority has instructed
judges called upon to assess claims of ineffective assistance of
counsel to advert to their own intuitions regarding what
constitutes "professional" representation, and has discouraged
them from trying to develop more detailed standards
governing the performance of defense counsel. In my view, the
Court has thereby not only abdicated its own responsibility to
interpret the Constitution, but also impaired the ability of the
lower courts to exercise theirs.

   I object to the prejudice standard adopted by the Court
for two independent reasons. First, it is often very difficult
                                  STRICKLAND V. WASHINGTON (1984) | 719

to tell whether a defendant convicted after a trial in which
he was ineffectively represented would have fared better if his
lawyer had been competent. Seemingly impregnable cases can
sometimes be dismantled by good defense counsel. On the
basis of a cold record, it may be impossible for a reviewing
court confidently to ascertain how the government's evidence
and arguments would have stood up against rebuttal and cross-
examination by a shrewd, well-prepared lawyer. The
difficulties of estimating prejudice after the fact are exacerbated
by the possibility that evidence of injury to the defendant may
be missing from the record precisely because of the
incompetence of defense counsel. In view of all these
impediments to a fair evaluation of the probability that the
outcome of a trial was affected by ineffectiveness of counsel, it
seems to me senseless to impose on a defendant whose lawyer
has been shown to have been incompetent the burden of
demonstrating prejudice.

   Second and more fundamentally, the assumption on which
the Court's holding rests is that the only purpose of the
constitutional guarantee of effective assistance of counsel is
to reduce the chance that innocent persons will be convicted.
In my view, the guarantee also functions to ensure that
convictions are obtained only through fundamentally fair
procedures. The majority contends that the Sixth Amendment
is not violated when a manifestly guilty defendant is convicted
after a trial in which he was represented by a manifestly
ineffective attorney. I cannot agree. Every defendant is entitled
720 | STRICKLAND V. WASHINGTON (1984)

to a trial in which his interests are vigorously and
conscientiously advocated by an able lawyer. A proceeding in
which the defendant does not receive meaningful assistance
in meeting the forces of the State does not, in my opinion,
constitute due process.

   [Justice Marshall then argued that even under the standard
set forth by the majority, Strickland's claim should have
prevailed.]

       Notes, Comments, and
                Questions

The Strickland standard requires two showings from the
defendant. First, the defendant must show that there was a
deficiency in the attorney's performance, and second, the
defendant must how that that deficiency prejudiced the
defense. In other words, the defendant must show that but for
the attorney's unprofessional errors, the outcome might well
have been different.

   Justice Marshall, on the other hand, focuses on the fairness
of the process. He finds the requirement that a defendant
prove prejudice, even after his attorney has been shown to be
ineffective, is "senseless" because of the difficulties in making
such a showing. Justice Marshall proposes the Sixth
Amendment is violated when a defendant is represented by
a manifestly ineffective attorney regardless of what other
evidence of guilt the prosecution might possess.
                                   STRICKLAND V. WASHINGTON (1984) | 721

   Students should consider whether they find the majority
or Justice Marshall more persuasive. Why? What are the
problems, if any, with the majority's standard (or its
application of the standard to the facts before it)? What are the
problems, if any, with Justice Marshall's proposed alternative?

   While Strickland articulated a two-pronged test applicable
when a defendant points to a specific error made by counsel,
prejudice is presumed (that is, the defendant needs to prove
it) when the defendant's ineffective assistance claim rests on
counsel's failure "to subject the prosecution's case to
meaningful adversarial testing." United States v. Cronic, 466
U.S. 648 (1984). The Court in Cronic, articulated that
surrounding circumstances (rather than specific error) can give
rise to a presumption of prejudice when counsel's overall
deficiency is akin to having no counsel at all. Some circuit
courts have expanded the Cronic standard to encompass
counsel that sleep during the entirety of trial and counsel that
ask no questions on cross examination.

   In our next chapter, we continue our examination of
ineffective assistance claims. We also review when a criminal
defendant may represent himself and when a Court may deny
that option to a defendant.

MISSOURI V. FRYE (2012)

              Supreme Court of the United States

    Missouri v. Galin E. Frye

            Decided March 21, 2012 - 566 U.S. 134

   Justice KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court.
   The Sixth Amendment, applicable to the States by the terms
of the Fourteenth Amendment, provides that the accused shall
have the assistance of counsel in all criminal prosecutions. The
right to counsel is the right to effective assistance of counsel.
This case arises in the context of claimed ineffective assistance
that led to the lapse of a prosecution offer of a plea bargain,
a proposal that offered terms more lenient than the terms of
the guilty plea entered later. The initial question is whether the
constitutional right to counsel extends to the negotiation and
consideration of plea offers that lapse or are rejected. If there
is a right to effective assistance with respect to those offers,
a further question is what a defendant must demonstrate in
order to show that prejudice resulted from counsel's deficient
performance.
                                                    MISSOURI V. FRYE (2012) | 727

                       I

In August 2007, respondent Galin Frye was charged with
driving with a revoked license. Frye had been convicted for
that offense on three other occasions, so the State of Missouri
charged him with a class D felony, which carries a maximum
term of imprisonment of four years.

   On November 15, the prosecutor sent a letter to Frye's
counsel offering a choice of two plea bargains. The prosecutor
first offered to recommend a 3-year sentence if there was a
guilty plea to the felony charge, without a recommendation
regarding probation but with a recommendation that Frye
serve 10 days in jail as so-called "shock" time. The second offer
was to reduce the charge to a misdemeanor and, if Frye pleaded
guilty to it, to recommend a 90-day sentence. The
misdemeanor charge of driving with a revoked license carries a
maximum term of imprisonment of one year. The letter stated
both offers would expire on December 28. Frye's attorney did
not advise Frye that the offers had been made. The offers
expired.

   Frye's preliminary hearing was scheduled for January 4,
2008. On December 30, 2007, less than a week before the
hearing, Frye was again arrested for driving with a revoked
license. At the January 4 hearing, Frye waived his right to a
preliminary hearing on the charge arising from the August
2007 arrest. He pleaded not guilty at a subsequent arraignment
but then changed his plea to guilty. There was no underlying
728 | MISSOURI V. FRYE (2012)

plea agreement. The state trial court accepted Frye's guilty
plea. The prosecutor recommended a 3-year sentence, made no
recommendation regarding probation, and requested 10 days
shock time in jail. The trial judge sentenced Frye to three years
in prison.

   Frye filed for postconviction relief in state court. He alleged
his counsel's failure to inform him of the prosecution's plea
offer denied him the effective assistance of counsel. At an
evidentiary hearing, Frye testified he would have entered a
guilty plea to the misdemeanor had he known about the offer.

   A state court denied the postconviction motion, but the
Missouri Court of Appeals reversed.To implement a remedy
for the violation, the court deemed Frye's guilty plea
withdrawn and remanded to allow Frye either to insist on a
trial or to plead guilty to any offense the prosecutor deemed it
appropriate to charge. This Court granted certiorari.

                       II

                         A

It is well settled that the right to the effective assistance of
counsel applies to certain steps before trial. The "Sixth
Amendment guarantees a defendant the right to have counsel
present at all `critical' stages of the criminal proceedings."
Critical stages include arraignments, postindictment
                                                    MISSOURI V. FRYE (2012) | 729

interrogations, postindictment lineups, and the entry of a
guilty plea.

   With respect to the right to effective counsel in plea
negotiations, a proper beginning point is to discuss two cases
from this Court considering the role of counsel in advising
a client about a plea offer and an ensuing guilty plea: Hill v.
Lockhart, 474 U.S. 52 (1985) and Padilla v. Kentucky, 559
U.S. 356 (2010).

   Hill established that claims of ineffective assistance of
counsel in the plea bargain context are governed by the two-
part test set forth in Strickland. As noted above, in Frye's case,
the Missouri Court of Appeals, applying the two part test
of Strickland, determined first that defense counsel had been
ineffective and second that there was resulting prejudice.

   In Hill, the decision turned on the second part of the
Strickland test. There, a defendant who had entered a guilty
plea claimed his counsel had misinformed him of the amount
of time he would have to serve before he became eligible for
parole. But the defendant had not alleged that, even if
adequate advice and assistance had been given, he would have
elected to plead not guilty and proceed to trial. Thus, the
Court found that no prejudice from the inadequate advice had
been shown or alleged.

   In Padilla, the Court again discussed the duties of counsel
in advising a client with respect to a plea offer that leads to a
guilty plea. Padilla held that a guilty plea, based on a plea offer,
should be set aside because counsel misinformed the defendant
730 | MISSOURI V. FRYE (2012)

of the immigration consequences of the conviction. The
Court made clear that "the negotiation of a plea bargain is
a critical phase of litigation for purposes of the Sixth
Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel." It also
rejected the argument made by petitioner in this case that a
knowing and voluntary plea supersedes errors by defense
counsel.

   The State is correct to point out that Hill and Padilla
concerned whether there was ineffective assistance leading to
acceptance of a plea offer, a process involving a formal court
appearance with the defendant and all counsel present. Before
a guilty plea is entered the defendant's understanding of the
plea and its consequences can be established on the record.
This affords the State substantial protection against later
claims that the plea was the result of inadequate advice. At
the plea entry proceedings the trial court and all counsel have
the opportunity to establish on the record that the defendant
understands the process that led to any offer, the advantages
and disadvantages of accepting it, and the sentencing
consequences or possibilities that will ensue once a conviction
is entered based upon the plea. Hill and Padilla both illustrate
that, nevertheless, there may be instances when claims of
ineffective assistance can arise after the conviction is entered.
Still, the State, and the trial court itself, have had a substantial
opportunity to guard against this contingency by establishing
at the plea entry proceeding that the defendant has been given
proper advice or, if the advice received appears to have been
                                                    MISSOURI V. FRYE (2012) | 731

inadequate, to remedy that deficiency before the plea is
accepted and the conviction entered.

   ***And, as noted, the State insists there is no right to receive
a plea offer. For all these reasons, the State contends, it is unfair
to subject it to the consequences of defense counsel's
inadequacies, especially when the opportunities for a full and
fair trial, or, as here, for a later guilty plea albeit on less
favorable terms, are preserved.

   The State's contentions are neither illogical nor without
some persuasive force, yet they do not suffice to overcome
a simple reality. Ninety-seven percent of federal convictions
and ninety-four percent of state convictions are the result of
guilty pleas. The reality is that plea bargains have become so
central to the administration of the criminal justice system
that defense counsel have responsibilities in the plea bargain
process, responsibilities that must be met to render the
adequate assistance of counsel that the Sixth Amendment
requires in the criminal process at critical stages. Because ours
"is for the most part a system of pleas, not a system of trials,"
it is insufficient simply to point to the guarantee of a fair trial
as a backstop that inoculates any errors in the pretrial process.
"To a large extent ... horse trading [between prosecutor and
defense counsel] determines who goes to jail and for how long.
That is what plea bargaining is. It is not some adjunct to the
criminal justice system; it is the criminal justice system." In
today's criminal justice system, therefore, the negotiation of
732 | MISSOURI V. FRYE (2012)

a plea bargain, rather than the unfolding of a trial, is almost
always the critical point for a defendant.

   To note the prevalence of plea bargaining is not to criticize
it. The potential to conserve valuable prosecutorial resources
and for defendants to admit their crimes and receive more
favorable terms at sentencing means that a plea agreement can
benefit both parties. In order that these benefits can be
realized, however, criminal defendants require effective
counsel during plea negotiations. "Anything less ... might deny
a defendant `effective representation by counsel at the only
stage when legal aid and advice would help him.'"

                         B

Here the question is whether defense counsel has the duty to
communicate the terms of a formal offer to accept a plea on
terms and conditions that may result in a lesser sentence, a
conviction on lesser charges, or both.

   This Court now holds that, as a general rule, defense
counsel has the duty to communicate formal offers from the
prosecution to accept a plea on terms and conditions that may
be favorable to the accused. Any exceptions to that rule need
not be explored here, for the offer was a formal one with a
fixed expiration date. When defense counsel allowed the offer
to expire without advising the defendant or allowing him to
consider it, defense counsel did not render the effective
assistance the Constitution requires.
                                                    MISSOURI V. FRYE (2012) | 733

   ***There appears to be a reasonable probability Frye would
have accepted the prosecutor's original offer of a plea bargain if
the offer had been communicated to him, because he pleaded
guilty to a more serious charge, with no promise of a
sentencing recommendation from the prosecutor.

       Notes, Comments, and
                Questions

In general, courts reviewing claims of ineffective assistance of
counsel are deferential to decisions by lawyers that can
plausibly be described as "strategy." Notwithstanding the
result in McCoy, lawyers enjoy broad latitude to decide how
to achieve a client's objectives, and judges rarely second guess
choices simply because bad results followed. By contrast,
ineffective assistance claims have greater success when a
lawyer's action (or inaction) appears driven by laziness rather
than by tactics.

   For example, a lawyer who interviews a potential alibi
witness and chooses not to call her as a trial witness can later
explain the strategy behind the choice. Perhaps the witness
seemed shifty and counsel feared the jury would think poorly
of a defendant who called such a witness. But if a client tells
a lawyer of a potential alibi witness, and the lawyer conducts
no investigation, the lawyer may have trouble justifying that
choice.

   Relatedly, defense lawyers have a duty to obtain expert
734 | MISSOURI V. FRYE (2012)

testimony in cases where any reasonable lawyer would do so.
An insanity defense, for example, will normally require expert
testimony about the client's mental health.

   A few examples help illustrate the sorts of failings that
constitute ineffective assistance:

   In Hinton v. Alabama, 571 U.S. 263 (2014), the lawyer in a
capital case had failed to obtain a qualified expert on "firearms
and toolmark" evidence, largely because the lawyer
erroneously believed that state law authorized only $1,000 for
the cost of an expert. The Court held, "The trial attorney's
failure to request additional funding in order to replace an
expert he knew to be inadequate because he mistakenly
believed that he had received all he could get under Alabama
law constituted deficient performance." Subsequently, Hinton
was exonerated and released after thirty years in prison. He
tells his story in The Sun Does Shine: How I Found Life and
Freedom on Death Row (2018).

   In Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S. 510 (2003), the Court found
ineffective assistance in the penalty phase of a capital case after
trial counsel failed to conduct an adequate investigation into
the defendant's background. "Counsel's decision not to
expand their investigation beyond the [presentence
investigation (PSI) report] and the [Baltimore City
Department of Social Services (DSS)] records fell short of the
professional standards that prevailed in Maryland in 1989."

   In Rompilla v. Beard, 545 U.S. 374 (2005), the Court found
ineffective assistance in a lawyer's failure to examine a capital
                                                    MISSOURI V. FRYE (2012) | 735

defendant's prior case files. "Counsel knew that the
Commonwealth intended to seek the death penalty by proving
Rompilla had a significant history of felony convictions
indicating the use or threat of violence, an aggravator under
state law. ... [I]t is difficult to see how counsel could have failed
to realize that without examining the readily available file they
were seriously compromising their opportunity to respond to
a case for aggravation."

   Rompilla offers insight on how changes to Court
membership can affect constitutional law. Justice Sandra Day
O'Connor voted with the majority, and the case was decided
5-4. (She joined the majority opinion and also filed a
concurrence.) About two weeks afterward, O'Connor
announced her retirement. O'Connor's seat on the Court was
then filled by Justice Samuel Alito, who joined the Court in
2006. As it happens, the Third Circuit judgment reversed by
the Supreme Court in Rompilla was explained in an opinion
written by then-Circuit Judge Alito. See 355 F.3d 233. Would
a case with similar facts be decided the same way today?
FARETTA V. CALIFORNIA
(1975)

         Self-Representation by Criminal Defendants

   Faretta v. California (1975)

In Faretta v. California, 422 U.S. 806 (1975), the Court
considered "whether a defendant in a state criminal trial has
a constitutional right to proceed without counsel when he
voluntarily and intelligently elects to do so." The Court said
that another way to frame the question was "whether a State
may constitutionally hale a person into its criminal courts and
there force a lawyer upon him, even when he insists that he
wants to conduct his own defense."

   In an opinion by Justice Stewart, the Court noted that a
defendant's right to represent himself in criminal cases had
long been recognized in America. "In the federal courts, the
right of self-representation has been protected by statute since
the beginnings of our Nation. With few exceptions, each of
the several States also accords a defendant the right to represent
himself in any criminal case. The constitutions of 36 States
explicitly confer that right. Moreover, many state courts have
                                           FARETTA V. CALIFORNIA (1975) | 737

expressed the view that the right is also supported by the
Constitution of the United States." Recognizing that
longstanding practice has its own persuasive authority, the
Court wrote, "We confront here a nearly universal conviction,
on the part of our people as well as our courts, that forcing
a lawyer upon an unwilling defendant is contrary to his basic
right to defend himself if he truly wants to do so."

   The Court noted, too, that the Sixth Amendment provides
the defendant with various rights; the rights are not provided
to the lawyer. "The Sixth Amendment does not provide
merely that a defense shall be made for the accused; it grants
to the accused personally the right to make his defense. It
is the accused, not counsel, who must be `informed of the
nature and cause of the accusation,' who must be `confronted
with the witnesses against him,' and who must be accorded
`compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor.'
Although not stated in the Amendment in so many words,
the right to self-representation--to make one's own defense
personally--is thus necessarily implied by the structure of the
Amendment. The right to defend is given directly to the
accused; for it is he who suffers the consequences if the defense
fails."

   The Court then decided that even though a defendant
would normally be extraordinarily foolish to forgo the
assistance of counsel in favor of self-representation, the
Constitution provides the option:

   "It is undeniable that in most criminal prosecutions
738 | FARETTA V. CALIFORNIA (1975)

defendants could better defend with counsel's guidance than
by their own unskilled efforts. But where the defendant will
not voluntarily accept representation by counsel, the potential
advantage of a lawyer's training and experience can be realized,
if at all, only imperfectly. To force a lawyer on a defendant can
only lead him to believe that the law contrives against him.
Moreover, it is not inconceivable that in some rare instances,
the defendant might in fact present his case more effectively by
conducting his own defense. Personal liberties are not rooted
in the law of averages. The right to defend is personal. The
defendant, and not his lawyer or the State, will bear the
personal consequences of a conviction. It is the defendant,
therefore, who must be free personally to decide whether in his
particular case counsel is to his advantage."

   When a defendant wishes to forgo counsel, a trial judge
must advise the defendant carefully of the consequences. The
decision then belongs to the defendant.

   The Court's decision inspired a spirited dissent.
   Mr. Chief Justice BURGER, with whom Mr. Justice
BLACKMUN and Mr. Justice REHNQUIST join,
dissenting.
   This case [] is another example of the judicial tendency to
constitutionalize what is thought "good." That effort fails on
its own terms here, because there is nothing desirable or useful
in permitting every accused person, even the most uneducated
and inexperienced, to insist upon conducting his own defense
to criminal charges. Moreover, there is no constitutional basis
                                           FARETTA V. CALIFORNIA (1975) | 739

for the Court's holding, and it can only add to the problems of
an already malfunctioning criminal justice system. I therefore
dissent.

   The fact of the matter is that in all but an extraordinarily
small number of cases an accused will lose whatever defense
he may have if he undertakes to conduct the trial himself.
The Court's opinion in Powell v. Alabama puts the point
eloquently:

   "Even the intelligent and educated layman has small and
sometimes no skill in the science of law. If charged with crime,
he is incapable, generally, of determining for himself whether
the indictment is good or bad. He is unfamiliar with the rules
of evidence. Left without the aid of counsel he may be put
on trial without a proper charge, and convicted upon
incompetent evidence, or evidence irrelevant to the issue or
otherwise inadmissible. He lacks both the skill and knowledge
adequately to prepare his defense, even though he have a
perfect one. He requires the guiding hand of counsel at every
step in the proceedings against him. Without it, though he be
not guilty, he faces the danger of conviction because he does
not know how to establish his innocence. If that be true of
men of intelligence, how much more true is it of the ignorant
and illiterate, or those of feeble intellect."

   Obviously, these considerations do not vary depending
upon whether the accused actively desires to be represented
by counsel or wishes to proceed pro se. Nor is it accurate to
suggest, as the Court seems to later in its opinion, that the
740 | FARETTA V. CALIFORNIA (1975)

quality of his representation at trial is a matter with which
only the accused is legitimately concerned. Although we have
adopted an adversary system of criminal justice, the
prosecution is more than an ordinary litigant, and the trial
judge is not simply an automaton who insures that technical
rules are adhered to. Both are charged with the duty of
insuring that justice, in the broadest sense of that term, is
achieved in every criminal trial. That goal is ill-served, and the
integrity of and public confidence in the system are
undermined, when an easy conviction is obtained due to the
defendant's ill-advised decision to waive counsel. The damage
thus inflicted is not mitigated by the lame explanation that the
defendant simply availed himself of the "freedom" "to go to
jail under his own banner ...." The system of criminal justice
should not be available as an instrument of self-destruction.

   In short, both the "spirit and the logic" of the Sixth
Amendment are that every person accused of crime shall
receive the fullest possible defense; in the vast majority of cases
this command can be honored only by means of the expressly
guaranteed right to counsel, and the trial judge is in the best
position to determine whether the accused is capable of
conducting his defense. True freedom of choice and society's
interest in seeing that justice is achieved can be vindicated only
if the trial court retains discretion to reject any attempted
waiver of counsel and insist that the accused be tried according
to the Constitution. This discretion is as critical an element of
                                            FARETTA V. CALIFORNIA (1975) | 741

basic fairness as a trial judge's discretion to decline to accept a
plea of guilty.

   Society has the right to expect that, when courts find new
rights implied in the Constitution, their potential effect upon
the resources of our criminal justice system will be considered.
However, such considerations are conspicuously absent from
the Court's opinion in this case.

       Notes, Comments, and
                Questions

After the Court decided Faretta, a few sensational cases
followed in which criminal defendants represented themselves
in especially ineffective ways, perhaps causing embarrassment
to the judicial system in addition to themselves. The case of
Colin Ferguson, who shot fellow passengers on a Long Island
Rail Road train in 1993, became especially famous. Ferguson
killed six passengers and shot several others. He later
represented himself at trial, questioning victims he had shot.
He referred to himself in the third person, stating, for example,
that "at the time that Mr. Ferguson was on the train," he fell
asleep and then someone else took his gun.

   He asked one witness, "Is it your testimony that the
defendant Ferguson stood right in front of you and shot you?"

   The witness answered, "You weren't right in front of me.
You were about ten to twelve feet away, approximately the
distance we're at about now."
742 | FARETTA V. CALIFORNIA (1975)

   His performance was parodied on Saturday Night Life. "I
did not shoot them. They shot me," the SNL Ferguson said in
his opening statement. He continued, "There is no such thing
as a `railroad' or a `Long Island.' Colin Ferguson is the victim
of a conspiracy."

   Do cases like these show that Faretta is wrongly decided, or
are they a necessary evil associated with vindicating the rights
explained by the Court?

   In Indiana v. Edwards, the Court considered how to apply
Faretta to defendants who may lack the mental competence
to conduct their own defense. Students should note that the
mental state of a defendant can be evaluated at three different
times (at least) for different purposes. For a defense based on
insanity or mental disease or defect, the question is what
mental state the defendant had at the moment she committed
an offense. Regardless of the defendant's mental state at the
crime scene, a court may deem someone incompetent to stand
trial if she is unable to understand the character and
consequences of the proceedings against her or is unable
properly to assist in her defense (that is, to communicate with
counsel about defense strategies). Finally, there is the question
of whether a defendant who is competent to stand trial might
nonetheless be incompetent to represent himself. The
Edwards Court decided whether such a category of defendants
exists and, if so, how trial courts should deal with them.

   Justice BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court.
   This case focuses upon a criminal defendant whom a state
court found mentally competent to stand trial if represented
by counsel but not mentally competent to conduct that trial
himself. We must decide whether in these circumstances the
Constitution prohibits a State from insisting that the
defendant proceed to trial with counsel, the State thereby
denying the defendant the right to represent himself. We
conclude that the Constitution does not forbid a State so to
insist.

   Our next case concerns eyewitness identifications evidence.
We will examine first when the Court has held that a suspect
has the right to have counsel attend an identification

regulations on the quality of such procedures, along with best
practices for identifications suggested by modern social
science.
PART XXXII

IDENTIFICATION:
RIGHT TO
COUNSEL

 Identifications and the Right
             to Counsel

In this chapter we begin our three-chapter unit on
identification evidence, which generally consists of witness
statements about who committed a crime. A victim or other
witness can identify a perpetrator in court (saying, in front
of the jury, something like, "That's the one who did it"), and
police often ask witnesses to identify suspects out of court.
Out-of-court identification procedures include lineups--at
which several similar-looking persons are presented to a
witness in the hope that the witness will identify the correct
person--as well as less elaborate presentations which are
essentially lineups with only one suspect, about whom the
witness says "yes" or "no." Further, police can show photos
to witnesses, a process much quicker than in-person
identification.
746 | IDENTIFICATION: RIGHT TO COUNSEL

   This chapter concerns when a suspect has the right to have
counsel present during an identification procedure.
UNITED STATES V.
WADE (1967)

              Supreme Court of the United States

   United States v. Billy Joe
                 Wade

             Decided June 12, 1967 - 388 U.S. 218

   Mr. Justice BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the
Court.

   The question here is whether courtroom identifications of
an accused at trial are to be excluded from evidence because
the accused was exhibited to the witnesses before trial at a
post-indictment lineup conducted for identification purposes
without notice to and in the absence of the accused's
appointed counsel.

   The federally insured bank in Eustace, Texas, was robbed
on September 21, 1964. A man with a small strip of tape
on each side of his face entered the bank, pointed a pistol
at the female cashier and the vice president, the only persons
748 | UNITED STATES V. WADE (1967)

in the bank at the time, and forced them to fill a pillowcase
with the bank's money. The man then drove away with an
accomplice who had been waiting in a stolen car outside the
bank. On March 23, 1965, an indictment was returned against
respondent, Wade, and two others for conspiring to rob the
bank, and against Wade and the accomplice for the robbery
itself. Wade was arrested on April 2, and counsel was
appointed to represent him on April 26. Fifteen days later an
FBI agent, without notice to Wade's lawyer, arranged to have
the two bank employees observe a lineup made up of Wade and
five or six other prisoners and conducted in a courtroom of the
local county courthouse. Each person in the line wore strips of
tape such as allegedly worn by the robber and upon direction
each said something like `put the money in the bag,' the words
allegedly uttered by the robber. Both bank employees
identified Wade in the lineup as the bank robber.

   At trial the two employees, when asked on direct
examination if the robber was in the courtroom, pointed to
Wade. The prior lineup identification was then elicited from
both employees on cross-examination. At the close of
testimony, Wade's counsel moved for a judgment of acquittal
or, alternatively, to strike the bank officials' courtroom
identifications on the ground that conduct of the lineup,
without notice to and in the absence of his appointed counsel,
violated his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-
incrimination and his Sixth Amendment right to the assistance
of counsel. The motion was denied, and Wade was convicted.
                                          UNITED STATES V. WADE (1967) | 749

The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed the
conviction and ordered a new trial at which the in-court
identification evidence was to be excluded. We granted
certiorari and set the case for oral argument with [other cases]
which present similar questions. We reverse the judgment of
the Court of Appeals and remand to that court with direction
to enter a new judgment vacating the conviction and
remanding the case to the District Court for further
proceedings consistent with this opinion.

                       I

Neither the lineup itself nor anything shown by this record
that Wade was required to do in the lineup violated his
privilege against self-incrimination. We have only recently
reaffirmed that the privilege "protects an accused only from
being compelled to testify against himself, or otherwise
provide the State with evidence of a testimonial or
communicative nature ...." "[T]he prohibition of compelling
a man in a criminal court to be witness against himself is a
prohibition of the use of physical or moral compulsion to
extort communications from him, not an exclusion of his body
as evidence when it may be material."

   We have no doubt that compelling the accused merely to
exhibit his person for observation by a prosecution witness
prior to trial involves no compulsion of the accused to give
evidence having testimonial significance. It is compulsion of
750 | UNITED STATES V. WADE (1967)

the accused to exhibit his physical characteristics, not
compulsion to disclose any knowledge he might have. ***

                       II

The fact that the lineup involved no violation of Wade's
privilege against self-incrimination does not, however, dispose
of his contention that the courtroom identifications should
have been excluded because the lineup was conducted without
notice to and in the absence of his counsel. [I]n this case it
is urged that the assistance of counsel at the lineup was
indispensable to protect Wade's most basic right as a criminal
defendant--his right to a fair trial at which the witnesses
against him might be meaningfully cross-examined.

   When the Bill of Rights was adopted, there were no
organized police forces as we know them today. The accused
confronted the prosecutor and the witnesses against him, and
the evidence was marshalled, largely at the trial itself. In
contrast, today's law enforcement machinery involves critical
confrontations of the accused by the prosecution at pretrial
proceedings where the results might well settle the accused's
fate and reduce the trial itself to a mere formality. In
recognition of these realities of modern criminal prosecution,
our cases have construed the Sixth Amendment guarantee to
apply to "critical" stages of the proceedings. The guarantee
reads: "In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the
right ... to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence." The
                                          UNITED STATES V. WADE (1967) | 751

plain wording of this guarantee thus encompasses counsel's
assistance whenever necessary to assure a meaningful
"defence."

   ***
   In sum, the principle of Powell v. Alabama and succeeding
cases requires that we scrutinize any pretrial confrontation of
the accused to determine whether the presence of his counsel
is necessary to preserve the defendant's basic right to a fair
trial as affected by his right meaningfully to cross-examine the
witnesses against him and to have effective assistance of
counsel at the trial itself. It calls upon us to analyze whether
potential substantial prejudice to defendant's rights inheres in
the particular confrontation and the ability of counsel to help
avoid that prejudice.

                      III

But the confrontation compelled by the State between the
accused and the victim or witnesses to a crime to elicit
identification evidence is peculiarly riddled with innumerable
dangers and variable factors which might seriously, even
crucially, derogate from a fair trial. The vagaries of eyewitness
identification are well-known; the annals of criminal law are
rife with instances of mistaken identification. Mr. Justice
Frankfurter once said: "What is the worth of identification
testimony even when uncontradicted? The identification of
strangers is proverbially untrustworthy. The hazards of such
752 | UNITED STATES V. WADE (1967)

testimony are established by a formidable number of instances
in the records of English and American trials. These instances
are recent--not due to the brutalities of ancient criminal
procedure." A major factor contributing to the high incidence
of miscarriage of justice from mistaken identification has been
the degree of suggestion inherent in the manner in which the
prosecution presents the suspect to witnesses for pretrial
identification. Suggestion can be created intentionally or
unintentionally in many subtle ways. And the dangers for the
suspect are particularly grave when the witness' opportunity
for observation was insubstantial, and thus his susceptibility to
suggestion the greatest.

   Moreover, "[i]t is a matter of common experience that, once
a witness has picked out the accused at the line-up, he is not
likely to go back on his word later on, so that in practice the
issue of identity may [in the absence of other relevant
evidence] for all practical purposes be determined there and
then, before the trial." 

   The pretrial confrontation for purpose of identification
may take the form of a lineup, also known as an "identification
parade" or "showup," as in the present case, or presentation
of the suspect alone to the witness. It is obvious that risks of
suggestion attend either form of confrontation and increase
the dangers inhering in eyewitness identification. But as is the
case with secret interrogations, there is serious difficulty in
depicting what transpires at lineups and other forms of
identification confrontations. "Privacy results in secrecy and
                                          UNITED STATES V. WADE (1967) | 753

this in turn results in a gap in our knowledge as to what in
fact goes on ...." For the same reasons, the defense can seldom
reconstruct the manner and mode of lineup identification for
judge or jury at trial. Those participating in a lineup with the
accused may often be police officers; in any event, the
participants' names are rarely recorded or divulged at trial. The
impediments to an objective observation are increased when
the victim is the witness. Lineups are prevalent in rape and
robbery prosecutions and present a particular hazard that a
victim's understandable outrage may excite vengeful or
spiteful motives. In any event, neither witnesses nor lineup
participants are apt to be alert for conditions prejudicial to the
suspect. And if they were, it would likely be of scant benefit to
the suspect since neither witnesses nor lineup participants are
likely to be schooled in the detection of suggestive influences.
Improper influences may go undetected by a suspect, guilty or
not, who experiences the emotional tension which we might
expect in one being confronted with potential accusers. Even
when he does observe abuse, if he has a criminal record he may
be reluctant to take the stand and open up the admission of
prior convictions. Moreover any protestations by the suspect
of the fairness of the lineup made at trial are likely to be in vain;
the jury's choice is between the accused's unsupported version
and that of the police officers present. In short, the accused's
inability effectively to reconstruct at trial any unfairness that
occurred at the lineup may deprive him of his only
754 | UNITED STATES V. WADE (1967)

opportunity meaningfully to attack the credibility of the
witness' courtroom identification.

   The potential for improper influence is illustrated by the
circumstances, insofar as they appear, surrounding the prior
identifications in the three cases we decide today. In the present
case, the testimony of the identifying witnesses elicited on
cross-examination revealed that those witnesses were taken to
the courthouse and seated in the courtroom to await assembly
of the lineup. The courtroom faced on a hallway observable
to the witnesses through an open door. The cashier testified
that she saw Wade "standing in the hall" within sight of an
FBI agent. Five or six other prisoners later appeared in the hall.
The vice president testified that he saw a person in the hall in
the custody of the agent who "resembled the person that we
identified as the one that had entered the bank."

   Insofar as the accused's conviction may rest on a courtroom
identification in fact the fruit of a suspect pretrial
identification which the accused is helpless to subject to
effective scrutiny at trial, the accused is deprived of that right
of cross-examination which is an essential safeguard to his right
to confront the witnesses against him. And even though cross-
examination is a precious safeguard to a fair trial, it cannot
be viewed as an absolute assurance of accuracy and reliability.
Thus in the present context, where so many variables and
pitfalls exist, the first line of defense must be the prevention
of unfairness and the lessening of the hazards of eyewitness
identification at the lineup itself. ***
                                          UNITED STATES V. WADE (1967) | 755

   Since it appears that there is grave potential for prejudice,
intentional or not, in the pretrial lineup, which may not be
capable of reconstruction at trial, and since presence of counsel
itself can often avert prejudice and assure a meaningful
confrontation at trial, there can be little doubt that for Wade
the postindictment lineup was a critical stage of the
prosecution at which he was "as much entitled to such aid
[of counsel]... as at the trial itself." Thus both Wade and his
counsel should have been notified of the impending lineup,
and counsel's presence should have been a requisite to conduct
of the lineup, absent an "intelligent waiver." [W]e leave open
the question whether the presence of substitute counsel might
not suffice where notification and presence of the suspect's
own counsel would result in prejudicial delay.

   ***

       Notes, Comments, and
                Questions

In Wade, the FBI held a lineup, and the defendant's counsel

KIRBY V. ILLINOIS (1972)

              Supreme Court of the United States

    Thomas Kirby v. Illinois

              Decided June 7, 1972 - 406 U.S. 682

   Mr. Justice STEWART announced the judgment of the
Court and an opinion in which THE CHIEF JUSTICE, Mr.
Justice BLACKMUN, and Mr. Justice REHNQUIST join.

   In United States v. Wade and Gilbert v. California this
Court held "that a post-indictment pretrial lineup at which
the accused is exhibited to identifying witnesses is a critical
stage of the criminal prosecution; that police conduct of such
a lineup without notice to and in the absence of his counsel
denies the accused his Sixth (and Fourteenth) Amendment
right to counsel and calls in question the admissibility at trial
of the in-court identifications of the accused by witnesses who
attended the lineup." Those cases further held that no "in-
court identifications" are admissible in evidence if their
"source" is a lineup conducted in violation of this
constitutional standard. "Only a per se exclusionary rule as to
                                                     KIRBY V. ILLINOIS (1972) | 757

such testimony can be an effective sanction," the Court said,
"to assure that law enforcement authorities will respect the
accused's constitutional right to the presence of his counsel at
the critical lineup." In the present case we are asked to extend
the Wade-Gilbert per se exclusionary rule to identification
testimony based upon a police station showup that took place
before the defendant had been indicted or otherwise formally
charged with any criminal offense.

   On February 21, 1968, a man named Willie Shard reported
to the Chicago police that the previous day two men had
robbed him on a Chicago street of a wallet containing, among
other things, traveler's checks and a Social Security card. On
February 22, two police officers stopped the petitioner and a
companion, Ralph Bean, on West Madison Street in Chicago.
When asked for identification, the petitioner produced a wallet
that contained three traveler's checks and a Social Security
card, all bearing the name of Willie Shard. Papers with Shard's
name on them were also found in Bean's possession. When
asked to explain his possession of Shard's property, the
petitioner first said that the traveler's checks were "play
money," and then told the officers that he had won them in a
crap game. The officers then arrested the petitioner and Bean
and took them to a police station.

   Only after arriving at the police station, and checking the
records there, did the arresting officers learn of the Shard
robbery. A police car was then dispatched to Shard's place of
employment, where it picked up Shard and brought him to
758 | KIRBY V. ILLINOIS (1972)

the police station. Immediately upon entering the room in
the police station where the petitioner and Bean were seated
at a table, Shard positively identified them as the men who
had robbed him two days earlier. No lawyer was present in
the room, and neither the petitioner nor Bean had asked for
legal assistance, or been advised of any right to the presence of
counsel.

   More than six weeks later, the petitioner and Bean were
indicted for the robbery of Willie Shard. Upon arraignment,
counsel was appointed to represent them, and they pleaded
not guilty. A pretrial motion to suppress Shard's identification
testimony was denied, and at the trial Shard testified as a
witness for the prosecution. In his testimony he described his
identification of the two men at the police station on February
22, and identified them again in the courtroom as the men
who had robbed him on February 20. He was cross-examined
at length regarding the circumstances of his identification of
the two defendants. The jury found both defendants guilty,
and the petitioner's conviction was affirmed on appeal. The
Illinois appellate court held that the admission of Shard's
testimony was not error, relying upon an earlier decision of
the Illinois Supreme Court ... that [held] the Wade-Gilbert
per se exclusionary rule is not applicable to preindictment
confrontations. We granted certiorari, limited to this
question.
                                                     KIRBY V. ILLINOIS (1972) | 759

                       I

***
   This is not to say that a defendant in a criminal case has

a constitutional right to counsel only at the trial itself. But
the point is that, while members of the Court have differed
as to existence of the right to counsel in the contexts of some
of the above cases, all of those cases have involved points of
time at or after the initiation of adversary judicial criminal
proceedings--whether by way of formal charge, preliminary
hearing, indictment, information, or arraignment.

   The initiation of judicial criminal proceedings is far from a
mere formalism. It is the starting point of our whole system
of adversary criminal justice. For it is only then that the
government has committed itself to prosecute, and only then
that the adverse positions of government and defendant have
solidified. It is then that a defendant finds himself faced with
the prosecutorial forces of organized society, and immersed in
the intricacies of substantive and procedural criminal law. It
is this point, therefore, that marks the commencement of the
"criminal prosecutions" to which alone the explicit guarantees
of the Sixth Amendment are applicable.

   In this case we are asked to import into a routine police
investigation an absolute constitutional guarantee historically
and rationally applicable only after the onset of formal
prosecutorial proceedings. We decline to do so. Less than a
year after Wade and Gilbert were decided, the Court explained
760 | KIRBY V. ILLINOIS (1972)

the rule of those decisions as follows: "The rationale of those
cases was that an accused is entitled to counsel at any `critical
stage of the prosecution,' and that a post-indictment lineup is
such a `critical stage.'" We decline to depart from that rationale
today by imposing a per se exclusionary rule upon testimony
concerning an identification that took place long before the
commencement of any prosecution whatever.

                       II

What has been said is not to suggest that there may not be
occasions during the course of a criminal investigation when
the police do abuse identification procedures. Such abuses are
not beyond the reach of the Constitution.The judgment is
affirmed.

   Mr. Justice BRENNAN, with whom Mr. Justice
DOUGLAS and Mr. Justice MARSHALL join, dissenting.

   While it should go without saying, it appears necessary, in
view of the plurality opinion today, to re-emphasize that Wade
did not require the presence of counsel at pretrial
confrontations for identification purposes simply on the basis
of an abstract consideration of the words "criminal
prosecutions" in the Sixth Amendment. Counsel is required
at those confrontations because "the dangers inherent in
eyewitness identification and the suggestibility inherent in the
context of the pretrial identification" mean that protection
must be afforded to the "most basic right [of] a criminal
                                                     KIRBY V. ILLINOIS (1972) | 761

defendant--his right to a fair trial at which the witnesses
against him might be meaningfully cross-examined."

   An arrest evidences the belief of the police that the
perpetrator of a crime has been caught. A post-arrest
confrontation for identification is not "a mere preparatory
step in the gathering of the prosecution's evidence." A
primary, and frequently sole, purpose of the confrontation for
identification at that stage is to accumulate proof to buttress
the conclusion of the police that they have the offender in
hand. The plurality offers no reason, and I can think of none,
for concluding that a post-arrest confrontation for
identification, unlike a post-charge confrontation, is not
among those "critical confrontations of the accused by the
prosecution at pretrial proceedings where the results might
well settle the accused's fate and reduce the trial itself to a mere
formality."

   The highly suggestive form of confrontation employed in
this case underscores the point. This showup was particularly
fraught with the peril of mistaken identification. In the setting
of a police station squad room where all present except
petitioner and Bean were police officers, the danger was quite
real that Shard's understandable resentment might lead him
too readily to agree with the police that the pair under arrest,
and the only persons exhibited to him, were indeed the
robbers. "It is hard to imagine a situation more clearly
conveying the suggestion to the witness that the one presented
is believed guilty by the police." The State had no case without
762 | KIRBY V. ILLINOIS (1972)

Shard's identification testimony,93 and safeguards against that
consequence were therefore of critical importance. Shard's
testimony itself demonstrates the necessity for such safeguards.
On direct examination, Shard identified petitioner and Bean
not as the alleged robbers on trial in the courtroom, but as
the pair he saw at the police station. His testimony thus lends
strong support to the observation that "[i]t is a matter of
common experience that, once a witness has picked out the
accused at the line-up, he is not likely to go back on his word
later on, so that in practice the issue of identity may [in the
absence of other relevant evidence] for all practical purposes be
determined there and then, before the trial."

   Wade and Gilbert, of course, happened to involve post-
indictment confrontations. Yet even a cursory perusal of the
opinions in those cases reveals that nothing at all turned upon
that particular circumstance. For my part, I do not agree that
we "extend" Wade and Gilbert by holding that the principles
of those cases apply to confrontations for identification
conducted after arrest. Because Shard testified at trial about his
identification of petitioner at the police station showup, the
exclusionary rule of Gilbert requires reversal.

In our next chapter we will conclude our review of

identification evidence, focusing on recent state-court
decisions, and will examine best practices suggested by modern
research.

   Before moving on, students may wish to consider some real-
life consequences of unintentional witness misidentification.
In one case, Ronald Cotton was identified as the rapist who
attacked Jennifer Thompson in 1984 in North Carolina.
Police showed Thompson a photo array, and she chose
Cotton's photo. She later identified Cotton at a line up. He
was convicted of rape and sentenced to life in prison.
Subsequently, DNA evidence proved that a different
man--who looked somewhat like Cotton--had committed
the rape. Cotton was released from prison in 1995. Cotton and
Thompson have since become advocates for criminal justice
reform. They give talks and have published a book: Picking
Cotton: Our Memoir of Injustice and Redemption

   On the book's website, one can view documents from the
case file, as well as photos of Cotton and of Bobby Poole,
who committed the rape for which Cotton served more than
ten years in prison. A short video (three minutes) about the
case is available here: https://www.youtube.com/

IDENTIFICATION:
BEST PRACTICES
AND STATE
APPROACHES

  Best Practices and Modern
        State Approaches

The Supreme Court's eyewitness identification jurisprudence
has remained virtually unchanged for the past 40 years.94 In
the next two cases, students will observe how two state courts
have dealt with eyewitness identification evidence in light of
a plethora of scientific research showing how it can be
unreliable.

       Notes, Comments, and
                Questions

The Supreme Court of Connecticut focused on how a
defendant might educate a jury about the unreliability of
766 | IDENTIFICATION: BEST PRACTICES AND STATE
APPROACHES

eyewitness identification, ameliorating the negative
consequences of unreliable evidence. Students who have taken
Evidence may recognize similarities between this kind of
testimony and other forms of hotly-disputed expert testimony.
For example, testimony about "battered woman syndrome"
and "rape trauma syndrome" may be helpful to the jury in
some cases. For example, a woman who kills her abusive
boyfriend may wish to offer syndrome evidence in support of a
self-defense theory. But such testimony is valuable only to the
extent it is based on sound scientific research. Also, when such
testimony is admissible, courts normally are careful to limit
its scope. For example, in a rape case, the defense might argue
that the alleged victim's behavior is not consistent with that
of a "real" rape victim (if, for example, she voluntarily spent
time with the defendant after the alleged rape). A prosecution
expert might help the jury understand that somewhat
counterintuitive behavior is actually within the range of
normal behavior observed among victims. The expert
normally may not, however, speculate about whether any
particular complaining witness was or was not raped.

       Notes, Comments, and
                Questions

Connecticut and New Jersey are two examples of states that
have endeavored to incorporate evidence-based
recommendations into eyewitness identification practices. In

 1. Instructions to the WitnessPreliminary instructions
      given to a witness by the administrator of an
      identification procedure before the procedure begins,
      should include the following:
        a. Instructing the witness orally or in writing about
            the details of the identification procedure
            (including that they will be asked about their
            confidence in the identification if any identification
            is made).
       b. Advising the witness that the person who
            committed the crime may or may not be in the
            photo array or lineup.
770 | NEW YORK STATE JUSTICE TASK FORCE
RECOMMENDATIONS

        c. Advising the witness that individuals may not
            appear exactly as they did on the day of the
            incident because features such as hair are subject to
            change.

       d. Advising the witness as follows:
              i. If an array or lineup is conducted double-
                  blind, the administrator shall inform the
                  witness that he does not know who the
                  suspect is; and
             ii. If the array or lineup is not conducted double-
                  blind, the administrator shall inform the
                  witness that he should not assume that the
                  administrator knows who the perpetrator is.

        e. Advising the witness that he or she should not feel
            compelled [or obligated] to make an
            identification.After the identification procedure is
            completed, the administrator of the identification
            procedure should:

        f. Instruct the witness not to discuss what was said,
            seen or done during the identification procedure
            with other witnesses involved in the case.

 2. Witness Confidence Statements
        a. In every case in which an identification is made, the
            administrator should elicit a statement of the
            witness' confidence in the identification, by asking
            a question to the effect of, "in your own words,
            how sure are you?" Witnesses should not be asked
                                   NEW YORK STATE JUSTICE TASK FORCE
                                                     RECOMMENDATIONS | 771

          to rate their confidence in any identification on a
          numerical scale.
      b. All witnesses should be instructed in advance that
          they will be asked about their confidence in any
          identification made.
      c. Witness confidence statements should be
          documented before any feedback on the
          identification is given to the witness by the
          administrator or others.
3. Documentation of Identification Procedures
    Documentation of identification procedures should
    include:
      a. Documentation of all lineups with a color
          photograph of the lineup as the witness viewed it
          and preservation of all photo arrays viewed by a
          witness.
      b. Documentation of the logistics of the
          identification procedure, including date, time,
          location and people present in the viewing room
          with the witness and/or the lineup room with the
          suspect, including anyone who escorted the witness
          to and/or from the procedure.
      c. Documentation of any speech, movement or
          clothing change the lineup members are asked to
          perform.
     d. Verbatim documentation of all statements and
          physical reactions made by a witness during an
772 | NEW YORK STATE JUSTICE TASK FORCE
RECOMMENDATIONS

            identification procedure.
        e. Ensuring that the witness sign and date the written

            results of the identification procedure, including a
            photograph of the live lineup if one is available.
 4. Photo Arrays
        a. Photo arrays should be conducted double-blind
            whenever practicable.
       b. If a photo array is conducted with a non-blind
            administrator, the procedure should be conducted
            blinded (as defined herein), whenever practicable.
        c. Photo array administrators must ensure that the
            photos in the photo array do not contain any
            writing, stray markings or information about the
            suspect such as information concerning previous
            arrests.
       d. At least five fillers should be used in each photo
            array, in addition to the suspect. There should be
            only one suspect per array.
        e. Fillers should be similar in appearance to the
            suspect in the array. Similarities should include
            gender, clothing, facial hair, race, age, height,
            extraordinary physical features or other distinctive
            characteristics. Fillers should not be known to the
            witness.
        f. If there is more than one suspect, photo array
            administrators should avoid reusing fillers when
            showing an array with a new suspect to the same

          witness.
      g. The position of the suspect should be moved or a

          new photo array (with new fillers) should be
          created each time an array is shown to a different
          witness.
5. Live Lineups
      a. Lineups may be conducted double-blind and if
          not, should be conducted in accordance with the
          procedures outlined by the NYS Identification
          Procedure Guidelines mentioned above, which
          include instructions on how to remain neutral and
          stand out of the witness' line of sight while the
          witness is viewing the lineup, and which when
          coupled with appropriate preliminary instructions
          are intended to create a neutral environment free of
          inadvertent cues.
      b. There should be five fillers in addition to the
          suspect, where practicable, but in no case fewer
          than four fillers. There should be only one suspect
          per lineup.
      c. Fillers should be similar in appearance to the
          suspect in the lineup. Similarities should include
          gender, clothing, facial hair, race, age, height,
          extraordinary physical features or other distinctive
          characteristics. Fillers should not be known to the
          witness.
     d. If there is more than one suspect, the lineup
774 | NEW YORK STATE JUSTICE TASK FORCE
RECOMMENDATIONS

            administrator should avoid reusing fillers when
            showing a lineup with a new suspect to the same
            witness.
        e. The position of the suspect should be moved each
            time the lineup is shown to a different witness,
            assuming the suspect and/or defense counsel agree.
        f. If an action is taken or words are spoken by one
            member of the lineup, all other members of the
            lineup must take the same action or speak the same
            words.
        g. All members of the lineup should be seated, if
            necessary, to eliminate any extreme variations in
            height.
       h. Fillers from a photo array previously viewed by the
            witness should not be used as fillers in the lineup.
        i. In those jurisdictions that regularly use live lineup
            procedures, consideration should be given to
            running lineups after the first witness makes an
            identification from the photo array. Where
            practicable, additional witnesses can view only the
            lineup and not the photo array.

PART XXXIV

PLEA BARGAINING

       PLEA BARGAINING

In a prior chapter, we saw a case about the obligation of a
defense attorney to inform the client about plea bargaining
offers made by the prosecution (Missouri v. Frye, 2012). It is
well recognized that the vast majority of criminal convictions
are obtained through plea bargaining and relatively few
criminal cases actually go through a criminal trial. Depending
on the jurisdiction, it is very typical to see fewer than 10
percent of cases go to trial. Thus, plea bargaining is an
especially important component of the process that
determines people's fates in the criminal justice system.

   When a plea bargain concludes a criminal case, it typically
means that the defendant agree to enter a guilty plea in
exchange for having certain charges dropped or having a
sentence that is less severe than the maximum possible
sentence or having the prosecutor make a recommendation for
a lesser sentence.

   In Santobellow v. New York (1971), Chief Justice Warren
Burger clearly pronounced the Supreme Court's approval of
plea bargaining as a desirable part of the criminal justice
process:
778 | PLEA BARGAINING

      The disposition of criminal charges by agreement between
      the prosecutor and the accused, sometimes loosely called
      "plea bargaining," is an essential component of the
      administration of justice. Properly administered, it is to
      be encouraged. If every criminal charge were subjected to
      a full-scale trial, the States and the Federal Government
      would need to multiply by many times the number of
      judges and court facilities.

         Disposition of charges after plea discussions is not only
      an essential part of the process, but a highly desirable part
      for many reasons. It leads to prompt and largely final
      disposition of most criminal cases; it avoids much of the
      corrosive impact of enforced idleness during pretrial
      confinement for those who are denied release pending trial;
      it protects the public from those accused persons who are
      prone to continue criminal conduct even while on pretrial
      release; and, by shortening the time between charge and
      disposition, it enhances whatever may be the rehabilitative
      prospects of the guilty when they are ultimately
      imprisoned.See Brady v. United States,397 U. S. 742,397
      U. S. 751-752 (1970).

There are, however, many criticisms of plea bargaining and
questions about the ways that the process can create unfair
treatment and unjust results. As described by a 2020 report by
the Vera Institute of Justice, there are a variety of concerns and
problems that can arise in concluding cases through the use of
negotiated guilty pleas:

   (https://www.vera.org/downloads/publications/in-the-
shadows-plea-bargaining.pdf)
                                                           PLEA BARGAINING | 779

  · Coercive factors: Defendants, including innocent
      defendants, may feel pressured to enter guilty pleas in
      order to avoid severe sentence or due to pressures from
      their defense attorneys who may desire to reach a quick
      conclusion to the case.

  · Systemic inequities: Conscious and unconscious bias
      may affect the nature of plea agreements offered to and
      sentences received by defendants, depending on their
      age, race, social status, and other factors.

  · Trial penalty: Because defendants who turn down plea
      agreement offers and are subsequently convicted after
      trial typically receive more severe sentences, there are
      concerns that the plea bargaining process unduly
      pressures defendants to surrender their constitutional
      rights, such as the right to trial by jury. Critics argue that
      defendants should not be penalized for using their
      constitutional rights.

  · Innocence: Cases have emerged in which innocent
      people felt pressured to plead guilty. Their fear of
      potentially severe sentences and their lack of confidence
      in the ability of the justice system to produce accurate
      results through the trial process can lead them to plead
      guilty despite their innocence.

One of the key issues in plea bargaining is the extent to which
prosecutors can pressure defendants to plead guilty by
780 | PLEA BARGAINING

threatening to pursue additional charges if the defendant
insists on going to trial.

BORDENKIRCHER V.
HAYES (1978)

 Bordenkircher v. Hayes, 434
           U.S. 357 (1978)

   MR. JUSTICE STEWART delivered the opinion of the
Court.

   The question in this case is whether the Due Process Clause
of the Fourteenth Amendment is violated when a state
prosecutor carries out a threat made during plea negotiations
to reindict the accused on more serious charges if he does
not plead guilty to the offense with which he was originally
charged.

                       I

The respondent, Paul Lewis Hayes, was indicted by a Fayette
County, Ky., grand jury on a charge of uttering a forged
instrument in the amount of $88.30, an offense then
782 | BORDENKIRCHER V. HAYES (1978)

punishable by a term of 2 to 10 years in prison. Ky.Rev.Stat. §
434.130 (1973) (repealed 1975). After arraignment, Hayes, his
retained counsel, and the Commonwealth's Attorney met in
the presence of the Clerk of the Court to discuss a possible plea
agreement. During these conferences, the prosecutor offered
to recommend a sentence of five years in prison if Hayes would
plead guilty to the indictment. He also said that, if Hayes did
not plead guilty and "save the court the inconvenience and
necessity of a trial," he would return to the grand jury to seek
an indictment under the Kentucky Habitual Criminal Act,
then Ky.Rev.Stat. § 431.190 (1973) (repealed 1975), which
would subject Hayes to a mandatory sentence of life
imprisonment by reason of his two prior felony convictions.
[Footnote 2] Hayes chose not to plead guilty, and the
prosecutor did obtain an indictment charging him under the
Habitual Criminal Act. It is not disputed that the recidivist
charge was fully justified by the evidence, that the prosecutor
was in possession of this evidence at the time of the original
indictment, and that Hayes' refusal to plead guilty to the
original charge was what led to his indictment under the
habitual criminal statute.

   A jury found Hayes guilty on the principal charge of
uttering a forged instrument and, in a separate proceeding,
further found that he had twice before been convicted of
felonies. As required by the habitual offender statute, he was
sentenced to a life term in the penitentiary.***

   Plea bargaining flows from "the mutuality of advantage"
                                      BORDENKIRCHER V. HAYES (1978) | 783

to defendants and prosecutors, each with his own reasons for
wanting to avoid trial.Brady v. United States, supraat397 U. S.
752. Defendants advised by competent counsel and protected
by other procedural safeguards are presumptively capable of
intelligent choice in response to prosecutorial persuasion, and
unlikely to be driven to false self-condemnation. 397 U.S.
at397 U. S. 758. Indeed, acceptance of the basic legitimacy
of plea bargaining necessarily implies rejection of any notion
that a guilty plea is involuntary in a constitutional sense simply
because it is the end result of the bargaining process. By
hypothesis, the plea may have been induced by promises of
a recommendation of a lenient sentence or a reduction of
charges, and thus by fear of the possibility of a greater penalty
upon conviction after a trial.SeeABA Project on Standards for
Criminal Justice, Pleas of Guilty § 3.1 (App.Draft 1968);...

   While confronting a defendant with the risk of more severe
punishment clearly may have a "discouraging effect on the
defendant's assertion of his trial rights, the imposition of these
difficult choices [is] an inevitable" -- and permissible --
"attribute of any legitimate system which tolerates and
encourages the negotiation of pleas."Chaffin v. Stynchcombe,
supra,at412 U. S. 31. It follows that, by tolerating and
encouraging the negotiation of pleas, this Court has necessarily
accepted as constitutionally legitimate the simple reality that
the prosecutor's interest at the bargaining table is to persuade
the defendant to forgo his right to plead not guilty.

   It is not disputed here that Hayes was properly chargeable
784 | BORDENKIRCHER V. HAYES (1978)

under the recidivist statute, since he had, in fact, been
convicted of two previous felonies. In our system, so long as
the prosecutor has probable cause to believe that the accused
committed an offense defined by statute, the decision whether
or not to prosecute, and what charge to file or bring before a
grand jury, generally rests entirely in his discretion. [Footnote
8] Within the limits set by the legislature's constitutionally
valid definition of chargeable offenses, "the conscious exercise
of some selectivity in enforcement is not, in itself, a federal
constitutional violation" so long as "the selection was [not]
deliberately based upon an unjustifiable standard such as race,
religion, or other arbitrary classification."Oyler v. Boles,368
U. S. 448,368 U. S. 456. To hold that the prosecutor's desire
to induce a guilty plea is an "unjustifiable standard," which,
like race or religion, may play no part in his charging decision,
would contradict the very premises that underlie the concept
of plea bargaining itself. Moreover, a rigid constitutional rule
that would prohibit a prosecutor from acting forthrightly in
his dealings with the defense could only invite unhealthy
subterfuge that would drive the practice of plea bargaining
back into the shadows from which it has so recently
emerged.See Blackledge v. Allison,431 U.S. at431 U. S. 76.

   There is no doubt that the breadth of discretion that our
country's legal system vests in prosecuting attorneys carries
with it the potential for both individual and institutional
abuse.] And broad though that discretion may be, there are
undoubtedly constitutional limits upon its exercise. We hold
                                      BORDENKIRCHER V. HAYES (1978) | 785

only that the course of conduct engaged in by the prosecutor
in this case, which no more than openly presented the
defendant with the unpleasant alternatives of forgoing trial or
facing charges on which he was plainly subject to prosecution,
did not violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment....

   MR JUSTICE BLACKMUN, with whom MR. JUSTICE
BRENNAN and MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL join,
dissenting. [separate dissenting opinion of Justice Powell is
omitted]

   ***
   Then later, inPerry,the Court applied the same principle to
prosecutorial conduct where there was a "realistic likelihood
ofvindictiveness.'" 417 U.S. at417 U. S. 27. It held that the
requirement of Fourteenth Amendment due process
prevented a prosecutor's reindictment of a convicted
misdemeanant on a felony charge after the defendant had
exercised his right to appeal the misdemeanor conviction and
thus to obtain a trialde novo.It noted the prosecution's
"considerable stake" in discouraging the appeal.Ibid.
   The Court now says, however, that this concern with
vindictiveness is of no import in the present case, despite the
difference between five years in prison and a life sentence,
because we are here concerned with plea bargaining where
there is give-and-take negotiation, and where, it is said,at434
U. S. 363, "there is no such element of punishment or
retaliation so long as the accused is free to accept or reject the
786 | BORDENKIRCHER V. HAYES (1978)

prosecution's offer." Yet, in this case, vindictiveness is present
to the same extent as it was thought to be inPearceand
inPerry;the prosecutor here admitted,see anteat434 U. S.
358n. 1, that the sole reason for the new indictment was to
discourage the respondent from exercising his right to a trial.
Even had such an admission not been made, when plea
negotiations, conducted in the face of the less serious charge
under the first indictment, fail, charging by a second
indictment a more serious crime for the same conduct creates
"a strong inference" of vindictiveness. As then Judge McCree
aptly observed, in writing for a unanimous panel of the Sixth
Circuit, the prosecutor initially "makes a discretionary
determination that the interests of the state are served by not
seeking more serious charges."Hayes v. Cowan,547 F.2d 42,
44 (1976). I therefore do not understand why, as inPearce,due
process does not require that the prosecution justify its action
on some basis other than discouraging respondent from the
exercise of his right to a trial.

   Prosecutorial vindictiveness, it seems to me, in the present
narrow context, is the fact against which the Due Process
Clause ought to protect. I perceive little difference between
vindictiveness after what the Court describes,anteat434 U.
S. 362, as the exercise of a "legal right to attack his original
conviction," and vindictiveness in the "give-and-take
negotiation common in plea bargaining.'" Prosecutorial
vindictiveness in any context is still prosecutorial
vindictiveness. The Due Process Clause should protect an
                                      BORDENKIRCHER V. HAYES (1978) | 787

accused against it, however it asserts itself. The Court of
Appeals rightly so held, and I would affirm the judgment.

   ***

                   Notes:

The majority opinion grants to prosecutors significant
discretion to threaten additional charges in the plea bargaining
process as long as those charges are justified by the facts in
the case. Prior decisions indicated that prosecutors could not
be "vindictive"--which a dictionary defines as a strong or
unreasoning desire for revenge. Here the majority justices and
the dissenters disagree about whether the additional of the
habitual offender statute, which carried a life sentence, was
vindictive when the prosecutor apparently admitted that the
sole reason for bringing the additional charge was to pressure
the defendant to give up his constitutional right to a trial.
For the dissenters, the prosecutor's original decision to charge
without imposing the habitual offender count indicated that
the prosecutor really thought this was the appropriate charge
and associated punishment for the crime. Notice that the
concept of a "vindictive" action is very much in the eye of the
beholder and not at all clearly defined by the Supreme Court.
PART XXXV

SIXTH
AMENDMENT:
SPEEDY TRIAL

   THE RIGHT TO A SPEEDY
                 TRIAL

The 6th Amendment contains a right to a speedy trial. But
what does it mean to have a "speedy" trial? The words of the
Constitution do not provide a definition. Thus, the Supreme
Court and other courts must rule on the meaning of this
provision when defendants claim that this right was violated.
The foundational Supreme Court decision address this right
was Barker v. Wingo (1972).
BARKER V. WINGO (1972)

MR. JUSTICE POWELL delivered the opinion of the Court.
   Although a speedy trial is guaranteed the accused by the

Sixth Amendment to the Constitution, this Court has dealt
with that right on infrequent occasions.... As MR. JUSTICE
BRENNAN pointed out in his concurring opinion
inDickey,in none of [our prior] cases have we attempted to set
out the criteria by which the speedy trial right is to be judged.
398 U.S. at398 U. S. 401. This case compels us to make such
an attempt.

                       I

On July 20, 1958, in Christian County, Kentucky, an elderly
couple was beaten to death by intruders wielding an iron tire
tool. Two suspects, Silas Manning and Willie Barker, the
petitioner, were arrested shortly thereafter. The grand jury
792 | BARKER V. WINGO (1972)

indicted them on September 15. Counsel was appointed on
September 17, and Barker's trial was set for October 21. The
Commonwealth had a stronger case against Manning, and it
believed that Barker could not be convicted unless Manning
testified against him. Manning was naturally unwilling to
incriminate himself. Accordingly, on October 23, the day Silas
Manning was brought to trial, the Commonwealth sought and
obtained the first of what was to be a series of 16 continuances
of Barker's trial. Barker made no objection. By first convicting
Manning, the Commonwealth would remove possible
problems of self-incrimination, and would be able to assure his
testimony against Barker.

   The Commonwealth encountered more than a few
difficulties in its prosecution of Manning. The first trial ended
in a hung jury. A second trial resulted in a conviction, but the
Kentucky Court of Appeals reversed because of the admission
of evidence obtained by an illegal search.Manning v.
Commonwealth,328 S.W.2d 421(1959). At his third trial,
Manning was again convicted, and the Court of Appeals again
reversed because the trial court had not granted a change of
venue.Manning v. Commonwealth,346 S.W.2d 755(1961). A
fourth trial resulted in a hung jury. Finally, after five trials,
Manning was convicted, in March, 1962, of murdering one
victim, and, after a sixth trial, in December, 1962, he was
convicted of murdering the other.

   The Christian County Circuit Court holds three terms each
year -- in February, June, and September. Barker's initial trial
                                                   BARKER V. WINGO (1972) | 793

was to take place in the September term of 1958. The first
continuance postponed it until the February, 1959, term. The
second continuance was granted for one month only. Every
term thereafter for as long as the Manning prosecutions were
in process, the Commonwealth routinely moved to continue
Barker's case to the next term. When the case was continued
from the June, 1959, term until the following September,
Barker, having spent 10 months in jail, obtained his release
by posting a $5,000 bond. He thereafter remained free in the
community until his trial. Barker made no objection, through
his counsel, to the first 11 continuances.

   When, on February 12, 1962, the Commonwealth moved
for the twelfth time to continue the case until the following
term, Barker's counsel filed a motion to dismiss the
indictment. The motion to dismiss was denied two weeks later,
and the Commonwealth's motion for a continuance was
granted. The Commonwealth was granted further
continuances in June, 1962, and September, 1962, to which
Barker did not object.

   In February, 1963, the first term of court following
Manning's final conviction, the Commonwealth moved to set
Barker's trial for March 19. But on the day scheduled for trial,
it again moved for a continuance until the June term. It gave
as its reason the illness of the ex-sheriff who was the chief
investigating officer in the case. To this continuance, Barker
objected unsuccessfully.

   The witness was still unable to testify in June, and the trial,
794 | BARKER V. WINGO (1972)

which had been set for June 19, was continued again until
the September term over Barker's objection. This time the
court announced that the case would be dismissed for lack of
prosecution if it were not tried during the next term. The final
trial date was set for October 9, 1963. On that date, Barker
again moved to dismiss the indictment, and this time specified
that his right to a speedy trial had been violated. The motion
was denied; the trial commenced with Manning a the chief
prosecution witness; Barker was convicted and given a life
sentence.

   Barker appealed his conviction to the Kentucky Court of
Appeals, relying in part on his speedy trial claim. The court
affirmed.Barker v. Commonwealth,385 S.W.2d 671(1964). In
February, 1970, Barker petitioned for habeas corpus in the
United States District Court for the Western District of
Kentucky. Although the District Court rejected the petition
without holding a hearing, the court granted petitioner leave
to appealin forma pauperisand a certificate of probable cause
to appeal. On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Sixth
Circuit affirmed the District Court. 442 F.2d 1141 (1971).
It ruled that Barker had waived his speedy trial claim for the
entire period before February, 1963, the date on which the
court believed he had first objected to the delay by filing a
motion to dismiss. In this belief the court was mistaken, for
the record reveals that the motion was filed in February, 1962.
The Commonwealth so conceded at oral argument before this
Court. The court held further that the remaining period after
                                                   BARKER V. WINGO (1972) | 795

the date on which Barker first raised his claim and before his
trial -- which it thought was only eight months but which
was actually 20 months -- was not unduly long. In addition,
the court held that Barker had shown no resulting prejudice,
and that the illness of the ex-sheriff was a valid justification for
the delay. We granted Barker's petition for certiorari. 404 U.S.
1037 (1972).

                       II

The right to a speedy trial is generically different from any
of the other rights enshrined in the Constitution for the
protection of the accused. In addition to the general concern
that all accused persons be treated according to decent and fair
procedures, there is a societal interest in providing a speedy
trial which exists separate from, and at times in opposition to,
the interests of the accused. The inability of courts to provide
a prompt trial has contributed to a large backlog of cases in
urban courts which, among other things, enables defendants
to negotiate more effectively for pleas of guilty to lesser offenses
and otherwise manipulate the system. In addition, persons
released on bond for lengthy periods awaiting trial have an
opportunity to commit other crimes. It must be of little
comfort to the residents of Christian County, Kentucky, to
know that Barker was at large on bail for over four years while
accused of a vicious and brutal murder of which he was
ultimately convicted. Moreover, the longer an accused is free
796 | BARKER V. WINGO (1972)

awaiting trial, the more tempting becomes his opportunity
to jump bail and escape. Finally, delay between arrest and
punishment may have a detrimental effect on rehabilitation.

   If an accused cannot make bail, he is generally confined,
as was Barker for 10 months, in a local jail. This contributes
to the overcrowding and generally deplorable state of those
institutions. Lengthy exposure to these conditions "has a
destructive effect on human character, and makes the
rehabilitation of the individual offender much more difficult."
At times the result may even be violent rioting. Finally, lengthy
pretrial detention is costly. The cost of maintaining a prisoner
in jail varies from $3 to $9 per day, and this amounts to
millions across the Nation. In addition, society loses wages
which might have been earned, and it must often support
families of incarcerated breadwinners.

   A second difference between the right to speedy trial and
the accused's other constitutional rights is that deprivation
of the right may work to the accused's advantage. Delay is
not an uncommon defense tactic. As the time between the
commission of the crime and trial lengthens, witnesses may
become unavailable or their memories may fade. If the
witnesses support the prosecution, its case will be weakened,
sometimes seriously so. And it is the prosecution which carries
the burden of proof. Thus, unlike the right to counsel or the
right to be free from compelled self-incrimination, deprivation
of the right to speedy trial does notper seprejudice the
accused's ability to defend himself.
                                                   BARKER V. WINGO (1972) | 797

   Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the right to speedy
trial is a more vague concept than other procedural rights. It
is, for example, impossible to determine with precision when
the right has been denied. We cannot definitely say how long
is too long in a system where justice is supposed to be swift
but deliberate. As a consequence, there is no fixed point in
the criminal process when the State can put the defendant to
the choice of either exercising or waiving the right to a speedy
trial. If, for example, the State moves for a 60-day continuance,
granting that continuance is not a violation of the right to
speedy trial unless the circumstances of the case are such that
further delay would endanger the values the right protects. It
is impossible to do more than generalize about when those
circumstances exist. There is nothing comparable to the point
in the process when a defendant exercises or waives his right
to counsel or his right to a jury trial. Thus, as we recognized
inBeavers v. Haubert, supra,any inquiry into a speedy trial
claim necessitates a functional analysis of the right in the
particular context of the case:

   "The right of a speedy trial is necessarily relative. It is
consistent with delays, and depends upon circumstances. It
secures rights to a defendant. It does not preclude the rights of
public justice."

   The amorphous quality of the right also leads to the
unsatisfactorily severe remedy of dismissal of the indictment
when the right has been deprived. This is indeed a serious
consequence, because it means that a defendant who may be
798 | BARKER V. WINGO (1972)

guilty of a serious crime will go free, without having been tried.
Such a remedy is more serious than an exclusionary rule or a
reversal for a new trial, but it is the only possible remedy.

   Perhaps because the speedy trial right is so slippery, two rigid
approaches are urged upon us as ways of eliminating some
of the uncertainty which courts experience in protecting the
right. The first suggestion is that we hold that the Constitution
requires a criminal defendant to be offered a trial within a
specified time period. The result of such a ruling would have
the virtue of clarifying when the right is infringed and of
simplifying courts' application of it.***

   The second suggested alternative would restrict
consideration of the right to those case in which the accused
has demanded a speedy trial.... We shall refer to the former
approach as the demand-waiver doctrine. The demand-waiver
doctrine provides that a defendant waives any consideration of
his right to speedy trial for any period prior to which he has not
demanded a trial. Under this rigid approach, a prior demand
is a necessary condition to the consideration of the speedy trial
right.***

   The nature of the speedy trial right does make it impossible
to pinpoint a precise time in the process when the right must
be asserted or waived, but that fact does not argue for placing
the burden of protecting the right solely on defendants. A
defendant has no duty to bring himself to trial; [the State
has that duty as well as the duty of insuring that the trial is
consistent with due process. Moreover, for the reasons earlier
                                                   BARKER V. WINGO (1972) | 799

expressed, society has a particular interest in bringing swift
prosecutions, and society's representatives are the ones who
should protect that interest.***

   We reject, therefore, the rule that a defendant who fails to
demand a speedy trial forever waives his right. This does not
mean, however, that the defendant has no responsibility to
assert his right. We think the better rule is that the defendant's
assertion of or failure to assert his right to a speedy trial is
one of the factors to be considered in an inquiry into the
deprivation of the right. Such a formulation avoids the
rigidities of the demand-waiver rule and the resulting possible
unfairness in its application.***

   We therefore reject both of the inflexible approaches -- the
fixed-time period because it goes further than the Constitution
requires; the demand-waiver rule because it is insensitive to a
right which we have deemed fundamental. The approach we
accept is a balancing test, in which the conduct of both the
prosecution and the defendant are weighed.

                      IV

A balancing test necessarily compels courts to approach speedy
trial cases on anad hocbasis. We can do little more than
identify some of the factors which courts should assess in
determining whether a particular defendant has been deprived
of his right. Though some might express them in different
ways, we identify four such factors: length of delay, the reason
800 | BARKER V. WINGO (1972)

for the delay, the defendant's assertion of his right, and
prejudice to the defendant.

   The length of the delay is to some extent a triggering
mechanism. Until there is some delay which is presumptively
prejudicial, there is no necessity for inquiry into the other
factors that go into the balance. Nevertheless, because of the
imprecision of the right to speedy trial, the length of delay that
will provoke such an inquiry is necessarily dependent upon the
peculiar circumstances of the case. To take but one example,
the delay that can be tolerated for an ordinary street crime is
considerably less than for a serious, complex conspiracy charge.

   Closely related to length of delay is the reason the
government assigns to justify the delay. Here, too, different
weights should be assigned to different reasons. A deliberate
attempt to delay the trial in order to hamper the defense
should be weighted heavily against the government. A more
neutral reason such as negligence or overcrowded courts
should be weighted less heavily but nevertheless should be
considered since the ultimate responsibility for such
circumstances must rest with the government, rather than
with the defendant. Finally, a valid reason, such as a missing
witness, should serve to justify appropriate delay.

   We have already discussed the third factor, the defendant's
responsibility to assert his right. Whether and how a defendant
asserts his right is closely related to the other factors we have
mentioned. The strength of his efforts will be affected by the
length of the delay, to some extent by the reason for the delay,
                                                   BARKER V. WINGO (1972) | 801

and most particularly by the personal prejudice, which is not
always readily identifiable, that he experiences. The more
serious the deprivation, the more likely a defendant is to
complain. The defendant's assertion of his speedy trial right,
then, is entitled to strong evidentiary weight in determining
whether the defendant is being deprived of the right. We
emphasize that failure to assert the right will make it difficult
for a defendant to prove that he was denied a speedy trial.

   A fourth factor is prejudice to the defendant. Prejudice,
of course, should be assessed in the light of the interests of
defendants which the speedy trial right was designed to
protect. This Court has identified three such interests: (i) to
prevent oppressive pretrial incarceration; (ii) to minimize
anxiety and concern of the accused; and (iii) to limit the
possibility that the defense will be impaired. Of these, the most
serious is the last, because the inability of a defendant
adequately to prepare his case skews the fairness of the entire
system. If witnesses die or disappear during a delay, the
prejudice is obvious. There is also prejudice if defense
witnesses are unable to recall accurately events of the distant
past. Loss of memory, however, is not always reflected in the
record, because what has been forgotten can rarely be shown.

   We have discussed previously the societal disadvantages of
lengthy pretrial incarceration, but obviously the disadvantages
for the accused who cannot obtain his release are even more
serious. The time spent in jail awaiting trial has a detrimental
impact on the individual. It often means loss of a job; it
802 | BARKER V. WINGO (1972)

disrupts family life; and it enforces idleness. Most jails offer
little or no recreational or rehabilitative programs. The time
spent in jail is simply dead time. Moreover, if a defendant is
locked up, he is hindered in his ability to gather evidence,
contact witnesses, or otherwise prepare his defense. Imposing
those consequences on anyone who has not yet been convicted
is serious. It is especially unfortunate to impose them on those
persons who are ultimately found to be innocent. Finally, even
if an accused is not incarcerated prior to trial, he is still
disadvantaged by restraints on his liberty and by living under a
cloud of anxiety, suspicion, and often hostility....

   We regard none of the four factors identified above as either
a necessary or sufficient condition to the finding of a
deprivation of the right of speedy trial. Rather, they are related
factors, and must be considered together with such other
circumstances as may be relevant. In sum, these factors have no
talismanic qualities; courts must still engage in a difficult and
sensitive balancing process. But, because we are dealing with a
fundamental right of the accused, this process must be carried
out with full recognition that the accused's interest in a speedy
trial is specifically affirmed in the Constitution.888

   [The Court looked at the four factors in this case and
concluded that it was a "close case." It was a very lengthy delay
and the delays were caused by the prosecution, two factors that
favored the defendant. On the other hand, the defendant did
not demand a trial and the defendant's case was not hurt by
the delay, nor was he stuck in jail the other time. Thus, they
                                                   BARKER V. WINGO (1972) | 803

concluded there was no violation of the right to speedy trial
here.]

SIXTH
AMENDMENT:
TRIAL BY JURY

    THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY
                 JURY

Although relatively few criminal cases are decided through
trials,--and even fewer through jury trials, since many trials are
"bench trials" presided over by a judge without a jury--trials
remain important in the criminal justice process. Prosecutors
and defense attorneys look at trials to inform themselves about
what kinds of offers and agreements to make in the plea
bargaining process. During plea negotiations, both sides are
thinking, "but if we go to trial, what might a jury think about
the evidence?" If, by observing jury trials that have occurred in
a particular court, a prosecutor believes, "a jury will definitely
find the defendant guilty based on the evidence that we have,"
it enbles the prosecutor to take a tougher position in the plea
negotiations. If, by observing jury trials that have occurred
in a particular court, a defense attorney believes, "it is really
806 | SIXTH AMENDMENT: TRIAL BY JURY

uncertain whether a jury will convict based on the available
evidence," the defense attorney may use that information as
an argument in plea negotiations to seek a more favorable
outcome for the client. Thus, jury trials do not merely
determine the fates of a small percentage of criminal
defendants; they provide information that influences plea
bargaining in the larger majority of cases that result in guilty
pleas.

   The words of the 6th Amendment say, "In all criminal
prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy..." and then lists various
rights, including the right to trial by jury. Yet, the Supreme
Court has not followed the literal words of the Constitution.
In certain kinds of criminal cases, defendants may be required
to accept a bench trial rather than a jury trial (see Lewis v.
United States, 1996, that follows).

   Other issues concerning constitutional rights for criminal
jury trials involve the selection and composition of the jury.
Americans often think the Constitution gives them a right to
a jury "of their peers." In fact, there is no right for defendants
to have people like themselves demographically (i.e., race, age,
gender, religion, etc.) on a jury. The phrase "jury of peers"
goes back to the Magna Carta, a document about rights from
1215 in England. It actually means a jury of equal citizens
rather than a jury of people who share the defendant's
characteristics. Instead, under the 6th Amendment, the
Supreme Court says that defendants have a right to a jury
drawn from a "fair cross section" of the community.
                                  SIXTH AMENDMENT: TRIAL BY JURY | 807

   Discrimination should not occur in jury selection.
However, there is a long history of discrimination in jury
selection in the United States, especially with respect to race
as prosecutors in many places have sought to benefit from
having all white juries judge African American defendants. In
addition, women were long excluded from jury duty. Cases
still arise alleging that people are unfairly excluded from
participation in jury service for racial reasons (see Georgia v.
McCollum, 1992, and Purkett v. Elem, 1995, that follow).

   In Flowers v. Mississippi (2019), for example, the Supreme
Court found that a prosecutor intentionally engaged in racial
discrimination to remove African Americans from the jury
pool by asking an African American potential many more
questions in the jury selection process than those asked of
potential white jurors.
LEWIS V. UNITED
STATES (1996)

                       U.S. Supreme Court

  Lewis v. United States, 518
           U.S. 322 (1996)

   JUSTICE O'CONNOR delivered the opinion of the
Court.

   This case presents the question whether a defendant who is
prosecuted in a single proceeding for multiple petty offenses
has a constitutional right to a jury trial where the aggregate
prison term authorized for the offenses exceeds six months.
We are also asked to decide whether a defendant who would
otherwise have a constitutional right to a jury trial may be
denied that right because the presiding judge has made a
pretrial commitment that the aggregate sentence imposed will
not exceed six months.

   We conclude that no jury trial right exists where a defendant
is prosecuted for multiple petty offenses. The Sixth
810 | LEWIS V. UNITED STATES (1996)

Amendment's guarantee of the right to a jury trial does not
extend to petty offenses, and its scope does not change where
a defendant faces a potential aggregate prison term in excess of
six months for petty offenses charged....

   Petitioner Ray Lewis was a mail handler for the United
States Postal Service. One day, postal inspectors saw him open
several pieces of mail and pocket the contents. The next day,
the inspectors routed "test" mail, containing marked currency,
through petitioner's station. After seeing petitioner open the
mail and remove the currency, the inspectors arrested him.
Petitioner was charged with two counts of obstructing the
mail, in violation of 18 U. S. C. § 170l. Each count carried
a maximum authorized prison sentence of six months.
Petitioner requested a jury, but the Magistrate Judge granted
the Government's motion for a bench trial. She explained that
because she would not, under any circumstances, sentence
petitioner to more than six months' imprisonment, he was not
entitled to a jury trial.

   ***
   The Sixth Amendment guarantees that "[i]n all criminal
prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and
public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district
wherein the crime shall have been committed .... " It is well
established that the Sixth Amendment, like the common law,
reserves this jury trial right for prosecutions of serious offenses,
and that "there is a category of petty crimes or offenses which
                                          LEWIS V. UNITED STATES (1996) | 811

is not subject to the Sixth Amendment jury trial
provision."Duncanv.Louisiana,391 U. S. 145, 159 (1968).

   ***
   An offense carrying a maximum prison term of six months
or less is presumed petty, unless the legislature has authorized
additional statutory penalties so severe as to indicate that the
legislature considered the offense serious.Id.,at
543;Codispotiv.Pennsylvania,418 U. S. 506, 512 (1974).
   Here, the maximum authorized penalty for obstruction of
mail is six months' imprisonment-a penalty that presumptively
places the offense in the "petty" category. We face the question
whether petitioner is nevertheless entitled to a jury trial,
because he was tried in a single proceeding for two counts of
the petty offense so that the potential aggregated penalty is 12
months' imprisonment.
   Petitioner argues that, where a defendant is charged with
multiple petty offenses in a single prosecution, the Sixth
Amendment requires that the aggregate potential penalty be
the basis for determining whether a jury trial is required.
   Although each offense charged here was petty, petitioner
faced a potential penalty of more than six months'
imprisonment; and, of course, if any offense charged had
authorized more than six months' imprisonment, he would
have been entitled to a jury trial. The Court must look to
the aggregate potential prison term to determine the existence
of the jury trial right, petitioner contends, not to the "petty"
character of the offenses charged.
812 | LEWIS V. UNITED STATES (1996)

   We disagree. The Sixth Amendment reserves the jury trial
right to defendants accused of serious crimes. As set forth
above, we determine whether an offense is serious by looking
to the judgment of the legislature, primarily as expressed in the
maximum authorized term of imprisonment. Here, by setting
the maximum authorized prison term at six months, the
Legislature categorized the offense of obstructing the mail as
petty. The fact that petitioner was charged with two counts of
a petty offense does not revise the legislative judgment as to
the gravity of that particular offense, nor does it transform the
petty offense into a serious one, to which the jury trial right
would apply.

   ***
   JUSTICE KENNEDY, with whom JUSTICE BREYER
joins, concurring in the judgment.
   This petitioner had no constitutional right to a jury trial
because from the outset it was settled that he could be
sentenced to no more than six months' imprisonment for his
combined petty offenses. The particular outcome, however,
should not obscure the greater consequence of today's
unfortunate decision. The Court holds that a criminal
defendant may be convicted of innumerable offenses in one
proceeding and sentenced to any number of years'
imprisonment, all without benefit of a jury trial, so long as
no one of the offenses considered alone is punishable by more
than six months in prison. The holding both in its doctrinal
formulation and in its practical effect is one of the most serious
                                         LEWIS V. UNITED STATES (1996) | 813

incursions on the right to jury trial in the Court's history,
and it cannot be squared with our precedents. The Sixth
Amendment guarantees a jury trial to a defendant charged
with a serious crime.Duncanv.Louisiana,391 U. S. 145, 159
(1968). Serious crimes, for purposes of the Sixth Amendment,
are defined to include any offense which carries a maximum
penalty of more than six months in prison; the right to jury
trial attaches to those crimes regardless of the sentence in fact
imposed.Id.,at 159-160. This doctrine is not questioned here,
but it does not define the outer limits of the right to trial
by jury. Our cases establish a further proposition: The right
to jury trial extends as well to a defendant who is sentenced
in one proceeding to more than six months'
imprisonment.Codispotiv.Pennsylvania, 418U. S. 506
(1974);Taylorv.Hayes,418 U. S. 488(1974). To be more
specific, a defendant is entitled to a jury if tried in a single
proceeding for more than one petty offense when the
combined sentences will exceed six months' imprisonment;
taken together, the crimes then are considered serious for
constitutional purposes, even if each is petty by itself,...

   ***
   The significance of the Court's decision quite transcends
the peculations of Ray Lewis, the petitioner here, who twice
filched from the mails. The decision affects more than repeat
violators of traffic laws, persons accused of public
drunkenness, persons who persist in breaches of the peace, and
the wide range of eccentrics capable of disturbing the quiet
814 | LEWIS V. UNITED STATES (1996)

enjoyment of life by others. Just as alarming is the threat the
Court's holding poses to millions of persons in agriculture,
manufacturing, and trade who must comply with minute
administrative regulations, many of them carrying a jail term
of six months or less. Violations of these sorts of rules often
involve repeated, discrete acts which can result in potential
liability of years of imprisonment. See,e.g.,16U. S. C. § 707
(violation of migratory bird treaties, laws, and regulations); 29
U. S. C. § 216 (penalties under Fair Labor Standards Act);
36 CFR § 1.3 (1995) (violation of National Park Service
regulations);id.,§ 261.1b (violation of Forest Service
prohibitions);id.,§ 327.25 (violation of Army Corps of
Engineers water resource development project regulations); 43
CFR §8351.1-1(b) (1995) (violation of Bureau of Land
management regulations under National Trails System Act of
1968). Still, under the Court's holding it makes no difference
whether a defendant is sentenced to a year in prison or for
that matter to 20 years: As long as no single violation charged
is punishable by more than six months, the defendant has no
right to a jury.

   ***
   When a defendant's liberty is put at great risk in a trial, he is
entitled to have the trial conducted to a jury. This principle lies
at the heart of the Sixth Amendment. The Court does grave
injury to the Amendment by allowing a defendant to suffer
a prison term of any length after a single trial before a single
                                         LEWIS V. UNITED STATES (1996) | 815

judge and without the protection of a jury. I join only the
Court's judgment.

   JUSTICE STEVENS, with whom JUSTICE GINSBURG
joins, dissenting.

   ....The majority, relying exclusively on cases in which the
defendant was tried for a single offense, extends a rule designed
with those cases in mind to the wholly dissimilar circumstance
in which the prosecution concerns multiple offenses. I agree
with JUSTICE KENNEDY to the extent he would hold that
a prosecution which exposes the accused to a sentence of
imprisonment longer than six months, whether for a single
offense or for a series of offenses, is sufficiently serious to confer
on the defendant the right to demand a jury. Seeante,at
335-337.

   Unlike JUSTICE KENNEDY, however, I believe that the
right to a jury trial attaches when the prosecution begins. I
do not quarrel with the established view that only defendants
whose alleged misconduct is deemed serious by the legislature
are entitled to be judged by a jury. But in my opinion, the
legislature's determination of the severity of the charges
against a defendant is properly measured by the maximum
sentence authorized for the prosecution as a whole. The text
of the Sixth Amendment supports this interpretation by
referring expressly to "criminalprosecutions."

   ***
   All agree that a judge may not strip a defendant of the right
to a jury trial for a serious crime by promising a sentence of six
816 | LEWIS V. UNITED STATES (1996)

months or less. ...Because the right attaches at the moment of
prosecution, a judge may not deprive a defendant of a jury trial
by making a pretrial determination that the crimes charged will
not warrant a sentence exceeding six months.

(1992)

                       U.S. Supreme Court

Georgia v. McCollum, 505 U.S.
               42 (1992)

   JUSTICE BLACKMUN delivered the opinion of the
Court.

   For more than a century, this Court consistently and
repeatedly has reaffirmed that racial discrimination by the State
in jury selection offends the Equal Protection Clause. See,e.
g., Strauderv.West Virginia,100 U. S. 303(1880). Last Term
this Court held that racial discrimination in a civil litigant's
exercise of peremptory challenges also violates the Equal
Protection Clause. SeeEdmonsonv.Leesville Concrete
Co.,500 U. S. 614(1991). Today, we are asked to decide
whether the Constitution prohibits acriminal defendantfrom
engaging in purposeful racial discrimination in the exercise of
peremptory challenges.
818 | GEORGIA V. MCCOLLUM (1992)

                       I

On August 10, 1990, a grand jury sitting in Dougherty

County, Ga., returned a six-count indictment charging

respondents with aggravated assault and simple battery. See

App. 2. The indictment alleged that respondents beat and

assaulted Jerry and Myra Collins. Respondents are white; the

alleged victims are African-Americans. Shortly after the events,

a leaflet was widely distributed in the local African-American

community reporting the assault and urging community

residents not to patronize respondents' business.

Before jury selection began, the prosecution moved to

prohibit respondents from exercising peremptory challenges

in a racially discriminatory manner. The State explained that

it expected to show that the victims' race was a factor in the

alleged assault. According to the State, counsel for respondents

had indicated a clear intention to use peremptory strikes in a

racially discriminatory manner, arguing that the circumstances

of their case gave them the right to exclude African-American

citizens from participating as jurors in the trial. Observing that

43 percent of the county's population is African-American,

the State contended that, if a statistically representative panel

is assembled for jury selection, 18 of the potential 42 jurors

would be African-American.1 With 20 peremptory challenges,

respondents therefore would be able to remove all the African-

American  potential               jurors.2         Relying

onBatsonv.Kentucky,476 U. S. 79(1986), the Sixth
                                           GEORGIA V. MCCOLLUM (1992) | 819

Amendment, and the Georgia Constitution, the State sought
an order providing that, if it succeeded in making out a prima
facie case of racial discrimination by respondents, the latter
would be required to articulate a racially neutral explanation
for peremptory challenges.

   The trial judge denied the State's motion, holding that
"[n]either Georgia nor federal law prohibits criminal
defendants from exercising peremptory strikes in a racially
discriminatory manner." App.14. The issue was certified for
immediate appeal.Id.,at 15 and 18.

   ***
   Over the last century, in an almost unbroken chain of
decisions, this Court gradually has abolished race as a
consideration for jury service. InStrauderv.West Virginia,
100U. S. 303 (1880), the Court invalidated a state statute
providing that only white men could serve as jurors. While
stating that a defendant has no right to a "petit jury composed
in whole or in part of persons of his own race,"id.,at 305, the
Court held that a defendant does have the right to be tried
by a jury whose members are selected by nondiscriminatory
criteria. See alsoNealv.Delaware,103 U. S. 370,***
   InSwainv.Alabama,380 U. S. 202(1965), the Court was
confronted with the question whether an African-American
defendant was denied equal protection by the State's exercise
of peremptory challenges to exclude members of his race from
the petit jury.Id.,at 209-210. Although the Court rejected the
defendant's attempt to establish an equal protection claim
820 | GEORGIA V. MCCOLLUM (1992)

premised solely on the pattern of jury strikes in his own case,
it acknowledged that proof of systematic exclusion of African-
Americans through the use of peremptories over a period of
time might establish such a violation.Id.,at 224-228.

   InBatsonv.Kentucky,476 U. S. 79(1986), the Court
discardedSwain'sevidentiary formulation. TheBatsonCourt
held that a defendant may establish a prima facie case of
purposeful discrimination in selection of the petit jury based
solely on the prosecutor's exercise of peremptory challenges at
the defendant's trial.Id.,at 87. "Once the defendant makes a
prima facie showing, the burden shifts to the State to come
forward with a neutral explanation for challenging black
jurors."Id.,at 97.4

   Last Term this Court applied theBatsonframework in two
other contexts. InPowersv.Ohio,499 U. S. 400(1991), it held
that in the trial of a white criminal defendant, a prosecutor
is prohibited from excluding African-American jurors on the
basis of race. InEdmonsonv.Leesville Concrete Co.,500 U.
S. 614(1991), the Court decided that in a civil case, private
litigants cannot exercise their peremptory strikes in a racially
discriminatory manner.5

   In deciding whether the Constitution prohibits criminal
defendants from exercising racially discriminatory peremptory
challenges, we must answer four questions. First, whether a
criminal defendant's exercise of peremptory challenges in a
racially discriminatory manner inflicts the harms addressed
byBatson.Second, whether the exercise of peremptory
                                           GEORGIA V. MCCOLLUM (1992) | 821

challenges by a criminal defendant constitutes state action.
Third, whether prosecutors have standing to raise this
constitutional challenge. And fourth, whether the
constitutional rights of a criminal defendant nonetheless
preclude the extension of our precedents to this case.

   ***
   [First Question answered] "[B]e it at the hands of the State
or the defense," if a court allows jurors to be excluded because
of group bias, "[it] is [a] willing participant in a scheme that
could only undermine the very foundation of our system of
justice-our citizens' confidence in it."Statev.Alvarado,221 N.
J. Super. 324, 328, 534 A. 2d 440, 442 (1987). Just as public
confidence in criminal justice is undermined by a conviction
in a trial where racial discrimination has occurred in jury
selection, so is public confidence undermined where a
defendant, assisted by racially discriminatory peremptory
strikes, obtains an acquitta1.
   ***
   [Second Question answered] ....Thus, the second question
that must be answered is whether a criminal defendant's
exercise of a peremptory challenge constitutes state action for
purposes of the Equal Protection Clause.
   UntilEdmonson,the cases decided by this Court that
presented the problem of racially discriminatory peremptory
challenges involved assertions of discrimination by a
prosecutor, a quintessential state actor. InEdmonson,by
822 | GEORGIA V. MCCOLLUM (1992)

contrast, the contested peremptory challenges were exercised
by a private defendant in a civil action.***

   .... As to the first principle, theEdmonsonCourt found that
the peremptory challenge system, as well as the jury system as a
whole, "simply could not exist" without the "overt, significant
participation of the government."Id.,at 622. Georgia provides
for the compilation of jury lists by the board of jury
commissioners in each county and establishes the general
criteria for service and the sources for creating a pool of
qualified jurors representing a fair cross section of the
community.***

   ....In regard to the second principle, the Court
inEdmonsonfound that peremptory challenges perform a
traditional function of the government: "Their sole purpose
is to permit litigants to assist the government in the selection
of an impartial trier of fact."Id.,at 620. And, as
theEdmonsonCourt recognized, the jury system in turn
"performs the critical governmental functions of guarding the
rights of litigants and `ensur[ing] continued acceptance of the
laws by all of the people'"Id.,at 624 (citation omitted). These
same conclusions apply with even greater force in the criminal
context because the selection of a jury in a criminal case fulfills
a unique and constitutionally compelled governmental
function.***

   Finally, theEdmonsonCourt indicated that the courtroom
setting in which the peremptory challenge is exercised
intensifies the harmful effects of the private litigant's
                                           GEORGIA V. MCCOLLUM (1992) | 823

discriminatory act and contributes to its characterization as
state action. These concerns are equally present in the context
of a criminal trial. Regardless of who precipitated the jurors'
removal, the perception and the reality in a criminal trial will
be that the court has excused jurors based on race, an outcome
that will be attributed to the State.***

   ***
   We hold that the Constitution prohibits a criminal
defendant from engaging in purposeful discrimination on the
ground of race in the exercise of peremptory challenges.
Accordingly, if the State demonstrates a prima facie case of
racial discrimination by the defendants, the defendants must
articulate a racially neutral explanation for peremptory
challenges....
   JUSTICE SCALIA, dissenting.
   I agree with the Court that its judgment follows logically
fromEdmonsonv.Leesville Concrete Co.,500 U. S.
614(1991). For the reasons given in theEdmonsondissents,
however, I think that case was wrongly decided. Barely a year
later, we witness its reduction to the terminally absurd: A
criminal defendant, in the process of defending himself against
the state, is held to be acting on behalf of the state. JUSTICE
O'CONNOR demonstrates the sheer inanity of this
proposition (in case the mere statement of it does not suffice),
and the contrived nature of the Court's justifications. I see
no need to add to her discussion, and differ from her views
only in that I do not considerEdmonsondistinguishable in
824 | GEORGIA V. MCCOLLUM (1992)

principle-except in the principle that a bad decision should not
be followed logically to its illogical conclusion.

   Today's decision gives the lie once again to the belief that
an activist, "evolutionary" constitutional jurisprudence always
evolves in the direction of greater individual rights. In the
interest of promoting the supposedly greater good of race
relations in the society as a whole (make no mistake that that is
what underlies all of this), we use the Constitution to destroy
the ages-old right of criminal defendants to exercise
peremptory challenges as they wish, to secure a jury that they
consider fair. I dissent.

   [omitted are concurring opinion by Justice Thomas and
dissenting opinion by Justice O'Connor]

                  Notes:

Drawing jurors from a "fair cross section of the community"
involves a two-step process. First, the local jurisdiction must
use a fair process in identifying people to be summoned for
potential jury duty. Typically, courts use voter registration lists
and/or driver's license list to summon people at random.
However, some demographic groups, especially the poor,
young people, and, in some places, people of color, may be
underrepresented among those who register to vote or who
have driver's licenses. If the lists from which jurors are drawn
do not accurately reflect the composition of the community,
                                           GEORGIA V. MCCOLLUM (1992) | 825

this increases the likelihood that jury pools will be wealthier
and whiter than the actual composition of the community.

   Second, during the "voir dire" process in which attorneys
question potential jurors, attorneys for each side typically can
use two kinds of "challenges" to seek to remove individuals
from participation in the jury. "Challenges for cause" involve
asking the judge to excuse a potential juror because there is an
indication of possible bias, such as the juror being personally
acquainted with the defendant or prosecutor, the juror
expressing views about the case in advance, or the juror making
statements indicating potential bias. Attorneys can make as
many requests for challenges for cause as they feel are needed
in light of responses of individual jurors.

   "Peremptory challenges" are discretionary challenges used
by attorneys to remove potential jurors without giving any
reasons. These are the challenges that have been used by
prosecutors to create all-white or all-male juries by eliminating
people of color or women from the jury pool. Each side has
a set number of peremptory challenges that they may use.
As described in Georgia v. McCollum, the Supreme Court in
a series of cases forbade the use peremptory challenges in a
racially discriminatory way by prosecutors, defense attorneys,
and attorneys in civil litigation. According to the reasoning of
the Court, such challenges do not impact the 6th Amendment
jury trial right of the defendant, but rather constitute a 14th
Amendment equal protection of the laws violation against the
potential jurors by excluding them from participation in an
826 | GEORGIA V. MCCOLLUM (1992)

important government process due to their race. In J.E.B. v.
Alabama ex rel. T.B. (1994), the Court ruled that peremptory
challenges also cannot be used to engage in sex discrimination.
That case concerned a civil action over paternity and child
support in which the state, which was seeking to force a man
to pay for the child he allegedly fathered, sought to create an
all-woman jury to pass judgement on the man.
PURKETT V. ELEM (1995)

                       U.S. Supreme Court

 Purkett v. Elem, 514 U.S. 765
                 (1995)

   PER CURIAM.
   Respondent was convicted of second-degree robbery in a
Missouri court. During jury selection, he objected to the
prosecutor's use of peremptory challenges to strike two black
men from the jury panel, an objection arguably based
onBatsonv.Kentucky,476 U. S. 79(1986). The prosecutor
explained his strikes:

      "I struck [juror] number twenty-two because of his long
      hair. He had long curly hair. He had the longest hair of
      anybody on the panel by far. He appeared to me to not
      be a good juror for that fact, the fact that he had long
      hair hanging down shoulder length, curly, unkempt hair.
      Also, he had a mustache and a goatee type beard. And juror
      number twenty-four also has a mustache and goatee type
      beard. Those are the only two people on the jury ... with
      the facial hair .... And I don't like the way they looked, with
828 | PURKETT V. ELEM (1995)

      the way the hair is cut, both of them. And the mustaches
      and the beards look suspicious to me." App. to Pet. for
      Cert. A-41.

The prosecutor further explained that he feared that juror
number 24, who had had a sawed-off shotgun pointed at him
during a supermarket robbery, would believe that "to have a
robbery you have to have a gun, and there is no gun in this
case."Ibid.

   The state trial court, without explanation, overruled
respondent's objection and empaneled the jury. On direct
appeal, respondent renewed hisBatsonclaim. The Missouri
Court of Appeals affirmed, finding that the "state's
explanation constituted a legitimate `hunch'" and that "[t]he
circumstances fail[ed] to raise the necessary inference of racial
discrimination."Statev.Elem,747 S. W. 2d 772, 775 (Mo.
App. 1988).

   ***
   The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed and
remanded with instructions to grant the writ of habeas corpus.
It said:

      "[W]here the prosecution strikes a prospective juror who
      is a member of the defendant's racial group, solely on the
      basis of factors which are facially irrelevant to the question
      of whether that person is qualified to serve as a juror in
      the particular case, the prosecution must at least articulate
      some plausible race-neutral reason for believing those
      factors will somehow affect the person's ability to perform
      his or her duties as a juror. In the present case, the
                                                   PURKETT V. ELEM (1995) | 829

      prosecutor's comments, `I don't like the way [he] look[s],
      with the way the hair is cut .... And the mustach[e] and
      the bear[d] look suspicious to me,' do not constitute such
      legitimate race-neutral reasons for striking juror 22."25
      F.3d 679, 683 (1994).

It concluded that the "prosecution's explanation for striking
juror 22 ... was pretextual," and that the state trial court had
"clearly erred" in finding that striking juror number 22 had not
been intentional discrimination.Id.,at 684.

   Under ourBatsonjurisprudence, once the opponent of a
peremptory challenge has made out a prima facie case of racial
discrimination (step one), the burden of production shifts to
the proponent of the strike to come forward with a race
neutral explanation (step two). If a race-neutral explanation is
tendered, the trial court must then decide (step three) whether
the opponent of the strike has proved purposeful racial
discrimination.Hernandezv.New York,500 U. S. 352,
358-359 (1991) (plurality opinion);id.,at 375 (O'CONNOR,
J., concurring in judgment);Batson, supra,at 96-98. ***

   The Court of Appeals erred by combiningBatson'ssecond
and third steps into one, requiring that the justification
tendered at the second step be not just neutral but also at
least minimally persuasive, i.e.,a "plausible" basis for believing
that "the person's ability to perform his or her duties as a
juror" will be affected. ...At that stage, implausible or fantastic
justifications may (and probably will) be found to be pretexts
for purposeful discrimination. But to say that a trial judgemay
830 | PURKETT V. ELEM (1995)

choose to disbelievea silly or superstitious reason at step three
is quite different from saying that a trial judgemust
terminatethe inquiry at step two when the race-neutral reason
is silly or superstitious. ***

   The prosecutor's proffered explanation in this case-that he
struck juror number 22 because he had long, unkempt hair,
a mustache, and a beard-is race neutral and satisfies the
prosecution's step two burden of articulating a
nondiscriminatory reason for the strike. "The wearing of
beards is not a characteristic that is peculiar to any
race."EEOCv.Greyhound Lines, Inc.,635 F.2d 188, 190, n.
3 (CA3 1980). And neither is the growing of long, unkempt
hair. Thus, the inquiry properly proceeded to step three, where
the state court found that the prosecutor was not motivated by
discriminatory intent.

   ***
   JUSTICE STEVENS, with whom JUSTICE BREYER
joins, dissenting.
   In my opinion it is unwise for the Court to announce a
law-changing decision without first ordering full briefing and
argument on the merits of the case. The Court does this today
when it overrules a portion of our opinion inBatson
   InBatson,the Court held that the Equal Protection Clause
of the Fourteenth Amendment forbids a prosecutor to use
peremptory challenges to exclude African-Americans from
jury service because of their race. The Court articulated a
three-step process for proving such violations. First, a pattern
                                                    PURKETT V. ELEM (1995) | 831

of peremptory challenges of black jurors may establish a prima
facie case of discriminatory purpose. Second, the prosecutor
may rebut that prima face case by tendering a race-neutral
explanation for the strikes. Third, the court must decide
whether that explanation is pretextual.Id.,at 96-98. At the
second step of this inquiry, neither a mere denial of improper
motive nor an incredible explanation will suffice to rebut the
prima facie showing of discriminatory purpose. At a
minimum, as the Court held inBatson,the prosecutor "must
articulate a neutral explanation related to the particular case to
be tried."Id.,at 98.2

   Today the Court holds that it did not mean what it said
inBatson.Moreover, the Court resolves a novel procedural
question without even recognizing its importance to the
unusual facts of this case.

                       I

In the Missouri trial court, the judge rejected the
defendant'sBatsonobjection to the prosecutor's peremptory
challenges of two jurors, juror number 22 and juror number
24, on the ground that the defendant had not made out a
prima facie case of discrimination. Accordingly, because the
defendant had failed at the first step of theBatsoninquiry, the
judge saw no need even to confirm the defendant's assertion
that jurors 22 and 24 were black; nor did the judge require
the prosecutor to explain his challenges. The prosecutor
832 | PURKETT V. ELEM (1995)

nevertheless did volunteer an explanation, but the judge

evaluated neither its credibility nor its sufficiency.

(1935)]. The prosecutor therefore must articulate a neutral

explanation related to the particular case to be tried. The trial

court then will have the duty to determine if the defendant

has                   established                       purposeful

discrimination."Batsonv.Kentucky,476 U. S., at 97-98

(footnotes omitted).

The Missouri Court of Appeals affirmed, relying partly on

the ground that the use of one-third of the prosecutor's

peremptories to strike black veniremen did not require an

explanation,Statev.Elem,747 S. W. 2d 772, 774 (1988), and

partly on the ground that if any rebuttal was necessary then

the volunteered "explanation constituted a legitimate

`hunch,'"id.,at 775. The court thus relied, alternatively, on

steps one and two of theBatsonanalysis without reaching the

question whether the prosecutor's explanation might have

been pretextual under step three.***

***

Today, without argument, the Court replaces

theBatsonstandard with the surprising announcement that

any neutral explanation, no matter how "implausible or

fantastic,"ante,at 768, even if it is "silly or

superstitious,"ibid.,is sufficient to rebut a prima facie case of

discrimination. A trial court must accept that neutral

explanation unless a separate "step three" inquiry leads to the

conclusion that the peremptory challenge was racially
                                                   PURKETT V. ELEM (1995) | 833

motivated. The Court does not attempt to explain why a
statement that "the juror had a beard," or "the juror's last
name began with the letter'S'" should satisfy step two, though
a statement that "I had a hunch" should not. Seeante,at
769;Batson,476 U. S., at 98. It is not too much to ask that
a prosecutor's explanation for his strikes be race neutral,
reasonably specific,andtrial related. Nothing less will serve to
rebut the inference of race-based discrimination that arises
when the defendant has made out a prima facie case. Cf.Texas
Dept. of Community Affairsv.Burdine,450 U. S. 248, 253
(1981). That, in any event, is what we decided inBatson.

   ***
   ....Whatever procedure is contemplated, however, I think
even this Court would acknowledge that some implausible,
fantastic, and silly explanations could be found to be
pretextual without any further evidence. Indeed,
inHernandezthe Court explained that a trial judge could find
pretext based on nothing more than a consistent policy of
excluding all Spanishspeaking jurors if that characteristic was
entirely unrelated to the case to be tried. 500 U. S., at 371-372
(pluralityopinion of KENNEDY, J.). Parallel reasoning would
justify a finding of pretext based on a policy of excusing jurors
with beards if beards have nothing to do with the pending case.
   In some cases, conceivably the length and unkempt
character of a juror's hair and goatee type beard might give
rise to a concern that he is a nonconformist who might not
be a good juror. In this case, however, the prosecutor did not
834 | PURKETT V. ELEM (1995)

identify any such concern. He merely said he did not" `like
the way [the juror] looked,'" that the facial hair "`look[ed]
suspicious.'"Ante,at 766. I think this explanation may well be
pretextual as a matter of law; it has nothing to do with the case
at hand, and it is just as evasive as "I had a hunch."...

   ...The Court's unnecessary tolerance of silly, fantastic, and
implausible explanations, together with its assumption that
there is a difference of constitutional magnitude between a
statement that "I had a hunch about this juror based on his
appearance," and "I challenged this juror because he had a
mustache," demeans the importance of the values vindicated
by our decision inBatson.

   I respectfully dissent.

                  Notes:

Critics have argued that the decision in Purkett v. Elem may
render the prohibition on discriminatory peremptory
challenges largely symbolic if trial judges are permitted to
accept any excuse for systematic exclusion of jurors by race
or sex. Indeed, it has been argued that this decision provides
a roadmap instructing attorneys how to engage in
discrimination: eliminate jurors by race or sex but claim any
fanciful reason other than race or sex for doing so. In effect,
this decision places largely in the hands of trial judges the duty
to stop this form of discrimination during jury selection. Trial
judges who are willing to accept any old reason for exclusions
                                                   PURKETT V. ELEM (1995) | 835

risk permitting intentional discrimination. Trial judges who
are skeptical and ask the attorneys, "what does that reason have
to do with the individual's ability to be a good juror in this
case?" are much more likely to guard against discrimination in
jury selection.
PART XXXVII

EIGHTH
AMENDMENT
ISSUES

   8th AMENDMENT ISSUES

The 8th Amendment contains three specific provisions that
protect constitutional rights:

   "Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines
imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted."

   We summarize these three rights as being individual
described in the three clauses of the 8th Amendment:

  · The Excessive Bail Clause
  · The Excessive Fines Clause
  · The Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause

All of the provisions require interpretation. What is "excessive
bail"? What is an "excessive fine"? What punishments are
"cruel and unusual"?

   The U.S. Supreme Court has not given much attention to
the Excessive Bail Clause. Indeed, it is one of the few rights
838 | EIGHTH AMENDMENT ISSUES

in the Bill of Rights that has not yet been incorporated and
therefore does not apply to bail amounts and conditions
imposed in state court proceedings.

   Bear in mind that the Excessive Bail Clause does not
guarantee that bail will be set in order for an arrested defendant
to gain release pending trial. It should be understood as
saying, "IF bail is set for a defendant in federal court, the
amount and conditions of bail cannot be `excessive.'" Under
federal law (Bail Reform Act of 1984), if a U.S. magistrate
judge or district judge finds that there is no amount of bail
and no conditions of release that would prevent the defendant
from fleeing or endangering the community, then the
defendant can be ordered held in jail without bail until there is
a plea agreement or trial to conclude the criminal case (United
States v. Salerno and Cafaro, 1987).

   The Excessive Fines Clause is the provision of the Bill of
Rights most recently incorporated and applied in state court
proceedings. The Supreme Court's decision in Timbs v.
Indiana (2019) [below] incorporated this clause of the 8th
Amendment and provided guidance on the definition of an
"excessive fine."

   The Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause was
incorporated and applied to the states in 1962 (Robinson v.
California). As illustrated in cases that will follow, this clause
has been interpreted by the Supreme Court to affect policies
and practices concerning capital punishment, the length of
                                           EIGHTH AMENDMENT ISSUES | 839

prison sentences, conditions of confinement in prisons, and
other aspects of sentencing and punishment.
EXCESSIVE FINES

          Excessive Fines
TIMBS V. INDIANA (2019)

                       U.S. Supreme Court

Timbs v. Indiana, 139 S.Ct. 682
                 (2019)

   Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the Court.
   Tyson Timbs pleaded guilty in Indiana state court to
dealing in a controlled substance and conspiracy to commit
theft. The trial court sentenced him to one year of home
detention and five years of probation, which included a court-
supervised addiction-treatment program. The sentence also
required Timbs to pay fees and costs totaling $1,203. At the
time of Timbs's arrest, the police seized his vehicle, a Land
Rover SUV Timbs had purchased for about $42,000. Timbs
paid for the vehicle with money he received from an insurance
policy when his father died.
   The State engaged a private law firm to bring a civil suit
for forfeiture of Timbs's Land Rover, charging that the vehicle
had been used to transport heroin. After Timbs's guilty plea in
the criminal case, the trial court held a hearing on the forfeiture
                    TIMBS V. INDIANA (2019) | 843

demand. Although finding that Timbs's vehicle had been used

to facilitate violation of a criminal statute, the court denied

the requested forfeiture, observing that Timbs had recently

purchased the vehicle for $42,000, more than four times the

maximum $10,000 monetary fine assessable against him for

his drug conviction. Forfeiture of the Land Rover, the court

determined, would be grossly disproportionate to the gravity

of Timbs's offense, hence unconstitutional under the Eighth

Amendment's Excessive Fines Clause. The Court of Appeals

of Indiana affirmed that determination, but the Indiana

Supreme Court reversed. 84 N.E. 3d 1179 (2017). The

Indiana Supreme Court did not decide whether the forfeit-ure

would be excessive. Instead, it held that the Exces- sive Fines

Clause constrains only federal action and is inapplicable to

state impositions. We granted certiorari. 585 U.S. __ (2018).

The question presented: Is the Eighth Amendment's

Excessive Fines Clause an "incorporated" protection

applicable to the States under the Fourteenth Amendment's

Due Process Clause? Like the Eighth Amendment's

proscriptions of "cruel and unusual punishment" and

"[e]xcessive bail," the protection against excessive fines guards

against abuses of government's punitive or criminal-law-

enforcement authority. This safeguard, we hold, is

"fundamental to our scheme of ordered liberty," with "dee[p]

root[s]  in  [our]  history  and

tradition."McDonaldv.Chicago,561 U.S. 742, 767 (2010)

(internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis deleted). The
844 | TIMBS V. INDIANA (2019)

Excessive Fines Clause is therefore incorporated by the Due
Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

   ***
   Today, acknowledgment of the right's fundamental nature
remains widespread. As Indiana itself reports, all 50 States have
a constitutional provision prohibiting the imposition of
excessive fines either directly or by requiring proportionality.
Brief in Opposition 8-9. Indeed, Indiana explains that its own
Supreme Court has held that the Indiana Constitution should
be interpreted to impose the same restrictions as the Eighth
Amendment.Id., at 9 (citingNorrisv.State, 271 Ind. 568,
576,394 N.E.2d 144, 150 (1979)).
   For good reason, the protection against excessive fines has
been a constant shield throughout Anglo-American history:
Exorbitant tolls undermine other constitutional liberties.
Excessive fines can be used, for example, to retaliate against
or chill the speech of political enemies, as the Stuarts' critics
learned several centuries ago. SeeBrowning-Ferris, 492 U.S., at
267. Even absent a political motive, fines may be employed "in
a measure out of accord with the penal goals of retribution
and deterrence," for "fines are a source of revenue," while other
forms of punishment "cost a State
money."Harmelinv.Michigan,501 U.S. 957, 979, n. 9 (1991)
(opinion of Scalia, J.) ("it makes sense to scrutinize
governmental action more closely when the State stands to
benefit"). This concern is scarcely hypothetical. See Brief for
American Civil Liberties Union etal. asAmici Curiae7
                                                    TIMBS V. INDIANA (2019) | 845

("Perhaps because they are politically easier to impose than
generally applicable taxes, state and local governments
nationwide increasingly depend heavily on fines and fees as a
source of general revenue.").

   In short, the historical and logical case for concluding that
the Fourteenth Amendment incorporates the Excessive Fines
Clause is overwhelming. Protection against excessive punitive
economic sanctions secured by the Clause is, to repeat, both
"fundamental to our scheme of ordered liberty" and "deeply
rooted in this Nation's history and tradition."McDonald, 561
U.S., at 767 (internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis
deleted).

   ***

                   Note:

The Land Rover owned by Mr. Timbs was seized in 2013
when he entered a guilty to a drug offense. The U.S. Supreme
Court's 2019 decision incorporated the Excessive Fines Clause
of the 8th Amendment and informed Indiana--and other
states--that this clause applies to state criminal cases. The
U.S. Supreme Court sent the case back to Indiana for its state
courts to decide whether the seizure of the vehicle violated the
8th Amendment as an Excessive Fine. The state trial court
ruled that the seizure of the $35,000 vehicle was indeed an
improper excessive fine for a crime for which the punishment
was one-year of home confinement and $1,200 in court fees.
846 | TIMBS V. INDIANA (2019)

Indiana appealed that decision through state appellate courts.
In June 2021, the Indiana Supreme Court ruled that the
vehicle must be returned to Mr. Timbs. Mr. Timbs was
represented by a public interest law firm that handles cases
involving property rights, economic liberty for businesses, and
parental choices about schools. Without the help of an
organized public interest entity, the litigation process might
very well have been much too expensive for him to see his case
through to the end if he had to pay for his own attorney.
DISPROPORTIONATE
SENTENCES

 Disproportionate Sentences
   and the 8th Amendment
LOCKYER V. ANDRADE
(2003)

  Lockyer v. Andrade (2003)

                   Note:

Lockyer v. Andrade (2003) provides a controversial example
of a case in which the Supreme Court examined whether a
specific punishment should be considered "cruel and unusual"
in violation of the 8th Amendment because it was allegedly
disproportionate to the crime. Criminal sentences can be
found to violate the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause
either because of proportionality (they are
disproportionate--too severe--for the crime being punished)
or torturousness (they are akin to torture in their impact on
the sentenced human being). A man with a drug addiction
problem stole a total of $153 worth of children's videos in two
separate thefts from different K-Mart stores. Because he had
prior convictions for burglary and theft offenses, California's
"three strikes law" was applied to him and he was given a life
sentence with no possibility of parole for 50 years. The
Supreme Court's justices have typically given states the
                                            LOCKYER V. ANDRADE (2003) | 849

authority to define their own sentences for non-death penalty
offenses. Thus, the majority of justices said that the sentence
was did not constitute improper cruel and unusual
punishment.

   According to the dissenting opinion of Justice Souter,
joined by Justices Stevens, Ginsburg, and Breyer:

   ***
   .... Perhaps even more tellingly, no one could seriously argue
that the second theft of videotapes provided any basis to think
that Andrade would be so dangerous after 25 years, the date
on which the consecutive sentence would begin to run, as
to require at least 25 years more. I know of no jurisdiction
that would add 25 years of imprisonment simply to reflect
the fact that the two temporally related thefts took place on
two separate occasions, and I am not surprised that California
has found no such case, not even under its three-strikes law.
Tr. of Oral Arg. 52 (State's counsel acknowledging "I have
no reference to any 50-yearto-life sentences based on two
convictions"). In sum, the argument that repeating a trivial
crime justifies doubling a 25-year minimum incapacitation
sentence based on a threat to the public does not raise a
seriously debatable point on which judgments might
reasonably differ. The argument is irrational, and the state
court's acceptance of it in response to a facially gross
disproportion between triggering offense and penalty was
unreasonable...
   This is the rare sentence of demonstrable gross
850 | LOCKYER V. ANDRADE (2003)

disproportionality, as the California Legislature may well have
recognized when it specifically provided that a prosecutor may
move to dismiss or strike a prior felony conviction "in the
furtherance of justice." Cal. Penal Code Ann. § 667(f)(2)
(West 1999). In this case, the statutory safeguard failed, and
the state court was left to ensure that the Eighth Amendment
prohibition on grossly disproportionate sentences was met.
If Andrade's sentence is not grossly disproportionate, the
principle has no meaning. The California court's holding was
an unreasonable application of clearly established precedent.
CAPITAL PUNISHMENT

       Capital Punishment

                   Note:

The constitutionality of capital punishment has been
challenged in the Supreme Court in many cases for more than
five decades. The Supreme Court temporarily halted the death
penalty in 1972 (Furman v. Georgia) when it ruled that the
punishment was administered too arbitrarily. States that
sought to use the death penalty rewrote their laws to require
more careful deliberation, especially through use of a separate
proceeding after conviction focused solely on the sentence (to
execute or to imprison?) and using an explicit consideration
of aggravating and mitigating factors. Aggravating factors are
those that make the crime or the murderer worse than those
in other murder cases, such as a killing during the commission
of a separate felony or a murderer with a long criminal record.
Mitigating factors are those that make the individual or the
crime less deserving of the death penalty, such as youthful age,
victimization during childhood, or limited mental capacity.
852 | CAPITAL PUNISHMENT

The Supreme Court approved a reactivation of the death
penalty under these new statutes in 1977 (Gregg v. Georgia).

   The Supreme Court has prohibited the application of
capital punishment to certain categories of crimes and
individuals when such applications were ruled to violate the
8th Amendment prohibition on cruel and unusual
punishments. For example:

  · No death penalty permitted for the crime of rape of an
      adult woman (Coker v. Georgia, 1977)

  · No death penalty for the rape of a child (Kennedy v.
      Louisiana, 2008)

  · No death penalty for someone who commits a murder
      prior to attaining the age of 18 (Roper v. Simmons,
      2005)

  · No death penalty for developmentally disabled
      individuals who commit murders (Atkins v. Virginia,
      2002).

Because the Supreme Court during its 2021-2022 term moved
swiftly to reverse longstanding precedents concerning various
major issues (e.g., the right to privacy, separation of church
and state, and the authority of government agencies),
commentators wonder whether the Court might revisit some
of these capital punishment issues. The newly constituted
majority on the Court, with the addition of three conservative
appointees of President Donald Trump, has shown it will
                                                     CAPITAL PUNISHMENT | 853

decide many issues differently than did justices during prior
Supreme Court eras.

   The Supreme Court has heard several cases presenting
arguments about lethal injection as a method of execution.
Because of problems with lethal injections, including whether
the method can inflict torturous pain, these cases seek to have
the Court declare that this method violates the Cruel and
Unusual Punishments Clause. The Court has consistently
declared that no one has yet presented sufficient evidence and
arguments to justify such a ruling (e.g., Baze v. Rees, 2008).
ROPER V. SIMMONS
(2005)

 The description of the murder in the following case is
              graphic and potentially upsetting.
                         U.S. Supreme Court

  Roper v. Simmons, 543 U.S.
              551 (2005)

   Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court.
    This case requires us to address, for the second time in a
decade and a half, whether it is permissible under the Eighth
and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the
United States to execute a juvenile offender who was older than
15 but younger than 18 when he committed a capital crime.
InStanfordv.Kentucky,492 U. S. 361(1989), a divided Court
rejected the proposition that the Constitution bars capital
punishment for juvenile offenders in this age group. We
reconsider the question.
                                                ROPER V. SIMMONS (2005) | 855

                       I

 At the age of 17, when he was still a junior in high school,
Christopher Simmons, the respondent here, committed
murder. About nine months later, after he had turned 18, he
was tried and sentenced to death. There is little doubt that
Simmons was the instigator of the crime. Before its
commission Simmons said he wanted to murder someone. In
chilling, callous terms he talked about his plan, discussing it
for the most part with two friends, Charles Benjamin and John
Tessmer, then aged 15 and 16 respectively. Simmons proposed
to commit burglary and murder by breaking and entering,
tying up a victim, and throwing the victim off a bridge.
Simmons assured his friends they could "get away with it"
because they were minors.

   The three met at about 2 a.m. on the night of the murder,
but Tessmer left before the other two set out. (The State later
charged Tessmer with conspiracy, but dropped the charge in
exchange for his testimony against Simmons.) Simmons and
Benjamin entered the home of the victim, Shirley Crook, after
reaching through an open window and unlocking the back
door. Simmons turned on a hallway light. Awakened, Mrs.
Crook called out, "Who's there?" In response Simmons
entered Mrs. Crook's bedroom, where he recognized her from
a previous car accident involving them both. Simmons later
admitted this confirmed his resolve to murder her.

   Using duct tape to cover her eyes and mouth and bind her
856 | ROPER V. SIMMONS (2005)

hands, the two perpetrators put Mrs. Crook in her minivan
and drove to a state park. They reinforced the bindings,
covered her head with a towel, and walked her to a railroad
trestle spanning the Meramec River. There they tied her hands
and feet together with electrical wire, wrapped her whole face
in duct tape and threw her from the bridge, drowning her in
the waters below.

   By the afternoon of September 9, Steven Crook had
returned home from an overnight trip, found his bedroom in
disarray, and reported his wife missing. On the same afternoon
fishermen recovered the victim's body from the river.
Simmons, meanwhile, was bragging about the killing, telling
friends he had killed a woman "because the bitch seen my
face."

   The next day, after receiving information of Simmons'
involvement, police arrested him at his high school and took
him to the police station in Fenton, Missouri. They read him
hisMirandarights. Simmons waived his right to an attorney
and agreed to answer questions. After less than two hours of
interrogation, Simmons confessed to the murder and agreed to
perform a videotaped reenactment at the crime scene.

   The State charged Simmons with burglary, kidnaping,
stealing, and murder in the first degree. As Simmons was 17 at
the time of the crime, he was outside the criminal jurisdiction
of Missouri's juvenile court system. See Mo. Rev. Stat.
§§211.021 (2000) and 211.031 (Supp. 2003). He was tried as
an adult. At trial the State introduced Simmons' confession
                                                ROPER V. SIMMONS (2005) | 857

and the videotaped reenactment of the crime, along with
testimony that Simmons discussed the crime in advance and
bragged about it later. The defense called no witnesses in the
guilt phase. The jury having returned a verdict of murder, the
trial proceeded to the penalty phase.

   The State sought the death penalty. As aggravating factors,
the State submitted that the murder was committed for the
purpose of receiving money; was committed for the purpose
of avoiding, interfering with, or preventing lawful arrest of
the defendant; and involved depravity of mind and was
outrageously and wantonly vile, horrible, and inhuman. The
State called Shirley Crook's husband, daughter, and two
sisters, who presented moving evidence of the devastation her
death had brought to their lives.

   In mitigation Simmons' attorneys first called an officer of
the Missouri juvenile justice system, who testified that
Simmons had no prior convictions and that no previous
charges had been filed against him. Simmons' mother, father,
two younger half brothers, a neighbor, and a friend took the
stand to tell the jurors of the close relationships they had
formed with Simmons and to plead for mercy on his behalf.
Simmons' mother, in particular, testified to the responsibility
Simmons demonstrated in taking care of his two younger half
brothers and of his grandmother and to his capacity to show
love for them.

   During closing arguments, both the prosecutor and
defense counsel addressed Simmons' age, which the trial judge
858 | ROPER V. SIMMONS (2005)

had instructed the jurors they could consider as a mitigating
factor. Defense counsel reminded the jurors that juveniles of
Simmons' age cannot drink, serve on juries, or even see certain
movies, because "the legislatures have wisely decided that
individuals of a certain age aren't responsible enough."
Defense counsel argued that Simmons' age should make "a
huge difference to [the jurors] in deciding just exactly what
sort of punishment to make." In rebuttal, the prosecutor gave
the following response: "Age, he says. Think about age.
Seventeen years old. Isn't that scary? Doesn't that scare you?
Mitigating? Quite the contrary I submit. Quite the contrary."

   The jury recommended the death penalty after finding the
State had proved each of the three aggravating factors
submitted to it. Accepting the jury's recommendation, the
trial judge imposed the death penalty.

   Simmons obtained new counsel, who moved in the trial
court to set aside the conviction and sentence. One argument
was that Simmons had received ineffective assistance at trial. To
support this contention, the new counsel called as witnesses
Simmons' trial attorney, Simmons' friends and neighbors, and
clinical psychologists who had evaluated him.

   Part of the submission was that Simmons was "very
immature," "very impulsive," and "very susceptible to being
manipulated or influenced." The experts testified about
Simmons' background including a difficult home
environment and dramatic changes in behavior, accompanied
by poor school performance in adolescence. Simmons was
                                                ROPER V. SIMMONS (2005) | 859

absent from home for long periods, spending time using
alcohol and drugs with other teenagers or young adults. The
contention by Simmons' postconviction counsel was that
these matters should have been established in the sentencing
proceeding.

   ***
   After these proceedings in Simmons' case had run their
course, this Court held that the Eighth and Fourteenth
Amendments prohibit the execution of a [developmentally
disabled] person.Atkinsv.Virginia,536 U. S. 304(2002).
Simmons filed a new petition for state postconviction relief,
arguing that the reasoning ofAtkinsestablished that the
Constitution prohibits the execution of a juvenile who was
under 18 when the crime was committed.
   The Missouri Supreme Court agreed.State ex rel.
Simmonsv.Roper, 112 S.W. 3d 397 (2003) (en banc). It held
that sinceStanford,
   "a national consensus has developed against the execution
of juvenile offenders, as demonstrated by the fact that eighteen
states now bar such executions for juveniles, that twelve other
states bar executions altogether, that no state has lowered its
age of execution below 18 sinceStanford, that five states have
legislatively or by case law raised or established the minimum
age at 18, and that the imposition of the juvenile death penalty
has become truly unusual over the last decade." 112 S.W. 3d,
at 399.
   On this reasoning it set aside Simmons' death sentence and
860 | ROPER V. SIMMONS (2005)

resentenced him to "life imprisonment without eligibility for
probation, parole, or release except by act of the
Governor."Id.,at 413.

   ***
   The prohibition against "cruel and unusual punishments,"
like other expansive language in the Constitution, must be
interpreted according to its text, by considering history,
tradition, and precedent, and with due regard for its purpose
and function in the constitutional design. To implement this
framework we have established the propriety and affirmed the
necessity of referring to "the evolving standards of decency
that mark the progress of a maturing society" to determine
which punishments are so disproportionate as to be cruel and
unusual.Tropv.Dulles,356 U. S. 86, 100-101 (1958)
(plurality opinion).
   ***
   A majority of States have rejected the imposition of the
death penalty on juvenile offenders under 18, and we now hold
this is required by the Eighth Amendment.
   ***
   Three general differences between juveniles under 18 and
adults demonstrate that juvenile offenders cannot with
reliability be classified among the worst offenders. First, as any
parent knows and as the scientific and sociological studies
respondent and hisamicicite tend to confirm, "[a] lack of
maturity and an underdeveloped sense of responsibility are
found in youth more often than in adults and are more
                                                 ROPER V. SIMMONS (2005) | 861

understandable among the young. These qualities often result
in impetuous and ill-considered actions and
decisions."Johnson,supra, at 367; see alsoEddings,supra, at
115-116 ("Even the normal 16-year-old customarily lacks the
maturity of an adult"). It has been noted that "adolescents
are overrepresented statistically in virtually every category of
reckless behavior." Arnett, Reckless Behavior in Adolescence:
A Developmental Perspective, 12 Developmental Review 339
(1992). In recognition of the comparative immaturity and
irresponsibility of juveniles, almost every State prohibits those
under 18 years of age from voting, serving on juries, or
marrying without parental consent. See Appendixes
B-D,infra.

   The second area of difference is that juveniles are more
vulnerable or susceptible to negative influences and outside
pressures, including peer pressure.Eddings,supra, at 115
("[Y]outh is more than a chronological fact. It is a time and
condition of life when a person may be most susceptible to
influence and to psychological damage"). This is explained in
part by the prevailing circumstance that juveniles have less
control, or less experience with control, over their own
environment. See Steinberg & Scott, Less Guilty by Reason
of Adolescence: Developmental Immaturity, Diminished
Responsibility, and the Juvenile Death Penalty, 58 Am.
Psychologist 1009, 1014 (2003) (hereinafter Steinberg &
Scott) ("[A]s legal minors, [juveniles] lack the freedom that
862 | ROPER V. SIMMONS (2005)

adults have to extricate themselves from a criminogenic
setting").

   The third broad difference is that the character of a juvenile
is not as well formed as that of an adult. The personality traits
of juveniles are more transitory, less fixed. See generally E.
Erikson, Identity: Youth and Crisis (1968).

   These differences render suspect any conclusion that a
juvenile falls among the worst offenders. The susceptibility of
juveniles to immature and irresponsible behavior means "their
irresponsible conduct is not as morally reprehensible as that of
an adult."Thompson,supra,at 835 (plurality opinion). Their
own vulnerability and comparative lack of control over their
immediate surroundings mean juveniles have a greater claim
than adults to be forgiven for failing to escape negative
influences in their whole environment. SeeStanford, 492 U. S.,
at 395 (Brennan, J., dissenting). The reality that juveniles still
struggle to define their identity means it is less supportable to
conclude that even a heinous crime committed by a juvenile is
evidence of irretrievably depraved character....

   ***
   As for deterrence, it is unclear whether the death penalty
has a significant or even measurable deterrent effect on
juveniles, as counsel for the petitioner acknowledged at oral
argument. Tr. of Oral Arg. 48. In general we leave to
legislatures the assessment of the efficacy of various criminal
penalty schemes, seeHarmelinv.Michigan,501 U. S. 957,
998-999 (1991) (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and
                                                ROPER V. SIMMONS (2005) | 863

concurring in judgment). Here, however, the absence of
evidence of deterrent effect is of special concern because the
same characteristics that render juveniles less culpable than
adults suggest as well that juveniles will be less susceptible to
deterrence. In particular, as the plurality observed
inThompson, "[t]he likelihood that the teenage offender has
made the kind of cost-benefit analysis that attaches any weight
to the possibility of execution is so remote as to be virtually
nonexistent." 487 U. S., at 837. To the extent the juvenile
death penalty might have residual deterrent effect, it is worth
noting that the punishment of life imprisonment without the
possibility of parole is itself a severe sanction, in particular for
a young person.

   ***
   The Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments forbid
imposition of the death penalty on offenders who were under
the age of 18 when their crimes were committed. The
judgment of the Missouri Supreme Court setting aside the
sentence of death imposed upon Christopher Simmons is
affirmed.
   Justice O'Connor, dissenting.
   The Court's decision today establishes a categorical rule
forbidding the execution of any offender for any crime
committed before his 18th birthday, no matter how deliberate,
wanton, or cruel the offense. Neither the objective evidence
of contemporary societal values, nor the Court's moral
864 | ROPER V. SIMMONS (2005)

proportionality analysis, nor the two in tandem suffice to
justify this ruling.

   Although the Court finds support for its decision in the
fact that a majority of the States now disallow capital
punishment of 17-year-old offenders, it refrains from asserting
that its holding is compelled by a genuine national consensus.
Indeed, the evidence before us fails to demonstrate
conclusively that any such consensus has emerged in the brief
period since we upheld the constitutionality of this practice
inStanfordv.Kentucky,492 U. S. 361(1989).

   Instead, the rule decreed by the Court rests, ultimately,
on its independent moral judgment that death is a
disproportionately severe punishment for any 17-year-old
offender. I do not subscribe to this judgment. Adolescentsas a
classare undoubtedly less mature, and therefore less culpable
for their misconduct, than adults. But the Court has adduced
no evidence impeaching the seemingly reasonable conclusion
reached by many state legislatures: that at leastsome17-year-
old murderers are sufficiently mature to deserve the death
penalty in an appropriate case. Nor has it been shown that
capital sentencing juries are incapable of accurately assessing a
youthful defendant's maturity or of giving due weight to the
mitigating characteristics associated with youth.

   ***
   Justice Scalia, with whom The Chief Justice and Justice
Thomas join, dissenting.
   .... What a mockery today's opinion makes of [Alexander]
                                                ROPER V. SIMMONS (2005) | 865

Hamilton's expectation, announcing the Court's conclusion
that the meaning of our Constitution has changed over the
past 15 years--not, mind you, that this Court's decision 15
years ago waswrong, but that the Constitutionhaschanged.
The Court reaches this implausible result by purporting to
advert, not to the original meaning of the Eighth Amendment,
but to "the evolving standards of decency,"ante, at 6 (internal
quotation marks omitted), of our national society. It then
finds, on the flimsiest of grounds, that a national consensus
which could not be perceived in our people's laws barely 15
years ago now solidly exists. Worse still, the Court says in so
many words that what our people's laws say about the issue
does not, in the last analysis, matter: "[I]n the end our own
judgment will be brought to bear on the question of the
acceptability of the death penalty under the Eighth
Amendment."Ante, at 9 (internal quotation marks omitted).
The Court thus proclaims itself sole arbiter of our Nation's
moral standards--and in the course of discharging that
awesome responsibility purports to take guidance from the
views of foreign courts and legislatures. Because I do not
believe that the meaning of our Eighth Amendment, any more
than the meaning of other provisions of our Constitution,
should be determined by the subjective views of five Members
of this Court and like-minded foreigners, I dissent.

QUESTIONS

One Final Series of Questions

Before putting this book away, please consider:
   "If Americans better understood Supreme Court doctrine

related to the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth Amendments,
do you think they would have more or less faith in the criminal
justice system? Why?"

   "If you are unhappy with the state of policing, how might
things be improved? If instead you think policing is going
fairly well, to what do you attribute the discontent exhibited
during the 2020 protests?"

   Have your answers to these questions changed as you
learned more about criminal procedure law?
