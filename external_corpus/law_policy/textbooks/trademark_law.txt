1. Introduction to Trademark Law

        Welcome to trademark law. This introductory chapter has three purposes.
First, it explains some basics of trademark law at a very high level of generality.
Second, it outlines traditional arguments for the protection of trademark rights.
Finally, it introduces several issues that complicate the development and application
of trademark law.

        At the outset, it is worth noting that trademark law is always in dialogue with
other social practices and legal systems. You don't need to take a stroll in Times
Square to know that we are awash in brands. Their creation and promotion
consume an enormous amount of resources. The choices made by marketers are, of
course, strongly influenced by the requirements of trademark law, but other
imperatives shape their strategies and, in turn, our experiences with trademarks. As
we will see, trademark doctrine has a set of conceptions about the relationship
between citizens and trademarks, but that relationship is not necessarily congruent
with the one that emerges from our interactions with trademark creators and
marketers.

        Likewise, trademark law is just one of several legal doctrines grouped in the
"intellectual property" category. As we will study, the federal copyright and patent
regimes both leave marks on the scope of trademark rights, and the state law right of
publicity overlaps with certain aspects of trademark doctrine.

        In my view, however, classifying trademark law as a subset of intellectual
property law obscures its parallel status as a regulator of marketplace information.
Trademark law is one of many doctrines--both state and federal, regulatory and
tort--that shape the creation and dissemination of information to us in our
capacities as consumers and citizens. Some of these doctrines are quite general and
could be the topic of a course of their own. For example, federal false advertising
law creates a cause of action against advertising that "misrepresents the nature,
characteristics, qualities, or geographic origin of . . . [a] person's goods, services, or
commercial activities." 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a). Other consumer information rules can
be incredibly specific, as when federal law spells out what kinds of whisky may be
labeled as "bourbon." 27 C.F.R. § 5.22(b). Detailed regulations of this sort may also
cover broader product categories, as is the case for the rules surrounding what may
be labeled as "organic." 7 CFR Part 205. And, of course, many important laws
shaping the consumer information ecosystem are not explicitly about consumer
information at all. Most notably, section 230 of the Communications Decency Act
is critical legal infrastructure for the existence of websites that host consumer ratings
and reviews of goods and services. Most of these sites did not exist, and were not
contemplated, when the law was first passed in the 1990s.

                                                     5
        Trademark law is just a part of this larger legal framework, offering its
particular views on a range of consumer information issues. Some of its answers
may conflict with those offered by other regimes. As you move through these
materials, you might ask yourself not only whether trademark law answers these
questions correctly, but also whether trademark law is the appropriate arena for
resolving some of the underlying disputes.

Some basics

        Terminology. We begin with terminology. Simply stated, a trademark is
anything used to identify and distinguish goods in the marketplace. Or as the
statute puts it, a trademark is "any word, name, symbol, or device, or any
combination thereof" that is used "to identify and distinguish" the markholder's
goods "from those manufactured or sold by others and to indicate the source of the
goods, even if that source is unknown."1 15 U.S.C. § 1127. So PEPSI functions as a
trademark because it distinguishes that brand of soda from COCA-COLA. Of
course, this simple statement hides a host of complexities that qualify what kinds of
marks can actually receive trademark protection. These rules are the subject of the
chapters that follow this one.

        To be technical, a trademark specifically identifies goods, and a service mark is
used to identify and distinguish services. In the vast majority of cases, however, the
rules for the two are the same. Unless otherwise specified, therefore, these materials
will use the term "trademark" to encompass both trademarks and service marks.

        There are a couple of other mark categories. A certification mark reflects the
certification of the mark owner that someone else's goods or services possess certain
qualities. Well-known certification marks include that of UL (formerly Underwriters
Laboratories) or fair-trade marks directed to practices promoting sustainability.

          1 In full the statute provides:

          Trademark. The term "trademark" includes any word, name, symbol, or device, or any combination
          thereof--

          (1) used by a person, or

          (2) which a person has a bona fide intention to use in commerce and applies to register on the
          principal register established by this Act,

          to identify and distinguish his or her goods, including a unique product, from those manufactured
          or sold by others and to indicate the source of the goods, even if that source is unknown.

15 U.S.C. § 1127.

                                                     6
Finally, a collective mark is a trademark or service mark "used by the members of a
cooperative, an association, or other collective group or organization" and "includes
marks indicating membership in a union, an association, or other organization." 15
U.S.C. § 1127.

        Trademark registration. You no doubt have encountered the ® symbol in
conjunction with certain marks. This symbol indicates that the mark has been
registered with the Patent and Trademark Office ("PTO"), which I will sometimes
refer to as the Trademark Office. The PTO has a webpage
(https://tmsearch.uspto.gov/search/search-information) that enables search for
trademark registrations and applications for registration. Registration is not a
requirement for securing rights in a mark. Indeed in the United States, trademark
rights are primarily based on actually using the mark in question, and trademark
rights may be lost if use ceases (known as abandonment). Rights based on use alone
are typically referred to as common law rights. Nor does registration confer rights
outside the United States (though a domestic registration may be a basis for
securing a foreign one). That said, registration confers important advantages, such
as the ability to secure priority in markets where your mark is not yet known. You
likely have also seen trademark users append the TM and SM symbols to their
marks. Unlike the ®, these terms are not federally regulated and simply represent a
claim of trademark rights, which may or may not be valid when push comes to
shove.

        Trademark Office review. The PTO produces the Trademark Manual of
Examining Procedure (TMEP) as a reference guide for trademark examiners. It
provides both a helpful summary of much of trademark law and the Trademark
Office's view of it, so the readings will often cite it.

        The actions of the Trademark Office in registering (or refusing to register)
marks are reviewable by federal courts. Those denied registration first appeal to the
Trademark Trial and Appeal Board (TTAB). In addition to hearing appeals from
adverse examiner decisions, the TTAB also adjudicates adversary proceedings (e.g.,
petitions to cancel a registration). Parties that lose before the TTAB may directly
appeal to the Federal Circuit, which is better known for being the appellate court
for patent cases. Alternatively, one may file a civil action in federal district court. 15
U.S.C. § 1071.

        Trademark rights. Federal law creates several causes of action for trademark
holders. The most fundamental ones are reprinted below.

                                                     7
                   Section 32 of the Lanham Act (15 U.S.C. § 1114):

        Any person who shall, without the consent of the registrant . . . use in
        commerce any reproduction, counterfeit, copy, or colorable imitation of a
        registered mark in connection with the sale, offering for sale, distribution, or
        advertising of any goods or services on or in connection with which such use
        is likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive . . . shall be
        liable in a civil action by the registrant for the remedies hereinafter provided.

                Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act (15 U.S.C. § 1125(a)):

        Any person who, on or in connection with any goods or services, or any
        container for goods, uses in commerce any word, term, name, symbol, or
        device, or any combination thereof, or any false designation of origin, false
        or misleading description of fact, or false or misleading representation of
        fact, which . . . is likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive
        as to the affiliation, connection, or association of such person with another
        person, or as to the origin, sponsorship, or approval of his or her goods,
        services, or commercial activities by another person . . . shall be liable in a
        civil action by any person who believes that he or she is or is likely to be
        damaged by such act.

        As you can see, Section 32 addresses registered marks, while section 43(a)
broadens potential relief to include unregistered marks. In practice, the two
provisions are administered in similar ways. Note the shared standard of targeting
conduct that is "likely to cause confusion." In addition to these causes of action, the
Lanham Act has causes of action addressing both trademark dilution and certain
uses of trademarks in domain names. We will, of course, cover all these causes of
action in detail later in the course.

        The source of federal trademark law. Trademarks are also protected by state law.
State trademark law largely parallels federal law, and our focus will be on federal
law. Any federal trademark statute needs to have a basis in the Constitution. Before
reading further, can you figure out the constitutional basis for the Lanham Act?

        And now the answer. The Patent and Copyright Acts trace their
authorization to the Intellectual Property (IP) clause.2 In Trade-Mark Cases, 100 U.S.

          2 Article I, § 8 of the Constitution gives Congress the power to "promote the Progress of Science
and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their
respective Writings and Discoveries."

                                                     8
82 (1879), the Supreme Court rejected an effort to base a federal trademark statute
in the IP clause and declared the statute unconstitutional. Since then, federal
trademark statutes have been grounded in the Commerce Clause, found in Article
I, § 8 of the Constitution, which authorizes Congress to "regulate Commerce with
foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes."

        Trademark law and unfair competition law. You will sometimes see trademark
cases referred to as suits for "unfair competition." This is in part because modern
federal trademark law unites what were once somewhat discrete bodies of law.
Unfair competition is a tort that encompasses a range of activities. These acts
traditionally included "passing off" or "palming off" of goods, acts that are now
encompassed by the trademark infringement cause of action.3 The unfair
competition tort--being loosely defined4--also included suits for acts like
misappropriation, which you may have encountered in other courses. See
International News Service v. Associated Press, 248 U.S. 215 (1918).

        Trademark law has been described as part of unfair competition law,
Hanover Star Milling Co. v. Metcalf, 240 U.S. 403, 413 (1916) ("[T]he common law
of trademarks is but a part of the broader law of unfair competition."), but it also
has independent roots. 1 J. Thomas McCarthy, MCCARTHY ON TRADEMARKS AND
UNFAIR COMPETITION § 5:2.5 In any case, the two bodies of law were discrete in the

          3 See RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF UNFAIR COMPETITION § 9 cmt. d (1995) (describing issue in early
cases involving trademarks as "whether the defendant had imitated the plaintiff's mark for the purpose of
misrepresenting the defendant's goods as those of the plaintiff" and explaining that "[t]hese actions
eventually evolved into a distinct tort of `passing off,' or `unfair competition' as it came to be known in the
United States"). Passing off is now largely synonymous with trademark infringement, though the overlap may
not be perfect. See, e.g., J. Thomas McCarthy, MCCARTHY ON TRADEMARKS AND UNFAIR COMPETITION §
1:15 ("This kind of `passing off' consisted of trying to deceive buyers by passing off one's product as that of a
competitor by means of similar marks, packaging or advertising. This type of behavior is still a major form of
unfair competition, but now is categorized one particular type of trademark infringement. Today, the terms
"passing off" or "palming off" are more properly reserved for those cases where defendant has made an
unauthorized substitution of the goods of one maker when the goods of another were ordered by the
customer.").

          4 See, e.g., Levings v. Forbes & Wallace, Inc., 396 N.E.2d 149, 153 (Mass. App. 1979) ("The
objectionable conduct must attain a level of rascality that would raise an eyebrow of someone inured to the
rough and tumble of the world of commerce.").

          5 The McCarthy treatise is the leading trademark treatise, and courts often cite it as authority, as will
these materials.

                                                     9
first part of the Twentieth Century. Federal trademark protection was once limited
to what were known as "technical trademarks," and the law of unfair competition
covered what were then known as trade names, but are now treated as trademarks.6
Passage of the Lanham Act in 1946 unified federal trademark protection in one
body of law.7

        For the most part, therefore, the references you encounter to unfair
competition will be references to trademark law (for example when an action for
infringement of an unregistered mark is styled as a suit for unfair competition).
MCCARTHY § 2:7 (noting that practice of calling infringement of unregistered
marks "unfair competition" in pleading "is not inaccurate, but may mislead those
not conversant with the standard labels used in this field of law. The habits and
traditions of custom and usage are hard to break.").

What is the purpose of trademark law?

        So much for basics. What is the purpose of trademark law? What rights
should the owner of a trademark have in order to pursue those purposes? Before we
proceed, what do you think? Even though you likely haven't studied trademarks
before, you probably have spent your life surrounded by them. How would your life
be different without trademarks? Would it be worse? Are there any ways in which it
might be better? Consider the following hypothetical:

        You are driving cross country and pull off the highway to buy gas. You're
        hungry and look for something to eat. Assume for the sake of this example
        that you like hamburgers. Across the street are two restaurants: a
        McDONALD'S and "JOE'S Burgers." You like McDonald's fine, but it's not
        your favorite cuisine. You've never heard of Joe's, and it's a purely local
        place. It's 3:00, so there are no customers in either restaurant.

          6 You need not worry about the details of this old division right now as we have yet to discuss
trademark categories. But for the sake of completeness and future reference, see 1 MCCARTHY § 4:5 ("Under
archaic usage, marks that were not inherently distinctive were not protected as `technical trademarks,' but
were protected as `trade names' under the law of `unfair competition' upon proof of secondary meaning."); id.
§ 4:12 ("The Lanham Act of 1946 integrated the two types of common law marks (technical trademarks and
trade names), calling both types `trademarks' and treating them in essentially the same manner."). Federal
trademark statutes before the Lanham Act limited registration to technical trademarks. Id. § 5:3.

          7 The statute also filled the gap created by Erie R.R. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64 (1938), which
eliminated federal unfair competition law as a matter of judge-made common law.

                                                     10
        Which do you choose? Why? How might trademarks have influenced your
decision? Are you conscious of all these influences? What advantages does
McDonald's gain from its mark? How might the McDonald's mark help your choice
even if you don't like McDonald's? Can you think of ways that the McDonald's
mark might inhibit competition?

        Continuing to think about McDonald's, how far do you think the company
may go in controlling its marks? Should it be allowed . . .

        to stop Joe's from renaming itself "McDonald's"?
        to stop Joe's from renaming itself "McDougal's"?
        to stop a computer seller from calling itself McDonald's?
        to stop a beef seller from calling itself McDonalds's?
        to stop an adult-themed magazine from calling itself McDonald's?
        to stop Joe's from adopting a similar color scheme?
        to stop Joe's from offering similar-tasting burgers?
        to stop Joe's from advertising, "we are better than McDonald's"?
        to stop Joe's from advertising, "we're just off highway 6, next to the
McDonald's"?
        to stop Joe's from paying Google to display its advertising when a search is
run on the word "mcdonald's"?
        to stop Joe's from running an ad in which actors beat up a clown dressed like
Ronald McDonald?
        to stop a vegetarian market from registering mcdonaldsfood.com as a domain
name when the owner is named McDonald, but the market is not?
        to stop a vegetarian market from registering mcdonaldsfood.com as a domain
name when it has no connection to the name?
        to stop a beef producer from advertising (truthfully) that McDonald's uses its
products?
        to stop the sales of t-shirts with the McDonald's logo?
        to stop a fictional film from depicting a McDonald's franchise as the setting
of the film's plot?
        to stop a magazine from writing an article about the rise of McJobs, defined
as a poorly paid job with little hope for advancement?

        What guides your choices? See if they remain constant as you progress
through these materials.

        A happy story of trademark law. More than seventy years ago, the Senate
Committee on Patents explained that:

                                                     11
        [t]he purpose underlying any trade-mark statute is twofold. One is to protect
        the public so that it may be confident that, in purchasing a product bearing a
        particular trade-mark which it favorably knows, it will get the product which
        it asks for and wants to get. Secondly, where the owner of a trade-mark has
        spent energy, time, and money in presenting to the public the product, he is
        protected in his investment from its misappropriation by pirates and cheats.8

        The Senate Report talks of protecting the public and trademark owners. Are
these goals in harmony? Let's start with the public side of the equation. Most
basically, as the Senate Report states, we want to ensure that purchasers "get the
product" they are asking for. In this, trademark protection can prevent fraud and
other forms of deception (if I ask for a COKE, are you going to try to pass
something else off as COKE?).

        But trademarks do a good deal more than simply name our final product
choices. A common rationale for trademark protection is the potential of
trademarks to lower consumer search costs. The idea here is that when you make a
purchase, you don't just pay the final price of the good or service in question. The
act of looking can also be costly, so making search easier will free time and resources
for consumers.

        How might trademarks lower search costs? We've mentioned one way
already. Protecting trademark rights enables consumers to trust that their choices
will be honored (if I ask for a DELL XPS, do I get a DELL XPS?). Marks also allow
consumers to rely on their past experiences as a guide to future encounters (is this
POTBELLY sandwich likely to taste the same as the ones that I've had the past?). See
Qualitex Co. v. Jacobson Prods. Co., 514 U.S. 159, 163-64 (1995) ("In principle,
trademark law, by preventing others from copying a source-identifying mark,
`reduce[s] the customer's costs of shopping and making purchasing decisions,' for it
quickly and easily assures a potential customer that this item--the item with this
mark--is made by the same producer as other similarly marked items that he or she
liked (or disliked) in the past." (citation omitted) (quoting 1 J. THOMAS MCCARTHY,
MCCARTHY ON TRADEMARKS AND UNFAIR COMPETITION 2-3 (3d ed. 1994)); see
also William M. Landes & Richard A. Posner, Trademark Law: An Economic
Perspective, 30 J.L. & ECON. 265, 269 (1987). And here we can bring sellers into the
framework. If consumers can rely on past experiences with a product, sellers have an
incentive to make those experiences positive in order to attract repeat business.

        Another powerful way trademarks lower consumer search costs is by allowing
others to assume the costs of gathering information about products. Sellers generally
have better access to this data than consumers, and are usually delighted to gather it

          8 S. Rep. No. 1333, 79th Cong., 2d Sess. 3, reprinted in 1946 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1274, 1274.

on the consumer's behalf. So once a mark is established, say for a TOYOTA
CAMRY, the seller can imbue that mark with information about the attached
product (e.g., what is the fuel efficiency of a TOYOTA CAMRY?) that would be
difficult for the buyer to assemble. The seller may also provide information about its
general reliability or otherwise offer assurances of quality that may attach to
multiple goods or services.9 The trademark is a repository of information that can
also be filled by third parties (e.g., product reviews or consumer word of mouth).
And some of this information may go beyond "concrete" product details and can
encompass matters like brand personality10 or collective affiliation (as with fans of a
sports team).

        By signaling source, a trademark is able to stand in for all this information in
a manageable manner for the consumer and can then serve as a reference point for
deeper explorations, inquiries, and ultimate choices.

        The economic role of the trademark is to help the consumer identify the
        unobservable features of the trademarked product. This information is not
        provided to the consumer in an analytic form, such as an indication of size
        or a listing of ingredients, but rather in summary form, through a symbol
        which the consumer identifies with a specific combination of features.
        Information in analytic form is a complement to, rather than a substitute for,
        trademarks.

        What about sellers? The Senate Report language quoted above talks of the
protection of seller investments from "misappropriation by pirates and cheats." The
story here is a simple one. Sellers would be reluctant to make investments in
improving the quality or lowering the price of their services if someone else were
able to swoop in and make the sale to the consumer under the first seller's mark.
Protecting this interest of trademark holders is sometimes referred to as protecting
the goodwill embodied by the mark.11

          10 For example, the marks APPLE and MICROSOFT have very different connotations. An old
Apple campaign rested on these differences. See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eEG5LVXdKo.

          11 Goodwill has a variety of definitions that contemplate more than one conception of the word.

        This cheerful account sets up consumer and seller protection as flip sides of
the same coin. The benefit to sellers, protection of goodwill, redounds to the benefit
of consumers by incentivizing the creation of desirable goods and services, creating a
competitive market in which sellers are incentivized to meet the needs and wants of
the buyers. The benefit to consumers, lowered search costs and freedom from fear
of fraud, also benefits sellers, as it enables them to compete for business. What
could be better? How might we complicate this simple happy story?

        Diverging interests. We might start by questioning the identity of consumer
and trademark owner interests. Trademark infringement actions are brought by
trademark holders, not consumers. Might we imagine situations in which seller self-
interest might lead to actions that stifle, rather than promote, competition?

        Sure. What would happen if a trademark could be claimed in a useful
product feature, like the taste of a soda? That would potentially give the soda maker
a monopoly on a particular taste.12 What if an apple distributor could claim a
trademark in the word "apple" and seek to prevent competitors from labeling their
products as apples? What if leading brands could stop unapproved references by
competitors (e.g., references by the "PEPSI Challenge" to COKE) as a
misappropriation of goodwill?

        Trademark law answers some of these questions with certain categorical
exclusions from protection. Subject matter that is functional cannot be protected.
Likewise there is no protection for generic marks, which are trademarks that describe
a product category rather than a specific product. As for comparative advertising,
trademark law has a variety of doctrinal mechanisms for giving competitors room to
talk about market incumbents. Naturally the precise scope of each of these
limitations is contested, as we will study in the coming readings.

are in some way vaguely associated with that phrase: (1) excess value, (2) favorable customer relations, and (3)
the privilege of continuance."). It has been called "that which makes tomorrow's business more than an
accident. It is the reasonable expectation of future patronage based on past satisfactory dealings." Edward S.
Rogers, GOOD WILL, TRADEMARKS AND UNFAIR TRADING 13 (1914)); cf. Newark Morning Ledger Co. v.
U.S., 507 U.S. 546, 555-56 (1993) ("Although the definition of goodwill has taken different forms over the
years, the shorthand description of good-will as `the expectancy of continued patronage,' provides a useful
label with which to identify the total of all the imponderable qualities that attract customers to the business"
(citing Boe v. Commissioner, 307 F.2d 339, 343 (9th Cir. 1962)). See generally 1 MCCARTHY § 2:17.

          12 Note that we might want to encourage this sort of monopoly in order to incentivize innovation
that may lead to new products. But that kind of incentive theory is explicit in the non-trademark IP regimes of
patent law (for inventions) and copyright law (for works of authorship).

                                                     14
        Other issues are trickier. Should the holder of, say, the BOSTON RED SOX
trademark get to control the sale of baseball caps with the team's trademark logo?
After all, no one buys the cap because they think the team makes a good hat. They
do it for other reasons--because they like the team, are from Boston, are trying to
annoy Yankees fans, etc. None of these reasons fit into the happy account of
trademark law. Indeed, trademark rights seem to disadvantage the consumer here,
because giving control to the team (or Major League Baseball's collective licensing
entity) serves to create artificial scarcity and raise consumer prices.

        Common rejoinders argue that third parties should not be able to "free ride"
on the mark (why not?) and that the Red Sox deserve the monopoly profits that
come with creating an attractive mark. Note that these rationales are outside the
trademark story developed above. The law does not prohibit free riding--imagine
the impossibility of competition if every idea were forever off limits to competitors--
and incentive theories are the province of IP regimes like copyright and patent. But
even if we overlook that, how sure are we that the Red Sox, and not their fans,
deserve the surplus value at issue here? After all, isn't part of the value of fandom
the shared experience with other fans (e.g., when Red Sox fans identify themselves
as "Red Sox Nation") that is derived from their efforts? Why should these
individual, private investments of emotion be the basis for having to pay more
rather than less? All that said, the intuition that the team should have control over
merchandising markets seems entrenched among judges (who likely number sports
fans among their ranks). Should that mean that trademark law should bend to
conform notwithstanding the poor fit with trademark's consumer protection story?

        In a similar vein, what about "prestige goods"? Suppose someone offers to
sell me a fake ARMANI suit, fully disclosing that it's a knockoff. Assuming I don't
then try to resell it as an authentic suit, is my purchase a problem for trademark law?
What is the harm?

        Issues like these abound in trademark law (some reflected in the list of
hypotheticals at the beginning of this section). The disputes concern not only
discrete questions of policy (e.g., should trademark owners control merchandising
markets?), but also more fundamental questions of trademark law's scope (e.g.,
questions of how we measure likelihood of confusion--Confusion of what? Whose
confusion? How many are confused? How likely is the confusion? Is pre-sale
confusion relevant? Post-sale? And so on and on). They reflect conflicting interests
not just between sellers and purchasers, but also among consumers (for example, I
may want to buy a fake ARMANI suit, but someone enjoying the prestige of the real
thing may not want me to).

        Trademarks as expression. Another tension concerns the role of trademarks as
cultural objects. Trademark holders work very hard to push their marks into our

                                                     15
consciousness. Having made trademarks part of the water in which we swim, what
happens when they are used as objects of commentary or as raw material for creative
expression?

        Can strong marks undermine search? Think about an over-the-counter pain
reliever like TYLENOL. It retails for a premium over generic bottles of
acetaminophen (which is the active ingredient of TYLENOL) even though the
products are chemically identical. What explains the difference? We might tell a
benign story about a consumer belief in the quality control of the mark owner.
Given the equivalence of the products (as regulated by the FDA), however, there
might be some reason to question that.13

        A more malign story might be that the seller of TYLENOL is taking
advantage of consumer cognitive limitations. Think about all the effort marketers
make in order to "position" brands in our mind and ensure that theirs is the one
that comes to mind when it's time to shop.14 On that note, consider how much of
the advertising we see has nothing to do with empirical data about a product but is
instead about creating a mood, crafting a brand personality, or simply creating an
impression of the mark in the hope that we recall it in the future.

        Once advertising, sales, and other factors have entrenched a mark as the
leading brand, does the strength of the mark function as a barrier to entry? To some
extent, the difficulty of dislodging entrenched market leaders may be the flip side of
the benefits of trademarks to consumer search costs. Our time and attention are
limited. By standing in for a range of information, trademarks simplify our ability to
find a satisfactory option, but this efficiency can be turned against competition. If a
brand is the market leader, or otherwise favorably positioned in the consumer's
mind, it can take advantage of consumer inertia or heuristics that lead to
predictable deviations from what we might expect a purely "rational" consumer to
do. Consider the "availability heuristic," described by Amos Tversky & Daniel
Kahneman,15 which gives disproportionate weight to information that comes readily

to mind. Its existence suggests that that the primary need of advertisers is not to give
us information about their products, but rather to create simple brand awareness.

        This prospect is a familiar issue in trademark scholarship. Writing in 1948,
Ralph Brown observed that:

        With time, the symbol comes to be more than a conduit through which the
        persuasive power of the advertising is transmitted, and acquires a potency, a
        "commercial magnetism," of its own. One of the oldest of advertising
        techniques, the simple reiteration of the brand name, contributes to this
        result. Early advertising artists aspired to deface every natural monument
        with such forgotten symbols as "Sapolio." Their successors, no longer
        earthbound, write the bare syllables "Pepsi-Cola" in the sky. If those who
        crane their necks at the sky-writing are unable to blurt any name but Pepsi-
        Cola to the soda-clerk, the symbol obviously has commercial value. Even
        though its continued nurture requires continued outlays, the distillation of
        past displays and jingles and art exhibits into a word makes that word of
        great price, quite independently of the vats and alchemy that produce the
        drink.16

Does this ring true to you? If not, how would you explain this ad:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_SwD7RveNE?

        If it is the case that strong marks may be a barrier to entry, what, if anything,
should trademark law do about it? Should we, for example, allow the sellers of
generic acetaminophen to use the name TYLENOL? (e.g., "TYLENOL by CVS").
Or would that undermine the potential benefits of trademark rights in other
settings? Are there middle-ground positions that trademark law might take?

        A final note. These materials are a work in progress, and I modify them each
year in response to changes in the law and student comments. I welcome your input
for making them better (and in catching the new typos generated by each year's
changes).

2. Distinctiveness

        Trademark protection begins with selecting a trademark that is eligible for
protection. To be protected a trademark must be distinctive, that is, it must be
capable of identifying and distinguishing the product or service in the marketplace.
Accordingly, Section 45 of the Lanham Act (15 U.S.C. § 1127) defines a trademark
as "any word, name, symbol, or device, or any combination thereof [used] . . . to
identify and distinguish [goods or services] from those manufactured or sold by
others and to indicate the source of the goods [or services], even if that source is
unknown." The Restatement of Unfair Competition requires that a mark be "distinctive
of a person's goods or services and . . . used in a manner that identifies those goods
or services and distinguishes them from the goods or services of others."

        Note that neither of these definitions limits a trademark to words. As we will
see, trademark rights have been claimed in a range of subject matter, including
logos, symbols, product packaging, product design, color, sounds, and expressive
works. This reading focuses on trademark protection for words.

        What does it mean to be distinctive? Trademark law sees certain marks as
inherently distinctive. That means that by their very nature, the marks are perceived as
performing a trademark function when paired with a product or service. Note that
this is an empirical assumption, which may not necessarily be true. If a court treats a
mark as inherently distinctive, the mark holder need not show that consumers
actually treat the word as a trademark.

        On the flip side of the coin, some would-be marks are not inherently
distinctive but remain eligible for protection. These source identifiers are treated as
trademarks only if the trademark holder can establish secondary meaning. For
protection, the mark holder must show that consumers have come to treat the word
or device in question as a trademark. In other words, the primary significance of the
word (in context) with the relevant consuming public must be as a source identifier
rather as a descriptor of the product. See, e.g., Kellogg Co. v. Nat'l Biscuit Co., 305
U.S. 111, 113 (1938) (when "the primary significance of the term in the minds of
the consuming public is not the product but the producer"). As you will see when
you read the Zatarains case, words that are deemed descriptive of a product are not
inherently distinctive for trademark purposes, while arbitrary words are. Thus
APPLE computer is an inherently distinctive mark, while TASTY hamburgers is
not. But if the consuming public comes to associate TASTY with a particular source
of hamburgers, the TASTY mark may be protected. Secondary meaning has its
limits. Some words may never be trademarked regardless of what consumers think.
Generic marks, words that are descriptive of product categories, are ineligible for

                                                     18
protection regardless of secondary meaning. APPLE cannot be a trademark for a
brand of apple.

        The distinction between distinctive and non-distinctive marks also applies to
trademark registration. Section 2 of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1052, makes this
distinction and gives some clues on ways to establish secondary meaning. It provides
that:

        . . . . Except as expressly excluded in subsections (a), (b), (c), (d), (e)(3), and
        (e)(5) of this section, nothing herein shall prevent the registration of a mark
        used by the applicant which has become distinctive of the applicant's goods
        in commerce. The Director may accept as prima facie evidence that the mark
        has become distinctive, as used on or in connection with the applicant's
        goods in commerce, proof of substantially exclusive and continuous use
        thereof as a mark by the applicant in commerce for the five years before the
        date on which the claim of distinctiveness is made.

        A well-known classification case follows:

                     Zatarains, Inc. v. Oak Grove Smokehouse, Inc.
                                 698 F.2d 786 (5th Cir. 1983)

GOLDBERG, Circuit Judge:
        This appeal of a trademark dispute presents us with a menu of edible

delights sure to tempt connoisseurs of fish and fowl alike. At issue is the alleged
infringement of two trademarks, "Fish-Fri" and "Chick-Fri," held by appellant
Zatarain's, Inc. ("Zatarain's"). The district court held that the alleged infringers had
a "fair use" defense to any asserted infringement of the term "Fish-Fri" and that the
registration of the term "Chick-Fri" should be cancelled. We affirm.

                        I. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS BELOW
        A. THE TALE OF THE TOWN FRIER
        Zatarain's is the manufacturer and distributor of a line of over one hundred
food products. Two of these products, "Fish-Fri" and "Chick-Fri," are coatings or
batter mixes used to fry foods. These marks serve as the entreè in the present
litigation.
        Zatarain's "Fish-Fri" consists of 100% corn flour and is used to fry fish and
other seafood. "Fish-Fri" is packaged in rectangular cardboard boxes containing
twelve or twenty-four ounces of coating mix. The legend "Wonderful FISH-FRI ®"
is displayed prominently on the front panel, along with the block Z used to identify
all Zatarain's products. The term "Fish-Fri" has been used by Zatarain's or its
predecessor since 1950 and has been registered as a trademark since 1962.
        Zatarain's "Chick-Fri" is a seasoned corn flour batter mix used for frying
chicken and other foods. The "Chick-Fri" package, which is very similar to that used

                                                     19
for "Fish-Fri," is a rectangular cardboard container labelled "Wonderful CHICK-
FRI." Zatarain's began to use the term "Chick-Fri" in 1968 and registered the term
as a trademark in 1976.

        Zatarain's products are not alone in the marketplace. At least four other
companies market coatings for fried foods that are denominated "fish fry" or
"chicken fry." Two of these competing companies are the appellees here, and
therein hangs this fish tale.

        Appellee Oak Grove Smokehouse, Inc. ("Oak Grove") began marketing a
"fish fry" and a "chicken fry" in March 1979. Both products are packaged in clear
glassine packets that contain a quantity of coating mix sufficient to fry enough food
for one meal. The packets are labelled with Oak Grove's name and emblem, along
with the words "FISH FRY" OR "CHICKEN FRY." Oak Grove's "FISH FRY" has a
corn flour base seasoned with various spices; Oak Grove's "CHICKEN FRY" is a
seasoned coating with a wheat flour base.

        Appellee Visko's Fish Fry, Inc. ("Visko's") entered the batter mix market in
March 1980 with its "fish fry." Visko's product is packed in a cylindrical eighteen-
ounce container with a resealable plastic lid. The words "Visko's FISH FRY" appear
on the label along with a photograph of a platter of fried fish. Visko's coating mix
contains corn flour and added spices.

        Other food manufacturing concerns also market coating mixes. Boochelle's
Spice Co. ("Boochelle's"), originally a defendant in this lawsuit, at one time
manufactured a seasoned "FISH FRY" packaged in twelve-ounce vinyl plastic
packets. Pursuant to a settlement between Boochelle's and Zatarain's, Boochelle's
product is now labelled "FISH AND VEGETABLE FRY." Another batter mix,
"YOGI Brand ® OYSTER SHRIMP and FISH FRY," is also available. Arnaud
Coffee Corporation ("Arnaud") has manufactured and marketed "YOGI Brand" for
ten to twenty years, but was never made a party to this litigation. A product called
"Golden Dipt Old South Fish Fry" has recently entered the market as well.

        B. OUT OF THE FRYING PAN, INTO THE FIRE
        Zatarain's first claimed foul play in its original complaint filed against Oak
Grove on June 19, 1979, in the United States District Court for the Eastern District
of Louisiana. The complaint alleged trademark infringement and unfair
competition under the Lanham Act §§ 32(1), 43(a), 15 U.S.C. §§ 1114(1), 1125(a)
(1976), and La.Rev.Stat.Ann. § 51:1405(A) (West Supp.1982). Zatarain's later
amended its complaint to add Boochelle's and Visko's as defendants. Boochelle's
and Zatarain's ultimately resolved their dispute, and Boochelle's was dismissed from
the suit. The remaining defendants, Oak Grove and Visko's, filed counterclaims
against Zatarain's under the Sherman Act § 2, 15 U.S.C. § 2 (1976); the Clayton
Act § 4, 15 U.S.C. § 15 (1976); La.Rev.Stat.Ann. § 51:1401 (West Supp.1982); the
Fair Packaging and Labeling Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1451-1461 (1976); and the Food,

                                                     20
Drug, and Cosmetic Act § 403, 21 U.S.C. § 343 (1976). The defendants also
counterclaimed for cancellation of the trademarks "Fish-Fri" and "Chick-Fri" under
section 37 of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1119 (1976), and for damages under
section 38 of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1120 (1976).

        The case was tried to the court without a jury. Treating the trademark claims
first, the district court classified the term "Fish-Fri" as a descriptive term identifying
a function of the product being sold. The court found further that the term "Fish-
Fri" had acquired a secondary meaning in the New Orleans geographical area and
therefore was entitled to trademark protection, but concluded that the defendants
were entitled to fair use of the term "fish fry" to describe characteristics of their
goods. Accordingly, the court held that Oak Grove and Visko's had not infringed
Zatarain's trademark "Fish-Fri."

        With respect to the alleged infringement of the term "Chick-Fri," the court
found that "Chick-Fri" was a descriptive term that had not acquired a secondary
meaning in the minds of consumers. Consequently, the court held that Zatarain's
claim for infringement of its trademark "Chick-Fri" failed and ordered that the
trademark registration of "Chick-Fri" should be cancelled.

        Turning to Zatarain's unfair competition claims, the court observed that the
evidence showed no likelihood of or actual confusion on the part of the buying
public. Additionally, the court noted that the dissimilarities in trade dress of
Zatarain's, Oak Grove's, and Visko's products diminished any possibility of buyer
confusion. For these reasons, the court found no violations of federal or state unfair
competition laws.

        Finally, the court addressed the counterclaims asserted by Oak Grove and
Visko's. Because no evidence was introduced to support the defendants' allegations
of monopolistic behavior, fraud, and bad faith on the part of Zatarain's, the court
dismissed the federal and state antitrust and unfair trade practices counterclaims.
The court also dismissed the counterclaim based on Zatarain's allegedly improper
product identity labelling. Both sides now appeal to this court.

                                   II. ISSUES ON APPEAL
        The district court found that Zatarain's trademark "Fish-Fri" was a
descriptive term with an established secondary meaning, but held that Oak Grove
and Visko's had a "fair use" defense to their asserted infringement of the mark. The
court further found that Zatarain's trademark "Chick-Fri" was a descriptive term
that lacked secondary meaning, and accordingly ordered the trademark registration
cancelled. Additionally, the court concluded that Zatarain's had produced no
evidence in support of its claims of unfair competition on the part of Oak Grove
and Visko's. Finally, the court dismissed Oak Grove's and Visko's counterclaims for
antitrust violations, unfair trade practices, misbranding of food products, and
miscellaneous damages.

                                                     21
        Battered, but not fried, Zatarain's appeals from the adverse judgment on
several grounds. First, Zatarain's argues that its trademark "Fish-Fri" is a suggestive
term and therefore not subject to the "fair use" defense. Second, Zatarain's asserts
that even if the "fair use" defense is applicable in this case, appellees cannot invoke
the doctrine because their use of Zatarain's trademarks is not a good faith attempt
to describe their products. Third, Zatarain's urges that the district court erred in
cancelling the trademark registration for the term "Chick-Fri" because Zatarain's
presented sufficient evidence to establish a secondary meaning for the term. For
these reasons, Zatarain's argues that the district court should be reversed. . . .

                             III. THE TRADEMARK CLAIMS
        A. BASIC PRINCIPLES
        1. Classifications of Marks
        The threshold issue in any action for trademark infringement is whether the
word or phrase is initially registerable or protectable. Courts and commentators
have traditionally divided potential trademarks into four categories. A potential
trademark may be classified as (1) generic, (2) descriptive, (3) suggestive, or (4)
arbitrary or fanciful. These categories, like the tones in a spectrum, tend to blur at
the edges and merge together. The labels are more advisory than definitional, more
like guidelines than pigeonholes. Not surprisingly, they are somewhat difficult to
articulate and to apply.
        A generic term is "the name of a particular genus or class of which an
individual article or service is but a member." A generic term connotes the "basic
nature of articles or services" rather than the more individualized characteristics of a
particular product. Generic terms can never attain trademark protection.
Furthermore, if at any time a registered trademark becomes generic as to a particular
product or service, the mark's registration is subject to cancellation. Lanham Act §
14, 15 U.S.C. § 1064(c) (1976). Such terms as aspirin and cellophane have been
held generic and therefore unprotectable as trademarks. See Bayer Co. v. United Drug
Co., 272 F. 505 (S.D.N.Y.1921) (aspirin); DuPont Cellophane Co. v. Waxed Products
Co., 85 F.2d 75 (2d Cir.1936) (cellophane).
        A descriptive term "identifies a characteristic or quality of an article or
service," such as its color, odor, function, dimensions, or ingredients. Descriptive
terms ordinarily are not protectable as trademarks, Lanham Act § 2(e)(1), 15 U.S.C.
§ 1052(e)(1) (1976); they may become valid marks, however, by acquiring a
secondary meaning in the minds of the consuming public. See id. § 2(f), 15 U.S.C. §
1052(f). Examples of descriptive marks would include "Alo" with reference to
products containing gel of the aloe vera plant and "Vision Center" in reference to a
business offering optical goods and services. As this court has often noted, the
distinction between descriptive and generic terms is one of degree. The distinction
has important practical consequences, however; while a descriptive term may be

                                                     22
elevated to trademark status with proof of secondary meaning, a generic term may
never achieve trademark protection.

        A suggestive term suggests, rather than describes, some particular
characteristic of the goods or services to which it applies and requires the consumer
to exercise the imagination in order to draw a conclusion as to the nature of the
goods and services. A suggestive mark is protected without the necessity for proof of
secondary meaning. The term "Coppertone" has been held suggestive in regard to
sun tanning products.

        Arbitrary or fanciful terms bear no relationship to the products or services to
which they are applied. Like suggestive terms, arbitrary and fanciful marks are
protectable without proof of secondary meaning. The term "Kodak" is properly
classified as a fanciful term for photographic supplies; "Ivory" is an arbitrary term as
applied to soap.

        2. Secondary Meaning
        As noted earlier, descriptive terms are ordinarily not protectable as
trademarks. They may be protected, however, if they have acquired a secondary
meaning for the consuming public. The concept of secondary meaning recognizes
that words with an ordinary and primary meaning of their own "may by long use
with a particular product, come to be known by the public as specifically designating
that product." In order to establish a secondary meaning for a term, a plaintiff
"must show that the primary significance of the term in the minds of the consuming
public is not the product but the producer." The burden of proof to establish
secondary meaning rests at all times with the plaintiff; this burden is not an easy
one to satisfy, for " `[a] high degree of proof is necessary to establish secondary
meaning for a descriptive term.' " Vision Center, 596 F.2d at 118 (quoting 3 R.
Callman, supra, § 77.3, at 359). Proof of secondary meaning is an issue only with
respect to descriptive marks; suggestive and arbitrary or fanciful marks are
automatically protected upon registration, and generic terms are unprotectible even
if they have acquired secondary meaning.
        3. The "Fair Use" Defense
        Even when a descriptive term has acquired a secondary meaning sufficient to
warrant trademark protection, others may be entitled to use the mark without
incurring liability for trademark infringement. When the allegedly infringing term is
"used fairly and in good faith only to describe to users the goods or services of [a]
party, or their geographic origin," Lanham Act § 33(b)(4), 15 U.S.C. § 1115(b)(4)
(1976), a defendant in a trademark infringement action may assert the "fair use"
defense. The defense is available only in actions involving descriptive terms and
only when the term is used in its descriptive sense rather than its trademark sense.
In essence, the fair use defense prevents a trademark registrant from appropriating a
descriptive term for its own use to the exclusion of others, who may be prevented

                                                     23
thereby from accurately describing their own goods. The holder of a protectable
descriptive mark has no legal claim to an exclusive right in the primary, descriptive
meaning of the term; consequently, anyone is free to use the term in its primary,
descriptive sense so long as such use does not lead to customer confusion as to the
source of the goods or services. See 1 J. McCarthy, Trademarks and Unfair Competition
§ 11.17, at 379 (1973). . . .

        B. "FISH-FRI"3
        1. Classification
        Throughout this litigation, Zatarain's has maintained that the term "Fish-Fri"
is a suggestive mark automatically protected from infringing uses by virtue of its
registration in 1962. Oak Grove and Visko's assert that "fish fry" is a generic term
identifying a class of foodstuffs used to fry fish; alternatively, Oak Grove and Visko's
argue that "fish fry" is merely descriptive of the characteristics of the product. The
district court found that "Fish-Fri" was a descriptive term identifying a function of
the product being sold. Having reviewed this finding under the appropriate "clearly
erroneous" standard, we affirm.
        We are mindful that "[t]he concept of descriptiveness must be construed
rather broadly." 3 R. Callman, supra, § 70.2. Whenever a word or phrase conveys an
immediate idea of the qualities, characteristics, effect, purpose, or ingredients of a
product or service, it is classified as descriptive and cannot be claimed as an
exclusive trademark. Id. § 71.1. Courts and commentators have formulated a
number of tests to be used in classifying a mark as descriptive.
        A suitable starting place is the dictionary, for "[t]he dictionary definition of
the word is an appropriate and relevant indication `of the ordinary significance and
meaning of words' to the public." Webster's Third New International Dictionary 858
(1966) lists the following definitions for the term "fish fry": "1. a picnic at which
fish are caught, fried, and eaten; .... 2. fried fish." Thus, the basic dictionary
definitions of the term refer to the preparation and consumption of fried fish. This
is at least preliminary evidence that the term "Fish-Fri" is descriptive of Zatarain's
product in the sense that the words naturally direct attention to the purpose or
function of the product.
        The "imagination test" is a second standard used by the courts to identify
descriptive terms. This test seeks to measure the relationship between the actual
words of the mark and the product to which they are applied. If a term "requires
imagination, thought and perception to reach a conclusion as to the nature of
goods," it is considered a suggestive term. Alternatively, a term is descriptive if
standing alone it conveys information as to the characteristics of the product. In this

          3 We note at the outset that Zatarain's use of the phonetic equivalent of the words "fish fry"--that is,

misspelling it--does not render the mark protectable.

                                                     24
case, mere observation compels the conclusion that a product branded "Fish-Fri" is
a prepackaged coating or batter mix applied to fish prior to cooking. The
connection between this merchandise and its identifying terminology is so close and
direct that even a consumer unfamiliar with the product would doubtless have an
idea of its purpose or function. It simply does not require an exercise of the
imagination to deduce that "Fish-Fri" is used to fry fish. Accordingly, the term "Fish-
Fri" must be considered descriptive when examined under the "imagination test."

        A third test used by courts and commentators to classify descriptive marks is
"whether competitors would be likely to need the terms used in the trademark in
describing their products." A descriptive term generally relates so closely and
directly to a product or service that other merchants marketing similar goods would
find the term useful in identifying their own goods. Common sense indicates that
in this case merchants other than Zatarain's might find the term "fish fry" useful in
describing their own particular batter mixes. While Zatarain's has argued
strenuously that Visko's and Oak Grove could have chosen from dozens of other
possible terms in naming their coating mix, we find this position to be without
merit. As this court has held, the fact that a term is not the only or even the most
common name for a product is not determinative, for there is no legal foundation
that a product can be described in only one fashion. There are many edible fish in
the sea, and as many ways to prepare them as there are varieties to be prepared.
Even piscatorial gastronomes would agree, however, that frying is a form of
preparation accepted virtually around the world, at restaurants starred and
unstarred. The paucity of synonyms for the words "fish" and "fry" suggests that a
merchant whose batter mix is specially spiced for frying fish is likely to find "fish
fry" a useful term for describing his product.

        A final barometer of the descriptiveness of a particular term examines the
extent to which a term actually has been used by others marketing a similar service
or product. This final test is closely related to the question whether competitors are
likely to find a mark useful in describing their products. As noted above, a number
of companies other than Zatarain's have chosen the word combination "fish fry" to
identify their batter mixes. Arnaud's product, "Oyster Shrimp and Fish Fry," has
been in competition with Zatarain's "Fish-Fri" for some ten to twenty years. When
companies from A to Z, from Arnaud to Zatarain's, select the same term to describe
their similar products, the term in question is most likely a descriptive one.

        The correct categorization of a given term is a factual issue; consequently, we
review the district court's findings under the "clearly erroneous" standard of
Fed.R.Civ.P. 52. The district court in this case found that Zatarain's trademark
"Fish-Fri" was descriptive of the function of the product being sold. Having applied
the four prevailing tests of descriptiveness to the term "Fish-Fri," we are convinced

                                                     25
that the district court's judgment in this matter is not only not clearly erroneous,
but clearly correct.4

        2. Secondary Meaning
        Descriptive terms are not protectable by trademark absent a showing of
secondary meaning in the minds of the consuming public. To prevail in its
trademark infringement action, therefore, Zatarain's must prove that its mark "Fish-
Fri" has acquired a secondary meaning and thus warrants trademark protection.
The district court found that Zatarain's evidence established a secondary meaning
for the term "Fish-Fri" in the New Orleans area. We affirm.

          4 Oak Grove and Visko's argue in a conclusory manner that the term "fish fry" is a generic name for
the class of substances used to coat fish prior to frying. We are unable to agree. No evidence in the record
indicates that the term "fish fry" is the common, recognized name for any class of foodstuffs. The district
court specifically rejected the contention that the term "Fish-Fri" was generic. This finding was not clearly
erroneous and must be affirmed.

          Zatarain's urges that its "Fish-Fri" mark is suggestive rather than descriptive, and our lengthy
discussion in text addresses this contention fully. We pause here, however, to speak to Zatarain's argument
that certain survey evidence introduced at trial proves the suggestive nature of the term "Fish-Fri." Just as the
compleat angler exaggerates his favorite fish story, so Zatarain's overstates the results of its consumer survey.
We consider the survey unpersuasive on the issue of suggestiveness for several reasons.

          First, the survey was not intended to investigate the term's descriptiveness or suggestiveness. Rather,
as expert witness Allen Rosenzweig testified, the survey was designed to explore two completely different
issues: likelihood of confusion in the marketplace and secondary meaning. Furthermore, the district court
prohibited Rosenzweig's testimony as to whether the survey data showed Zatarain's term to be suggestive or
descriptive.

          Second, a glance at the survey itself convinces us that, regardless of its purpose, the questions were
not framed in a manner adequate to classify the mark properly. Respondents were asked the following
questions: "2. If you planned to fry fish tonight, what would you buy at the grocery to use as a coating? 3. Are
you familiar with any product on the market that is especially made for frying fish?" If these questions were to
test the associational link between the mark "Fish-Fri" and Zatarain's product, they should have been devoid
of such broad hints as the place of purchase ("grocery"), the nature of the product ("coating"), and the
purpose or function of the product ("to fry fish"). Furthermore, we caution that survey samples such as these-
100 women in each of four randomly selected cities-may not be adequate in size to prove much of anything.

          Survey evidence is often critically important in the field of trademark law. We heartily embrace its
use, so long as the survey design is relevant to the legal issues, open-ended in its construction, and neutral in
its administration. Given the admitted purposes of this survey and its obvious design limitations, it is rather
disingenuous of Zatarain's to assert that the survey provided conclusive evidence of suggestiveness. We
therefore reject Zatarain's contention in this regard.

          Finally, Zatarain's urges that it is entitled to a legal presumption of suggestiveness by virtue of its
federal registration of the term "Fish-Fri." The Lanham Act provides that:

          [Registration] shall be prima facie evidence of registrant's exclusive right to use the registered mark
          in commerce on the goods or services specified in the registration subject to any conditions or
          limitations stated therein, but shall not preclude an opposing party from proving any legal or
          equitable defense or defect which might have been asserted if such mark had not been registered.
Lanham Act § 33(a), 15 U.S.C. § 1115(a) (1976). See also id. § 7(b), 15 U.S.C. § 1057(b). This statutory
presumption can be rebutted by establishing the generic or descriptive nature of the mark.
          Zatarain's maintains that Oak Grove and Visko's failed to show that the term "Fish-Fri" is a
descriptive one. We cannot agree. As our discussion in text indicates, ample evidence supports the appellees'
contention that "Fish-Fri" is descriptive of a coating used to fry fish. This evidence is sufficient to rebut the
presumption that the term is suggestive rather than descriptive.

                                                     26
        The existence of secondary meaning presents a question for the trier of fact,
and a district court's finding on the issue will not be disturbed unless clearly
erroneous. The burden of proof rests with the party seeking to establish legal
protection for the mark--the plaintiff in an infringement suit. The evidentiary
burden necessary to establish secondary meaning for a descriptive term is
substantial.

        In assessing a claim of secondary meaning, the major inquiry is the
consumer's attitude toward the mark. The mark must denote to the consumer "a
single thing coming from a single source," to support a finding of secondary
meaning. Both direct and circumstantial evidence may be relevant and persuasive
on the issue.

        Factors such as amount and manner of advertising, volume of sales, and
length and manner of use may serve as circumstantial evidence relevant to the issue
of secondary meaning. While none of these factors alone will prove secondary
meaning, in combination they may establish the necessary link in the minds of
consumers between a product and its source. It must be remembered, however, that
"the question is not the extent of the promotional efforts, but their effectiveness in
altering the meaning of [the term] to the consuming public."

        Since 1950, Zatarain's and its predecessor have continuously used the term
"Fish-Fri" to identify this particular batter mix. Through the expenditure of over
$400,000 for advertising during the period from 1976 through 1981, Zatarain's has
promoted its name and its product to the buying public. Sales of twelve-ounce boxes
of "Fish-Fri" increased from 37,265 cases in 1969 to 59,439 cases in 1979. From
1964 through 1979, Zatarain's sold a total of 916,385 cases of "Fish-Fri." The
district court considered this circumstantial evidence of secondary meaning to weigh
heavily in Zatarain's favor. Record on Appeal, Vol. I at 273.

        In addition to these circumstantial factors, Zatarain's introduced at trial two
surveys conducted by its expert witness, Allen Rosenzweig. In one survey, telephone
interviewers questioned 100 women in the New Orleans area who fry fish or other
seafood three or more times per month. Of the women surveyed, twenty-three
percent specified Zatarain's "Fish-Fri" as a product they "would buy at the grocery to
use as a coating" or a "product on the market that is especially made for frying fish."
In a similar survey conducted in person at a New Orleans area mall, twenty-eight of
the 100 respondents answered "Zatarain's `Fish-Fri' " to the same questions.8

          8 The telephone survey also included this question: "When you mentioned `fish fry,' did you have a
specific product in mind or did you use that term to mean any kind of coating used to fry fish?" To this
inartfully worded question, 77% of the New Orleans respondents answered "specific product" and 23%
answered "any kind of coating." Unfortunately, Rosenzweig did not ask the logical follow-up question that
seemingly would have ended the inquiry conclusively: "Who makes the specific product you have in mind?"
Had he but done so, our task would have been much simpler.

                                                     27
        The authorities are in agreement that survey evidence is the most direct and
persuasive way of establishing secondary meaning. The district court believed that
the survey evidence produced by Zatarain's, when coupled with the circumstantial
evidence of advertising and usage, tipped the scales in favor of a finding of
secondary meaning. Were we considering the question of secondary meaning de
novo, we might reach a different conclusion than did the district court, for the issue
is close. Mindful, however, that there is evidence in the record to support the
finding below, we cannot say that the district court's conclusion was clearly
erroneous. Accordingly, the finding of secondary meaning in the New Orleans area
for Zatarain's descriptive term "Fish-Fri" must be affirmed.

        3. The "Fair Use" Defense
        [The court concluded that the defendant's use of the term "Fish-Fri" was a
"fair use" for purposes of trademark law and did not create liability.]
        C. "CHICK-FRI"
        1. Classification
        Most of what has been said about "Fish-Fri" applies with equal force to
Zatarain's other culinary concoction, "Chick-Fri." "Chick-Fri" is at least as
descriptive of the act of frying chicken as "Fish-Fri" is descriptive of frying fish. It
takes no effort of the imagination to associate the term "Chick-Fri" with Southern
fried chicken. Other merchants are likely to want to use the words "chicken fry" to
describe similar products, and others have in fact done so. Sufficient evidence exists
to support the district court's finding that "Chick-Fri" is a descriptive term;
accordingly, we affirm.
        2. Secondary Meaning
        The district court concluded that Zatarain's had failed to establish a
secondary meaning for the term "Chick-Fri." We affirm this finding. The mark
"Chick-Fri" has been in use only since 1968; it was registered even more recently, in
1976. In sharp contrast to its promotions with regard to "Fish-Fri," Zatarain's
advertising expenditures for "Chick-Fri" were mere chickenfeed; in fact, Zatarain's
conducted no direct advertising campaign to publicize the product. Thus the
circumstantial evidence presented in support of a secondary meaning for the term
"Chick-Fri" was paltry.
        Allen Rosenzweig's survey evidence regarding a secondary meaning for
"Chick-Fri" also "lays an egg." The initial survey question was a "qualifier:"
"Approximately how many times in an average month do you, yourself, fry fish or
other seafood?" Only if respondents replied "three or more times a month" were they
asked to continue the survey. This qualifier, which may have been perfectly
adequate for purposes of the "Fish-Fri" questions, seems highly unlikely to provide
an adequate sample of potential consumers of "Chick-Fri." This survey provides us

                                                     28
with nothing more than some data regarding fish friers' perceptions about products
used for frying chicken. As such, it is entitled to little evidentiary weight.10

        It is well settled that Zatarain's, the original plaintiff in this trademark
infringement action, has the burden of proof to establish secondary meaning for its
term. This it has failed to do. The district court's finding that the term "Chick-Fri"
lacks secondary meaning is affirmed.

        3. Cancellation
        Having concluded that the district court was correct in its determination that
Zatarain's mark "Chick-Fri" is a descriptive term lacking in secondary meaning, we
turn to the issue of cancellation. The district court, invoking the courts' power over
trademark registration as provided by section 37 of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. §
1119 (1976), ordered that the registration of the term "Chick-Fri" should be
cancelled. The district court's action was perfectly appropriate in light of its findings
that "Chick-Fri" is a descriptive term without secondary meaning. We affirm . . . .

                                              Notes

        The Abercrombie spectrum. The spectrum of distinctiveness is sometimes
referred to as the Abercrombie spectrum after Abercrombie & Fitch Co. v. Hunting
World, Inc., 537 F.2d 4 (2d Cir. 1976), which set out the points on the spectrum in
an opinion by Judge Henry Friendly. Id. at 9.

        Questioning fanciful marks. Ever use a SWIFFER mop? The word "swiffer" is
invented, but is it really fanciful? Jake Linford notes that a "nonsense word like
Swiffer may lack a dictionary definition, but the component sounds in the word
communicate speed and ease of use, independent of whether the word resembles
other known words." Jake Linford, Are Trademarks Ever Fanciful?, 105 Geo. L.J. 731,
734 (2017). Likewise, which of the following images is "bouba" and which is "kiki"?

          10 Even were we to accept the results of the survey as relevant, the result would not change. In the
New Orleans area, only 11 of the 100 respondents in the telephone survey named "Chick-Fri," "chicken fry,"
or "Zatarain's `Chick-Fri' "as a product used as a coating for frying chicken. Rosenzweig himself testified that
this number was inconclusive for sampling purposes. Thus the survey evidence cannot be said to establish a
secondary meaning for the term "Chick-Fri."

                                                     29
See id. at 750-52 (discussing sound symbolism). When surveyed, people generally
agree on which is which even though "kiki" and "bouba" are meaningless words.
Does this call into question the treatment trademark law gives to fanciful marks?

        Irresistible marks. It's easy to come up with an inherently distinctive term, isn't
it? Why then do trademark holders insist on adopting descriptive marks? Judge
Learned Hand mused,

        I have always been at a loss to know why so many marks are adopted which
        have an aura, or more, of description about them. With the whole field of
        possible coinage before them, it is strange that merchants insist upon
        adopting marks that are so nearly descriptive. Probably they wish to interject
        into the name of their goods some intimation of excellence, and are willing
        to incur the risk.

Franklin Knitting Mills, Inc. v. Fashionit Sweater Mills, Inc., 297 F. 247 (S.D.N.Y.
1923), aff'd, 4 F.2d 1018 (2d Cir. 1925). The temptation to advertise while branding
is a strong one. Is such advertising just about claiming a feature? Or something
more?

        Context matters. Note that a mark's classification depends on the product, so
in Abercrombie & Fitch Co. v. Hunting World, Inc. the Second Circuit found that the
mark SAFARI was generic for certain types of clothing, including a broad flat-
brimmed hat with a large band, a belted bush jacket with patch pockets, and clothes
with khaki coloring, but descriptive or suggestive for boots and shoes. Of course for
web browsers, it is arbitrary (or perhaps suggestive), thus Apple's use of the name for
its SAFARI browser.

        Relatedly, in determining whether a mark is descriptive, one cannot consider
the term in the abstract. As the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board has explained:

        the question of whether a mark is merely descriptive must be determined not
        in the abstract, that is, not by asking whether one can guess, from the mark
        itself, considered in a vacuum, what the goods or services are, but rather in
        relation to the goods or services for which registration is sought, that is, by
        asking whether, when the mark is seen on the goods or services, it
        immediately conveys information about their nature.

In re Patent & Trademark Services Inc., 49 U.S.P.Q.2d 1537, 1539, 1998 WL 970180
(T.T.A.B. 1998). So suppose you had a soda branded THICK. Liquid is not thick,
so one might think that the mark is not descriptive, but suppose further that the

                                                     30
soda's flavor had a very thick mouthfeel. Were that the case, a court could find that
the term in context connotes flavor and not viscosity and would therefore be
descriptive. See, e.g., A.J. Canfield Co. v. Honickman, 808 F.2d 291 (3d Cir. 1986).

        Anti-dissection. Sometimes would-be marks combine elements that would be
ineligible for protection if used individually. The rule is to consider the marks as a
whole and not their component parts. "The commercial impression of a trademark
is derived from it as a whole, not from its elements separated and considered in
detail. For this reason it should be considered in its entirety." Estate of P. D.
Beckwith, Inc. v. Commissioner of Patents, 252 U.S. 538, 545-46 (1920). This is
sometimes referred to as the anti-dissection rule. Thus COCA-COLA is a valid
mark notwithstanding the generic element COLA.

        This is not to say that having non-protectable elements in a would-be mark is
irrelevant. As the Federal Circuit has explained: "In considering the mark as a
whole, the Board may weigh the individual components of the mark to determine
the overall impression or the descriptiveness of the mark and its various
components." In re Oppedahl & Larson LLP, 373 F.3d 1171 (Fed. Cir. 2004).
There, the court affirmed a ruling by the TTAB that PATENTS.COM was merely
descriptive notwithstanding the addition of the .com top-level-domain name to the
word patents. Sometimes the whole is just the sum of its parts. See, e.g., Arizona
Int'l, Ltd. v. Merrill Lynch Realty Operating Partnership, 1991 WL 407023 (D.
Ariz. 1991) (rejecting ARIZONA REALTY as a generic composite of the product
category of Arizona property services).

        Anti-dissection principles also apply in considering whether a trademark is
infringing.

        Foreign words. The "doctrine of foreign equivalents" calls for words in foreign
languages to be treated as if they were translated into English. Thus the French
word "vin" would still be rejected as generic for a brand of wine. The TTAB has
explained:

        The doctrine of foreign equivalents ... extends the protection of the
        [Lanham] Act to those consumers in this country who speak other languages
        in addition to English ... . At least one significant group of ordinary
        American purchasers is the purchaser who is knowledgeable in English as
        well as the pertinent foreign language.

In re Spirits International N.V., 86 U.S.P.Q.2d 1078, 1083-1085, 2008 WL
375723 (T.T.A.B. 2008). That said, the Federal Circuit has stated that the doctrine
is not a rigid rule but should be applied in a contextual manner. Given the

                                                     31
product's marketing, would a reasonable consumer familiar with both English and
the foreign word make the translation? Palm Bay Imports, Inc. v. Veuve Clicquot
Ponsardin Maison Fondee En 1772, 396 F.3d 1369, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2005). Courts
also refrain from applying the doctrine to dead or obscure languages.

        Disclaimers. Because marks will often include non-protectable elements, it is
common for trademark registrants to "disclaim" an effort to capture the non-
protectable word. This does not preclude a rejection if the mark as a whole is
descriptive. Nor does it preclude the registrant from claiming the disclaimed matter
in an action based on common law use rights. See generally 15 U.S.C. § 1056.

        Secondary meaning. There are a variety of judicial definitions of secondary
meaning, but they center on the same concept, the point at which consumers
identify a term as designating a product's source. See, e.g., Kellogg Co. v. National
Biscuit Co., 305 U.S. 111, 118 (1938) (secondary meaning is the point at which
"the primary significance of the term in the minds of the consuming public is not
the product but the producer"). In a similar vein, section 2 of the Lanham Act (15
U.S.C. § 1052) provides that certain non-distinctive marks may be registered if they
have "become distinctive of the applicant's goods in commerce."

        Note, however, that this association with a word as designating a single
source does not necessarily mean that the consumer knows precisely who that
source is.

        Proving secondary meaning. Did you find the survey evidence of Zatarains
persuasive?

        Courts are not entirely consistent in determining when secondary meaning
exists, which is perhaps unsurprising given its status as a question of fact. In the
absence of direct consumer testimony, surveys may provide something resembling
direct evidence of consumer perception. As evidenced by Zatarains, courts do not
require that a majority of the relevant consumer class see the word as a mark. A
substantial portion is often enough.

        Courts also rely on more circumstantial evidence. Some forms of acceptable
circumstantial evidence include the exclusive use of the term by one party as a mark,
advertising, sales and customers, market position, and evidence that a defendant
intentionally copied the mark. See, e.g., Viacom Int'l v. IJR Capital Investments,
L.L.C., 891 F.3d 178, 190 (5th Cir. 2018) (listing factors as "(1) length and manner
of use of the mark or trade dress, (2) volume of sales, (3) amount and manner of
advertising, (4) nature of use of the mark or trade dress in newspapers and
magazines, (5) consumer-survey evidence, (6) direct consumer testimony, and (7) the
defendant's intent in copying the [mark]." (internal quotation and citation

                                                     32
omitted)); see also 15 U.S.C. § 1052 (providing that the Trademark Office "may
accept as prima facie evidence that the mark has become distinctive, as used on or
in connection with the applicant's goods in commerce, proof of substantially
exclusive and continuous use thereof as a mark by the applicant in commerce for
the five years before the date on which the claim of distinctiveness is made."). Are
these factors necessarily probative of secondary meaning? What about situations in
which the descriptive term is sometimes used with an inherently distinctive mark
and sometimes without?

        Does it matter if a defendant copied the plaintiff's mark? Might a defendant
sometimes copy a term for descriptive (as opposed to trademark) purposes? Some
Second Circuit cases have suggested that the New York law of unfair competition
allows evidence of the deliberate copying of a non-inherently distinctive mark to
substitute for proof of secondary meaning. The viability of this "New York Rule" is
in doubt. See generally 2 MCCARTHY § 15:20.

        As for the Trademark Office, 37 C.F.R. § 2.41 provides that proof of
acquired distinctiveness includes:

        (1) Ownership of prior registration(s). In appropriate cases, ownership of one
        or more active prior registrations on the Principal Register or under the
        Trademark Act of 1905 of the same mark may be accepted as prima facie
        evidence of distinctiveness if the goods or services are sufficiently similar to
        the goods or services in the application; however, further evidence may be
        required.

        (2) Five years substantially exclusive and continuous use in commerce. In
        appropriate cases, if a trademark or service mark is said to have become
        distinctive of the applicant's goods or services by reason of the applicant's
        substantially exclusive and continuous use of the mark in commerce for the
        five years before the date on which the claim of distinctiveness is made, a
        showing by way of verified statements in the application may be accepted as
        prima facie evidence of distinctiveness; however, further evidence may be
        required.

        (3) Other evidence. In appropriate cases, where the applicant claims that a
        mark has become distinctive in commerce of the applicant's goods or
        services, the applicant may, in support of registrability, submit with the
        application, or in response to a request for evidence or to a refusal to
        register, verified statements, depositions, or other appropriate evidence
        showing duration, extent, and nature of the use in commerce and advertising
        expenditures in connection therewith (identifying types of media and
        attaching typical advertisements), and verified statements, letters or

                                                     33
        statements from the trade or public, or both, or other appropriate evidence
        of distinctiveness.

        Sliding scales. Some courts vary the amount of evidence of secondary meaning
required on how descriptive the term is. That is, terms closer to the
suggestive/descriptive border may not require as much evidence of secondary
meaning as a more obviously descriptive mark. See, e.g., In re Steelbuilding.com, 415
F.3d 1293, 1300 (Fed. Cir. 2005) ("[T]he applicant's burden of showing acquired
distinctiveness increases with the level of descriptiveness; a more descriptive term
requires more evidence of secondary meaning."); 2 MCCARTHY § 15:33.

        "Secondary meaning in the making." What happens if someone uses, advertises,
or otherwise invests in a descriptive mark, but fails to achieve secondary meaning
before another, more powerful user, deliberately steps in with the same mark. Does
the first user have a remedy? The judicial answer has largely been no.

        Does the mark function as a mark? How a mark is used also affects whether
consumers perceive it as performing a trademark function. If you look at, say, a box
of cereal, you'll see that the brand name is set off in any manner of ways, including
font size and style, graphic elements, and packaging position. These design choices
also affect whether consumers perceive the mark as performing a trademark
function. For empirical research on this point, see Thomas R. Lee, Eric D. DeRosia,
& Glenn L. Christensen, An Empirical and Consumer Psychology Analysis of Trademark
Distinctiveness, 41 Ariz. St. L.J. 1033, 1097-98 (2009) (varying uses testing
hypothetical WONDERFUL mark for chocolate coconut macaroons).

        If it is the case that trademark placement can make consumers see descriptive
terms as trademarks, does that cast doubt on trademark law's skepticism of
descriptive marks? Or is the effect on competition the more important concern? Or
is what matters non-label uses (e.g., hearing the trademarked word in advertising,
e.g., "try our wonderful cereal!")?

        Courts and the PTO sometimes refuse to protect claimed marks that fail to
function as marks (considering questions like placement of the mark, whether it is
set off from other elements, whether the matter is informational, etc.). For an
argument that this trademark use question should matter more and integrate
considerations of distinctiveness, see Alexandra J. Roberts, Trademark Failure to
Function, 104 Iowa L. Rev. 1977 (2019).

        Use as a mark and scope of protection. We will not cover trademark
infringement for a while yet, but note how issues of distinctiveness and trademark
use naturally raise questions about the scope of trademark rights. For example, the

                                                     34
Trademark Office will sometimes refuse to register a mark that is merely used as a
slogan on a t-shirt.

        An ornamental refusal is when the USPTO refuses registration of your mark
        because the sample of how you actually use the applied-for mark (the
        "specimen") or other information in the record shows use of your mark
        merely as an ornamental or decorative feature on the goods and not as a
        trademark to indicate the source of the goods. For example, a slogan
        prominently displayed on the front of a t-shirt may be considered merely
        ornamental use and not trademark use. That is, most purchasers of the t-
        shirts would not automatically think the slogan identified the source of the
        goods but would view the slogan only as a decoration on the goods.

USPTO, "`Ornamental' Refusal and How to Overcome This Refusal,"
https://www.uspto.gov/trademark/laws-regulations/ornamental-refusal-and-how-
overcome-refusal-0. Fair enough. So suppose the t-shirt entrepreneur uses the slogan
on the front of the shirt and the collar tag (where trademarks on clothing are often
found). That seems enough for trademark protection. Suppose then that a
competitor comes along who uses the same slogan on the front of the t-shirt, but
has an entirely different (non-infringing) trademark inside the collar? Will an
infringement claim based on the front be possible? As we will see, the answer is
often yes.

        Enough marks? Trademark law assumes that the costs of protection are
generally low given that there is a functionally inexhaustible supply of marks. For
research suggesting this may not be so in practice, see Barton Beebe & Jeanne C.
Fromer, Are We Running Out of Trademarks? An Empirical Study of Trademark Depletion
and Congestion, 131 Harv. L. Rev. 945, 953 (2018) ("New market entrants face
significant barriers to entry in the form of the cost of searching for an unclaimed
mark and in the ongoing cost of using a less effective mark.").

        What's in a name? REX Real Estate has a founding partner named Rex
Glendenning. Does that make the mark descriptive? The traditional approach is
that first names and surnames are treated as descriptive marks and require
secondary meaning for protection. But consumers might perceive a word like "Rex"
as having a royal connotation, creating the possibility that the mark is inherently
distinctive. The answer in cases like this will therefore depend on the record created
by the litigants. See Rex Real Estate I, L.P. v. Rex Real Estate Exchange, Inc., 80
F.4th 607 (5th Cir. 2023) (concluding that the district court erred by resolving the
question as a matter of law); see generally 2 MCCARTHY § 13.2.

        Fair use. You may have noticed the reference in Zatarains to "fair use" as
excusing the defendants' potential liability. Those of you who have studied
copyright may be familiar with the fair use defense in copyright. Fair use means
something different in trademark law (as indicated by its description in Zatarains).
We will cover trademark fair use in greater detail later in the course.

Technologies, a computer manufacturer. Strisk has a new computer line that will be
marketed as providing faster performance than Strisk's competitors, particularly
when the computer is turned on. The marketing department suggested the
following names:

Laptop                                    a computer

        Which, if any, of these names could secure trademark protection? Which
names would work best from a marketing perspective? You may assume that none of
these options infringe any existing trademarks.

        2. The Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) developed a system of rating the
credit worthiness of borrowers. FICO rates potential borrowers on a 300-850 point
scale (with higher ratings indicating better credit risks). May FICO trademark "300-
850" for its credit rating services? What kind of mark would it be? Is there any harm
to allowing protection for this kind of mark?

            Filipino Yellow Pages, Inc. v. Asian Journal Publications, Inc.
                                198 F.3d 1143 (9th Cir. 1999)

O'SCANNLAIN, Circuit Judge:
        We must decide whether the publisher of a telephone directory for the

Filipino-American community can establish that the term "Filipino Yellow Pages" is
protectible under trademark law. [Plaintiff, FYP, published the Filipino Yellow Pages.
Defendant, AJP, published the Filipino Consumer Directory.]

        In June 1996, two months before it sued AJP for trademark infringement,
FYP applied for registration of "Filipino Yellow Pages" with the Patent and
Trademark Office ("PTO"). In December 1996, the PTO refused registration of
"Filipino Yellow Pages." The PTO stated: "The proposed mark merely describes the
goods and the nature and intended audience for the goods. Accordingly, the mark
cannot be registered on the Principal Register based solely on an intent to use the
mark in Interstate Commerce." The PTO informed FYP that because its application
"indicate[d] use of the mark for a significant time," however, FYP could amend its
application to seek registration based on acquired distinctiveness. The PTO further
advised FYP that its amended application would have to include the following
disclaimer: "No claim is made to the exclusive right to use [the term] `yellow pages'
apart from [`Filipino Yellow Pages']." FYP subsequently amended its application for
trademark registration to seek registration based on acquired distinctiveness. FYP's
application for trademark registration remains pending at the current time.

        On August 2, 1996, FYP filed a complaint against AJP.... FYP alleged the
following causes of action: (1) trademark infringement; (2) false designation of
origin and false description of sponsorship or affiliation; (3) unfair competition and
misappropriation of goodwill, reputation, and business properties . . . .

        AJP moved for summary judgment, arguing that the term "Filipino Yellow
Pages" is generic and as such incapable of trademark protection. In support of this
contention, AJP relied upon:

          1. the presence in the dictionary and generic nature of the individual terms
  "Filipino" and "yellow pages";

          2. [The generic use of the term "Filipino Yellow Pages" in an earlier non-
  compete agreement between the parties in which the owner of the plaintiff entity
  "agree[d] not to compete in the Filipino Directory (Filipino Yellow Pages) [market]
  in California...."];

          3. the marketing of a second Filipino Yellow Pages, that of Kayumanggi
  Communications, to the Filipino-American community on the East Coast; and

          4. generic usage by the media of the term "Filipino Yellow Pages," in a Los

                                                     38
  Angeles Times article on specialty yellow pages which stated as follows: "Virgil Janio
  of Los Angeles sells ads nationwide for his Filipino yellow pages...."

        In opposing the motion for summary judgment, FYP contended that
"Filipino Yellow Pages," rather than being generic, is protectible under trademark
law as a descriptive mark with a secondary meaning in the minds of consumers (i.e.,
as specifically referring to FYP's telephone directory). . . .

        [T]he district court granted AJP's motion for summary judgment. The district
court held that (1) the term "Filipino Yellow Pages" is generic, and as such
incapable of serving as a trademark; and (2) even if the term were descriptive, AJP
would still be entitled to summary judgment because FYP had failed to produce any
admissible evidence of secondary meaning. . . .

                                                 II
        The first issue presented is whether the term "Filipino Yellow Pages" is
generic with respect to telephone directories targeted at the Filipino-American
community. . . .

                                                 A
         Before proceeding to the merits, a word on the burden of persuasion is
appropriate. In cases involving properly registered marks, a presumption of validity
places the burden of proving genericness upon the defendant. If a supposedly valid
mark is not federally registered, however, the plaintiff has the burden of proving
nongenericness once the defendant asserts genericness as a defense. The case at bar
involves a claimed mark that is unregistered; FYP has not yet been successful in its
attempts to register "Filipino Yellow Pages" with the PTO. Thus FYP, as trademark
plaintiff, bears the burden of showing that "Filipino Yellow Pages" is not generic.

                                                 B
         . . . . AJP contends that "Filipino Yellow Pages" is a generic term and as such
incapable of trademark protection, while FYP argues that the term is protectible as a
descriptive term with secondary meaning.3
        . . . . In determining whether a term is generic, we have often relied upon the
"who-are-you/what-are-you" test: "A mark answers the buyer's questions `Who are
you?' `Where do you come from?' `Who vouches for you?' But the [generic] name of
the product answers the question `What are you?' " Official Airline Guides, Inc. v.
Goss, 6 F.3d 1385, 1391 (9th Cir.1993) (quoting 1 J. Thomas McCarthy, Trademarks
and Unfair Competition § 12.01 (3d ed.1992)). Under this test, "[i]f the primary
significance of the trademark is to describe the type of product rather than the

          3 FYP does not claim (nor could it do so successfully) that "Filipino Yellow Pages" can qualify for

trademark protection as a suggestive mark . . . . No imagination or mental leap is required to ascertain that

the Filipino Yellow Pages is a telephone directory targeted at the Filipino-American community.

                                                     39
producer, the trademark [is] a generic term and [cannot be] a valid trademark."
         Here the parties do not dispute that "Filipino" and "yellow pages" are

generic terms. The word "Filipino" is a clearly generic term used to refer to "a native
of the Philippine islands" or "a citizen of the Republic of the Philippines." Webster's
Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary 462 (1986). The term "yellow pages" has been found
to be a generic term for "a local business telephone directory alphabetized by
product or service." AmCan Enters., Inc. v. Renzi, 32 F.3d 233, 234 (7th Cir.1994)
(Posner, J.) (citing cases, and noting that "yellow pages," which originally was not a
generic term, has become generic over time); see also Webster's Ninth New Collegiate
Dictionary 1367 (defining "yellow pages" as "the section of a telephone directory that
lists businesses and professional firms alphabetically by category and that includes
classified advertising") . . . .

        The issue then becomes whether combining the generic terms "Filipino" and
"yellow pages" to form the composite term "Filipino Yellow Pages" creates a generic
or a descriptive term. AJP argues, and the district court concluded, that "Filipino
Yellow Pages" is generic based on this court's analysis in Surgicenters of America, Inc.
v. Medical Dental Surgeries Co., 601 F.2d 1011 (9th Cir.1979). In Surgicenters, we held
that the term "surgicenter" was generic and that the plaintiff's registered service
mark had to be removed from the trademark register. In our discussion in
Surgicenters, we summarized (but did not explicitly adopt) the analysis of the district
court in that case, which reasoned that "surgicenter," created by combining the
generic terms "surgery" and "center," retained the generic quality of its components.
We distinguished "surgicenter" from the composite term "Startgrolay," upheld as a
valid mark for poultry feed, by noting that the combination of terms in
"surgicenter" did not constitute a "deviation from normal usage" or an "unusual
unitary combination." Nowhere in Surgicenters did we hold, however, that a
composite term made up of generic components is automatically generic unless the
combination constitutes a "deviation from normal usage" or an "unusual unitary
combination."

        In reaching our conclusion of genericness in Surgicenters, we placed
significant but not controlling weight on the dictionary definitions and generic
nature of "surgery" and "center." We explained that "[w]hile not determinative,
dictionary definitions are relevant and often persuasive in determining how a term
is understood by the consuming public, the ultimate test of whether a trademark is
generic." But we also based our genericness finding upon detailed information in
some 45 exhibits that, taken collectively, suggested that the consuming public
considered the composite term "surgicenter" to mean a surgical center generally
speaking, as opposed to a surgical center maintained and operated by the plaintiff
specifically. These exhibits included letters from potential consumers and several
publications that used the term "surgicenter" in a clearly generic sense. The finding

                                                     40
of genericness in Surgicenters cannot be separated from the uniquely well-developed
record in that case.

        In this case, the district court cited Surgicenters for the proposition that "a
combination of two generic words is also generic, unless the combination is a
`deviation from natural usage' or an `unusual unitary combination.' " The court
then stated that "[u]nder this analysis, the term `Filipino Yellow Pages' seems to be
neither a `deviation from natural usage,' nor an `unusual unitary combination.' "
The district court's reading of Surgicenters appears somewhat troubling insofar as it
oversimplifies our opinion. First, it overlooks our explicit recognition that "words
which could not individually become a trademark may become one when taken
together." Second, it effectively makes dictionary definitions the crucial factor in
assessing genericness, even though Surgicenters makes clear that such definitions are
"not determinative" and that the "ultimate test" of genericnessness is "how a term is
understood by the consuming public." Finally, it severs our Surgicenters analysis from
its unique factual context, in which a wealth of exhibits supported a finding that the
term "surgicenter" was generic even when taken as a whole (as opposed to the sum
of generic parts).

        Furthermore, reading the Surgicenters opinion for the rather broad (and
somewhat reductionist) principle that "a generic term plus a generic term equals a
generic term" would give rise to an unnecessary conflict between that decision and
several other cases, decided both before and after Surgicenters, in which we have
adopted a more holistic approach to evaluating composite terms.

        In United States Jaycees v. San Francisco Junior Chamber of Commerce, 513 F.2d
1226 (9th Cir.1975) (per curiam), decided a few years before Surgicenters, this court
rejected the rather blunt "generic plus generic equals generic" approach to
evaluating composite terms. The Jaycees court affirmed the district court's holding
that "Junior Chamber of Commerce" was a descriptive mark with secondary
meaning over a dissent arguing that "Junior Chamber of Commerce" was generic.
The dissent relied upon the presence of "junior" and "chamber of commerce" in
the dictionary to argue that both terms were generic and that "junior" modified
"chamber of commerce" in a perfectly ordinary way, thereby creating a generic term.
The Jaycees court, in affirming over the dissent, implicitly rejected evaluating
genericness of composite terms by breaking them down into their parts.

        Several of our more recent cases have taken a fairly integrative approach to
evaluating composite terms, rejecting the breaking down of such terms into their
individual (and often generic) parts....

        In California Cooler, Inc. v. Loretto Winery, Ltd., 774 F.2d 1451 (9th Cir.1985),
we affirmed the district court's preliminary injunction enjoining the defendant from
using the name "California Special Cooler" for its wine cooler products on the
ground that it was confusingly similar to the plaintiff's registered trademark,

                                                     41
"California Cooler." The defendant in California Cooler argued that because the
generic terms "California" and "Cooler" could not qualify as valid marks
individually, their combination, "California Cooler," was similarly generic. We
rejected this argument: "California Cooler's mark is a composite term, and its
validity is not judged by an examination of its parts. Rather, the validity of a
trademark is to be determined by viewing the trademark as a whole. ... Thus, the
composite may become a distinguishing mark even though its components
individually cannot.") . . . .

        Finally, in Committee for Idaho's High Desert, Inc. v. Yost, 92 F.3d 814 (9th
Cir.1996), we held that an environmental organization's name, "Committee for
Idaho's High Desert," was not generic. Appellants challenged the validity of that
tradename by arguing that it was generic based on the genericness of "Idaho's high
desert" and "committee." We rejected their argument, stating that "[t]he district
court was clearly correct in evaluating the genericness of the name as a whole, rather
than looking to its constituent parts individually. .... The relevant question therefore
is whether the entire name `Committee for Idaho's High Desert' is generic."

        As the foregoing discussion illustrates, several pre- and post-Surgicenters cases
have announced what could be described as an "anti-dissection rule" for evaluating
the trademark validity of composite terms. Official Airline Guides, Inc., 6 F.3d at 1392
(noting that under this rule, "the validity and distinctiveness of a composite
trademark is determined by viewing the trademark as a whole, as it appears in the
marketplace"). When Surgicenters is examined in light of these later cases, it becomes
clear that Surgicenters should not be read overbroadly to stand for the simple
proposition that "generic plus generic equals generic." Rather, Surgicenters must be
read in its proper context. First, it must be noted that Surgicenters explicitly
recognizes that generic individual terms can be combined to form valid composite
marks. Second, it must be recalled that we found the term "surgicenter" generic
based in large part on a well-developed record of 45 exhibits showing that the term
"surgicenter," considered as a whole, was generic (i.e., understood by the consuming
public as referring simply to a center at which surgery was performed).

        In light of the foregoing discussion, the district court here may have
oversimplified matters somewhat when it stated that "[t]he Ninth Circuit has held
that a combination of two generic words is also generic, unless the combination is a
`deviation from natural usage' or an `unusual unitary combination.' " Any arguable
imprecision in the district court's application of Surgicenters was harmless, however,
because the term "Filipino Yellow Pages" would be unprotectible in any event.

        In finding "Filipino Yellow Pages" generic, the district court did not rely
solely upon the generic nature and presence in the dictionary of "Filipino" and
"yellow pages." The district court also considered other evidence tending to suggest
that "Filipino Yellow Pages," even when considered as an entire mark, is generic

                                                     42
with respect to telephone directories. The district court took note of the following
facts: (1) [FYP's owner] himself appeared to use the term "Filipino Yellow Pages" in
a generic sense in the Shareholders' Buy Out Agreement with [Defendant's owner],
when he "agree[d] not to compete in the Filipino Directory (Filipino Yellow Pages)
in California"; (2) FYP did not bring suit to challenge the marketing of a second
Filipino Yellow Pages to the Filipino-American community on the East Coast; and (3)
a Los Angeles Times article, in discussing a trend toward specialized yellow pages,
appeared to use the term in a generic sense; the article referred to a directory
published by one Virgil Junio as "his Filipino yellow pages" instead of using the
actual title of Junio's publication.

        These three pieces of evidence are not as weighty as the 45 exhibits presented
in Surgicenters, in which the record established generic use of the term "surgicenter"
by Newsweek magazine, six medical publications, and the Department of Health,
Education and Welfare. An important difference between Surgicenters and the
instant case should be noted, however. The mark at issue in Surgicenters was a
federally-registered mark, and thus the burden of proving genericness rested upon
the party challenging the mark's validity. The mark at issue in this case, in contrast,
is not registered; thus FYP, as trademark plaintiff, must prove that "Filipino Yellow
Pages" is not generic. It does not appear that FYP has offered evidence of
nongenericness sufficient to rebut even the fairly modest evidence of genericness
offered by AJP. In light of the evidence presented by AJP, it would seem that under
the "who-are-you/what-are-you" test, the term "Filipino Yellow Pages" is generic. If
faced with the question "What are you?", FYP's Filipino Yellow Pages, AJP's Filipino
Consumer Directory, and the Filipino Directory of the U.S.A. and Canada could all
respond in the same way: "A Filipino yellow pages." Giving FYP exclusive rights to
the term "Filipino Yellow Pages" might be inappropriate because it would effectively
"grant [FYP as] owner of the mark a monopoly, since a competitor could not
describe his goods as what they are." Surgicenters, 601 F.2d at 1017 (internal
quotation marks omitted).

        Even assuming that AJP's other evidence of genericness would be insufficient
to sustain a genericness finding by itself, it certainly suggests that "Filipino Yellow
Pages," if descriptive, would be the feeblest of descriptive marks--in the words of
one court, "perilously close to the `generic' line." Such a weak descriptive mark
could be a valid trademark only with a strong showing of strong secondary meaning.
To this component of the trademark analysis we now turn.5

          5 We have noted in the past that "the lines of demarcation [between the four categories of marks]

are not always clear" and that "courts often have difficulty in distinguishing between generic and descriptive

terms." Surgicenters, 601 F.2d at 1014, 1015. The difference between a generic mark and the weakest of

descriptive marks may be almost imperceptible. In this case, we do not need to determine whether "Filipino

                                                     43
        [The court ruled that "[t]he district court did not err in concluding that FYP
had failed to establish secondary meaning for `Filipino Yellow Pages,'" and
affirmed.]

                                              Notes

        Primary significance is the key. A mark is generic if the primary significance of
the term is as a product category rather than a mark. The Trademark Office asks not
whether the public uses the term as a category identifier, but rather if the public
would understand the term as such. Trademark Manual of Examining Procedures
("TMEP") § 1209.01(c)(i) ("It is not necessary to show that the relevant public uses
the term to refer to the genus. The correct inquiry is whether the relevant public
would understand the term to be generic." (citing In re 1800Mattress.com IP LLC,
586 F.3d 1359 (Fed. Cir. 2009)).

        One consequence of the primary significance test is that a mark may be
generic if a court determines that 60% of the relevant public views the mark as
generic even if a substantial minority views the term as a source-identifier. In such
cases, the interests of differing consumer classes may be at odds. While the term in
question may lower search costs for some consumers, others may need it as an
identifier of a product category. It may be that when push comes to shove the
interests of one consumer class outweighs the other's, but it is worth noting that
trademark law cannot avoid the choice. That said, sometimes courts will try to
mediate the conflict between the two consumer classes. See the note on "de facto
secondary meaning" below.

        Non-word marks. What about non-word marks? How should a court treat a
picture of a product that is claimed as a trademark? According to the McCarthy
treatise (§ 7:37), most courts would treat such a picture as descriptive, but,
depending on the circumstances, generic treatment is also possible. Think about
wine. If you browse a liquor store, you'll notice certain recurring themes on wine
bottles (e.g., references to ridges, hills, moons, and valleys). The Ninth Circuit has
held that the use of leaf imagery in vineyard logos is so commonplace as to be a
generic practice. Kendall-Jackson Winery, Ltd. v. E. & J. Gallo Winery, 150 F.3d
1042, 1048 (9th Cir. 1998) ("Grape-leaf designs have become generic emblems for
wine. Thus, they are not protectable as trademarks.").

Yellow Pages" is a generic or very weak descriptive term. For the reasons discussed infra, FYP's failure to show
secondary meaning renders the term unprotectible in either case.

                                                     44
        What about product color? The question may be premature as we have not
yet addressed the question of whether color can be trademarked (spoiler alert, yes).
Color may also be generic, see, e.g., In re: PT Medisafe Techs., 134 F.4th 1368 (Fed.
Cir. 2025) (affirming TTAB determination that proposed color mark was generic),
but note the potential interplay with functionality considerations--which we will
discuss in greater detail in chapters to come.

        For now, think about whether treating color trademarks as generic may lower
consumer search costs. Consider packets for sugar substitutes. You may find that
those using the chemical equivalent of sucralose are yellow even if they are not
SPLENDA, the brand name of the product that first used sucralose. Does use of
yellow packaging in this way benefit consumers who prefer sucralose to, say,
saccharine for their artificial sweetening? Or is this an impermissible free ride on the
efforts of the maker and popularizer of SPLENDA? For litigation raising, but not
resolving, this point, see, e.g., McNeil Nutritionals, LLC v. Heartland Sweeteners,
LLC, 511 F.3d 350 (3d Cir. 2007). Similarly, a popular maker of fiberglass
insulation uses the color pink for its fiberglass. What if the pink is so popular that
consumers have come to associate the pink color with fiberglass insulation generally.
Can you think of ways in which this association might mean that granting a
trademark in the pink color could harm consumers?

        Anti-dissection again. Note the reappearance of the anti-dissection principle. Is
it any clearer in the generic context than in the descriptive? The Trademark Office
understands its marching orders as follows (from TMEP § 1209.01(c)(i) (Oct. 2018)
(some citations omitted)):

        When a term is a compound word, the examining attorney may establish
        that a term is generic by producing evidence that each of the constituent
        words is generic, and that the separate words retain their generic significance
        when joined to form a compound that has "a meaning identical to the
        meaning common usage would ascribe to those words as a compound." In re
        Gould Paper Corp., 834 F.2d 1017, 1018, 5 USPQ2d 1110, 1111-1112 (Fed.
        Cir. 1987) (SCREENWIPE held generic as applied to premoistened
        antistatic cloths for cleaning computer and television screens).

        However, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has expressly limited
        the holding in Gould to "compound terms formed by the union of words"
        where the public understands the individual terms to be generic for a genus
        of goods or services, and the joining of the individual terms into one
        compound word lends "no additional meaning to the term." In re Dial-A-
        Mattress Operating Corp., 240 F.3d 1341, 57 USPQ2d 1807, 1810 (Fed. Cir.

                                                     45
        2001) (citing In re Am. Fertility Soc'y, 188 F.3d 1341, 51 USPQ2d 1832, 1837
        (Fed. Cir. 1999)). Where the mark is a phrase, the examining attorney
        cannot simply cite definitions and generic uses of the individual components
        of the mark, but must provide evidence of the meaning of the composite
        mark as a whole. In Coleman, however, the Board stated that Am. Fertility
        Soc'y cannot be read to suggest that an applicant can create a trademark by
        adding a clearly generic term to a non-source-identifying word, even in the
        absence of proof that others have used the composite. 93 USPQ2d 2019 at
        2025.

        In Am. Fertility Soc'y, the court held that evidence that the components
        "Society" and "Reproductive Medicine" were generic was not enough to
        establish that the composite phrase SOCIETY FOR REPRODUCTIVE
        MEDICINE was generic for association services in the field of reproductive
        medicine. The court held that the examining attorney must show: (1) the
        genus of services that the applicant provides; and (2) that the relevant public
        understands the proposed composite mark to primarily refer to that genus of
        services. 51 USPQ2d at 1836-37.

        The Supreme Court took up a dissection issue in the domain name context
in 2020.

          United States Patent and Trademark Office v. Booking.com B.V.
                                      591 U.S. 549 (2020)

Justice GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.
        This case concerns eligibility for federal trademark registration. Respondent

Booking.com, an enterprise that maintains a travel-reservation website by the same
name, sought to register the mark "Booking.com." Concluding that "Booking.com"
is a generic name for online hotel-reservation services, the U. S. Patent and
Trademark Office (PTO) refused registration.

        A generic name--the name of a class of products or services--is ineligible for
federal trademark registration. The word "booking," the parties do not dispute, is
generic for hotel-reservation services. "Booking.com" must also be generic, the PTO
maintains, under an encompassing rule the PTO currently urges us to adopt: The
combination of a generic word and ".com" is generic.

        In accord with the first- and second-instance judgments in this case, we reject
the PTO's sweeping rule. A term styled "generic.com" is a generic name for a class
of goods or services only if the term has that meaning to consumers. Consumers,
according to lower court determinations uncontested here by the PTO, do not
perceive the term "Booking.com" to signify online hotel-reservation services as a

                                                     46
class. In circumstances like those this case presents, a "generic.com" term is not
generic and can be eligible for federal trademark registration. . . .

        Booking.com is a digital travel company that provides hotel reservations and
other services under the brand "Booking.com," which is also the domain name of
its website. Booking.com filed applications to register four marks in connection
with travel-related services, each with different visual features but all containing the
term "Booking.com."

         Both a PTO examining attorney and the PTO's Trademark Trial and Appeal
Board concluded that the term "Booking.com" is generic for the services at issue
and is therefore unregistrable. "Booking," the Board observed, means making travel
reservations, and ".com" signifies a commercial website. The Board then ruled that
"customers would understand the term BOOKING.COM primarily to refer to an
online reservation service for travel, tours, and lodgings." Alternatively, the Board
held that even if "Booking.com" is descriptive, not generic, it is unregistrable
because it lacks secondary meaning.

        Booking.com sought review in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern
District of Virginia, invoking a mode of review that allows Booking.com to
introduce evidence not presented to the agency. See § 1071(b). Relying in
significant part on Booking.com's new evidence of consumer perception, the
District Court concluded that "Booking.com"--unlike "booking"--is not generic.
The "consuming public," the court found, "primarily understands that
BOOKING.COM does not refer to a genus, rather it is descriptive of services
involving `booking' available at that domain name." Having determined that
"Booking.com" is descriptive, the District Court additionally found that the term
has acquired secondary meaning as to hotel-reservation services. For those services,
the District Court therefore concluded, Booking.com's marks meet the
distinctiveness requirement for registration. [The Fourth Circuit affirmed.]

        Although the parties here disagree about the circumstances in which terms
like "Booking.com" rank as generic, several guiding principles are common ground.
First, a "generic" term names a "class" of goods or services, rather than any
particular feature or exemplification of the class. Second, for a compound term, the
distinctiveness inquiry trains on the term's meaning as a whole, not its parts in
isolation. Third, the relevant meaning of a term is its meaning to consumers.
Eligibility for registration, all agree, turns on the mark's capacity to "distinguis[h]"
goods "in commerce." § 1052. Evidencing the Lanham Act's focus on consumer
perception, the section governing cancellation of registration provides that "[t]he
primary significance of the registered mark to the relevant public ... shall be the test
for determining whether the registered mark has become the generic name of goods
or services." § 1064(3).

                                                     47
        Under these principles, whether "Booking.com" is generic turns on whether
that term, taken as a whole, signifies to consumers the class of online hotel-
reservation services. Thus, if "Booking.com" were generic, we might expect
consumers to understand Travelocity--another such service--to be a "Booking.com."
We might similarly expect that a consumer, searching for a trusted source of online
hotel-reservation services, could ask a frequent traveler to name her favorite
"Booking.com" provider.

        Consumers do not in fact perceive the term "Booking.com" that way, the
courts below determined. The PTO no longer disputes that determination. See Pet.
for Cert. I; Brief for Petitioners 17-18 (contending only that a consumer-perception
inquiry was unnecessary, not that the lower courts' consumer-perception
determination was wrong). That should resolve this case: Because "Booking.com" is
not a generic name to consumers, it is not generic.

        Opposing that conclusion, the PTO urges a nearly per se rule that would
render "Booking.com" ineligible for registration regardless of specific evidence of
consumer perception. In the PTO's view, which the dissent embraces, when a
generic term is combined with a generic top-level domain like ".com," the resulting
combination is generic. In other words, every "generic.com" term is generic
according to the PTO, absent exceptional circumstances.

        The PTO's own past practice appears to reflect no such comprehensive
rule. . . . We decline to adopt a rule essentially excluding registration of
"generic.com" marks. . . .

        The PTO urges that the exclusionary rule it advocates follows from a
common-law principle, applied in Goodyear's India Rubber Glove Mfg. Co. v. Goodyear
Rubber Co., 128 U.S. 598 (1888), that a generic corporate designation added to a
generic term does not confer trademark eligibility. In Goodyear, a decision predating
the Lanham Act, this Court held that "Goodyear Rubber Company" was not
"capable of exclusive appropriation." Standing alone, the term "Goodyear Rubber"
could not serve as a trademark because it referred, in those days, to "well-known
classes of goods produced by the process known as Goodyear's invention."
"[A]ddition of the word `Company' " supplied no protectable meaning, the Court
concluded, because adding "Company" "only indicates that parties have formed an
association or partnership to deal in such goods." Permitting exclusive rights in
"Goodyear Rubber Company" (or "Wine Company, Cotton Company, or Grain
Company"), the Court explained, would tread on the right of all persons "to deal in
such articles, and to publish the fact to the world."

        "Generic.com," the PTO maintains, is like "Generic Company" and is
therefore ineligible for trademark protection, let alone federal registration.
According to the PTO, adding ".com" to a generic term--like adding "Company"--
"conveys no additional meaning that would distinguish [one provider's] services

                                                     48
from those of other providers." The dissent endorses that proposition:
"Generic.com" conveys that the generic good or service is offered online "and
nothing more."

        That premise is faulty. A "generic.com" term might also convey to consumers
a source-identifying characteristic: an association with a particular website. As the
PTO and the dissent elsewhere acknowledge, only one entity can occupy a particular
Internet domain name at a time, so "[a] consumer who is familiar with that aspect
of the domain-name system can infer that BOOKING.COM refers to some specific
entity." Thus, consumers could understand a given "generic.com" term to describe
the corresponding website or to identify the website's proprietor. We therefore
resist the PTO's position that "generic.com" terms are capable of signifying only an
entire class of online goods or services and, hence, are categorically incapable of
identifying a source.

        The PTO's reliance on Goodyear is flawed in another respect. The PTO
understands Goodyear to hold that "Generic Company" terms "are ineligible for
trademark protection as a matter of law"--regardless of how "consumers would
understand" the term. But, as noted, whether a term is generic depends on its
meaning to consumers. That bedrock principle of the Lanham Act is incompatible
with an unyielding legal rule that entirely disregards consumer perception. Instead,
Goodyear reflects a more modest principle harmonious with Congress' subsequent
enactment: A compound of generic elements is generic if the combination yields no
additional meaning to consumers capable of distinguishing the goods or services. . . .

        While we reject the rule proffered by the PTO that "generic.com" terms are
generic names, we do not embrace a rule automatically classifying such terms as
nongeneric. Whether any given "generic.com" term is generic, we hold, depends on
whether consumers in fact perceive that term as the name of a class or, instead, as a
term capable of distinguishing among members of the class. . . .

        The PTO, echoed by the dissent objects that protecting "generic.com" terms
as trademarks would disserve trademark law's animating policies. We disagree.

         The PTO's principal concern is that trademark protection for a term like
"Booking.com" would hinder competitors. But the PTO does not assert that others
seeking to offer online hotel-reservation services need to call their services
"Booking.com." Rather, the PTO fears that trademark protection for
"Booking.com" could exclude or inhibit competitors from using the term "booking"
or adopting domain names like "ebooking.com" or "hotel-booking.com." The
PTO's objection, therefore, is not to exclusive use of "Booking.com" as a mark, but
to undue control over similar language, i.e., "booking," that others should remain
free to use.

        That concern attends any descriptive mark. Responsive to it, trademark law
hems in the scope of such marks short of denying trademark protection altogether.

                                                     49
Notably, a competitor's use does not infringe a mark unless it is likely to confuse
consumers. In assessing the likelihood of confusion, courts consider the mark's
distinctiveness: "The weaker a mark, the fewer are the junior uses that will trigger a
likelihood of consumer confusion." 2 [MCCARTHY], § 11:76. When a mark
incorporates generic or highly descriptive components, consumers are less likely to
think that other uses of the common element emanate from the mark's owner.
Similarly, "[i]n a `crowded' field of look-alike marks" (e.g., hotel names including the
word "grand"), consumers "may have learned to carefully pick out" one mark from
another. Id., § 11:85. And even where some consumer confusion exists, the doctrine
known as classic fair use, protects from liability anyone who uses a descriptive term,
"fairly and in good faith" and "otherwise than as a mark," merely to describe her
own goods. 15 U.S.C. § 1115(b)(4).

        These doctrines guard against the anticompetitive effects the PTO identifies,
ensuring that registration of "Booking.com" would not yield its holder a monopoly
on the term "booking." Booking.com concedes that "Booking.com" would be a
"weak" mark. The mark is descriptive, Booking.com recognizes, making it "harder ...
to show a likelihood of confusion." Furthermore, because its mark is one of many
"similarly worded marks," Booking.com accepts that close variations are unlikely to
infringe. And Booking.com acknowledges that federal registration of
"Booking.com" would not prevent competitors from using the word "booking" to
describe their own services.

        The PTO also doubts that owners of "generic.com" brands need trademark
protection in addition to existing competitive advantages. Booking.com, the PTO
argues, has already seized a domain name that no other website can use and is easy
for consumers to find. Consumers might enter "the word `booking' in a search
engine," the PTO observes, or "proceed directly to `booking.com' in the expectation
that [online hotel-booking] services will be offered at that address." Those
competitive advantages, however, do not inevitably disqualify a mark from federal
registration. All descriptive marks are intuitively linked to the product or service
and thus might be easy for consumers to find using a search engine or telephone
directory. The Lanham Act permits registration nonetheless. And the PTO fails to
explain how the exclusive connection between a domain name and its owner makes
the domain name a generic term all should be free to use. That connection makes
trademark protection more appropriate, not less.

        Finally, even if "Booking.com" is generic, the PTO urges, unfair-competition
law could prevent others from passing off their services as Booking.com's. But
federal trademark registration would offer Booking.com greater protection. . . .

Justice SOTOMAYOR, concurring.
        The question before the Court here is simple: whether there is a nearly per se

rule against trademark protection for a "generic.com" term. I agree with the Court
that there is no such rule . . . . I add two observations.

        First, the dissent wisely observes that consumer-survey evidence "may be an
unreliable indicator of genericness." Flaws in a specific survey design, or weaknesses
inherent in consumer surveys generally, may limit the probative value of surveys in
determining whether a particular mark is descriptive or generic in this context. But I
do not read the Court's opinion to suggest that surveys are the be-all and end-all. . . .

        Second, the PTO may well have properly concluded, based on such
dictionary and usage evidence, that Booking.com is in fact generic for the class of
services at issue here, and the District Court may have erred in concluding to the
contrary. But that question is not before the Court. With these understandings, I
concur in the Court's opinion.

Justice BREYER, dissenting.
        What is Booking.com? To answer this question, one need only consult the

term itself. Respondent provides an online booking service. The company's name
informs the consumer of the basic nature of its business and nothing more. Therein
lies the root of my disagreement with the majority.

        Trademark law does not protect generic terms, meaning terms that do no
more than name the product or service itself. This principle preserves the linguistic
commons by preventing one producer from appropriating to its own exclusive use a
term needed by others to describe their goods or services. Today, the Court holds
that the addition of ".com" to an otherwise generic term, such as "booking," can
yield a protectable trademark. Because I believe this result is inconsistent with
trademark principles and sound trademark policy, I respectfully dissent. . . .

        Courts have recognized that it is not always easy to distinguish generic from
descriptive terms. It is particularly difficult to do so when a firm wishes to string
together two or more generic terms to create a compound term. Despite the generic
nature of its component parts, the term as a whole is not necessarily generic. In such
cases, courts must determine whether the combination of generic terms conveys
some distinctive, source-identifying meaning that each term, individually, lacks. . . .

        In Goodyear, we held that appending the word " `Company' " to the generic
name for a class of goods does not yield a protectable compound term. . . .

        . . . . It is true that the Lanham Act altered the common law in certain
important respects. Most significantly, it extended trademark protection to
descriptive marks that have acquired secondary meaning. But it did not disturb the
basic principle that generic terms are ineligible for trademark protection, and
nothing in the Act suggests that Congress intended to overturn Goodyear. We

                                                     51
normally assume that Congress did not overturn a common-law principle absent
some indication to the contrary. I can find no such indication here. . . .

        More fundamentally, the Goodyear principle is sound as a matter of law and
logic. . . . [W]here a compound term consists simply of a generic term plus a
corporate designation, the whole is necessarily no greater than the sum of its
parts. . . .

        Like the corporate designations at issue in Goodyear, a top-level domain such
as ".com" has no capacity to identify and distinguish the source of goods or services.
It is merely a necessary component of any web address. When combined with the
generic name of a class of goods or services, ".com" conveys only that the owner
operates a website related to such items. Just as "Wine Company" expresses the
generic concept of a company that deals in wine, "wine.com" connotes only a
website that does the same. The same is true of "Booking.com.". . .

        When a website uses an inherently distinctive second-level domain, it is
obvious that adding ".com" merely denotes a website associated with that term. Any
reasonably well-informed consumer would understand that "post-it.com" is the
website associated with Post-its. Recognizing this feature of domain names, courts
generally ignore the top-level domain when analyzing likelihood of confusion.

        Generic second-level domains are no different. The meaning conveyed by
"Booking.com" is no more and no less than a website associated with its generic
second-level domain, "booking." This will ordinarily be true of any generic term
plus ".com" combination. The term as a whole is just as generic as its constituent
parts. . . .

        The majority believes that Goodyear is inapposite because of the nature of the
domain name system. Because only one entity can hold the contractual rights to a
particular domain name at a time, it contends, consumers may infer that a
"generic.com" domain name refers to some specific entity.

        That fact does not distinguish Goodyear. A generic term may suggest that it is
associated with a specific entity. That does not render it nongeneric. For example,
"Wine, Inc." implies the existence of a specific legal entity incorporated under the
laws of some State. Likewise, consumers may perceive "The Wine Company" to
refer to some specific company rather than a genus of companies. But the addition
of the definite article "the" obviously does not transform the generic nature of that
term. True, these terms do not carry the exclusivity of a domain name. But that
functional exclusivity does not negate the principle animating Goodyear: Terms that
merely convey the nature of the producer's business should remain free for all to
use.

        This case illustrates the difficulties inherent in the majority's fact-specific
approach. The lower courts determined (as the majority highlights), that consumers
do not use the term "Booking.com" to refer to the class of hotel reservation websites
in ordinary speech. True, few would call Travelocity a "Booking.com." But literal

                                                     52
use is not dispositive. Consumers do not use the term "Wine, Incs." to refer to
purveyors of wine. Still, the term "Wine, Inc." is generic because it signifies only a
company incorporated for that purpose. Similarly, "Booking, Inc." may not be
trademarked because it signifies only a booking company. The result should be no
different for "Booking.com," which signifies only a booking website.

        More than that, many of the facts that the Court supposes may distinguish
some "generic.com" marks as descriptive and some as generic are unlikely to vary
from case to case. There will never be evidence that consumers literally refer to the
relevant class of online merchants as "generic.coms." Nor are "generic.com" terms
likely to appear in dictionaries. And the key fact that, in the majority's view,
distinguishes this case from Goodyear--that only one entity can own the rights to a
particular domain name at a time--is present in every "generic.com" case.

        What, then, stands in the way of automatic trademark eligibility for every
"generic.com" domain? Much of the time, that determination will turn primarily on
survey evidence, just as it did in this case.

        However, survey evidence has limited probative value in this context.
Consumer surveys often test whether consumers associate a term with a single
source. But it is possible for a generic term to achieve such an association--either
because that producer has enjoyed a period of exclusivity in the marketplace, or
because it has invested money and effort in securing the public's identification.
Evidence of such an association, no matter how strong, does not negate the generic
nature of the term. For that reason, some courts and the TTAB have concluded that
survey evidence is generally of little value in separating generic from descriptive
terms. Although this is the minority viewpoint, I nonetheless find it to be the more
persuasive one.

        Consider the survey evidence that respondent introduced below.
Respondent's survey showed that 74.8% of participants thought that
"Booking.com" is a brand name, whereas 23.8% believed it was a generic name. At
the same time, 33% believed that "Washingmachine.com"--which does not
correspond to any company--is a brand, and thought it was generic.

        What could possibly account for that difference? "Booking.com" is not
inherently more descriptive than "Washingmachine.com" or any other
"generic.com." The survey participants who identified "Booking.com" as a brand
likely did so because they had heard of it, through advertising or otherwise. If
someone were to start a company called "Washingmachine.com," it could likely
secure a similar level of consumer identification by investing heavily in advertising.
Would that somehow transform the nature of the term itself? Surely not. This
hypothetical shows that respondent's survey tested consumers' association of
"Booking.com" with a particular company, not anything about the term itself. But
such association does not establish that a term is nongeneric.

        Under the majority's approach, a "generic.com" mark's eligibility for

                                                     53
trademark protection turns primarily on survey data, which, as I have explained,
may be an unreliable indicator of genericness. As the leading treatise writer in this
field has observed, this approach "[d]iscard[s] the predictable and clear line rule of
the [PTO] and the Federal Circuit" in favor of "a nebulous and unpredictable zone
of generic name and top level domain combinations that somehow become
protectable marks when accompanied by favorable survey results." 1 McCarthy §
7:17.50. I would heed this criticism. . . .

        In addition to the doctrinal concerns discussed above, granting trademark
protection to "generic.com" marks threatens serious anticompetitive consequences
in the online marketplace.

        The owners of short, generic domain names enjoy all the advantages of doing
business under a generic name. These advantages exist irrespective of the trademark
laws. Generic names are easy to remember. Because they immediately convey the
nature of the business, the owner needs to expend less effort and expense educating
consumers. And a generic business name may create the impression that it is the
most authoritative and trustworthy source of the particular good or service. These
advantages make it harder for distinctively named businesses to compete. . . .

        Generic domains are also easier for consumers to find. A consumer who
wants to buy wine online may perform a keyword search and be directed to
"wine.com." Or he may simply type "wine.com" into his browser's address bar,
expecting to find a website selling wine. The owner of a generic domain name
enjoys these benefits not because of the quality of her products or the goodwill of
her business, but because she was fortunate (or savvy) enough to be the first to
appropriate a particularly valuable piece of online real estate.

        Granting trademark protection to "generic.com" marks confers additional
competitive benefits on their owners by allowing them to exclude others from using
similar domain names. Federal registration would allow respondent to threaten
trademark lawsuits against competitors using domains such as "Bookings.com,"
"eBooking.com," "Booker.com," or "Bookit.com." Respondent says that it would
not do so. But other firms may prove less restrained.

        Indeed, why would a firm want to register its domain name as a trademark
unless it wished to extend its area of exclusivity beyond the domain name itself? The
domain name system, after all, already ensures that competitors cannot appropriate
a business's actual domain name . . . .

        Under the majority's reasoning, many businesses could obtain a trademark
by adding ".com" to the generic name of their product (e.g., pizza.com, flowers.com,
and so forth). As the internet grows larger, as more and more firms use it to sell
their products, the risk of anticompetitive consequences grows. Those consequences
can nudge the economy in an anticompetitive direction. At the extreme, that
direction points towards one firm per product, the opposite of the competitive
multifirm marketplace that our basic economic laws seek to achieve.

                                                     54
        Not to worry, the Court responds, infringement doctrines such as likelihood
of confusion and fair use will restrict the scope of protection afforded to
"generic.com" marks. This response will be cold comfort to competitors of
"generic.com" brands. Owners of such marks may seek to extend the boundaries of
their marks through litigation, and may, at times succeed. See, e.g., Advertise.com v.
AOL, LLC, 2010 WL 11507594 (CD Cal.) (owner of "Advertising.com" obtained
preliminary injunction against competitor's use of "Advertise.com"), vacated in part,
616 F.3d 974 (CA9 2010). Even if ultimately unsuccessful, the threat of costly
litigation will no doubt chill others from using variants on the registered mark and
privilege established firms over new entrants to the market. . . .

                                              Notes

        Administrative asymmetries. Note that registration creates a presumption that a
mark is not generic. But one may obtain that presumption without proving that the
mark is not generic. In the Booking.com litigation, the Fourth Circuit joined the
Federal Circuit in holding that PTO bears the burden of establishing that a mark is
generic if it wishes to refuse registration on those grounds (rather than requiring an
applicant to establish that the mark is not generic). Booking.com, 915 F.3d at 179-80.
Is that a sensible policy? What incentives does it create for would-be trademark
holders?

        Note further that the survey evidence supporting trademark protection for
Booking.com was submitted after the PTO proceedings. Absent an opposition,
would we ever expect a counter-survey to be available? Given the concentrated
benefits of a trademark registration and the diffuse costs, will this mean an
increased number of low-quality marks?

        Doctrinal pressure. In Booking.com the Court assumes--and Justice Breyer
contests--that other trademark doctrines will prevent the holder of a generic.com
mark from asserting it too broadly. But given the relative weakness of a mark like
Booking.com, is it worth the risk? Note also, as Justice Breyer does, that "the threat
of costly litigation will no doubt chill others from using variants on the registered
mark and privilege established firms over new entrants to the market." This is a
recurring issue in trademark law that we will see again.

        Purchaser motivation. 15 U.S.C. § 1127 explains that in determining whether
a mark has become abandoned as a result of becoming generic "purchaser
motivation" is not a factor. The qualification stems from Ninth Circuit precedent
that suggested that a mark could be generic if consumers did not care about the
source of the product. Anti-Monopoly, Inc. v. General Mills Fun Group, 611 F.2d

                                                     55
296, 305-06 (9th Cir. 1979). Traditional trademark doctrine only requires that a
mark identify a single source even if the precise identity of that source is unknown.
Congress added the purchaser motivation language to the statute to nullify the
Ninth Circuit's suggestion to the contrary.

        "De facto secondary meaning." If a mark is generic, it is generic, and
competitors are free to use the term in question even if consumers also see the mark
as designating product source. That said, courts sometimes issue orders to ensure
that competitors clearly label their products to avoid potential confusion with the
generic term's creator. For example, the Supreme Court held that the term
"shredded wheat" was generic, but declared that it was nonetheless necessary for
junior users to use their own distinctive mark on their shredded wheat products.
Kellogg Co. v. National Biscuit Co., 305 U.S. 111, 118-19 (1938) ("The showing
which [the plaintiff] has made does not entitle it to the exclusive use of the term
shredded wheat but merely entitles it to require that the defendant use reasonable
care to inform the public of the source of its product.").

        Similarly, Blinded Veterans Ass'n v. Blinded American Veterans Foundation, 872
F.2d 1035 (D.C. Cir. 1989), in an opinion by then-Judge (later Justice) Ginsburg,
concluded that the term "blinded veterans" was generic, but that a passing off
action remained possible:

        [T]he subsequent competitor cannot be prevented from using the generic
        term to denote itself or its product, but it may be enjoined from passing itself
        or its product off as the first organization or its product. Thus, a court may
        require the competitor to take whatever steps are necessary to distinguish
        itself or its product from the first organization or its product. In the
        paradigm case, Kellogg Co. v. National Biscuit Co., 305 U.S. 111 (1938), for
        example, the Supreme Court held that the term "shredded wheat" is generic;
        the National Biscuit Company therefore was not entitled to exclusive use of
        the term. Because National Biscuit had been the only manufacturer of
        shredded wheat for many years, however, the public had come to associate
        the product and the term "shredded wheat" with that company. The Court
        therefore stated that the Kellogg Company, which also produced a shredded
        wheat cereal, could be required to "use reasonable care to inform the public
        of the source of its product." Id. at 119; see also, e.g., . . . Metric &
        Multistandard Components Corp. v. Metric's, Inc., 635 F.2d 710, 714 (8th
        Cir.1980) (finding "metric" generic designation of metric industrial supplies,
        but nevertheless concluding that section 43(a) of Lanham Act had been
        violated because mark had become so associated with plaintiff that
        defendant's use of it created likelihood of confusion); King-Seeley Thermos Co.

                                                     56
        v. Aladdin Indus., Inc., 321 F.2d 577, 581 (2d Cir.1963) (finding "thermos"
        generic denotation of vacuum-insulated container, but affirming requirement
        that defendant distinguish its product from plaintiff's by preceding
        "thermos" with "Aladdin's," by using only the lower case "t", and by never
        using the words "original" or "genuine" in describing its product); DuPont
        Cellophane Co. v. Waxed Prods. Co., 85 F.2d 75, 80, 82 (2d Cir.) (finding
        "cellophane" generic denotation of cellulose transparent wrappings, but
        requiring defendant to identify itself as source of product in certain instances
        to avoid confusion with plaintiff's product); G. & C. Merriam Co. v. Saalfield,
        198 F. 369, 373-76 (6th Cir.1912) (requiring defendant to accompany
        generic term "Webster's Dictionary" with sufficient explanation to avoid
        giving false impression that his book was plaintiff's) . . . .

        Under the approach set forth in these cases, a court will not act to remedy or
        prevent "confusion generated by a mere similarity of names." If a consumer
        confuses two manufacturers' shredded wheat cereal, for example, because
        both products share the same name and the consumer has a general appetite
        for crunchy, pillow-shaped wheat biscuits, there is no cause for judicial
        action. . . . If, however, the consumer associates "shredded wheat" with a
        particular manufacturer, perhaps because that manufacturer enjoyed a de
        facto (or de jure) monopoly for many years, there is a risk that the consumer
        may erroneously assume that any product entitled "shredded wheat" comes
        from that manufacturer. A second manufacturer may increase the risk of
        confusion by, for example, using a similar label, similar packaging,
        misleading advertisements, or simply by failing to state the product's source.
        Only when there is a likelihood that the newcomer might thus pass its
        product off as the original manufacturer's may a court require the newcomer
        to distinguish its product or to notify consumers explicitly that its product
        does not come from the original manufacturer.

        Which category? As you can tell from the cases, much depends on how the
product class is defined. The broader the category, the less likely the mark is to be
seen as generic. Consider COKE ZERO. Is ZERO generic for zero-calorie sodas? Or
is the product category soda in general? See, e.g., Royal Crown Company, Inc. v. The
Coca-Cola Company, 892 F.3d 1358, 1368 (Fed. Cir. 2018) ("[I]f the public
understands ZERO when used in combination with a designated beverage name to
refer to a sub-group or type of beverage that carries specific characteristics, that
would be enough to render the term generic.").

                                                     57
        When do we assess generic status? This question matters for surveys of consumer
perception. Candidate dates include, the entry of the term into the marketplace; the
entry of the defendant into the marketplace; and the current date. See, e.g., Classic
Foods Intern. Corp. v. Kettle Foods, Inc., 468 F. Supp. 2d 1181, 1188 n.10 (C.D.
Cal. 2007) ("The crucial date for the determination of genericness in this case is
1999, the date [the junior user] first entered the market with the disputed mark.").
A survey taken for litigation may be probative of the status of a mark at one of the
earlier dates.

        No adjective/noun shortcuts. Consider the following from a case considering
whether "WAREHOUSE SHOES" is generic:

        At first glance, it appears that "warehouse" is functioning as an adjective in
        Mil-Mar's "Warehouse Shoes," which makes it seem more descriptive. An
        easy "noun versus adjective" test to signify a mark as either generic or
        descriptive, respectively, does not, however, adequately characterize the law
        of this circuit, nor would such a simplistic approach adequately embody
        fundamental principles of trademark law. The fact that "light" and "lite"
        were being used as adjectives to describe beer did not defeat our conclusion
        that "light beer" and "lite beer" were generic terms that could not garner
        trademark protection. . . . "Warehouse Shoes" and "Shoe Warehouse" both
        signify a particular type, category, or genus of retail stores: large stores that
        sell shoes in high volume at discount prices.

Mil-Mar Shoe Co. v. Shonac Corp., 75 F.3d 1153, 1160 (7th Cir. 1996) (footnote
omitted). Mil-Mar also noted that secondary dictionary definitions may be evidence
of genericness. Id. at 1158-159 ("However, no principle of trademark law mandates
that only the primary definition of a word can qualify as generic. In fact, we have
previously found that "light" and its phonetic equivalent "lite" are generic when
used to describe a type of beer, even though the most common adjectival meaning
of "light" has to do with weight.") (citation omitted).

        Regional generic status and trademark registration. As we will discuss, one of the
benefits of registering a trademark is nationwide priority (for example, a registered
mark that at the time of registration is used only in the northeast United States will
have priority over later-adopter in the southwest even if the later-adopter is first to
use the term in the southwest region). Registration is impossible, however, if the
term in question is generic in one part of the country. If only "common law,"
regional rights are at issue, however, it is possible for a mark to be generic in one
part of the country and not another.

                                                     58
        Highly descriptive marks. The line between generic and descriptive marks is
often unclear, see, e.g., MCCARTHY § 12:20 (describing circuit splits as to whether
particular marks are generic or descriptive) and depends in part on contested
market definitions. Precedent from the Federal Circuit also indicates that some
marks, though not generic, may be so highly descriptive as to preclude trademark
status. In re Boston Beer Co. Ltd. Partnership, 198 F.3d 1370 (Fed. Cir. 1999)
(affirming rejected registration of "The Best Beer in America," noting that "a phrase
or slogan can be so highly laudatory and descriptive as to be incapable of acquiring
distinctiveness as a trademark"). There is precedent to the contrary, and Professor
McCarthy notes that it is more accurate to say that highly descriptive marks simply
require greater evidence of secondary meaning. MCCARTHY § 12:22 ("This means
that it is very difficult, but not totally impossible, for a highly descriptive designation
or self-laudatory slogan to acquire a secondary meaning. Only in a rare case could
such highly descriptive designations amass sufficient consumer identification with a
single source to achieve trademark status." (footnote omitted)).

        Geographical Indications. Geographical indications of origin (GIs) indicate that
a product has come from a particular area and (typically) has been made in a
particular way. They are somewhat controversial. Should an American producer of
sparkling wine be able to label it CHAMPAGNE? Or call a bottle of Pinot Noir a
BURGUNDY? Or produce PROSCIUTTO DI PARMA? To turn the question
around, should a European producer be permitted to sell NAPA VALLEY wine or
IDAHO potatoes? Because this sort of trademark issue implicates regional interests,
GIs are often the subject of international trademark negotiations.

        Should GIs receive special protection? On the one hand, regional producers
have an interest in developing, and then controlling, the reputation for products
from a given area. On the other hand, those names may become generic in the
minds of the consuming public, creating a potential barrier to entry for producers
outside the region in question. Suppose the term "parmesan cheese" were off limits
to domestic producers. Similarly, what better way to communicate that your wine is
made in the Champagne style than to call it Champagne, even if you are not located
in the Champagne region of France?

        The World Trade Organization Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of
Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs) contains several provisions on GIs. Article 22
requires signatories to provide means to prevent the false suggestions of geographic
origin, and Article 23 calls for similar protections for GIs concerning wines and
spirits to apply even when the public is not misled as to the beverage's true origin.
Article 24 cuts back on the breadth of Article 23 by allowing use of such terms in
those nations in which they have become generic.

                                                     59
        Some of the Lanham Act's accommodations to GIs include certification
marks and certain registration exclusions. But what do you make of the underlying
policy question? When push comes to shove, would you give the wine-makers of
Champagne exclusive rights to CHAMPAGNE? Why or why not? Would it change
your answer if--for reasons of soil and climate--sparkling wine from Champagne,
France tastes differently than sparkling wine made elsewhere? What if taste tests
reveal that consumers prefer the taste of "authentic" champagne? What if that
preference disappears if the taste tests are blind?

        Genericide. Some generic marks are not "born generic" but lose their source
identifying function over time. Examples include ASPIRIN and CELLOPHANE.
Are any current famous marks fated to lose protection?

                                     Elliott v. Google, Inc.
                                860 F.3d 1151 (9th Cir. 2017)

TALLMAN, Circuit Judge:
        [Elliott and another party attempted to acquire various domain names that

included the word "google." Google, Inc. objected based on its trademark rights in
the term. In response, Elliott filed an action petitioning for cancellation of the
GOOGLE trademark, arguing that the word "`google' is primarily understood as `a
generic term universally used to describe the act[ ] of internet searching.'" The
district court ruled in Google's favor.]

        . . . . Genericide occurs when the public appropriates a trademark and uses it
as a generic name for particular types of goods or services irrespective of its source.
For example, ASPIRIN, CELLOPHANE, and ESCALATOR were once protectable
as arbitrary or fanciful marks because they were primarily understood as identifying
the source of certain goods. But the public appropriated those marks and now
primarily understands aspirin, cellophane, and escalator as generic names for those
same goods. . . .

        . . . . The mere fact that the public sometimes uses a trademark as the name
for a unique product does not immediately render the mark generic. See 15 U.S.C.
§ 1064(3). Instead, a trademark only becomes generic when the "primary
significance of the registered mark to the relevant public" is as the name for a
particular type of good or service irrespective of its source. . . .

        On appeal, Elliott claims that he has presented sufficient evidence to create a
triable issue of fact as to whether the GOOGLE trademark is generic, and that the
district court erred when it granted summary judgment for Google. First, he argues
that the district court erred because it misapplied the primary significance test and
failed to recognize the importance of verb use. Specifically, he argues that the

                                                     60
district court erroneously framed the inquiry as whether the primary significance of
the word "google" to the relevant public is as a generic name for internet search
engines, or as a mark identifying the Google search engine in particular. Instead,
Elliott argues that the court should have framed the inquiry as whether the relevant
public primarily uses the word "google" as a verb.

        We conclude that Elliott's proposed inquiry is fundamentally flawed for two
reasons. First, Elliott fails to recognize that a claim of genericide must always relate
to a particular type of good or service. Second, he erroneously assumes that verb use
automatically constitutes generic use. For similar reasons, we conclude that the
district court did not err in its formulation of the relevant inquiry under the
primary significance test.

        First, we take this opportunity to clarify that a claim of genericide or
genericness must be made with regard to a particular type of good or service. . . .
Elliott claims that the word "google" has become a generic name for "the act" of
searching the internet, and argues that the district court erred when it focused on
internet search engines. We reject Elliott's criticism and conclude that the district
court properly recognized the necessary and inherent link between a claim of
genericide and a particular type of good or service.

        This requirement is clear from the text of the Lanham Act, which allows a
party to apply for cancellation of a trademark when it "becomes the generic name
for the goods or services ... for which it is registered." 15 U.S.C. § 1064(3) (emphasis
added). The Lanham Act further provides that "[i]f the registered mark becomes the
generic name for less than all of the goods or services for which it is registered, a
petition to cancel the registration for only those goods or services may be filed." Id.
(emphasis added). Finally, the Lanham Act specifies that the relevant question
under the primary significance test is "whether the registered mark has become the
generic name of [certain] goods or services." Id. (emphasis added). In this way, the
Lanham Act plainly requires that a claim of genericide relate to a particular type of
good or service.

        We also note that such a requirement is necessary to maintain the viability of
arbitrary marks as a protectable trademark category. By definition, an arbitrary mark
is an existing word that is used to identify the source of a good with which the word
otherwise has no logical connection. If there were no requirement that a claim of
genericide relate to a particular type of good, then a mark like IVORY, which is
"arbitrary as applied to soap," could be cancelled outright because it is "generic
when used to describe a product made from the tusks of elephants." Abercrombie &
Fitch Co. v. Hunting World, Inc., 537 F.2d 4, 9 n.6 (2d Cir. 1976). This is not how
trademark law operates: Trademark law recognizes that a term may be unprotectable
with regard to one type of good, and protectable with regard to another type of
good. In this way, the very existence of arbitrary marks as a valid trademark category

                                                     61
supports our conclusion that a claim of genericide must relate to a particular type of
good or service.

        Second, Elliott's alternative inquiry fails because verb use does not
automatically constitute generic use. Elliott claims that a word can only be used in a
trademark sense when it is used as an adjective. He supports this claim by
comparing the definitions of adjectives and trademarks, noting that both adjectives
and trademarks serve descriptive functions.

        Once again, Elliott's semantic argument contradicts fundamental principles
underlying the protectability of trademarks. When Congress amended the Lanham
Act to specify that the primary significance test applies to claims of genericide, it
specifically acknowledged that a speaker might use a trademark as the name for a
product, i.e., as a noun, and yet use the mark with a particular source in mind, i.e.,
as a trademark. It further explained that:

        A trademark can serve a dual function--that of [naming] a product while at
        the same time indicating its source. Admittedly, if a product is unique, it is
        more likely that the trademark adopted and used to identify that product will
        be used as if it were the identifying name of that product. But this is not
        conclusive of whether the mark is generic.

S. Rep. No. 98-627, at 5 (1984). In this way, Congress has instructed us that a
speaker might use a trademark as a noun and still use the term in a source-
identifying trademark sense.

        Moreover, we have already implicitly rejected Elliott's theory that only
adjective use constitutes trademark use. In Coca-Cola Co. v. Overland, Inc., 692 F.2d
1250 (9th Cir. 1982), the Coca-Cola Company sued a local restaurant for
trademark infringement because its servers regularly and surreptitiously replaced
customer orders for "a coke" with a non-Coca-Cola beverage. The restaurant
defended on the basis of genericide, arguing that the COKE trademark had become
a generic name for all cola beverages. To support its claim, the restaurant presented
employee affidavits stating that the employees believed that customers who ordered
"a coke" were using the term in a generic sense. We rejected these affidavits because
they were not based on personal knowledge. More significant to the issue at hand,
we also noted that the mere fact that customers ordered "a coke," i.e., used the
mark as a noun, failed to show "what ... customers [were] thinking," or whether they
had a particular source in mind.

        If Elliott were correct that a trademark can only perform its source-
identifying function when it is used as an adjective, then we would not have cited a
need for evidence regarding the customers' inner thought processes. Instead, the
fact that the customers used the trademark as a noun and asked for "a coke" would
prove that they had no particular source in mind. In this way, we have implicitly

                                                     62
rejected Elliott's theory that a trademark can only serve a source-identifying function
when it is used as an adjective.

        For these reasons, the district court correctly rejected Elliott's theory that
verb use automatically constitutes generic use.3 Moreover, the district court aptly
coined the terms "discriminate verb" and "indiscriminate verb" in order to evaluate
Elliott's proffered examples of verb use and determine whether they were also
examples of generic use. Although novel, these terms properly frame the relevant
inquiry as whether a speaker has a particular source in mind. We have already
acknowledged that a customer might use the noun "coke" in an indiscriminate
sense, with no particular cola beverage in mind; or in a discriminate sense, with a
Coca-Cola beverage in mind. In the same way, we now recognize that an internet
user might use the verb "google" in an indiscriminate sense, with no particular
search engine in mind; or in a discriminate sense, with the Google search engine in
mind.

        Because a claim of genericide must relate to a particular type of good or
service and because verb use does not necessarily constitute generic use, the district
court did not err when it refused to frame its inquiry as whether the relevant public
primarily uses the word "google" as a verb. Moreover, the district court correctly
framed its inquiry as whether the primary significance of the word "google" to the
relevant public is as a generic name for internet search engines or as a mark
identifying the Google search engine in particular. We therefore evaluate Elliott's
claim of genericide and the sufficiency of his proffered evidence under the proper
inquiry. . . .

        At summary judgment, the district court assumed that a majority of the
public uses the verb "google" to refer to the act of "searching on the internet
without regard to [the] search engine used." In other words, it assumed that a
majority of the public uses the verb "google" in a generic and indiscriminate sense.
The district court then concluded that this fact, on its own, cannot support a jury
finding of genericide under the primary significance test. We agree.

         [A] claim of genericide must relate to a particular type of good. Even if we
assume that the public uses the verb "google" in a generic and indiscriminate sense,

          3 We acknowledge that if a trademark is used as an adjective, it will typically be easier to prove that

the trademark is performing a source-identifying function. If a speaker asks for "a Kleenex tissue," it is quite

clear that the speaker has a particular brand in mind. But we will not assume that a speaker has no brand in

mind simply because he or she uses the trademark as a noun and asks for "a Kleenex." Instead, the party

bearing the burden of proof must offer evidence to support a finding of generic use. See McCarthy § 12:8

("The fact that buyers or users often call for or order a product by a [trademark] term does not necessarily

prove that that term is being used as a `generic name.' ").

                                                     63
this tells us nothing about how the public primarily understands the word itself,
irrespective of its grammatical function, with regard to internet search engines. [The
court concluded that Elliott's survey evidence "only supports the favorable but
insufficient inference already drawn by the district court--that a majority of the
public uses the verb "google" in a generic sense. Standing in isolation, this fact is
insufficient to support a jury finding of genericide." Although such use is not
irrelevant, "evidence that a mark is used in a generic sense in one particular setting
cannot support a finding of genericide when it is unaccompanied by evidence
regarding the primary significance of the mark as a whole."]

        We next consider Elliott's examples of alleged generic use by the media and
by consumers. Documented examples of generic use might support a claim of
genericide if they reveal a prevailing public consensus regarding the primary
significance of a registered trademark. However, if the parties offer competing
examples of both generic and trademark use, this source of evidence is typically
insufficient to prove genericide.

        Initially, we note that Elliott's admissible examples are only examples of verb
use. To repeat, verb use does not automatically constitute generic use. For instance,
Elliott purports to offer an example of generic use by T-Pain, a popular rap music
artist. But we will not assume that T-Pain is using the word "google" in a generic
sense simply because he tells listeners to "google [his] name." T-Pain, Bottlez, on
rEVOLVEr (RCA Records 2011). Without further evidence regarding T-Pain's
inner thought process, we cannot tell whether he is using "google" in a discriminate
or indiscriminate sense. In this way, many of Elliott's admissible examples do not
even support the favorable inference that a majority of the relevant public uses the
verb "google" in a generic sense. . . .

        We agree that Elliott has failed to present sufficient evidence to support a
jury finding that the relevant public primarily understands the word "google" as a
generic name for internet search engines and not as a mark identifying the Google
search engine in particular. We therefore affirm the district court's grant of
summary judgment.

Problems

        1. The whiskey producer Bison Outline wowed the spirits world by
introducing a bourbon blended with a proprietary chocolate flavoring, which it
markets as CHOCOLATE CAKE whiskey. Whiskey Journal & Spirit News gave it a
rave review, saying "it's like biting into the best chocolate cake you ever had."
Making the product even more appealing is the fact that the flavoring mimics the

                                                     64
taste of cake without the ingredients. The fact that Bison Copy's flavorings are non-
caloric is part of the product's appeal.

        Success breeds imitation, and before long Cardbeg distillers has entered the
market with its own cake-flavored offering, CARDBEG's CHOCOLATE CAKE.
Bison Outline wants to sue. What kind of mark does it have? You may assume that
consumer surveys would indicate that a plurality of respondents would see the term
CHOCOLATE CAKE on whiskey as referring to Bison Outline's product.

        2. Is there any advice you could have given to Bison Outline before it
entered the market that would increase the chance that its mark would be deemed
protectable?

        3. Consider PRETZEL CRISPS

        Generic?

                                                     65
4. Non-Word Marks, Colors, and Trade
Dress

        Our focus now turns to non-word marks. We will begin by considering logos
and colors before moving to a discussion of the problems presented by protection of
trade dress.

                           Lanham Act § 45 (15 U.S.C. § 1127)

        The term "trademark" includes any word, name, symbol, or device, or any
        combination thereof--

        (1)

        used by a person, or

        (2)

        which a person has a bona fide intention to use in commerce and applies to
        register on the principal register established by this Act, to identify and
        distinguish his or her goods, including a unique product, from those
        manufactured or sold by others and to indicate the source of the goods, even
        if that source is unknown.

Distinctive and non-distinctive non-word marks

        As you can tell from the statutory provision, the text of the Lanham Act is
open as to trademark subject matter, extending potential protection to any "symbol"
or "device". Trademarks must still be distinctive to secure protection. We previously
discussed trademark law's development of assumptions about the distinctiveness of
different kinds of word marks. Matters are more complicated when we ask whether
a non-word mark is inherently distinctive. Consider a circle. Is it inherently
distinctive for, say, a car? On the one hand, it is not in any sense descriptive of the
car, but may so common a shape be a trademark without secondary meaning?

        The Trademark Manual of Examining Procedure directs examiners to
address the issue as follows:

                            1202.03(a) Commercial Impression

        The examining attorney must determine whether the overall commercial
        impression of the proposed mark is that of a trademark. Matter that is purely

                                                     66
        ornamental or decorative does not function as a trademark and is
        unregistrable on either the Principal Register or the Supplemental Register.

        The significance of the proposed mark is a factor to consider when
        determining whether ornamental matter serves a trademark function.
        Common expressions and symbols (e.g., the peace symbol, "smiley face," or
        the phrase "Have a Nice Day") are normally not perceived as marks.

        The examining attorney must also consider the size, location, and dominance
        of the proposed mark, as applied to the goods, to determine whether
        ornamental matter serves a trademark function. In re Dimitri's Inc., 9
        USPQ2d 1666, 1667 (TTAB 1988); In re Astro-Gods Inc., 223 USPQ 621,
        623 (TTAB 1984). A small, neat, and discrete word or design feature (e.g.,
        small design of animal over pocket or breast portion of shirt) may be likely to
        create the commercial impression of a trademark, whereas a larger rendition
        of the same matter emblazoned across the front of a garment (or a tote bag,
        or the like) may be likely to be perceived merely as a decorative or
        ornamental feature of the goods. However, a small, neat, and discrete word
        or design feature will not necessarily be perceived as a mark in all cases.

        ***

        Can the law do any better than this subjective standard? Does it lead to
asking whether there is secondary meaning? Would that be a good thing? Consider
your intuitions on this point as you read how the Supreme Court resolved the
question whether color may be trademarked.

                       Qualitex Co. v. Jacobson Products Co., Inc.
                                      514 U.S. 159 (1995)

BREYER, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.
        The question in this case is whether the Trademark Act of 1946 (Lanham

Act), 15 U.S.C. §§ 1051-1127 (1988 ed. and Supp. V), permits the registration of a
trademark that consists, purely and simply, of a color. We conclude that,
sometimes, a color will meet ordinary legal trademark requirements. And, when it
does so, no special legal rule prevents color alone from serving as a trademark.

                                                  I
        The case before us grows out of petitioner Qualitex Company's use (since the
1950's) of a special shade of green-gold color on the pads that it makes and sells to
dry cleaning firms for use on dry cleaning presses. In 1989, respondent Jacobson
Products (a Qualitex rival) began to sell its own press pads to dry cleaning firms; and
it colored those pads a similar green gold. In 1991, Qualitex registered the special
green-gold color on press pads with the Patent and Trademark Office as a

                                                     67
trademark. Registration No. 1,633,711 (Feb. 5, 1991). Qualitex subsequently added
a trademark infringement count, 15 U.S.C. § 1114(1), to an unfair competition
claim, § 1125(a), in a lawsuit it had already filed challenging Jacobson's use of the
green-gold color.

        Qualitex won the lawsuit in the District Court. But, the Court of Appeals for
the Ninth Circuit set aside the judgment in Qualitex's favor on the trademark
infringement claim because, in that Circuit's view, the Lanham Act does not permit
Qualitex, or anyone else, to register "color alone" as a trademark.

        The Courts of Appeals have differed as to whether or not the law recognizes
the use of color alone as a trademark. . . . We now hold that there is no rule
absolutely barring the use of color alone, and we reverse the judgment of the Ninth
Circuit.

                                                 II
        The Lanham Act gives a seller or producer the exclusive right to "register" a
trademark, 15 U.S.C. § 1052 (1988 ed. and Supp. V), and to prevent his or her
competitors from using that trademark, § 1114(1). Both the language of the Act and
the basic underlying principles of trademark law would seem to include color within
the universe of things that can qualify as a trademark. The language of the Lanham
Act describes that universe in the broadest of terms. It says that trademarks
"includ[e] any word, name, symbol, or device, or any combination thereof." § 1127.
Since human beings might use as a "symbol" or "device" almost anything at all that
is capable of carrying meaning, this language, read literally, is not restrictive. The
courts and the Patent and Trademark Office have authorized for use as a mark a
particular shape (of a Coca-Cola bottle), a particular sound (of NBC's three chimes),
and even a particular scent (of plumeria blossoms on sewing thread). See, e.g.,
Registration No. 696,147 (Apr. 12, 1960); Registration Nos. 523,616 (Apr. 4, 1950)
and 916,522 (July 13, 1971); In re Clarke, 17 U.S.P.Q.2d 1238, 1240 (TTAB 1990).
If a shape, a sound, and a fragrance can act as symbols why, one might ask, can a
color not do the same?
        A color is also capable of satisfying the more important part of the statutory
definition of a trademark, which requires that a person "us[e]" or "inten[d] to use"
the mark
        "to identify and distinguish his or her goods, including a unique product,
        from those manufactured or sold by others and to indicate the source of the
        goods, even if that source is unknown." 15 U.S.C. § 1127.

        True, a product's color is unlike "fanciful," "arbitrary," or "suggestive" words
or designs, which almost automatically tell a customer that they refer to a brand. The
imaginary word "Suntost," or the words "Suntost Marmalade," on a jar of orange
jam immediately would signal a brand or a product "source"; the jam's orange color

                                                     68
does not do so. But, over time, customers may come to treat a particular color on a
product or its packaging (say, a color that in context seems unusual, such as pink on
a firm's insulating material or red on the head of a large industrial bolt) as signifying
a brand. And, if so, that color would have come to identify and distinguish the
goods-i.e., "to indicate" their "source"--much in the way that descriptive words on a
product (say, "Trim" on nail clippers or "Car-Freshner" on deodorizer) can come to
indicate a product's origin. In this circumstance, trademark law says that the word
(e.g., "Trim"), although not inherently distinctive, has developed "secondary
meaning." See Inwood Laboratories, Inc. v. Ives Laboratories, Inc., 456 U.S. 844, 851, n.
11 (1982) ("[S]econdary meaning" is acquired when "in the minds of the public, the
primary significance of a product feature ... is to identify the source of the product
rather than the product itself"). Again, one might ask, if trademark law permits a
descriptive word with secondary meaning to act as a mark, why would it not permit
a color, under similar circumstances, to do the same?

        We cannot find in the basic objectives of trademark law any obvious
theoretical objection to the use of color alone as a trademark, where that color has
attained "secondary meaning" and therefore identifies and distinguishes a particular
brand (and thus indicates its "source"). In principle, trademark law, by preventing
others from copying a source-identifying mark, "reduce[s] the customer's costs of
shopping and making purchasing decisions," 1 J. McCarthy, McCarthy on
Trademarks and Unfair Competition § 2.01[2], p. 2-3 (3d ed. 1994) (hereinafter
McCarthy), for it quickly and easily assures a potential customer that this item--the
item with this mark--is made by the same producer as other similarly marked items
that he or she liked (or disliked) in the past. At the same time, the law helps assure a
producer that it (and not an imitating competitor) will reap the financial,
reputation-related rewards associated with a desirable product. The law thereby
"encourage[s] the production of quality products," ibid., and simultaneously
discourages those who hope to sell inferior products by capitalizing on a consumer's
inability quickly to evaluate the quality of an item offered for sale. It is the source-
distinguishing ability of a mark--not its ontological status as color, shape, fragrance,
word, or sign--that permits it to serve these basic purposes. See Landes & Posner,
Trademark Law: An Economic Perspective, 30 J.Law & Econ. 265, 290 (1987).
And, for that reason, it is difficult to find, in basic trademark objectives, a reason to
disqualify absolutely the use of a color as a mark.

        Neither can we find a principled objection to the use of color as a mark in
the important "functionality" doctrine of trademark law. The functionality doctrine
prevents trademark law, which seeks to promote competition by protecting a firm's
reputation, from instead inhibiting legitimate competition by allowing a producer to
control a useful product feature. It is the province of patent law, not trademark law,
to encourage invention by granting inventors a monopoly over new product designs

                                                     69
or functions for a limited time, 35 U.S.C. §§ 154, 173, after which competitors are
free to use the innovation. If a product's functional features could be used as
trademarks, however, a monopoly over such features could be obtained without
regard to whether they qualify as patents and could be extended forever (because
trademarks may be renewed in perpetuity). Functionality doctrine therefore would
require, to take an imaginary example, that even if customers have come to identify
the special illumination-enhancing shape of a new patented light bulb with a
particular manufacturer, the manufacturer may not use that shape as a trademark,
for doing so, after the patent had expired, would impede competition--not by
protecting the reputation of the original bulb maker, but by frustrating competitors'
legitimate efforts to produce an equivalent illumination-enhancing bulb. See, e.g.,
(Kellogg Co., supra, 305 U.S., at 119-120, trademark law cannot be used to extend
monopoly over "pillow" shape of shredded wheat biscuit after the patent for that
shape had expired). This Court consequently has explained that, "[i]n general terms,
a product feature is functional," and cannot serve as a trademark, "if it is essential to
the use or purpose of the article or if it affects the cost or quality of the article," that
is, if exclusive use of the feature would put competitors at a significant non-
reputation-related disadvantage. Inwood Laboratories, Inc., supra, 456 U.S., at 850, n.
10. Although sometimes color plays an important role (unrelated to source
identification) in making a product more desirable, sometimes it does not. And, this
latter fact--the fact that sometimes color is not essential to a product's use or
purpose and does not affect cost or quality--indicates that the doctrine of
"functionality" does not create an absolute bar to the use of color alone as a mark.
See Owens-Corning, 774 F.2d, at 1123 (pink color of insulation in wall "performs no
nontrademark function").

        It would seem, then, that color alone, at least sometimes, can meet the basic
legal requirements for use as a trademark. It can act as a symbol that distinguishes a
firm's goods and identifies their source, without serving any other significant
function. See U.S. Dept. of Commerce, Patent and Trademark Office, Trademark
Manual of Examining Procedure § 1202.04(e), p. 1202-13 (2d ed. May, 1993)
(hereinafter PTO Manual) (approving trademark registration of color alone where it
"has become distinctive of the applicant's goods in commerce," provided that "there
is [no] competitive need for colors to remain available in the industry" and the color
is not "functional") . . . . Indeed, the District Court, in this case, entered findings
(accepted by the Ninth Circuit) that show Qualitex's green-gold press pad color has
met these requirements. The green-gold color acts as a symbol. Having developed
secondary meaning (for customers identified the green-gold color as Qualitex's), it
identifies the press pads' source. And, the green-gold color serves no other function.
(Although it is important to use some color on press pads to avoid noticeable stains,
the court found "no competitive need in the press pad industry for the green-gold

                                                     70
color, since other colors are equally usable." 21 U.S.P.Q.2d, at 1460, 1991 WL
318798.) Accordingly, unless there is some special reason that convincingly militates
against the use of color alone as a trademark, trademark law would protect
Qualitex's use of the green-gold color on its press pads.

                                                III
        Respondent Jacobson Products says that there are four special reasons why
the law should forbid the use of color alone as a trademark. We shall explain, in
turn, why we, ultimately, find them unpersuasive.
        First, Jacobson says that, if the law permits the use of color as a trademark, it
will produce uncertainty and unresolvable court disputes about what shades of a
color a competitor may lawfully use. Because lighting (morning sun, twilight mist)
will affect perceptions of protected color, competitors and courts will suffer from
"shade confusion" as they try to decide whether use of a similar color on a similar
product does, or does not, confuse customers and thereby infringe a trademark.
Jacobson adds that the "shade confusion" problem is "more difficult" and "far
different from" the "determination of the similarity of words or symbols."
        We do not believe, however, that color, in this respect, is special. Courts
traditionally decide quite difficult questions about whether two words or phrases or
symbols are sufficiently similar, in context, to confuse buyers. They have had to
compare, for example, such words as "Bonamine" and "Dramamine" (motion-
sickness remedies); "Huggies" and "Dougies" (diapers); "Cheracol" and "Syrocol"
(cough syrup); "Cyclone" and "Tornado" (wire fences); and "Mattres" and "1-800-
Mattres" (mattress franchisor telephone numbers). Legal standards exist to guide
courts in making such comparisons. See, e.g., 2 McCarthy § 15.08; 1 McCarthy §§
11.24-11.25 ("[S]trong" marks, with greater secondary meaning, receive broader
protection than "weak" marks). We do not see why courts could not apply those
standards to a color, replicating, if necessary, lighting conditions under which a
colored product is normally sold. Indeed, courts already have done so in cases where
a trademark consists of a color plus a design, i.e., a colored symbol such as a gold
stripe (around a sewer pipe), a yellow strand of wire rope, or a "brilliant yellow"
band (on ampules).
        Second, Jacobson argues, as have others, that colors are in limited supply.
Jacobson claims that, if one of many competitors can appropriate a particular color
for use as a trademark, and each competitor then tries to do the same, the supply of
colors will soon be depleted. Put in its strongest form, this argument would concede
that "[h]undreds of color pigments are manufactured and thousands of colors can
be obtained by mixing." L. Cheskin, Colors: What They Can Do For You 47
(1947). But, it would add that, in the context of a particular product, only some
colors are usable. By the time one discards colors that, say, for reasons of customer
appeal, are not usable, and adds the shades that competitors cannot use lest they

                                                     71
risk infringing a similar, registered shade, then one is left with only a handful of
possible colors. And, under these circumstances, to permit one, or a few, producers
to use colors as trademarks will "deplete" the supply of usable colors to the point
where a competitor's inability to find a suitable color will put that competitor at a
significant disadvantage.

        This argument is unpersuasive, however, largely because it relies on an
occasional problem to justify a blanket prohibition. When a color serves as a mark,
normally alternative colors will likely be available for similar use by others. See, e.g.,
Owens-Corning, 774 F.2d, at 1121 (pink insulation). Moreover, if that is not so--if a
"color depletion" or "color scarcity" problem does arise--the trademark doctrine of
"functionality" normally would seem available to prevent the anticompetitive
consequences that Jacobson's argument posits, thereby minimizing that argument's
practical force.

        The functionality doctrine, as we have said, forbids the use of a product's
feature as a trademark where doing so will put a competitor at a significant
disadvantage because the feature is "essential to the use or purpose of the article" or
"affects [its] cost or quality." Inwood Laboratories, Inc., 456 U.S., at 850, n. 10. The
functionality doctrine thus protects competitors against a disadvantage (unrelated to
recognition or reputation) that trademark protection might otherwise impose,
namely, their inability reasonably to replicate important non-reputation-related
product features. For example, this Court has written that competitors might be free
to copy the color of a medical pill where that color serves to identify the kind of
medication (e.g., a type of blood medicine) in addition to its source. See id., at 853,
858, n. 20 ("[S]ome patients commingle medications in a container and rely on
color to differentiate one from another"); see also J. Ginsburg, D. Goldberg, & A.
Greenbaum, Trademark and Unfair Competition Law 194-195 (1991) (noting that
drug color cases "have more to do with public health policy" regarding generic drug
substitution "than with trademark law"). And, the federal courts have demonstrated
that they can apply this doctrine in a careful and reasoned manner, with sensitivity
to the effect on competition. Although we need not comment on the merits of
specific cases, we note that lower courts have permitted competitors to copy the
green color of farm machinery (because customers wanted their farm equipment to
match) and have barred the use of black as a trademark on outboard boat motors
(because black has the special functional attributes of decreasing the apparent size of
the motor and ensuring compatibility with many different boat colors). See Deere &
Co. v. Farmhand, Inc., 560 F.Supp. 85, 98 (SD Iowa 1982), aff'd, 721 F.2d 253 (CA8
1983); Brunswick Corp. v. British Seagull Ltd., 35 F.3d 1527, 1532 (CA Fed.1994),

U.S.P.Q.2d 1316, 1320, 1987 WL 13742 (ED Pa.1987) (blue color of fertilizer held
functional because it indicated the presence of nitrogen). The Restatement (Third)

                                                     72
of Unfair Competition adds that, if a design's "aesthetic value" lies in its ability to
"confe[r] a significant benefit that cannot practically be duplicated by the use of
alternative designs," then the design is "functional." Restatement (Third) of Unfair
Competition § 17, Comment c, pp. 175-176 (1993). The "ultimate test of aesthetic
functionality," it explains, "is whether the recognition of trademark rights would
significantly hinder competition." Id., at 176.

        The upshot is that, where a color serves a significant nontrademark
function--whether to distinguish a heart pill from a digestive medicine or to satisfy
the "noble instinct for giving the right touch of beauty to common and necessary
things," G. Chesterton, Simplicity and Tolstoy 61 (1912)--courts will examine
whether its use as a mark would permit one competitor (or a group) to interfere
with legitimate (nontrademark-related) competition through actual or potential
exclusive use of an important product ingredient. That examination should not
discourage firms from creating esthetically pleasing mark designs, for it is open to
their competitors to do the same. But, ordinarily, it should prevent the
anticompetitive consequences of Jacobson's hypothetical "color depletion"
argument, when, and if, the circumstances of a particular case threaten "color
depletion."

        Third, Jacobson points to many older cases--including Supreme Court cases--
in support of its position. In 1878, this Court described the common-law definition
of trademark rather broadly to "consist of a name, symbol, figure, letter, form, or
device, if adopted and used by a manufacturer or merchant in order to designate the
goods he manufactures or sells to distinguish the same from those manufactured or
sold by another." McLean v. Fleming, 96 U.S. 245. Yet, in interpreting the
Trademark Acts of 1881 and 1905, which retained that common-law definition, the
Court questioned "[w]hether mere color can constitute a valid trade-mark," A.
Leschen & Sons Rope Co. v. Broderick & Bascom Rope Co., 201 U.S. 166, 171 (1906),
and suggested that the "product including the coloring matter is free to all who
make it," Coca-Cola Co. v. Koke Co. of America, 254 U.S. 143, 147 (1920). Even
though these statements amounted to dicta, lower courts interpreted them as
forbidding protection for color alone.

        These Supreme Court cases, however, interpreted trademark law as it existed
before 1946, when Congress enacted the Lanham Act. The Lanham Act significantly
changed and liberalized the common law to "dispense with mere technical
prohibitions," S.Rep. No. 1333, 79th Cong., 2d Sess., 3 (1946), most notably, by
permitting trademark registration of descriptive words (say, "U-Build-It" model
airplanes) where they had acquired "secondary meaning." See Abercrombie & Fitch
Co., 537 F.2d, at 9 (Friendly, J.). The Lanham Act extended protection to
descriptive marks by making clear that (with certain explicit exceptions not relevant
here)

                                                     73
        "nothing ... shall prevent the registration of a mark used by the applicant
        which has become distinctive of the applicant's goods in commerce." 15
        U.S.C. § 1052(f) (1988 ed., Supp. V).

        This language permits an ordinary word, normally used for a nontrademark
purpose (e.g., description), to act as a trademark where it has gained "secondary
meaning." Its logic would appear to apply to color as well. Indeed, in 1985, the
Federal Circuit considered the significance of the Lanham Act's changes as they
related to color and held that trademark protection for color was consistent with the

        "jurisprudence under the Lanham Act developed in accordance with the
        statutory principle that if a mark is capable of being or becoming distinctive
        of [the] applicant's goods in commerce, then it is capable of serving as a
        trademark." Owens-Corning, 774 F.2d, at 1120.

        In 1988, Congress amended the Lanham Act, revising portions of the
definitional language, but left unchanged the language here relevant. It enacted
these amendments against the following background: (1) the Federal Circuit had
decided Owens-Corning; (2) the Patent and Trademark Office had adopted a clear
policy (which it still maintains) permitting registration of color as a trademark; and
(3) the Trademark Commission had written a report, which recommended that "the
terms `symbol, or device' ... not be deleted or narrowed to preclude registration of
such things as a color, shape, smell, sound, or configuration which functions as a
mark," The United States Trademark Association Trademark Review Commission
Report and Recommendations to USTA President and Board of Directors, 77
T.M.Rep. 375, 421 (1987). This background strongly suggests that the language
"any word, name, symbol, or device," 15 U.S.C. § 1127, had come to include color.
And, when it amended the statute, Congress retained these terms. Indeed, the
Senate Report accompanying the Lanham Act revision explicitly referred to this
background understanding, in saying that the "revised definition intentionally
retains ... the words `symbol or device' so as not to preclude the registration of
colors, shapes, sounds or configurations where they function as trademarks." S.Rep.
No. 100-515, at 44. (In addition, the statute retained language providing that "[n]o
trademark by which the goods of the applicant may be distinguished from the goods
of others shall be refused registration ... on account of its nature" (except for certain
specified reasons not relevant here). 15 U.S.C. § 1052 (1988 ed., Supp. V).)

        This history undercuts the authority of the precedent on which Jacobson
relies. Much of the pre-1985 case law rested on statements in Supreme Court
opinions that interpreted pre-Lanham Act trademark law and were not directly
related to the holdings in those cases. Moreover, we believe the Federal Circuit was
right in 1985 when it found that the 1946 Lanham Act embodied crucial legal
changes that liberalized the law to permit the use of color alone as a trademark

                                                     74
(under appropriate circumstances). At a minimum, the Lanham Act's changes left
the courts free to reevaluate the preexisting legal precedent which had absolutely
forbidden the use of color alone as a trademark. Finally, when Congress reenacted
the terms "word, name, symbol, or device" in 1988, it did so against a legal
background in which those terms had come to include color, and its statutory
revision embraced that understanding.

        Fourth, Jacobson argues that there is no need to permit color alone to
function as a trademark because a firm already may use color as part of a trademark,
say, as a colored circle or colored letter or colored word, and may rely upon "trade
dress" protection, under § 43(a) of the Lanham Act, if a competitor copies its color
and thereby causes consumer confusion regarding the overall appearance of the
competing products or their packaging, see 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a) (1988 ed., Supp.
V). The first part of this argument begs the question. One can understand why a
firm might find it difficult to place a usable symbol or word on a product (say, a
large industrial bolt that customers normally see from a distance); and, in such
instances, a firm might want to use color, pure and simple, instead of color as part
of a design. Neither is the second portion of the argument convincing. Trademark
law helps the holder of a mark in many ways that "trade dress" protection does not.
See 15 U.S.C. § 1124 (ability to prevent importation of confusingly similar goods);
§ 1072 (constructive notice of ownership); § 1065 (incontestible status); § 1057(b)
(prima facie evidence of validity and ownership). Thus, one can easily find reasons
why the law might provide trademark protection in addition to trade dress
protection.

                                                IV
        Having determined that a color may sometimes meet the basic legal
requirements for use as a trademark and that respondent Jacobson's arguments do
not justify a special legal rule preventing color alone from serving as a trademark
(and, in light of the District Court's here undisputed findings that Qualitex's use of
the green-gold color on its press pads meets the basic trademark requirements), we
conclude that the Ninth Circuit erred in barring Qualitex's use of color as a
trademark....

        Secondary meaning. Did the Court hold that secondary meaning is required or
was that statement dicta? In a later case, the Court characterized its observations vis-
à-vis secondary meaning as a holding.

one might ask, can a color not do the same?" Might one ask instead whether shapes,
sounds, and fragrances should be trademarks?

Trade Dress

        Matters become more difficult still when we venture into questions of the
protection of trade dress. But first, what is "trade dress"? In a footnote (omitted in
your copy) to the Two Pesos opinion that you are about to read, the Supreme Court
noted:

        The District Court instructed the jury: " `[T]rade dress' is the total image of
        the business. Taco Cabana's trade dress may include the shape and general
        appearance of the exterior of the restaurant, the identifying sign, the interior
        kitchen floor plan, the decor, the menu, the equipment used to serve food,
        the servers' uniforms and other features reflecting on the total image of the
        restaurant." The Court of Appeals accepted this definition and quoted from
        Blue Bell Bio-Medical v. Cin-Bad, Inc., 864 F.2d 1253, 1256 (CA5 1989):
        "The `trade dress' of a product is essentially its total image and overall
        appearance." It "involves the total image of a product and may include
        features such as size, shape, color or color combinations, texture, graphics, or
        even particular sales techniques." John H. Harland Co. v. Clarke Checks,
        Inc., 711 F.2d 966, 980 (CA11 1983).

See also RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF UNFAIR COMPETITION § 16 cmt. a (1995) ("The
term `trade dress' is often used to describe the overall appearance or image of goods
or services as offered for sale in the marketplace."). When is a trade dress eligible for
protection? Two Pesos was the first of two major Supreme Court cases to address the
issue.

                           Two Pesos, Inc. v. Taco Cabana, Inc.
                                      505 U.S. 763 (1992)

Justice WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.
        The issue in this case is whether the trade dress of a restaurant may be

protected under § 43(a) of the Trademark Act of 1946 (Lanham Act), 60 Stat. 441,
15 U.S.C. § 1125(a) 1982 ed.), based on a finding of inherent distinctiveness,
without proof that the trade dress has secondary meaning.

                                                  I
        Respondent Taco Cabana, Inc., operates a chain of fast-food restaurants in
Texas. The restaurants serve Mexican food. The first Taco Cabana restaurant was

                                                     76
opened in San Antonio in September 1978, and five more restaurants had been
opened in San Antonio by 1985. Taco Cabana describes its Mexican trade dress as

        "a festive eating atmosphere having interior dining and patio areas decorated
        with artifacts, bright colors, paintings and murals. The patio includes interior
        and exterior areas with the interior patio capable of being sealed off from the
        outside patio by overhead garage doors. The stepped exterior of the building
        is a festive and vivid color scheme using top border paint and neon stripes.
        Bright awnings and umbrellas continue the theme."

        In December 1985, a Two Pesos, Inc., restaurant was opened in Houston.
Two Pesos adopted a motif very similar to the foregoing description of Taco
Cabana's trade dress. Two Pesos restaurants expanded rapidly in Houston and other
markets, but did not enter San Antonio. In 1986, Taco Cabana entered the
Houston and Austin markets and expanded into other Texas cities, including Dallas
and El Paso where Two Pesos was also doing business.

        In 1987, Taco Cabana sued Two Pesos in the United States District Court
for the Southern District of Texas for trade dress infringement under § 43(a) of the
Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a) (1982 ed.),2 and for theft of trade secrets under
Texas common law. The case was tried to a jury, which was instructed to return its
verdict in the form of answers to five questions propounded by the trial judge. The
jury's answers were: Taco Cabana has a trade dress; taken as a whole, the trade dress
is nonfunctional; the trade dress is inherently distinctive; the trade dress has not
acquired a secondary meaning in the Texas market; and the alleged infringement
creates a likelihood of confusion on the part of ordinary customers as to the source
or association of the restaurant's goods or services. Because, as the jury was told,
Taco Cabana's trade dress was protected if it either was inherently distinctive or had
acquired a secondary meaning, judgment was entered awarding damages to Taco
Cabana. In the course of calculating damages, the trial court held that Two Pesos
had intentionally and deliberately infringed Taco Cabana's trade dress.

          2 Section 43(a) provides: "Any person who shall affix, apply, or annex, or use in connection with any

goods or services, or any container or containers for goods, a false designation of origin, or any false

description or representation, including words or other symbols tending falsely to describe or represent the

same, and shall cause such goods or services to enter into commerce, and any person who shall with

knowledge of the falsity of such designation of origin or description or representation cause or procure the

same to be transported or used in commerce or deliver the same to any carrier to be transported or used,

shall be liable to a civil action by any person doing business in the locality falsely indicated as that of origin or

in the region in which said locality is situated, or by any person who believes that he is or is likely to be

damaged by the use of any such false description or representation." 60 Stat. 441.

          This provision has been superseded by § 132 of the Trademark Law Revision Act of 1988, 102 Stat.

3946, 15 U.S.C. § 1121.

                                                     77
        The Court of Appeals ruled that the instructions adequately stated the
applicable law and that the evidence supported the jury's findings. In particular, the
Court of Appeals rejected petitioner's argument that a finding of no secondary
meaning contradicted a finding of inherent distinctiveness . . . . We granted
certiorari to resolve the conflict among the Courts of Appeals on the question
whether trade dress that is inherently distinctive is protectible under § 43(a) without
a showing that it has acquired secondary meaning. We find that it is, and we
therefore affirm.

                                                 II
        The Lanham Act7 was intended to make "actionable the deceptive and
misleading use of marks" and "to protect persons engaged in ... commerce against
unfair competition." § 45, 15 U.S.C. § 1127. Section 43(a) "prohibits a broader
range of practices than does § 32," which applies to registered marks, Inwood
Laboratories, Inc. v. Ives Laboratories, Inc., 456 U.S. 844, 858 (1982), but it is common
ground that § 43(a) protects qualifying unregistered trademarks and that the general
principles qualifying a mark for registration under § 2 of the Lanham Act are for
the most part applicable in determining whether an unregistered mark is entitled to
protection under § 43(a).
        A trademark is defined in 15 U.S.C. § 1127 as including "any word, name,
symbol, or device or any combination thereof" used by any person "to identify and
distinguish his or her goods, including a unique product, from those manufactured
or sold by others and to indicate the source of the goods, even if that source is
unknown." In order to be registered, a mark must be capable of distinguishing the
applicant's goods from those of others. § 1052. Marks are often classified in
categories of generally increasing distinctiveness; following the classic formulation
set out by Judge Friendly, they may be (1) generic; (2) descriptive; (3) suggestive; (4)
arbitrary; or (5) fanciful. See Abercrombie & Fitch Co. v. Hunting World, Inc., 537 F.2d
4, 9 (CA2 1976). The Court of Appeals followed this classification and petitioner
accepts it. The latter three categories of marks, because their intrinsic nature serves
to identify a particular source of a product, are deemed inherently distinctive and
are entitled to protection. . . .
        Marks which are merely descriptive of a product are not inherently
distinctive. When used to describe a product, they do not inherently identify a
particular source, and hence cannot be protected. However, descriptive marks may
acquire the distinctiveness which will allow them to be protected under the Act.
Section 2 of the Lanham Act provides that a descriptive mark that otherwise could

          7 The Lanham Act, including the provisions at issue here, has been substantially amended since the

present suit was brought. See Trademark Law Revision Act of 1988, 102 Stat. 3946, 15 U.S.C. § 1121.

                                                     78
not be registered under the Act may be registered if it "has become distinctive of the
applicant's goods in commerce." This acquired distinctiveness is generally called
"secondary meaning." The concept of secondary meaning has been applied to
actions under § 43(a).

        The general rule regarding distinctiveness is clear: An identifying mark is
distinctive and capable of being protected if it either (1) is inherently distinctive or (2)
has acquired distinctiveness through secondary meaning. It is also clear that
eligibility for protection under § 43(a) depends on nonfunctionality. It is, of course,
also undisputed that liability under § 43(a) requires proof of the likelihood of
confusion.

        The Court of Appeals determined that the District Court's instructions were
consistent with the foregoing principles and that the evidence supported the jury's
verdict. Both courts thus ruled that Taco Cabana's trade dress was not descriptive
but rather inherently distinctive, and that it was not functional. None of these
rulings is before us in this case, and for present purposes we assume, without
deciding, that each of them is correct. In going on to affirm the judgment for
respondent, the Court of Appeals . . . held that Taco Cabana's inherently distinctive
trade dress was entitled to protection despite the lack of proof of secondary
meaning. It is this issue that is before us for decision, and we agree with its
resolution by the Court of Appeals. There is no persuasive reason to apply to trade
dress a general requirement of secondary meaning which is at odds with the
principles generally applicable to infringement suits under § 43(a). . . .

        Petitioner argues that the jury's finding that the trade dress has not acquired
a secondary meaning shows conclusively that the trade dress is not inherently
distinctive. The Court of Appeals' disposition of this issue was sound:

        "Two Pesos' argument--that the jury finding of inherent distinctiveness
        contradicts its finding of no secondary meaning in the Texas market--ignores
        the law in this circuit. While the necessarily imperfect (and often
        prohibitively difficult) methods for assessing secondary meaning address the
        empirical question of current consumer association, the legal recognition of
        an inherently distinctive trademark or trade dress acknowledges the owner's
        legitimate proprietary interest in its unique and valuable informational
        device, regardless of whether substantial consumer association yet bestows
        the additional empirical protection of secondary meaning."

        Although petitioner makes the above argument, it appears to concede
elsewhere in its brief that it is possible for a trade dress, even a restaurant trade
dress, to be inherently distinctive and thus eligible for protection under § 43(a).
Recognizing that a general requirement of secondary meaning imposes "an unfair
prospect of theft [or] financial loss" on the developer of fanciful or arbitrary trade

                                                     79
dress at the outset of its use, petitioner suggests that such trade dress should receive
limited protection without proof of secondary meaning. Petitioner argues that such
protection should be only temporary and subject to defeasance when over time the
dress has failed to acquire a secondary meaning. This approach is also vulnerable for
the reasons given by the Court of Appeals. If temporary protection is available from
the earliest use of the trade dress, it must be because it is neither functional nor
descriptive, but an inherently distinctive dress that is capable of identifying a
particular source of the product. Such a trade dress, or mark, is not subject to
copying by concerns that have an equal opportunity to choose their own inherently
distinctive trade dress. To terminate protection for failure to gain secondary
meaning over some unspecified time could not be based on the failure of the dress
to retain its fanciful, arbitrary, or suggestive nature, but on the failure of the user of
the dress to be successful enough in the marketplace. This is not a valid basis to find
a dress or mark ineligible for protection. The user of such a trade dress should be
able to maintain what competitive position it has and continue to seek wider
identification among potential customers.

        This brings us to the line of decisions by the Court of Appeals for the
Second Circuit that would find protection for trade dress unavailable absent proof
of secondary meaning, a position that petitioner concedes would have to be
modified if the temporary protection that it suggests is to be recognized. Brief for
Petitioner 10-14. In Vibrant Sales, Inc. v. New Body Boutique, Inc., 652 F.2d 299
(1981), the plaintiff claimed protection under § 43(a) for a product whose features
the defendant had allegedly copied. The Court of Appeals held that unregistered
marks did not enjoy the "presumptive source association" enjoyed by registered
marks and hence could not qualify for protection under § 43(a) without proof of
secondary meaning. The court's rationale seemingly denied protection for
unregistered, but inherently distinctive, marks of all kinds, whether the claimed
mark used distinctive words or symbols or distinctive product design. The court
thus did not accept the arguments that an unregistered mark was capable of
identifying a source and that copying such a mark could be making any kind of a
false statement or representation under § 43(a).

        This holding is in considerable tension with the provisions of the Lanham
Act. If a verbal or symbolic mark or the features of a product design may be
registered under § 2, it necessarily is a mark "by which the goods of the applicant
may be distinguished from the goods of others," 60 Stat. 428, and must be
registered unless otherwise disqualified. Since § 2 requires secondary meaning only
as a condition to registering descriptive marks, there are plainly marks that are
registrable without showing secondary meaning. These same marks, even if not
registered, remain inherently capable of distinguishing the goods of the users of
these marks. Furthermore, the copier of such a mark may be seen as falsely claiming

                                                     80
that his products may for some reason be thought of as originating from the
plaintiff. . . .

        The Fifth Circuit was quite right in Chevron, and in this case, to follow the
Abercrombie classifications consistently and to inquire whether trade dress for which
protection is claimed under § 43(a) is inherently distinctive. If it is, it is capable of
identifying products or services as coming from a specific source and secondary
meaning is not required. This is the rule generally applicable to trademarks, and the
protection of trademarks and trade dress under § 43(a) serves the same statutory
purpose of preventing deception and unfair competition. There is no persuasive
reason to apply different analysis to the two. [The Court noted the agreement of the
Seventh, Ninth, and Eleventh Circuits.]

        It would be a different matter if there were textual basis in § 43(a) for
treating inherently distinctive verbal or symbolic trademarks differently from
inherently distinctive trade dress. But there is none. The section does not mention
trademarks or trade dress, whether they be called generic, descriptive, suggestive,
arbitrary, fanciful, or functional. Nor does the concept of secondary meaning appear
in the text of § 43(a). Where secondary meaning does appear in the statute, 15
U.S.C. § 1052 (1982 ed.), it is a requirement that applies only to merely descriptive
marks and not to inherently distinctive ones. We see no basis for requiring
secondary meaning for inherently distinctive trade dress protection under § 43(a)
but not for other distinctive words, symbols, or devices capable of identifying a
producer's product.

        Engrafting onto § 43(a) a requirement of secondary meaning for inherently
distinctive trade dress also would undermine the purposes of the Lanham Act.
Protection of trade dress, no less than of trademarks, serves the Act's purpose to
"secure to the owner of the mark the goodwill of his business and to protect the
ability of consumers to distinguish among competing producers. National
protection of trademarks is desirable, Congress concluded, because trademarks
foster competition and the maintenance of quality by securing to the producer the
benefits of good reputation." Park 'N Fly, 469 U.S., at 198, citing S.Rep. No. 1333,
79th Cong., 2d Sess., 3-5 (1946) (citations omitted). By making more difficult the
identification of a producer with its product, a secondary meaning requirement for
a nondescriptive trade dress would hinder improving or maintaining the producer's
competitive position.

        Suggestions that under the Fifth Circuit's law, the initial user of any shape or
design would cut off competition from products of like design and shape are not
persuasive. Only nonfunctional, distinctive trade dress is protected under §
43(a). . . .

        On the other hand, adding a secondary meaning requirement could have
anticompetitive effects, creating particular burdens on the startup of small

                                                     81
companies. It would present special difficulties for a business, such as respondent,
that seeks to start a new product in a limited area and then expand into new
markets. Denying protection for inherently distinctive nonfunctional trade dress
until after secondary meaning has been established would allow a competitor, which
has not adopted a distinctive trade dress of its own, to appropriate the originator's
dress in other markets and to deter the originator from expanding into and
competing in these areas.

        As noted above, petitioner concedes that protecting an inherently distinctive
trade dress from its inception may be critical to new entrants to the market and that
withholding protection until secondary meaning has been established would be
contrary to the goals of the Lanham Act. Petitioner specifically suggests, however,
that the solution is to dispense with the requirement of secondary meaning for a
reasonable, but brief, period at the outset of the use of a trade dress. If § 43(a) does
not require secondary meaning at the outset of a business' adoption of trade dress,
there is no basis in the statute to support the suggestion that such a requirement
comes into being after some unspecified time.

                                                III
        We agree with the Court of Appeals that proof of secondary meaning is not
required to prevail on a claim under § 43(a) of the Lanham Act where the trade
dress at issue is inherently distinctive, and accordingly the judgment of that court is
affirmed....

Justice SCALIA, concurring.

        I write separately to note my complete agreement with Justice THOMAS's
explanation as to how the language of § 43(a) and its common-law derivation are
broad enough to embrace inherently distinctive trade dress. Nevertheless, because I
find that analysis to be complementary to (and not inconsistent with) the Court's
opinion, I concur in the latter.

Justice STEVENS, concurring in the judgment.

        As the Court notes in its opinion, the text of § 43(a) of the Lanham Act, 15
U.S.C. § 1125(a) (1982 ed.), "does not mention trademarks or trade dress."
Nevertheless, the Court interprets this section as having created a federal cause of
action for infringement of an unregistered trademark or trade dress and concludes
that such a mark or dress should receive essentially the same protection as those
that are registered. Although I agree with the Court's conclusion, I think it is
important to recognize that the meaning of the text has been transformed by the
federal courts over the past few decades. I agree with this transformation, even
though it marks a departure from the original text, because it is consistent with the
purposes of the statute and has recently been endorsed by Congress.

                                                     82

        It is appropriate to begin with the relevant text of § 43(a).1 Section 43(a)2
provides a federal remedy for using either "a false designation of origin" or a "false
description or representation" in connection with any goods or services. The full
text of the section makes it clear that the word "origin" refers to the geographic
location in which the goods originated, and in fact, the phrase "false designation of
origin" was understood to be limited to false advertising of geographic origin. For
example, the "false designation of origin" language contained in the statute makes it
unlawful to represent that California oranges came from Florida, or vice versa.3
        For a number of years after the 1946 enactment of the Lanham Act, a "false
description or representation," like "a false designation of origin," was construed
narrowly. The phrase encompassed two kinds of wrongs: false advertising4 and the

          1 The text that we consider today is § 43(a) of the Lanham Act prior to the 1988 amendments; it
provides:

          "Any person who shall affix, apply, or annex, or use in connection with any goods or services, or any
          container or containers for goods, a false designation of origin, or any false description or
          representation, including words or other symbols tending falsely to describe or represent the same,
          and shall cause such goods or services to enter into commerce, and any person who shall with
          knowledge of the falsity of such designation of origin or description or representation cause or
          procure the same to be transported or used in commerce or deliver the same to any carrier to be
          transported or used, shall be liable to a civil action by any person doing business in the locality
          falsely indicated as that of origin or in the region in which said locality is situated, or by any person
          who believes that he is or is likely to be damaged by the use of any such false description or
          representation." 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a) (1982 ed.).

          2 Section 43(a) replaced and extended the coverage of § 3 of the Trademark Act of 1920, 41 Stat.
534, as amended. Section 3 was destined for oblivion largely because it referred only to false designation of
origin, was limited to articles of merchandise, thus excluding services, and required a showing that the use of
the false designation of origin occurred "willfully and with intent to deceive." Ibid. As a result, "[a]lmost no
reported decision can be found in which relief was granted to either a United States or foreign party based on
this newly created remedy." Derenberg, Federal Unfair Competition Law at the End of the First Decade of the
Lanham Act: Prologue or Epilogue?, 32 N.Y.U.L.Rev. 1029, 1034 (1957).

          3 This is clear from the fact that the cause of action created by this section is available only to a
person doing business in the locality falsely indicated as that of origin. See n. 1, supra.

          4 The deleterious effects of false advertising were described by one commentator as follows: "[A]
campaign of false advertising may completely discredit the product of an industry, destroy the confidence of
consumers and impair a communal or trade good will. Less tangible but nevertheless real is the injury
suffered by the honest dealer who finds it necessary to meet the price competition of inferior goods,
glamorously misdescribed by the unscrupulous merchant. The competition of a liar is always dangerous even

                                                     83
common-law tort of "passing off."5 False advertising meant representing that goods
or services possessed characteristics that they did not actually have and passing off
meant representing one's goods as those of another. Neither "secondary meaning"
nor "inherent distinctiveness" had anything to do with false advertising, but proof
of secondary meaning was an element of the common-law passing-off cause of
action. See, e.g., G. & C. Merriam Co. v. Saalfield, 198 F. 369, 372 (CA6 1912) ("The
ultimate offense always is that defendant has passed off his goods as and for those of
the complainant").

                                                 II
        Over time, the Circuits have expanded the categories of "false designation of
origin" and "false description or representation." One treatise identified the Court
of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit as the first to broaden the meaning of "origin" to
include "origin of source or manufacture" in addition to geographic origin. Another
early case, described as unique among the Circuit cases because it was so "forward-
looking," interpreted the "false description or representation" language to mean
more than mere "palming off." L'Aiglon Apparel, Inc. v. Lana Lobell, Inc., 214 F.2d
649 (CA3 1954). The court explained: "We find nothing in the legislative history of
the Lanham Act to justify the view that [§ 43(a) ] is merely declarative of existing
law.... It seems to us that Congress has defined a statutory civil wrong of false
representation of goods in commerce and has given a broad class of suitors injured
or likely to be injured by such wrong the right to relief in the federal courts." Id., at
651. Judge Clark, writing a concurrence in 1956, presciently observed: "Indeed,
there is indication here and elsewhere that the bar has not yet realized the potential
impact of this statutory provision [§ 43(a) ]." Maternally Yours, Inc. v. Your Maternity

though the exact injury may not be susceptible of precise proof." Handler, Unfair Competition, 21 Iowa L.Rev.
175, 193 (1936).

          5 The common-law tort of passing off has been described as follows:

          "Beginning in about 1803, English and American common law slowly developed an offshoot of the
          tort of fraud and deceit and called it `passing off' or `palming off.' Simply stated, passing off as a tort
          consists of one passing off his goods as the goods of another. In 1842 Lord Langdale wrote:

          " `I think that the principle on which both the courts of law and equity proceed is very well
          understood. A man is not to sell his own goods under the pretence that they are the goods of
          another man....'
          "In 19th century cases, trademark infringement embodied much of the elements of fraud and deceit
          from which trademark protection developed. That is, the element of fraudulent intent was
          emphasized over the objective facts of consumer confusion." 1 J. McCarthy, Trademarks and Unfair
          Competition § 5.2, p. 133 (2d ed. 1984) (McCarthy) (footnotes omitted).

Shop, Inc., 234 F.2d 538, 546(CA2). Although some have criticized the expansion as
unwise,9 it is now "a firmly embedded reality."10 The United States Trade
Association Trademark Review Commission noted this transformation with
approval: "Section 43(a) is an enigma, but a very popular one. Narrowly drawn and
intended to reach false designations or representations as to the geographical origin
of products, the section has been widely interpreted to create, in essence, a federal
law of unfair competition.... It has definitely eliminated a gap in unfair competition
law, and its vitality is showing no signs of age."11

        Today, it is less significant whether the infringement falls under "false
designation of origin" or "false description or representation" because in either case
§ 43(a) may be invoked. The federal courts are in agreement that § 43(a) creates a
federal cause of action for trademark and trade dress infringement claims. They are
also in agreement that the test for liability is likelihood of confusion: "[U]nder the
Lanham Act [§ 43(a) ], the ultimate test is whether the public is likely to be deceived
or confused by the similarity of the marks.... Whether we call the violation
infringement, unfair competition or false designation of origin, the test is identical--
is there a `likelihood of confusion?' " New West Corp. v. NYM Co. of California, Inc.,
595 F.2d 1194, 1201 (CA9 1979) (footnote omitted). And the Circuits are in
general agreement with perhaps the exception of the Second Circuit,14 that
secondary meaning need not be established once there is a finding of inherent
distinctiveness in order to establish a trade dress violation under § 43(a).

function").

          14 Consistent with the common-law background of § 43(a), the Second Circuit has said that proof of
secondary meaning is required to establish a claim that the defendant has traded on the plaintiff's good will
by falsely representing that his goods are those of the plaintiff. See, e.g., Crescent Tool Co. v. Kilborn & Bishop
Co., 247 F. 299 (1917). To my knowledge, however, the Second Circuit has not explained why "inherent
distinctiveness" is not an appropriate substitute for proof of secondary meaning in a trade dress case. Most of
the cases in which the Second Circuit has said that secondary meaning is required did not involve findings of
inherent distinctiveness. . . .

                                                     85
        Even though the lower courts' expansion of the categories contained in §
43(a) is unsupported by the text of the Act, I am persuaded that it is consistent with
the general purposes of the Act. For example, Congressman Lanham, the bill's
sponsor, stated: "The purpose of [the Act] is to protect legitimate business and the
consumers of the country." One way of accomplishing these dual goals was by
creating uniform legal rights and remedies that were appropriate for a national
economy. Although the protection of trademarks had once been "entirely a State
matter," the result of such a piecemeal approach was that there were almost "as
many different varieties of common law as there are States" so that a person's right
to a trademark "in one State may differ widely from the rights which [that person]
enjoys in another." H.R.Rep. No. 944, 76th Cong., 1st Sess., 4 (1939). The House
Committee on Trademarks and Patents, recognizing that "trade is no longer local,
but ...national," saw the need for "national legislation along national lines [to]
secur[e] to the owners of trademarks in interstate commerce definite rights." Ibid.16

        Congress has revisited this statute from time to time, and has accepted the
"judicial legislation" that has created this federal cause of action. Recently, for
example, in the Trademark Law Revision Act of 1988, 102 Stat. 3935, Congress
codified the judicial interpretation of § 43(a), giving its imprimatur to a growing body
of case law from the Circuits that had expanded the section beyond its original
language.

        Although Congress has not specifically addressed the question whether
secondary meaning is required under § 43(a), the steps it has taken in this
subsequent legislation suggest that secondary meaning is not required if inherent
distinctiveness has been established. First, Congress broadened the language of §
43(a) to make explicit that the provision prohibits "any word, term, name, symbol,
or device, or any combination thereof" that is "likely to cause confusion, or to cause
mistake, or to deceive as to the affiliation, connection, or association of such person
with another person, or as to the origin, sponsorship, or approval of his or her
goods, services, or commercial activities by another person." 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a).
That language makes clear that a confusingly similar trade dress is actionable under
§ 43(a), without necessary reference to "falsity." Second, Congress approved and
confirmed the extensive judicial development under the provision, including its

          16 Forty years later, the USTA Trademark Review Commission assessed the state of trademark law.

The conclusion that it reached serves as a testimonial to the success of the Act in achieving its goal of

uniformity: "The federal courts now decide, under federal law, all but a few trademark disputes. State

trademark law and state courts are less influential than ever. Today the Lanham Act is the paramount source

of trademark law in the United States, as interpreted almost exclusively by the federal courts." Trademark

Review Commission, 77 Trademark Rep., at 377.

                                                     86
application to trade dress that the federal courts had come to apply.18 Third, the
legislative history of the 1988 amendments reaffirms Congress' goals of protecting
both businesses and consumers with the Lanham Act. And fourth, Congress
explicitly extended to any violation of § 43(a) the basic Lanham Act remedial
provisions whose text previously covered only registered trademarks. The aim of the
amendments was to apply the same protections to unregistered marks as were
already afforded to registered marks. See S.Rep. No. 100-515, p. 40 (1988). These
steps buttress the conclusion that § 43(a) is properly understood to provide
protection in accordance with the standards for registration in § 2. These aspects of
the 1988 legislation bolster the claim that an inherently distinctive trade dress may
be protected under § 43(a) without proof of secondary meaning.

                                                IV
        In light of the consensus among the Courts of Appeals that have actually
addressed the question, and the steps on the part of Congress to codify that
consensus, stare decisis concerns persuade me to join the Court's conclusion that
secondary meaning is not required to establish a trade dress violation under § 43(a)
once inherent distinctiveness has been established. Accordingly, I concur in the
judgment, but not in the opinion, of the Court.

Justice THOMAS, concurring in the judgment.
        Both the Court and Justice STEVENS decide today that the principles that

qualify a mark for registration under § 2 of the Lanham Act apply as well to
determining whether an unregistered mark is entitled to protection under § 43(a).
The Court terms that view "common ground," though it fails to explain why that
might be so, and Justice STEVENS decides that the view among the Courts of
Appeals is textually insupportable, but worthy nonetheless of adherence. I see no
need in answering the question presented either to move back and forth among the
different sections of the Lanham Act or to adopt what may or may not be a

          18 As the Senate Report explained, revision of § 43(a) is designed "to codify the interpretation it has
been given by the courts. Because Section 43(a) of the Act fills an important gap in federal unfair competition
law, the committee expects the courts to continue to interpret the section.

                   "As written, Section 43(a) appears to deal only with false descriptions or representations and
        false designations of geographic origin. Since its enactment in 1946, however, it has been widely
        interpreted as creating, in essence, a federal law of unfair competition. For example, it has been
        applied to cases involving the infringement of unregistered marks, violations of trade dress and certain
        nonfunctional configurations of goods and actionable false advertising claims." S.Rep. No. 100-515,

misconstruction of the statute for reasons akin to stare decisis. I would rely, instead,
on the language of § 43(a).

        Section 43(a) made actionable (before being amended) "any false description
or representation, including words or other symbols tending falsely to describe or
represent," when "use[d] in connection with any goods or services." 15 U.S.C. §
1125(a) (1982 ed.). This language codified, among other things, the related
common-law torts of technical trademark infringement and passing off, which were
causes of action for false descriptions or representations concerning a good's or
service's source of production, see, e.g., Yale Electric Corp. v. Robertson, 26 F.2d 972,
973 (CA2 1928); American Washboard Co. v. Saginaw Mfg. Co., 103 F. 281, 284-286
(CA6 1900).

        At common law, words or symbols that were arbitrary, fanciful, or suggestive
(called "inherently distinctive" words or symbols, or "trademarks") were presumed
to represent the source of a product, and the first user of a trademark could sue to
protect it without having to show that the word or symbol represented the product's
source in fact. That presumption did not attach to personal or geographic names or
to words or symbols that only described a product (called "trade names"), and the
user of a personal or geographic name or of a descriptive word or symbol could
obtain relief only if he first showed that his trade name did in fact represent not just
the product, but a producer (that the good or service had developed "secondary
meaning"). Trade dress, which consists not of words or symbols, but of a product's
packaging (or "image," more broadly), seems at common law to have been thought
incapable ever of being inherently distinctive, perhaps on the theory that the
number of ways to package a product is finite. Thus, a user of trade dress would
always have had to show secondary meaning in order to obtain protection.

        Over time, judges have come to conclude that packages or images may be as
arbitrary, fanciful, or suggestive as words or symbols, their numbers limited only by
the human imagination. A particular trade dress, then, is now considered as fully
capable as a particular trademark of serving as a "representation or designation" of
source under § 43(a). As a result, the first user of an arbitrary package, like the first
user of an arbitrary word, should be entitled to the presumption that his package
represents him without having to show that it does so in fact. This rule follows, in
my view, from the language of § 43(a), and this rule applies under that section
without regard to the rules that apply under the sections of the Lanham Act that
deal with registration.

        Because the Court reaches the same conclusion for different reasons, I join
its judgment.

                                              Notes

                                                     88
        Judicial activism? Do you understand the precise point of textual disagreement
between Justices Thomas and Stevens? It might be helpful to look again at the
relevant text of the statutes. Section 43(a)'s original (and since amended) text
provided a cause of action against those who "affix, apply, or annex, or use" a "false
designation of origin." The text suggested that that "origin" meant geographic origin
because the cause of action was for "any person doing business in the locality falsely
indicated as that of origin or the region in which said locality is situated." Section
43(a) also prohibited "any false description or representation," which had debatable
applicability to trade dress in light of common law understandings (see the next
note).

        By the time Two Pesos reached the Court, however, Congress had amended
section 43(a) to more clearly apply to trade dress. The statute now provides liability
when the use of "any word, term, name, symbol, or device, or any combination
thereof . . . is likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive as to the
affiliation, connection, or association of such person with another person, or as to
the origin, sponsorship, or approval of his or her goods, services, or commercial
activities by another person." The cause of action in Two Pesos arose, however,
under the older text, provoking the debate between the Justices on the rationale for
their holding.

        Regardless of who you think has the better of the textual debate, the view
that the courts first expanded the Lanham Act's scope and Congress amended the
statute to catch up is a common one. The legislative history even says so.

        [The bill] revises Section 43(a) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 1125(a)) to codify the
        interpretation it has been given by the courts. Because Section 43(a) of the
        Act fills an important gap in federal unfair competition law, the committee
        expects the courts to continue to interpret the section.

        As written, Section 43(a) appears to deal only with false descriptions or
        representations and false designations of geographic origin. Since its
        enactment in 1946, however, it has been widely interpreted as creating, in
        essence, a federal law of unfair competition. For example, it has been applied
        to cases involving the infringement of unregistered marks, violations of trade
        dress and certain nonfunctional configurations of goods and actionable false
        advertising claims.

        Is this kind of judicial development of trademark law appropriate?

        Common law consistency. The Court's embrace of easy protection for trade
dress is in tension with trademark's common law roots. Traditional trademark law
excluded trade dress, 1 WILLIAM D. SHOEMAKER, TRADE-MARKS: A TREATISE ON

        Functionality. Lurking in the opinion is the concern that protection of trade
dress might place functional material under control of the trademark holder. The
majority ultimately is unconcerned. Should it have been? Think about the protected
dress in Two Pesos. Can you think of an argument that it was functional? Is food the
only thing the restaurants were selling? Or did they also offer an atmosphere? Was
trade dress part of that atmosphere?

        Do you understand why trademark law denies protection for functional
matter? How does one know when something is functional? We will explore these
topics in the coming chapters.

                                                     90
        How do we determine distinctiveness? Note that Two Pesos treats the spectrum of
distinctiveness as relevant to determining whether trade dress is inherently
distinctive (though it did not require its use in future cases). Does it seem like a
sensible test? Some courts continue to apply the Abercrombie spectrum to trade dress
cases, but others have noted that it is ill-equipped for the task.

        Seabrook Foods, Inc. v. Bar-Well Foods, Ltd., 568 F.2d 1342, 1344 (C.C.P.A.
1977), announced another common test for evaluating trade dress distinctiveness.
Seabrook asks if the mark is:

        (1) a "common" basic shape or design;

        (2) unique or unusual in the field in which it is used;

        (3) a mere refinement of a commonly adopted and well-known form of
        ornamentation for a particular class of goods viewed by the public as a dress
        or ornamentation for the goods;

        (4) capable of creating a commercial impression distinct from the
        accompanying words.

        Does this help? Is factor #4 simply a restatement of the question that the test
is trying to answer? The Trademark Office uses Seabrook to evaluate the inherent
distinctiveness of trade dress.* TMEP § 1202.02(b)(ii).

        How might lay juries approach the question of distinctiveness? If they look at
a restaurant décor and call it distinctive, do they necessarily mean distinctive in a
trademark sense? Could they mean distinctive as in striking? Evocative of a
particular cuisine (e.g., distinct from, say, a pizza restaurant)? Something else?

        Color and Packaging. If product packaging can be inherently distinctive, but
color alone requires secondary meaning, how do we treat the use of color in product
packaging? See Forney Indus., Inc. v. Daco of Missouri, Inc., 835 F.3d 1238, 1248
(10th Cir. 2016) (holding that "the use of color in product packaging can be
inherently distinctive . . . only if specific colors are used in combination with a well-
defined shape, pattern, or other distinctive design"). In In re Forney Industries, Inc.,
955 F.3d 940 (Fed. Cir. 2020), the Federal Circuit held that color marks on product
packaging may be inherently distinctive, at least where the claimed mark is in a
multi-color mark. The claimed mark looked like this:

          * More precisely, trade dress based on product packaging. As we will see in the next chapter, the
Supreme Court has announced that product design is protectable trade dress only if it has secondary meaning.

                                                     91
        In the Federal Circuit tradition of always trying to maximize the scope of
intellectual property rights, the court rejected a potential limitation of requiring
such marks to be in conjunction with a distinctive peripheral shape or border. Id. at
947.

        Functional or not distinctive? Think about the kinds of trade dress to which you
would deny protection. What drives your impulse? Is your hypothesized trade dress
functional? Not distinctive? Both? Does the problem correspond with the spectrum
of distinctiveness (i.e., the dress is generic or descriptive)? How should trademark
law formalize these exclusions? Should it?

5. Trade Dress and Product Design

             Section 43(a)(3) of the Lanham Act (15 U.S.C. § 1125(a)(3))

        In a civil action for trade dress infringement under this chapter for trade
        dress not registered on the principal register, the person who asserts trade
        dress protection has the burden of proving that the matter sought to be
        protected is not functional.

        The Supreme Court's approval of inherently distinctive trade dress in Two
Pesos raised serious issues regarding the use of trademark law to reach functional
product designs. Is this an issue that should be relegated to analysis under the
functionality doctrine (which is the topic of the next chapter)? Or should the
functionality issue also shape the distinctiveness analysis? As long as we're asking
questions, is product design likely to perform a source-identifying function in the
first place? The Court considered these issues in Wal-Mart.

                        Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Samara Bros., Inc.
                                      529 U.S. 205 (2000)

Justice SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court.
        In this case, we decide under what circumstances a product's design is

distinctive, and therefore protectible, in an action for infringement of unregistered
trade dress under § 43(a) of the Trademark Act of 1946 (Lanham Act), 60 Stat. 441,
as amended, 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a).

                                                  I
        Respondent Samara Brothers, Inc., designs and manufactures children's
clothing. Its primary product is a line of spring/summer one-piece seersucker outfits
decorated with appliques of hearts, flowers, fruits, and the like. A number of chain
stores, including JCPenney, sell this line of clothing under contract with Samara.
        Petitioner Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., is one of the Nation's best known retailers,
selling among other things children's clothing. In 1995, Wal-Mart contracted with
one of its suppliers, Judy-Philippine, Inc., to manufacture a line of children's outfits
for sale in the 1996 spring/summer season. Wal-Mart sent Judy-Philippine
photographs of a number of garments from Samara's line, on which Judy-
Philippine's garments were to be based; Judy-Philippine duly copied, with only
minor modifications, 16 of Samara's garments, many of which contained
copyrighted elements. In 1996, Wal-Mart briskly sold the so-called knockoffs,
generating more than $1.15 million in gross profits.

                                                     93
        In June 1996, a buyer for JCPenney called a representative at Samara to
complain that she had seen Samara garments on sale at Wal-Mart for a lower price
than JCPenney was allowed to charge under its contract with Samara. The Samara
representative told the buyer that Samara did not supply its clothing to Wal-Mart.
Their suspicions aroused, however, Samara officials launched an investigation,
which disclosed that Wal-Mart and several other major retailers--Kmart, Caldor,
Hills, and Goody's--were selling the knockoffs of Samara's outfits produced by Judy-
Philippine.

        After sending cease-and-desist letters, Samara brought this action in the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against Wal-
Mart, Judy-Philippine, Kmart, Caldor, Hills, and Goody's for copyright
infringement under federal law, consumer fraud and unfair competition under New
York law, and--most relevant for our purposes--infringement of unregistered trade
dress under § 43(a) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a). All of the defendants
except Wal-Mart settled before trial.

        After a weeklong trial, the jury found in favor of Samara on all of its claims.
Wal-Mart then renewed a motion for judgment as a matter of law, claiming, inter
alia, that there was insufficient evidence to support a conclusion that Samara's
clothing designs could be legally protected as distinctive trade dress for purposes of
§ 43(a). The District Court denied the motion, and awarded Samara damages,
interest, costs, and fees totaling almost $1.6 million, together with injunctive relief.
The Second Circuit affirmed the denial of the motion for judgment as a matter of
law, and we granted certiorari.

                                                 II
        The Lanham Act provides for the registration of trademarks, which it defines
in § 45 to include "any word, name, symbol, or device, or any combination thereof
[used or intended to be used] to identify and distinguish [a producer's] goods ...
from those manufactured or sold by others and to indicate the source of the
goods...." 15 U.S.C. § 1127. Registration of a mark under § 2 of the Lanham Act,
15 U.S.C. § 1052, enables the owner to sue an infringer under § 32, 15 U.S.C. §
1114; it also entitles the owner to a presumption that its mark is valid, see § 7(b), 15
U.S.C. § 1057(b), and ordinarily renders the registered mark incontestable after five
years of continuous use, see § 15, 15 U.S.C. § 1065. In addition to protecting
registered marks, the Lanham Act, in § 43(a), gives a producer a cause of action for
the use by any person of "any word, term, name, symbol, or device, or any
combination thereof ... which ... is likely to cause confusion ... as to the origin,
sponsorship, or approval of his or her goods...." 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a). It is the latter
provision that is at issue in this case.
        The breadth of the definition of marks registrable under § 2, and of the
confusion-producing elements recited as actionable by § 43(a), has been held to

                                                     94
embrace not just word marks, such as "Nike," and symbol marks, such as Nike's
"swoosh" symbol, but also "trade dress"--a category that originally included only the
packaging, or "dressing," of a product, but in recent years has been expanded by
many Courts of Appeals to encompass the design of a product. See, e.g., Ashley
Furniture Industries, Inc. v. Sangiacomo N. A., Ltd., 187 F.3d 363 (C.A.4 1999)
(bedroom furniture); Knitwaves, Inc. v. Lollytogs, Ltd., 71 F.3d 996 (C.A.2 1995)
(sweaters); Stuart Hall Co., Inc. v. Ampad Corp., 51 F.3d 780 (C.A.8 1995)
(notebooks). These courts have assumed, often without discussion, that trade dress
constitutes a "symbol" or "device" for purposes of the relevant sections, and we
conclude likewise. "Since human beings might use as a `symbol' or `device' almost
anything at all that is capable of carrying meaning, this language, read literally, is
not restrictive." Qualitex Co. v. Jacobson Products Co., 514 U.S. 159, 162 (1995). This
reading of § 2 and § 43(a) is buttressed by a recently added subsection of § 43(a), §
43(a)(3), which refers specifically to "civil action[s] for trade dress infringement
under this chapter for trade dress not registered on the principal register." 15
U.S.C. § 1125(a)(3) (1994 ed., Supp. V).

        The text of § 43(a) provides little guidance as to the circumstances under
which unregistered trade dress may be protected. It does require that a producer
show that the allegedly infringing feature is not "functional," see § 43(a)(3), and is
likely to cause confusion with the product for which protection is sought, see §
43(a)(1)(A), 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a)(1)(A). Nothing in § 43(a) explicitly requires a
producer to show that its trade dress is distinctive, but courts have universally
imposed that requirement, since without distinctiveness the trade dress would not
"cause confusion ... as to the origin, sponsorship, or approval of [the] goods," as the
section requires. Distinctiveness is, moreover, an explicit prerequisite for
registration of trade dress under § 2, and "the general principles qualifying a mark
for registration under § 2 of the Lanham Act are for the most part applicable in
determining whether an unregistered mark is entitled to protection under § 43(a)."
Two Pesos, Inc. v. Taco Cabana, Inc., 505 U.S. 763, 768 (1992) (citations omitted).

        In evaluating the distinctiveness of a mark under § 2 (and therefore, by
analogy, under § 43(a)), courts have held that a mark can be distinctive in one of
two ways. First, a mark is inherently distinctive if "[its] intrinsic nature serves to
identify a particular source." Ibid. In the context of word marks, courts have applied
the now-classic test originally formulated by Judge Friendly, in which word marks
that are "arbitrary" ("Camel" cigarettes), "fanciful" ("Kodak" film), or "suggestive"
("Tide" laundry detergent) are held to be inherently distinctive. See Abercrombie &
Fitch Co. v. Hunting World, Inc., 537 F.2d 4, 10-11 (C.A.2 1976). Second, a mark has
acquired distinctiveness, even if it is not inherently distinctive, if it has developed
secondary meaning, which occurs when, "in the minds of the public, the primary
significance of a [mark] is to identify the source of the product rather than the

                                                     95
product itself." Inwood Laboratories, Inc. v. Ives Laboratories, Inc., 456 U.S. 844, 851, n.
11 (1982).*

        The judicial differentiation between marks that are inherently distinctive and
those that have developed secondary meaning has solid foundation in the statute
itself. Section 2 requires that registration be granted to any trademark "by which the
goods of the applicant may be distinguished from the goods of others"--subject to
various limited exceptions. 15 U.S.C. § 1052. It also provides, again with limited
exceptions, that "nothing in this chapter shall prevent the registration of a mark
used by the applicant which has become distinctive of the applicant's goods in
commerce"--that is, which is not inherently distinctive but has become so only
through secondary meaning. § 2(f), 15 U.S.C. § 1052(f). Nothing in § 2, however,
demands the conclusion that every category of mark necessarily includes some marks
"by which the goods of the applicant may be distinguished from the goods of
others" without secondary meaning--that in every category some marks are inherently
distinctive.

        Indeed, with respect to at least one category of mark--colors--we have held
that no mark can ever be inherently distinctive. In Qualitex, petitioner
manufactured and sold green-gold dry-cleaning press pads. After respondent began
selling pads of a similar color, petitioner brought suit under § 43(a), then added a
claim under § 32 after obtaining registration for the color of its pads. We held that
a color could be protected as a trademark, but only upon a showing of secondary
meaning. Reasoning by analogy to the Abercrombie & Fitch test developed for word
marks, we noted that a product's color is unlike a "fanciful," "arbitrary," or
"suggestive" mark, since it does not "almost automatically tell a customer that [it]
refer[s] to a brand," and does not "immediately ... signal a brand or a product
`source,'". However, we noted that, "over time, customers may come to treat a
particular color on a product or its packaging ... as signifying a brand." Because a
color, like a "descriptive" word mark, could eventually "come to indicate a product's
origin," we concluded that it could be protected upon a showing of secondary meaning.

        It seems to us that design, like color, is not inherently distinctive. The
attribution of inherent distinctiveness to certain categories of word marks and
product packaging derives from the fact that the very purpose of attaching a

          * The phrase "secondary meaning" originally arose in the context of word marks, where it served to

distinguish the source-identifying meaning from the ordinary, or "primary," meaning of the word. "Secondary

meaning" has since come to refer to the acquired, source-identifying meaning of a nonword mark as well. It is

often a misnomer in that context, since nonword marks ordinarily have no "primary" meaning. Clarity might

well be served by using the term "acquired meaning" in both the word-mark and the nonword-mark contexts-

but in this opinion we follow what has become the conventional terminology.

                                                     96
particular word to a product, or encasing it in a distinctive packaging, is most often
to identify the source of the product. Although the words and packaging can serve
subsidiary functions--a suggestive word mark (such as "Tide" for laundry detergent),
for instance, may invoke positive connotations in the consumer's mind, and a garish
form of packaging (such as Tide's squat, brightly decorated plastic bottles for its
liquid laundry detergent) may attract an otherwise indifferent consumer's attention
on a crowded store shelf--their predominant function remains source identification.
Consumers are therefore predisposed to regard those symbols as indication of the
producer, which is why such symbols "almost automatically tell a customer that they
refer to a brand," and "immediately ... signal a brand or a product `source.' " And
where it is not reasonable to assume consumer predisposition to take an affixed
word or packaging as indication of source--where, for example, the affixed word is
descriptive of the product ("Tasty" bread) or of a geographic origin ("Georgia"
peaches)--inherent distinctiveness will not be found. That is why the statute
generally excludes, from those word marks that can be registered as inherently
distinctive, words that are "merely descriptive" of the goods, § 2(e)(1), 15 U.S.C. §
1052(e)(1), or "primarily geographically descriptive of them," see § 2(e)(2), 15
U.S.C. § 1052(e)(2). In the case of product design, as in the case of color, we think
consumer predisposition to equate the feature with the source does not exist.
Consumers are aware of the reality that, almost invariably, even the most unusual of
product designs--such as a cocktail shaker shaped like a penguin--is intended not to
identify the source, but to render the product itself more useful or more appealing.

        The fact that product design almost invariably serves purposes other than
source identification not only renders inherent distinctiveness problematic; it also
renders application of an inherent-distinctiveness principle more harmful to other
consumer interests. Consumers should not be deprived of the benefits of
competition with regard to the utilitarian and esthetic purposes that product design
ordinarily serves by a rule of law that facilitates plausible threats of suit against new
entrants based upon alleged inherent distinctiveness. How easy it is to mount a
plausible suit depends, of course, upon the clarity of the test for inherent
distinctiveness, and where product design is concerned we have little confidence
that a reasonably clear test can be devised. Respondent and the United States as
amicus curiae urge us to adopt for product design relevant portions of the test
formulated by the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals for product packaging in
Seabrook Foods, Inc. v. Bar-Well Foods, Ltd., 568 F.2d 1342 (1977). That opinion, in
determining the inherent distinctiveness of a product's packaging, considered,
among other things, "whether it was a `common' basic shape or design, whether it
was unique or unusual in a particular field, [and] whether it was a mere refinement
of a commonly-adopted and well-known form of ornamentation for a particular
class of goods viewed by the public as a dress or ornamentation for the goods." Id.,

                                                     97
at 1344 (footnotes omitted). Such a test would rarely provide the basis for summary
disposition of an anticompetitive strike suit. Indeed, at oral argument, counsel for
the United States quite understandably would not give a definitive answer as to
whether the test was met in this very case, saying only that "[t]his is a very difficult
case for that purpose."

        It is true, of course, that the person seeking to exclude new entrants would
have to establish the nonfunctionality of the design feature, see § 43(a)(3), 15
U.S.C. § 1125(a)(3)--a showing that may involve consideration of its esthetic appeal,
see Qualitex, supra, at 170. Competition is deterred, however, not merely by
successful suit but by the plausible threat of successful suit, and given the
unlikelihood of inherently source-identifying design, the game of allowing suit based
upon alleged inherent distinctiveness seems to us not worth the candle. That is
especially so since the producer can ordinarily obtain protection for a design that is
inherently source identifying (if any such exists), but that does not yet have
secondary meaning, by securing a design patent or a copyright for the design--as,
indeed, respondent did for certain elements of the designs in this case. The
availability of these other protections greatly reduces any harm to the producer that
might ensue from our conclusion that a product design cannot be protected under
§ 43(a) without a showing of secondary meaning.

        Respondent contends that our decision in Two Pesos forecloses a conclusion
that product-design trade dress can never be inherently distinctive. In that case, we
held that the trade dress of a chain of Mexican restaurants, which the plaintiff
described as "a festive eating atmosphere having interior dining and patio areas
decorated with artifacts, bright colors, paintings and murals," 505 U.S., at 765
(internal quotation marks and citation omitted), could be protected under § 43(a)
without a showing of secondary meaning. Two Pesos unquestionably establishes the
legal principle that trade dress can be inherently distinctive, but it does not establish
that product-design trade dress can be. Two Pesos is inapposite to our holding here
because the trade dress at issue, the decor of a restaurant, seems to us not to
constitute product design. It was either product packaging--which, as we have
discussed, normally is taken by the consumer to indicate origin--or else some tertium
quid that is akin to product packaging and has no bearing on the present case.

        Respondent replies that this manner of distinguishing Two Pesos will force
courts to draw difficult lines between product-design and product-packaging trade
dress. There will indeed be some hard cases at the margin: a classic glass Coca-Cola
bottle, for instance, may constitute packaging for those consumers who drink the
Coke and then discard the bottle, but may constitute the product itself for those
consumers who are bottle collectors, or part of the product itself for those
consumers who buy Coke in the classic glass bottle, rather than a can, because they
think it more stylish to drink from the former. We believe, however, that the

                                                     98
frequency and the difficulty of having to distinguish between product design and
product packaging will be much less than the frequency and the difficulty of having
to decide when a product design is inherently distinctive. To the extent there are
close cases, we believe that courts should err on the side of caution and classify
ambiguous trade dress as product design, thereby requiring secondary meaning. The
very closeness will suggest the existence of relatively small utility in adopting an
inherent-distinctiveness principle, and relatively great consumer benefit in requiring
a demonstration of secondary meaning.

                                                * * *
        We hold that, in an action for infringement of unregistered trade dress
under § 43(a) of the Lanham Act, a product's design is distinctive, and therefore
protectible, only upon a showing of secondary meaning. The judgment of the
Second Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings
consistent with this opinion.
        It is so ordered.

                                              Notes

        A policy case? How would you characterize the judicial reasoning on display in
Wal-Mart? Justice Scalia was known for his advocacy of textualist statutory
interpretation, but here he seems to be making a number of pragmatic moves. Or
might consideration of the larger context, including the common law backdrop of
trademark law, make the opinion more formalist than it initially appears? For
debate on this point, compare Michael Grynberg, Things Are Worse Than We Think:
Trademark Defenses in a "Formalist" Age, 24 BERKELEY TECH. L.J. 897 (2009), with
Graeme B. Dinwoodie, Developing Defenses in Trademark Law, 13 LEWIS & CLARK L.
REV. 99 (2009). If policy concerns are driving the opinion, which ones? Is the Court
most concerned with substantive trademark policy, procedural trademark policy
(i.e., the efficient administration of trademark claims), or perhaps the operation of
the legal system as a whole?

        Empirical observations. Regardless of how we describe Wal-Mart's statutory
interpretation methodology, there is no doubt that Scalia indulges in casual
empiricism in his observation that consumers are less likely to see product design as
indicating source. Is he right? Does it matter that the Court offers no empirical
backing for its conclusion? What about the opinion's observations about the need
to screen out anti-competitive suits at an early stage? Are judges better qualified to
draw these sorts of conclusions?

                                                     99
        Restoration of common law understandings? Recall from the last reading that Two
Pesos was in arguable tension with traditional understandings that withheld
protection from trade dress absent secondary meaning. What Two Pesos gave
trademark claimants, Wal-Mart took back in large part.

        Tertium quids. What do you make of the discussion of tertium quids in
conjunction with the Court's dictate that close product design/product packaging
calls are to be resolved in favor of finding product design? Is this just a way of not
admitting that Two Pesos was, at least in part, a mistake?

        Generic trade dress. Even if trade dress is not product design, it may still be
refused protection if it is generic:

        "Where it is the custom of an industry to package products in a particular
        manner, a trade dress in that style would be generic and therefore not
        inherently distinct." Paddington Corp. v. Attiki Imps. & Distribs., Inc., 996 F.2d
        577, 583 (2d Cir. 1993). The Second Circuit has provided a useful example
        of this: "packaging lime-flavored soda in green twelve-ounce cans is so
        common in the soft drink industry that such packaging probably is not
        inherently distinctive, although without the industry practice green cans
        would be either suggestive or arbitrary and therefore inherently distinctive."
        Id. at 583-84.

Bimbo Bakeries USA, Inc. v. Sycamore, 29 F.4th 630, 639 (10th Cir. 2022). In
Bimbo Bakeries, the plaintiff claimed trade dress in this bread packaging.

court   The plaintiff presented purported evidence of secondary meaning, but the
       ruled the claimed trade dress to be generic based on industry practices.
        We conclude that the purported trade dress for Grandma Sycamore's is
        generic and unprotectable . . . . the homemade bread products that compete
        with Grandma Sycamore's all tend to combine the purported trade dress
        elements: "(1) a horizontally-oriented label; (2) a design placed at the top
        center of the end; (3) the word `White' in red letters; (4) the use of a red,
        yellow, and white color scheme; and (5) stylized font below the design
        outlined in white." The purported trade dress claimed by Bimbo Bakeries is
        thus defined at a broad enough level of generality to sweep in its

       100
        competitors. Bimbo Bakeries may well have a protectable Grandma
        Sycamore's trade dress, but its claim in this litigation extends far beyond its
        product's more specific attributes.

Id.

        Secondary meaning and copying. Recall that courts often treat a defendant's
copying of a mark as evidence that the mark has achieved secondary meaning. Is
that inference more or less valid in the product design context? In Jason Scott
Collection, Inc. v. Trendily Furniture, LLC, 68 F.4th 1203 (9th Cir. 2023), the
defendant copied the plaintiff's furniture designs. The plaintiff sued for both
copyright and trade dress infringement. The copyright claim was successful. On the
trade dress front, the deliberate copying was treated as evidence that the plaintiff's
designs had secondary meaning. Does that follow? Might the successful copyright
claim suggest that the defendant had reasons for copying that were unrelated to
trademark law? If so, is the secondary meaning inference reasonable?

                       Best Cellars, Inc. v. Wine Made Simple, Inc.
                             320 F.Supp.2d 60 (S.D.N.Y. 2003)

LYNCH, District Judge.
        Plaintiff Best Cellars, Inc., owns and operates retail wine stores, as do the

defendants. Best Cellars claims in this action that its stores use a distinctive trade
dress protected by law, and that the wine shops operated by defendants are so
similar to plaintiff's that they infringe upon the protections provided to Best Cellars
(1) against trademark infringement, trade dress infringement and false designation
of origin pursuant to Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a); (2)
against trademark dilution under the Trademark Dilution Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1125(c);
and (3) against unfair competition under the laws of the States of New York,
California, Arizona, Colorado and Idaho.

        Best Cellars seeks injunctive relief, as well as compensatory and punitive
damages, against defendants Wine Made Simple, Inc., its principals Brigitte Baker
and William Baker, its New York licensee LJG Wines, Inc., and LJG's principal Lisa
Grossman (collectively "defendants"). The parties have cross-moved for summary
judgment . . .

                                        BACKGROUND
. . .

        Development of Best Cellars
        Plaintiff Best Cellars owns and operates four wine stores, including its
flagship store on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, which pursue the novel
marketing strategy of organizing wines by taste category rather than by grape type or

                                                    101
country of origin. The flagship store has a clean, crisp, modern decor that
demonstrates that the owners invested energy and capital in the design of the store
as well as in the development of the marketing theme. . . . . After developing the
concept of a store that retails wine by taste (such as light, medium or heavy-bodied
white or red wines, sparkling and dessert wines), the three men selected an
architectural firm and graphic design firm to create the interior decor for the store.
The interior design included wine racks built into a wall, which consist of tubes to
hold bottles of wine horizontally, creating the appearance of a grid of steel rimmed
holes in a light wood-paneled wall. The graphic design elements include computer-
generated icons and brightly colored signs associated with each taste category.

        Development of the prototype design for the store took twelve months. The
end result was dubbed "Best Cellars," and consisted of a store that stocks a limited
selection of wines, retailing for under 20 dollars a bottle, sorted by taste and
displayed in a what has been called a "wall of wine." Specialty wine and architectural
magazines described the store as "a different kind of wine store" and "radically
new", and the store has been described in more general-subject publications as
"revolutioniz[ing] wine shopping" and as offering "the most original approach to
selling wine". Plaintiff now also has stores in Brookline and Boston, Massachusetts,
Washington, D.C., and Seattle, Washington, and licenses its trade dress to a store
in Great Barrington, Massachusetts.
. . . .

        Advent of Bacchus
        In December 1998, defendants Brigitte and William Baker opened a wine
store in Manhattan Beach, California, called "Bacchus." Subsequently, their
company, Wine Made Simple, licensed additional Bacchus stores in Scottsdale,
Arizona, Boulder, Colorado, and Ketchum, Idaho. In November 2001, their
licensee LJG Wines and its owner, Lisa Grossman, opened a Bacchus store on the
Upper West Side of Manhattan, less than two miles (but in a distinctly different
neighborhood, on the other side of Central Park) from the flagship Best Cellars
store. Like Best Cellars, Bacchus aims to sell wine to novice wine consumers by
organizing the store's inventory by taste category, and by retailing modestly-priced
wines in an imaginatively-decorated store. The Bacchus stores have a Mediterranean-
themed decor consisting of white stucco and dark wood beams, and display wine
bottles horizontally in racks which are constructed to resemble a grid of holes in a
white stucco wall.

        Best Cellars Claims that Bacchus Violates its Trade Dress
        Plaintiff claims that the Bacchus stores are confusingly similar to the Best
Cellars stores, and that defendants are infringing plaintiff's legitimate intellectual
property rights in the trade dress of the Best Cellars stores. Plaintiff additionally

                                                    102
claims that defendants copied Best Cellars' trade dress, asserting that "[t]he
similarity in the look and feel of the Bacchus stores to Best Cellars is such that it
cannot be an accident." Defendants respond that they did not copy the Best Cellars
store, that they were unaware of the Best Cellars stores when they developed the
marketing strategy and interior design for Bacchus, and that plaintiff has not
presented evidence demonstrating that "defendants had ever seen or heard of Best
Cellars or copied any aspect of Best Cellar's purported trade dress." Plaintiff claims,
in essence, that fundamental elements of the marketing idea and trade dress that
took wine industry professionals over a year to develop could not possibly have been
independently devised by wine neophytes in less than half that time.

                                          DISCUSSION
. . . . II. Trade Dress Infringement

        The principal claim in the complaint charges trade dress infringement under
the Lanham Act. Trade dress "encompasses the design and appearance of the
product together with all the elements making up the overall image that serves to
identify the product presented to the consumer." Fun-Damental Too, Ltd. v. Gemmy
Indus. Corp., 111 F.3d 993, 999 (2d Cir.1997), citing Jeffrey Milstein, Inc. v. Greger,
Lawlor, Roth, Inc., 58 F.3d 27, 31 (2d Cir.1995). See also Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v.
Samara Bros., Inc., 529 U.S. 205, 209 (2000) (trade dress "constitutes a `symbol' or
`device' for purposes of' Lanham Act § 43(a)"). The legal principles governing the
protection of unregistered trade dress are very similar to the principles governing
other registered and unregistered marks. . . .

        . . . .[T]he Lanham Act is not intended to enable monopolistic use of a
commercial idea, but rather aims to guard against confusion in the marketplace that
would harm both buyers and sellers. Indeed, this Circuit has advised district courts
that "[w]hen evaluating [trade dress] claims, courts must not lose sight of the
underlying purpose of the Lanham Act, which is protecting consumers and
manufacturers from deceptive representations of affiliation and origin." Landscape
Forms, Inc. v. Columbia Cascade Co., 113 F.3d 373, 375 (2d Cir.1997). Furthermore,
"the Lanham Act must be construed in the light of a strong federal policy in favor of
vigorously competitive markets." Id. at 379.

        While the Lanham Act protects the "overall image or appearance" created by
a product's design or packaging, the plaintiff must precisely articulate the specific
elements that comprise its distinct trade dress, so that courts can evaluate claims of
infringement and fashion relief that is appropriately tailored to the distinctive
combination of elements that merit protection. See Landscape Forms, 113 F.3d at 381
(plaintiffs must provide "a precise expression of the character and scope of the
claimed trade dress"). This articulation requirement also helps to ensure that claims
of trade dress infringement are pitched at an appropriate level of generality, for "just
as copyright law does not protect ideas but only their concrete expression, neither

                                                    103
does trade dress law protect an idea, a concept, or a generalized type of appearance."
Jeffrey Milstein, 58 F.3d at 32.

        A. Distinctiveness of Best Cellars' Trade Dress
        The standard for assessing the "distinctiveness" of a product's trade dress
depends on the type of trade dress for which protection is sought. The trade dress
category has grown to include not simply the literal "dressing" or "packaging" of a
product, but also in some instances the design or configuration of the product itself.
To establish a claim for product packaging trade dress infringement under Lanham
Act § 43(a), the plaintiff must demonstrate (1) "that its trade dress is either
inherently distinctive or that it has acquired distinctiveness through a secondary
meaning, [although] an otherwise inherently distinctive trade dress is entitled to
protection only if it is also nonfunctional" and (2) "that there is a likelihood of
confusion between defendant's trade dress and plaintiff's." Fun-Damental Too, 111
F.3d at 999, citing Two Pesos, Inc. v. Taco Cabana, Inc., 505 U.S. 763, 769-70 (1992).
See 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a)(3). In contrast, trade dress based on product design "is not
inherently distinctive," since "almost invariably even the most unusual of product
designs ... is intended not to identify the source, but to render the product itself
more useful or more appealing," or in sum, for "purposes other than source
identification." In product design trade dress cases, therefore, the plaintiff must
show (1) that its trade dress has "acquired" distinctiveness in the form of "secondary
meaning" and (2) the likelihood of confusion. See id.
        Unlike more traditional trade dress cases that concern product packaging
(like water bottles, see Nora Beverages, Inc. v. Perrier Group of America, Inc., 269 F.3d
114 (2d Cir.2001)) or product designs (like children's clothing, see Samara Bros., 529
U.S. at 213), this case concerns the interior decor of a retail establishment where
customers purchase other products. In this, the case is similar to Two Pesos, which
concerned the interior decor of Mexican-themed restaurants. See Two Pesos, 505
U.S. at 764-65 n. 1 (noting that trade dress "may include features such as size,
shape, color or color combinations, texture, graphics, or even particular sales
techniques" (citations and internal quotation marks omitted)). As the Supreme
Court explained, the interior decor category fits awkwardly into the classifications of
trade dress law, constituting either product packaging or a "tertium quid" akin to
product packaging. Samara Bros., 529 U.S. at 215. Interior decor is thus clearly not
product design. Accordingly, it is appropriate to analyze the Best Cellars' interior
decor trade dress under the product packaging standard for inherent distinctiveness
set forth in this Circuit by Judge Friendly in Abercrombie & Fitch Co. v. Hunting
World, Inc., 537 F.2d 4, 9 (2d Cir.1976). Indeed, in a case similar to this one, Judge
Sweet found on a motion for a preliminary injunction that Best Cellars' trade dress
is inherently distinctive under the Abercrombie test and thus protectable. See Best
Cellars, Inc. v. Grape Finds at Dupont, Inc., 90 F.Supp.2d 431, 451-52 (S.D.N.Y.2000).

                                                    104
For the reasons set forth below, this Court agrees with that conclusion based on the
facts presented in this case.

        The trade dress for which Best Cellars claims protection is the total effect of
the interior design of its store, which it describes as: (1) eight words differentiating
taste categories; (2) eight colors differentiating taste categories; (3) eight computer
manipulated images differentiating taste categories; (4) taste categories set above
display fixtures by order of weight; (5) single display bottles set on stainless-steel wire
pedestals; (6) square 4"x4" cards with verbal descriptions of each wine ("shelf
talkers") with text arranged by template; (7) shelf talkers positioned at eye level,
below each display bottle; (8) bottles vertically aligned in rows of nine; (9) storage
cabinets located beneath vertically aligned bottled; (10) materials palette consisting
of light wood and stainless steel; (11) mixture of vertical racks and open shelving
display fixtures; (12) no fixed aisles; (13) bottles down and back-lit; and (14) limited
selection (approximately 100) of relatively inexpensive wine. Defendants contend
that certain of these elements are functional (such as arranging wines by taste
category, color coding categories, presenting categories under a sign, posting index-
card descriptions of each wine, stocking a limited number of wines, storing wine in
cabinets beneath wine racks and the absence of fixed aisles), and that other elements
are of such widespread use in wine stores that they are generic (such as storing wine
bottles horizontally in racks, using a single bottle on display, and placing
informational point-of-sale cards at a uniform height). In sum, the defendants claim
that the plaintiff's trade dress is not entitled to trade dress protection as a matter of
law.

        Under the Abercrombie test,

        trade dress is classified on a spectrum of increasing distinctiveness as generic,
        descriptive, suggestive, or arbitrary/ fanciful. Suggestive and arbitrary or
        fanciful trade dress are deemed inherently distinctive and thus always satisfy
        the first prong of the test for protection. A descriptive trade dress may be
        found inherently distinctive if the plaintiff establishes that its mark has
        acquired secondary meaning giving it distinctiveness to the consumer. A
        generic trade dress receives no Lanham Act protection.

Fun-Damental Too, 111 F.3d at 1000 (citing Two Pesos, 505 U.S. at 768-69). While it is
important that the party claiming protection articulate with specificity the elements
comprising its trade dress for purposes of the distinctiveness inquiry, as Best Cellars
has done here, it would be analytically unsound to parse each individual element to
determine where it falls on the Abercrombie spectrum. Rather, "although each
element of a trade dress individually might not be inherently distinctive, it is the
combination of elements that should be the focus of the distinctiveness inquiry.

                                                    105
Thus, if the overall dress is arbitrary, fanciful, or suggestive, it is distinctive despite
its incorporation of generic [or functional] elements." Jeffrey Milstein, 58 F.3d at 32.
Because in the context of trade dress the whole can be greater than, or at least
different from, the sum of its parts, it is necessary to consider the combined
articulated elements of Best Cellars' trade dress to determine whether as an
ensemble they form a distinctive presentation to consumers.

        Based on the evidence presented to the Court on the cross-motions for
summary judgment, and resolving any factual ambiguities in favor of defendants, it
is clear that plaintiff has a protectable interior decor trade dress. While certain
articulated elements are well-designed and thus "functional" for the purpose of
retail wine sales, such as posting point-of-sale cards at a height where they can be
easily read by the average height shopper, or storing wines in a cabinet positioned so
low on a wall that using that space for display would be impractical, that does not
mean that those elements are to be excluded from a specifically articulated trade
dress. By the same logic, simply because certain elements are used in other wine
shops, such as storing wine horizontally in racks or presenting one display bottle per
wine does not mean that those elements must be removed from the overall
impression because they are "generic."

        While there may be a certain ergonomic or marketing logic to certain
elements of the decor, defendants have not met their burden of showing that those
elements are "functional" in that they are "essential to effective competition in a
particular market," Landscape Forms, 70 F.3d at 253, or "essential to the use or
purpose of the article" (in this case, the store), Qualitex Co. v. Jacobson Prods. Co., Inc.,
514 U.S. 159, 165 (1995) (quoting Inwood Laboratories, Inc. v. Ives Laboratories, Inc.,
456 U.S. 844, 850 (1982)).

        Best Cellars, on the other hand, has met its burden of establishing the
inherent distinctiveness of its trade dress taken as a whole because the elements, as
combined, make up a distinct and arbitrary total visual image to consumers.
Defendants in fact do not seriously dispute that there is a distinctive look to Best
Cellars. They do not describe Best Cellars as a generic, unremarkable retail shop;
rather, they echo some of plaintiff's descriptions of the decor as quite specific, for
example, by describing the Best Cellars stores as exhibiting a clean, crisp modern
design characterized by wood and steel. It is thus essentially undisputed that certain
elements of the Best Cellars trade dress are arbitrary and/or uncommon for wine
shops, such as the use of wood and steel, and the law does not require that every
element of trade dress be arbitrary. See Jeffrey Milstein, 58 F.3d at 32.

        The Grape Finds decision intentionally does not comment on precisely which
of the 14 factors enumerated by plaintiff comprise the Best Cellars trade dress, and
instead describes what the court found to be

                                                    106
        the essence of the look [consisting of] color-coded, iconographic wall signs
        identifying eight taste categories above the single display bottles on stainless-
        steel wire pedestals which run along the store perimeter, above identical
        color-coded textually formatted square shelf-talkers, above vertical arrays of
        nine glowing bottles stacked horizontally, above a strip of cabinets or drawers
        which extend to the floor.

90 F.Supp.2d at 452. It is the combination of elements that defines the protectable
trade dress, because it is the combination that a customer would perceive upon
entering the store. This emphasis on the ensemble effect cuts both ways for the
plaintiff in this case, as indeed it does for any plaintiff in a trade dress infringement
case. Because of the vast array of permutations of elements available to sellers to
create their specific trade dress, "a product's trade dress typically will be arbitrary or
fanciful and meet the inherently distinctive requirement for § 43(a) protection."
Fun-Damental Too, 111 F.3d at 1000. However, as the Grape Finds court noted, while
the emphasis on specific combinations and total visual impact makes it relatively
easy for a plaintiff to meet the inherent distinctiveness aspect of the trade dress
infringement test, the same emphasis makes it correspondingly difficult for a
plaintiff to prove likelihood of confusion. That is because defendant-competitors
who have some similar elements as well as noteworthy dissimilar elements in their
trade dress may be able to show that the specific combination of elements that they
use also constitutes protectable trade dress, and that consumers are unlikely to
confuse the two products, or in this case, the two stores.

        In describing its own distinctive trade dress, Best Cellars frequently slides
between different theories, perhaps attempting (consciously or otherwise) to evade
this dilemma. Thus, plaintiff's strongest (and controlling) argument for
distinctiveness incorporates all fourteen of the features discussed above in
describing the total overall look of the wine shop, and Best Cellars adopts this
approach in arguing that its trade dress is distinctive. But when emphasizing the
publicity and praise it has received for its design, or arguing that defendants have
infringed their trade dress, plaintiff frequently speaks as if the "wall of wine" alone,
or even the general "revolutionary" concept of selling wines by taste, constitutes the
trade dress it claims was appropriated by defendants. This will not do; the trade
dress is the overall look of the store, consisting of a cumulation of interacting
elements, and defendants do not infringe by appropriating the marketing concept,
or any particular element of plaintiff's design, unless the overall dress is sufficiently
similar to generate likely consumer confusion. See Sports Traveler, Inc. v. Advance
Magazine Publishers, Inc., 25 F.Supp.2d 154, 163 (S.D.N.Y.1998) (citing Jeffrey
Milstein, 58 F.3d at 32-33, for the proposition that uniqueness of a concept is not
protected trade dress).

                                                    107
        It is thus worth noting that while some elements of Best Cellars' trade dress
are related to the marketing theme of selling wine by taste, those elements are not
dispositive. While categorization of wine by taste is relevant to plaintiff's trade dress
to the extent it impacts the store's interior design, that element standing alone is
not protected, and plaintiff cannot prevent other sellers from categorizing wine by
taste either in their general marketing scheme or in their interior design. For this
reason, when Judge Sweet granted the preliminary injunction against the defendant
in Grape Finds, he nevertheless permitted the defendant in that case to continue
organizing wine into eight taste categories in its store. See 90 F.Supp.2d at 458.

         Under the Two Pesos rule, if a trade dress is found to be inherently
distinctive, it is not necessary to prove secondary meaning. Because Best Cellars'
interior decor is inherently distinctive and thus protectable trade dress, it is not
necessary to consider the question of secondary meaning. Therefore, the next stage
of the analysis is to determine whether reasonable minds could disagree about
whether there is a probability of consumer confusion. . . .

                                              Notes

        Product lines. Did the court get it right in Best Cellars? What did you make of
its observation that the kind of dress claimed meant that the plaintiff's
demonstration of likelihood of confusion would be more difficult? Is this consistent
with the Supreme Court's concerns in Wal-Mart? Would your conclusion be
different if you knew how the court resolved the likelihood of confusion claim on
summary judgment? (Here, the court held that there were genuine issues of material
fact, precluding summary judgment on confusion.).

        Trademark claims over a product line's "look and feel" raise concerns of
overreach, and several courts have stated that plaintiffs cannot be so general in their
claims, though others allow claims to the "overall appearance" of a product. Jason
Scott Collection, Inc. v. Trendily Furniture, LLC, 68 F.4th 1203, 1213 (9th Cir.
2023) Some cases find product design even where the dress is claimed over
mechanisms of product presentation. Yankee Candle Co., Inc. v. Bridgewater
Candle Co., LLC, 259 F.3d 25 (1st Cir. 2001) (finding that a product line of
decorative candles and its related catalog layout is product design).

        Ornamentation or design? May a claimed feature be both ornamental and part
of the product's design? Yes. See, e.g., In re Slokevage, 441 F.3d 957 (Fed. Cir. 2006)
(treating foldable flaps at pants pocket as product design). But perhaps at some
point the feature starts to be perceived more as a label or as product packaging than
a part of product design. Given Wal-Mart, a good deal rides on the question, as the
classification determines whether secondary meaning is required for trademark

                                                    108
protection. For an exploration of the issue, see Mark A. Lemley & Mark P.
McKenna, Trademark Spaces and Trademark Law's Secret Step Zero, 75 Stan. L. Rev. 1,
6-7 (2023) (arguing that courts and the USPTO "frequently treat the location of a
claimed feature on the product or package as an important determinant of
trademark status.").

Problems

        1. Chippendales provides "adult entertainment services." Chippendales
performers perform without shirts but wear tuxedo-wrist cuffs and a bowtie collar.
They feature these outfits, such as they are, in advertising and refer to them as the
"Cuffs & Collar." They would like to protect the clothing as trade dress as shown
below (dashed lines indicate unclaimed matter). Will they succeed?

        2. Timberland boots look like this:

        Timberland seeks to register a trade dress with the following described
features (as later recited by a court):

        (1) the external appearance of a tube-shaped ankle collar on the outside
        surface of the product running from one eyelet panel to the other eyelet
        panel around the sides and rear of the boot and protruding over the upper
        side and rear panels of the boot (material on the inside of the ankle collar
        not being claimed);

                                                    109
        (2) outsoles having two color tones divided horizontally and extending
        around the circumference of the boot, and visibly showing inverted tooth
        shaped cuts on each side of the heel of the outsole and around the sides and
        front of the forward portion of the outsole;
        (3) an hourglass-shaped rear heel panel, defined by four vertical stitching
        lines from the top of the outsole to the rear collar;
        (4) quad-stitching forming an inverted "U" shape around the vamp line in
        front of the boot at the bottom of the tongue and curving around to the left
        and right sides and ending at the cinched portion of the hourglass stitching
        of the rear heel panel; and
        (5) eyelets shaped hexagonally on the exterior-facing outside surface.
        The double row stitching around the rear and side ankle collar, the single
        stitching around the upper two eyelets on each side, the single stitching
        along the upper perimeter of the shaft in front of the eyelets and the boot
        tongue, the appearance of the eyelets on the boot interior, the top of the
        ankle collar, the bottom, outer most surface of the outsole, and the
        uppermost surface of the outsole connecting to the boot around the
        perimeter, all of which are depicted in broken or dotted lines, are not being
        claimed as part of the mark and serve only to show the position or placement
        of the mark.

6. Functionality

        We have been discussing functionality--the principle that trademark law
cannot protect product features from copying--for some time now. It is a recurring
policy concern in determining what matter is eligible for trademark. The traditional
rationale for the functionality bar is utilitarian. The doctrine protects competition
by allowing competitors in the market to copy useful product designs/features and
therefore drive down prices and increase consumer options.

        The doctrine also serves a boundary policing role between IP regimes.
Federal law provides the option for inventors to seek patents for their inventions.
But while the patent term is limited (20 years from the date the patent is filed),
there is no trademark term--a trademark may be valid indefinitely. Forbidding
trademarks over functional matter prevents trademark from serving as a backdoor
patent. Note that this means that even if a functional feature has acquired
secondary meaning, a court should still not permit its protection as a trademark

        The Lanham Act contains multiple provisions driving home this basic point.
Section 2(e)(5) (15 U.S.C. § 1052(e)(5)) provides that an otherwise distinctive mark
will be refused registration if it "comprises any matter that, as a whole, is
functional." "Incontestable" trademark registrations, discussed in greater detail in a
later chapter, are immune from challenge on certain grounds. Section 33(b) (15
U.S.C. § 1115(b)) nonetheless provides that incontestable marks remain subject to
the "defense or defect" that the mark is functional. And section 43(a) (15 U.S.C. §
1125(a)(3)) states:

        In a civil action for trade dress infringement under this chapter for trade
        dress not registered on the principal register, the person who asserts trade
        dress protection has the burden of proving that the matter sought to be
        protected is not functional.

        Although the functionality principle has a long pedigree, see, e.g., Pope
Automatic Merchandising Co. v. McCrum-Howell Co., 191 F. 979 (7th Cir. 1911),
these statutory provisions are only a recent addition to the Lanham Act. Until
Congress added them in the late 1990s, courts still applied the doctrine,
notwithstanding its absence from the statute. They did so partly on the assumption
that Congress would not upend so traditional a principle without explicit mention.
See, e.g., Wilhelm Pudenz GmbH v. Littlefuse, Inc., 177 F.3d 1204 (11th Cir. 1999).
What does this tell you about statutory interpretation? Is this judicial activism? Or
would it have been judicial activism not to continue applying the doctrine? Or is the
term meaningless here?

                                                    111
        Defining functionality. The functionality principle seems easy to state, but it is
challenging to apply. As we have seen in discussing Two Pesos, identifying the
"product" is not always simple. Moreover, even seemingly functional product
features are not necessarily covered by the doctrine.

        For example, is a spray bottle's liquid reservoir functional by definition?
After all, the bottle would not function without it. But suppose the reservoir is in
the shape of, say, a duck. That design modification does nothing to enhance the
device's utilitarian functionality (what about its aesthetic value?). Indeed, it seems to
hamper it. The functionality doctrine does not seem intended to target such a
design flourish. And what about features that are wholly aesthetic? Should they be
eligible for trademark or do the principles behind the functionality doctrine argue
in favor of their exclusion? Or would so broad a view make obtaining an attractive
trademark impossible? We will return to the question of "aesthetic" functionality in
the next reading and focus on "utilitarian" functionality for now.

                    TrafFix Devices, Inc. v. Marketing Displays, Inc.
                                       532 U.S. 23 (2001)

Justice KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court.
        Temporary road signs with warnings like "Road Work Ahead" or "Left

Shoulder Closed" must withstand strong gusts of wind. An inventor named Robert
Sarkisian obtained two utility patents for a mechanism built upon two springs (the
dual-spring design) to keep these and other outdoor signs upright despite adverse
wind conditions. The holder of the now-expired Sarkisian patents, respondent
Marketing Displays, Inc. (MDI), established a successful business in the
manufacture and sale of sign stands incorporating the patented feature. MDI's
stands for road signs were recognizable to buyers and users (it says) because the dual-
spring design was visible near the base of the sign.

        This litigation followed after the patents expired and a competitor, TrafFix
Devices, Inc., sold sign stands with a visible spring mechanism that looked like
MDI's. MDI and TrafFix products looked alike because they were. When TrafFix
started in business, it sent an MDI product abroad to have it reverse engineered,
that is to say copied. Complicating matters, TrafFix marketed its sign stands under a
name similar to MDI's. MDI used the name "WindMaster," while TrafFix, its new
competitor, used "WindBuster."

        MDI brought suit . . . against TrafFix for trademark infringement (based on
the similar names), trade dress infringement (based on the copied dual-spring
design), and unfair competition. TrafFix counterclaimed on antitrust theories. After
the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan considered
cross-motions for summary judgment, MDI prevailed on its trademark claim for the

                                                    112
confusing similarity of names and was held not liable on the antitrust counterclaim;
and those two rulings, affirmed by the Court of Appeals, are not before us.

                                                  I
        We are concerned with the trade dress question. The District Court ruled
against MDI on its trade dress claim. After determining that the one element of
MDI's trade dress at issue was the dual-spring design, it held that "no reasonable
trier of fact could determine that MDI has established secondary meaning" in its
alleged trade dress. In other words, consumers did not associate the look of the
dual-spring design with MDI. As a second, independent reason to grant summary
judgment in favor of TrafFix, the District Court determined the dual-spring design
was functional. On this rationale secondary meaning is irrelevant because there can
be no trade dress protection in any event. In ruling on the functional aspect of the
design, the District Court noted that Sixth Circuit precedent indicated that the
burden was on MDI to prove that its trade dress was nonfunctional, and not on
TrafFix to show that it was functional (a rule since adopted by Congress, see 15
U.S.C. § 1125(a)(3) (1994 ed., Supp. V)), and then went on to consider MDI's
arguments that the dual-spring design was subject to trade dress protection. Finding
none of MDI's contentions persuasive, the District Court concluded MDI had not
"proffered sufficient evidence which would enable a reasonable trier of fact to find
that MDI's vertical dual-spring design is non-functional." Summary judgment was
entered against MDI on its trade dress claims.
        The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed the trade dress ruling.
The Court of Appeals held the District Court had erred in ruling MDI failed to
show a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether it had secondary meaning
in its alleged trade dress and had erred further in determining that MDI could not
prevail in any event because the alleged trade dress was in fact a functional product
configuration. The Court of Appeals suggested the District Court committed legal
error by looking only to the dual-spring design when evaluating MDI's trade dress.
Basic to its reasoning was the Court of Appeals' observation that it took "little
imagination to conceive of a hidden dual-spring mechanism or a tri or quad-spring
mechanism that might avoid infringing [MDI's] trade dress." The Court of Appeals
explained that "[i]f TrafFix or another competitor chooses to use [MDI's] dual-
spring design, then it will have to find some other way to set its sign apart to avoid
infringing [MDI's] trade dress." It was not sufficient, according to the Court of
Appeals, that allowing exclusive use of a particular feature such as the dual-spring
design in the guise of trade dress would "hinde[r] competition somewhat." Rather,
"[e]xclusive use of a feature must `put competitors at a significant non-reputation-
related disadvantage' before trade dress protection is denied on functionality
grounds." In its criticism of the District Court's ruling on the trade dress question,
the Court of Appeals took note of a split among Courts of Appeals in various other

                                                    113
Circuits on the issue whether the existence of an expired utility patent forecloses the
possibility of the patentee's claiming trade dress protection in the product's
design. . . .

                                                 II
        It is well established that trade dress can be protected under federal law. The
design or packaging of a product may acquire a distinctiveness which serves to
identify the product with its manufacturer or source; and a design or package which
acquires this secondary meaning, assuming other requisites are met, is a trade dress
which may not be used in a manner likely to cause confusion as to the origin,
sponsorship, or approval of the goods. In these respects protection for trade dress
exists to promote competition. As we explained just last Term, see Wal-Mart Stores,
Inc. v. Samara Brothers, Inc., 529 U.S. 205 (2000), various Courts of Appeals have
allowed claims of trade dress infringement relying on the general provision of the
Lanham Act which provides a cause of action to one who is injured when a person
uses "any word, term name, symbol, or device, or any combination thereof ... which
is likely to cause confusion ... as to the origin, sponsorship, or approval of his or her
goods." 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a)(1)(A). Congress confirmed this statutory protection for
trade dress by amending the Lanham Act to recognize the concept. Title 15 U.S.C.
§ 1125(a)(3) (1994 ed., Supp. V) provides: "In a civil action for trade dress
infringement under this chapter for trade dress not registered on the principal
register, the person who asserts trade dress protection has the burden of proving
that the matter sought to be protected is not functional." This burden of proof gives
force to the well-established rule that trade dress protection may not be claimed for
product features that are functional. And in Wal-Mart, we were careful to caution
against misuse or overextension of trade dress. We noted that "product design
almost invariably serves purposes other than source identification."
        Trade dress protection must subsist with the recognition that in many
instances there is no prohibition against copying goods and products. In general,
unless an intellectual property right such as a patent or copyright protects an item, it
will be subject to copying. As the Court has explained, copying is not always
discouraged or disfavored by the laws which preserve our competitive economy.
Bonito Boats, Inc. v. Thunder Craft Boats, Inc., 489 U.S. 141, 160 (1989). Allowing
competitors to copy will have salutary effects in many instances. "Reverse
engineering of chemical and mechanical articles in the public domain often leads to
significant advances in technology." Ibid.
        The principal question in this case is the effect of an expired patent on a
claim of trade dress infringement. A prior patent, we conclude, has vital significance
in resolving the trade dress claim. A utility patent is strong evidence that the
features therein claimed are functional. If trade dress protection is sought for those
features the strong evidence of functionality based on the previous patent adds great

                                                    114
weight to the statutory presumption that features are deemed functional until
proved otherwise by the party seeking trade dress protection. Where the expired
patent claimed the features in question, one who seeks to establish trade dress
protection must carry the heavy burden of showing that the feature is not
functional, for instance by showing that it is merely an ornamental, incidental, or
arbitrary aspect of the device.

        In the case before us, the central advance claimed in the expired utility
patents (the Sarkisian patents) is the dual-spring design; and the dual-spring design
is the essential feature of the trade dress MDI now seeks to establish and to protect.
The rule we have explained bars the trade dress claim, for MDI did not, and cannot,
carry the burden of overcoming the strong evidentiary inference of functionality
based on the disclosure of the dual-spring design in the claims of the expired
patents.

        The dual springs shown in the Sarkisian patents were well apart (at either
end of a frame for holding a rectangular sign when one full side is the base) while
the dual springs at issue here are close together (in a frame designed to hold a sign
by one of its corners). As the District Court recognized, this makes little difference.
The point is that the springs are necessary to the operation of the device. The fact
that the springs in this very different-looking device fall within the claims of the
patents is illustrated by MDI's own position in earlier litigation. In the late 1970's,
MDI engaged in a long-running intellectual property battle with a company known
as Winn-Proof. Although the precise claims of the Sarkisian patents cover sign
stands with springs "spaced apart," U.S. Patent No. 3,646,696, col. 4; U.S. Patent
No. 3,662,482, col. 4, the Winn-Proof sign stands (with springs much like the sign
stands at issue here) were found to infringe the patents by the United States District
Court for the District of Oregon, and the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit
affirmed the judgment. Sarkisian v. Winn-Proof Corp., 697 F.2d 1313 (1983).
Although the Winn-Proof traffic sign stand (with dual springs close together) did
not appear, then, to infringe the literal terms of the patent claims (which called for
"spaced apart" springs), the Winn-Proof sign stand was found to infringe the patents
under the doctrine of equivalents, which allows a finding of patent infringement
even when the accused product does not fall within the literal terms of the claims.
Id., at 1321-1322; see generally Warner-Jenkinson Co. v. Hilton Davis Chemical Co., 520
U.S. 17 (1997). In light of this past ruling--a ruling procured at MDI's own
insistence--it must be concluded the products here at issue would have been covered
by the claims of the expired patents.

        The rationale for the rule that the disclosure of a feature in the claims of a
utility patent constitutes strong evidence of functionality is well illustrated in this
case. The dual-spring design serves the important purpose of keeping the sign
upright even in heavy wind conditions; and, as confirmed by the statements in the

                                                    115
expired patents, it does so in a unique and useful manner. As the specification of
one of the patents recites, prior art "devices, in practice, will topple under the force
of a strong wind." U.S. Patent No. 3,662,482, col. 1. The dual-spring design allows
sign stands to resist toppling in strong winds. Using a dual-spring design rather than
a single spring achieves important operational advantages. For example, the
specifications of the patents note that the "use of a pair of springs ... as opposed to
the use of a single spring to support the frame structure prevents canting or twisting
of the sign around a vertical axis," and that, if not prevented, twisting "may cause
damage to the spring structure and may result in tipping of the device." U.S. Patent
No. 3,646,696, col. 3. In the course of patent prosecution, it was said that "[t]he use
of a pair of spring connections as opposed to a single spring connection ... forms an
important part of this combination" because it "forc[es] the sign frame to tip along
the longitudinal axis of the elongated ground-engaging members." The dual-spring
design affects the cost of the device as well; it was acknowledged that the device
"could use three springs but this would unnecessarily increase the cost of the
device." These statements made in the patent applications and in the course of
procuring the patents demonstrate the functionality of the design. MDI does not
assert that any of these representations are mistaken or inaccurate, and this is
further strong evidence of the functionality of the dual-spring design.

                                                III
        In finding for MDI on the trade dress issue the Court of Appeals gave
insufficient recognition to the importance of the expired utility patents, and their
evidentiary significance, in establishing the functionality of the device. The error
likely was caused by its misinterpretation of trade dress principles in other respects.
As we have noted, even if there has been no previous utility patent the party
asserting trade dress has the burden to establish the nonfunctionality of alleged
trade dress features. MDI could not meet this burden. Discussing trademarks, we
have said " `[i]n general terms, a product feature is functional,' and cannot serve as a
trademark, `if it is essential to the use or purpose of the article or if it affects the cost
or quality of the article.' " Qualitex, 514 U.S., at 165 (quoting Inwood Laboratories,
Inc. v. Ives Laboratories, Inc., 456 U.S. 844, 850, n. 10 (1982)). Expanding upon the
meaning of this phrase, we have observed that a functional feature is one the
"exclusive use of [which] would put competitors at a significant non-reputation-
related disadvantage." 514 U.S., at 165. The Court of Appeals in the instant case
seemed to interpret this language to mean that a necessary test for functionality is
"whether the particular product configuration is a competitive necessity." 200 F.3d,
at 940. See also Vornado, 58 F.3d, at 1507 ("Functionality, by contrast, has been
defined both by our circuit, and more recently by the Supreme Court, in terms of
competitive need"). This was incorrect as a comprehensive definition. As explained
in Qualitex, supra, and Inwood, supra, a feature is also functional when it is essential

                                                    116
to the use or purpose of the device or when it affects the cost or quality of the
device. The Qualitex decision did not purport to displace this traditional rule.
Instead, it quoted the rule as Inwood had set it forth. It is proper to inquire into a
"significant non-reputation-related disadvantage" in cases of esthetic functionality,
the question involved in Qualitex. Where the design is functional under the Inwood
formulation there is no need to proceed further to consider if there is a competitive
necessity for the feature. In Qualitex, by contrast, esthetic functionality was the
central question, there having been no indication that the green-gold color of the
laundry press pad had any bearing on the use or purpose of the product or its cost
or quality.

        The Court has allowed trade dress protection to certain product features that
are inherently distinctive. Two Pesos, 505 U.S., at 774. In Two Pesos, however, the
Court at the outset made the explicit analytic assumption that the trade dress
features in question (decorations and other features to evoke a Mexican theme in a
restaurant) were not functional. Id., at 767, n. 6. The trade dress in those cases did
not bar competitors from copying functional product design features. In the instant
case, beyond serving the purpose of informing consumers that the sign stands are
made by MDI (assuming it does so), the dual-spring design provides a unique and
useful mechanism to resist the force of the wind. Functionality having been
established, whether MDI's dual-spring design has acquired secondary meaning
need not be considered.

        There is no need, furthermore, to engage, as did the Court of Appeals, in
speculation about other design possibilities, such as using three or four springs
which might serve the same purpose. Here, the functionality of the spring design
means that competitors need not explore whether other spring juxtapositions might
be used. The dual-spring design is not an arbitrary flourish in the configuration of
MDI's product; it is the reason the device works. Other designs need not be
attempted.

        Because the dual-spring design is functional, it is unnecessary for competitors
to explore designs to hide the springs, say, by using a box or framework to cover
them, as suggested by the Court of Appeals. The dual-spring design assures the user
the device will work. If buyers are assured the product serves its purpose by seeing
the operative mechanism that in itself serves an important market need. It would be
at cross-purposes to those objectives, and something of a paradox, were we to
require the manufacturer to conceal the very item the user seeks.

        In a case where a manufacturer seeks to protect arbitrary, incidental, or
ornamental aspects of features of a product found in the patent claims, such as
arbitrary curves in the legs or an ornamental pattern painted on the springs, a
different result might obtain. There the manufacturer could perhaps prove that
those aspects do not serve a purpose within the terms of the utility patent. The

                                                    117
inquiry into whether such features, asserted to be trade dress, are functional by
reason of their inclusion in the claims of an expired utility patent could be aided by
going beyond the claims and examining the patent and its prosecution history to see
if the feature in question is shown as a useful part of the invention. No such claim
is made here, however. MDI in essence seeks protection for the dual-spring design
alone. The asserted trade dress consists simply of the dual-spring design, four legs, a
base, an upright, and a sign. MDI has pointed to nothing arbitrary about the
components of its device or the way they are assembled. The Lanham Act does not
exist to reward manufacturers for their innovation in creating a particular device;
that is the purpose of the patent law and its period of exclusivity. The Lanham Act,
furthermore, does not protect trade dress in a functional design simply because an
investment has been made to encourage the public to associate a particular
functional feature with a single manufacturer or seller. The Court of Appeals erred
in viewing MDI as possessing the right to exclude competitors from using a design
identical to MDI's and to require those competitors to adopt a different design
simply to avoid copying it. MDI cannot gain the exclusive right to produce sign
stands using the dual-spring design by asserting that consumers associate it with the
look of the invention itself. Whether a utility patent has expired or there has been
no utility patent at all, a product design which has a particular appearance may be
functional because it is "essential to the use or purpose of the article" or "affects the
cost or quality of the article." Inwood, 456 U.S., at 850, n. 10.

        TrafFix and some of its amici argue that the Patent Clause of the
Constitution, Art. I, § 8, cl. 8, of its own force, prohibits the holder of an expired
utility patent from claiming trade dress protection. We need not resolve this
question. If, despite the rule that functional features may not be the subject of trade
dress protection, a case arises in which trade dress becomes the practical equivalent
of an expired utility patent, that will be time enough to consider the matter. The
judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further
proceedings consistent with this opinion.

        It is so ordered.

                                              Notes

        Bigger and better things. The prevailing party's counsel in TrafFix was none
other than Chief Justice John Roberts, then in private practice.

        Design patents. TrafFix focuses on the separation between utility patents and
trademarks. What about design patents? They are supposed to be awarded only to
ornamental designs. 35 U.S.C. § 171. Does that mean that they negate a

                                                    118
functionality challenge? No. 1 MCCARTHY § 7:93 ("[W]hile a design patent is some
evidence of nonfunctionality, alone it is not sufficient without other evidence.").

        Two functionality tests. The Court gives us two functionality tests, one
described as suited for questions of aesthetic functionality. Do they help? Does the
"traditional" rule solve the problem of the duck-shaped spray bottle? Would we say
that the liquid reservoir, though duck-shaped, is still "essential to the use" of the
product? Or is the unusual shape "an arbitrary flourish in the configuration of" the
bottle?

        If that sounds like a simple problem, consider these two competing grease
pumps, used for the lubricating system of trucks:

        The one on the right copied the design of the one on the left, which has
been in the business for quite a long time. In an infringement suit, do you think the
trade dress would be unprotected as functional?

                                 730 F.3d 494 (6th Cir. 2013)

RONALD LEE GILMAN, Circuit Judge.
        The key issue in this case is whether a company can use trade-dress law to

protect its functional product design from competition with a "copycat" design
made by another company where there is no reasonable likelihood that consumers
would confuse the two companies' products as emanating from a single source. We
hold that it cannot. In so holding, we reaffirm that trademark law is designed to

                                                    119
promote brand recognition, not to insulate product manufacturers from lawful
competition. . . .

        This case, like many trademark cases before it, is a contest between an
oldtimer and a newcomer. Their battle is over a relatively obscure product--the
grease pump used in an automated lubrication system (ALS) for commercial trucks.
An ALS, as the name implies, is a system for delivering a controlled amount of
lubricant to different parts of a machine (in this case a commercial truck) while the
machine is in operation. Automated lubrication saves time, increases operational
efficiency, and minimizes corrosion by obviating the need for frequent manual
lubrication. The primary component of an ALS is a grease pump that forces grease
through injectors and hoses to targeted areas at timed intervals.

        Groeneveld is the American branch of a Dutch company that has been in
the ALS business for over 40 years. It began marketing the grease pump at issue in
the present case--designated by Groeneveld as its EP0 pump--in the 1980s. The
Groeneveld family of companies employs thousands of people and has a well-
established international presence.

        Lubecore, by contrast, is the new kid on the block. . . . [Groeneveld alleged
that Lubecore marketed its pump with the intent to confuse consumers. Its trade
dress claim went to the jury, which ruled in Groenveld's favor, awarding $1,225,000
in damages.]

        Groeneveld does not dispute that its grease pump is a functional device
designed to automatically lubricate commercial trucks. Nor does Groeneveld
attempt to protect the individual component parts of its pump. Rather, the
question is whether the "overall shape" of the grease pump (such shape being the
trade dress claimed by Groeneveld) "is essential to the use or purpose of the article
or ... affects the cost or quality of the article." See Inwood Labs., 456 U.S. at 850 n.
10.

         Groeneveld's pump, in its overall shape, consists of a black base topped by a
clear reservoir. The base is made of cast aluminum and contains the pump
mechanism, which is connected by wires and hoses to the rest of the ALS; the
reservoir is made of plastic and holds the grease. Both components clearly serve a
function essential to the product's operation.

        Trial testimony by two Groeneveld witnesses, Willem van der Hulst and
Cornelius Wapenaar, makes clear that not only the basic manufacture of the grease
pump's components, but also their size and shape, are closely linked to the grease-
pumping function. The shape of the base is functionally determined because it
minimizes the amount of material needed in construction. And the volume of the
reservoir is functionally dictated by the amount of grease that the vehicle needs
during each servicing interval. The use of clear material in the reservoir is also
functional because it allows one to easily see how much grease is left in the pump.

                                                    120
        Because the volume of the reservoir (like that of any cylinder) is the algebraic
product of its surface area times its height, and because the surface area and the
volume of the reservoir are both functionally determined (the former by the
necessity of fitting into the base and the latter by the necessity of holding a
predetermined amount of grease), the height is also functionally determined. The
overall design of the grease pump is therefore functional. As the magistrate judge
found when denying Groeneveld's motion for a preliminary injunction, "all the
elements of Groeneveld's pump are there for some practical benefit or reason....
Groeneveld has not presented its pump as in any way the equivalent of an
automotive tail fin--a purely ornamental feature that contributes no demonstrable
benefit to the operation or efficiency of the designed product."

        Because Groeneveld presented no evidence showing that the individual
components of its grease pump or their overall configuration are nonfunctional, it
failed to carry its burden of creating a triable issue of fact with respect to
nonfunctionality.

        Groeneveld nonetheless argues that the design of its pump is nonfunctional
because the particular design is not necessary for effective competition in the ALS
business. This is shown, according to Groeneveld's opening brief, by the fact that
none of Groeneveld's competitors other than Lubecore makes a similar-looking
pump . . . .

        We reject Groeneveld's argument because adopting it would result in a
reversion to the very standard that the Supreme Court unanimously rejected in
TrafFix Devices, Inc. v. Marketing Displays, Inc. . . .

        TrafFix Devices makes clear that Groeneveld's argument about the availability
of alternative grease-pump designs is misguided. The issue is not whether Lubecore
could have designed a grease pump with a different appearance; the issue is whether
Groeneveld's design "is essential to the use or purpose of the article or if it affects
the cost or quality of the article." Inwood Labs., 456 U.S. at 850 n. 10. In other
words, the question is whether the overall shape of Groeneveld's grease pump was
substantially influenced by functional imperatives or preferences. We accordingly
reject Groeneveld's invitation to drift back into the error of inquiring about
possible alternative designs.

        Groeneveld next points to the testimony of Willem van der Hulst, its Vice
President of Design and Production, who was involved in designing the EP0 grease
pump. Van der Hulst testified that Groeneveld did not "have to make its pump
look this way on the inside because of the way it works on the outside." For the
reasons stated above, this testimony is insufficient to create a triable issue of fact
under TrafFix Devices because it improperly focuses on the possibility of alternative
designs.

                                                    121
        Moreover, van der Hulst's testimony was entirely conclusory--he simply
asserted that Groeneveld was not limited to any particular design, but he did not
explain why the chosen design was nonfunctional, and certainly did not speak with
any particularity about the functional considerations that, as outlined above,
apparently dictated the pump's design. The same goes for van der Hulst's bald
assertion that the pump's design did not "affect the way the thing performs.". . .

        Finally, Groeneveld points to van der Hulst's testimony that the other grease
pumps on the market look "terrible," and that Groeneveld's founder was "different
from the really old-fashioned mechanical people" in that "he had very good choice"
and "like[d] nice things," such as "a nice office, nice cars, nice people." Van der
Hulst also testified that Groeneveld has not switched to alternative grease-pump
designs, even though they might be cheaper, because the current pump is "a very
nice pump" and "[e]verybody knows this pump."

        But these statements fail to meaningfully address the issue of
nonfunctionality. The fact that Mr. Groeneveld has good taste does nothing to
prove that the grease pump's design is nonfunctional. And to the extent that van
der Hulst's testimony was intended to show that less attractive or cheaper grease-
pump designs were also possible, such a showing plainly falls short under TrafFix
Devices because courts should not inquire into alternative designs when the design
at issue is substantially influenced by functional considerations. . . .

        This result is consonant with the public policy underlying the functionality
doctrine, which is to channel the legal protection of useful designs from the realm
of trademark to that of patent. Such channeling ensures that the high public costs
of monopoly are not imposed without an assurance that the design satisfies the
rigorous requirements of patentability, including novelty and nonobviousness, and
is protected for only a limited period of time. . . .

HELENE N. WHITE, Circuit Judge, dissenting.
        . . . . Whether a product feature is functional is a question of fact reviewed

for clear error. . . .
        Under TrafFix, the possibility of alternative designs cannot render a trade

dress non-functional where it is otherwise functional under Inwood. The majority
has morphed this simple principle into a holding that evidence regarding the
possibility of alternative designs is irrelevant to the determination whether a design
is functional. TrafFix does not so hold. . . .

        Applying the Inwood formulation, I disagree with the majority's conclusion
that Groeneveld presented "no evidence" that its pump's overall design is non-
functional. Groeneveld's vice president of design and production, Willem van der
Hulst, agreed that the base optimized the amount of material in the pump for its
internal workings. However, he did not say (as the majority infers) that the irregular

                                                    122
shape of the base was necessitated based on the pump's internal components.
Rather, he testified that the base was not "form fitted" around the internal parts,
and he clarified that it is the weight of aluminum in the base that affects the cost.
Van der Hulst added that the same amount of aluminum, if molded to a different
shape, probably would not affect the cost of the aluminum but could affect "the cost
of production to work the body," i.e., the "machine part" of the device. The
appropriate inference to be drawn from this testimony is that the volume of
aluminum or arrangement of the internal parts could impact the pump's function,
but the irregular shape of the base is not essential to the pump's functioning and
does not affect the cost of the device. As van der Hulst made clear, the pump would
cost the same even with a different shape. Further, although the "inside volume" of
the upper cylinder reservoir is determined by "something other than human design"
because the reservoir volume affects the amount of grease the pump can hold, it is
not apparent that the cylinder's shape is the reason the device works.

        In any event, the non-functional configuration of otherwise functional
components does not compel a finding that a product's overall trade dress is
functional as matter of law, and the majority's equation of such components adding
up to an overall functional design is not the law. Rather, "in order to receive trade
dress protection for the overall combination of functional features, those features
must be configured in an arbitrary, fanciful, or distinctive way." Antioch Co., 347
F.3d at 158 (emphasis added). The evidence supports a finding that the pump's
overall configuration was designed to look distinctive in the industry rather than
due to functional concerns.

        First, evidence that the pump's outer appearance was not dictated by its
internal functioning is sufficient. Whether a product's design is "essential to the use
or purpose of the article" or "affects the cost or quality of the article," TrafFix, 532
U.S. at 32-33, is the appropriate inquiry. In TrafFix, the Court emphasized that
"[t]he point is that the springs are necessary to the operation of the device," "the
dual-spring design provides a unique and useful mechanism to resist the force of the
wind," and "[t]he dual-spring design is not an arbitrary flourish in the configuration
of [the] product; it is the reason the device works." Id. at 30, 33, 34. . . .

        . . . . Here . . . the Groeneveld pump's external appearance--the round and
cylindrical shape of the clear reservoir, the grooves on the top and bottom of the
reservoir, the particular placement of the product label and other features, and the
irregular shape of the base--perform no inherently functional purpose. That its
individual components (or inside volume of those components) have functional
qualities does not compel a finding that the trade dress is functional.

        Second, van der Hulst's testimony--asserting that Groeneveld did not have to
design its pump in the unique way it did--was not a bare denial as characterized by
the majority:

                                                    123
        Q. Did Groeneveld have to make its pump look this way on the outside
        because of the way it works on the inside?

        A. No, no, of course not. No, no.

        Q. Well, again, you say of course not--

        A. You can't--the pump wasn't made in this way but you can put the valves
        inside. You can make out of the pistons horizontal or vertical, make it
        horizontal. You can change the shape of the reservoir round you can make
        also reservoirs which are square. So you can change very easily the same
        pump [would] function[ ] the same way.

        PID 7920.

        A. You see the reservoir on top? This is a reservoir on top, yeah. That is the
        container of the [grease]. The reservoir you can make in several dimensions,
        yeah. You can make them in two kilos, three. We're speaking kilos, okay.
        This one which you see on the table [is a] six kilo grease container, and this
        has to do with the time you want to [ ]come for the next ... filling....

        Q. So the sizes of reservoir of ALS pumps vary then?

        A. Yes, vary a lot, yeah.

        PID 7922.

        Q. Does the shape or outline of the pump affect the way the thing performs,
        the way it delivers grease throughout the system?

        A. No.

        Q. Explain this to the jury. It might be obvious, but I'm sorry. I'll ask you to
        explain.

        A. It's like a car. No? The car go from A to B and they're all different. The
        shape has nothing to do with the function of the [car] moving from A to B,
        and it's the same as the lubrication system. The only thing we have to do is
        create energy and that there is an outlet w[h]ere grease is coming out, how
        you do that, you can do it in many, many, many ways.

        PID 7947 (emphasis added).

        . . . .

        Fourth, van der Hulst explained in detail why the pump design is based on
branding considerations and that the pump has a unique look in the marketplace:

                                                    124
A. ... [W]e were sure that this was the only possibility to make a pump which
looks completely different than the other pumps at that time which were
available because a lot of pumps were made with mechanical parts with bolts
and screws and piece of steel, so on, and plastic. We wanted to make it
different. One piece worked and finished.

Q. Why did you want to make your pump different looking than everybody
else's that was on the market?

A. Yeah. It's just a challenge. It's a challenge of designer and each--let's say
you want to make something different than everybody else....

So we want to give it a groove look. So this has to be our pump for many,
many years and has to be good and nice.

Q. And was the Groeneveld EP-0 pump different looking than everybody
else's on the market?

A. At that time, yes. Yes, of course.

Q. And what about over the last 30 years?

A. We had a lot of success with this pump. Groeneveld went all over the
world with this pump. We created a lot of distributors everywhere, and we
were very successful with this pneumatic system, and we still are.

Q. Over the last 30 years, did anybody else's ALS pump look like
Groeneveld's, other than what we have here on the table now?

...

[A.] No, no.

Q. Did new products come on the market, ALS pumps over the last 30 years?

A. Yes, there is a lot of produce of lubrication pumps, lubrication system,
Japanese, Chinese, also Europe, different producers, smaller ones, but they
all have their own systems in a way, and they look all different, all different.

PID 7909-11

Q. You said that the Echo or the Sterk pump we were just looking at is a
terrible pump. What's terrible about it?

A. Yeah, only the look. I have nothing to say about the quality because
probably is a perfect pump, and so it's only the look which I mention, yeah.

                                           125
        Q. Was that--was that important to you or a factor in the way you chose to
        engineer the Groeneveld pump way back in the way it looked, and not
        looking terrible and all those things you just described?

        [A.] Yeah, I think so because the Groeneveld was--at that time, a very young
        company with young managers. Mr. Groeneveld, especially, he had very good
        choice. He like nice things. We had a nice office, nice cost, nice people. So
        we were different than the really old mechanical people. Let's say it in this
        way. We were a sales company, we did a lot of promotion, and there's a
        reason why we wanted to do something else[.]

        PID 7923-24. . . .

        Although the pump's trade dress is not an ornamental feature per se like
certain components of luxury cars, an ALS pump can be a visible component of a
truck. And for the consumer, its unique look causes immediate brand recognition.
Van der Hulst testified that, although it costs more to manufacture nowadays, the
pump's overall appearance has remained the same since it was first produced in the
1980s because the industry associates it with Groeneveld. . . .

        In sum, although the jury might have decided otherwise, there was sufficient
evidence to support a finding that the Groeneveld pump's trade dress is not based
on engineering or cost concerns, but was "selected for [its] distinctiveness." Ferrari
S.P.A. v. Roberts, 944 F.2d 1235, 1247 (6th Cir.1991). . . .

                                              Notes

        Who do you think has the better of the argument in Groeneveld? Compare,
e.g., Blumenthal Dist. Inc. v. Herman Miller, Inc., 963 F.3d 859, 867 (9th Cir.
2020) ("a product's overall appearance is necessarily functional if everything about it
is functional, not merely if anything about it is functional."). Functionality aside,
what do you think of the claim in Groeneveld? Does the design have trademark
significance beyond its label? Is the defendant's shape likely to confuse? In an
omitted part of the Groeneveld opinion the majority also concluded that given the
"stark visual difference in branding, no reasonable consumer would think that the
two grease pumps belong to the same company," especially when considering the
high price of the products.

        De facto and de jure functionality. One phrase that you may see cropping up
in functionality cases is "de facto" and "de jure" functionality. The phrase comes
from the Federal Circuit and its predecessor court to distinguish between an item
that is functional as a whole ("de facto" functionality, e.g., a roadside sign), and a
feature that has utilitarian value such that trademark protection is unavailable ("de

                                                    126
jure" functionality, e.g., the sign's spring mechanism that keeps it from blowing
down in the wind).

        The Trademark Office has moved away from this distinction as unsupported
by larger trademark jurisprudence. That said, the distinction between the utility of
the object as a whole and the feature that is the basis of the trademark claim
remains an issue, as seen in Groeneveld. The de facto/de jure phraseology, moreover,
persists in the courts. See, e.g., Secalt S.A. v. Wuxi Shenxi Const. Machinery Co.,
Ltd., 668 F.3d 677, 683 (9th Cir. 2012).

        The Morton-Norwich factors. In re Morton-Norwich Products, Inc., 671 F.2d
1332 (C.C.P.A. 1982), suggests four factors for determining functionality that
courts continue to refer to post-TrafFix.* They are:

        "the existence of an expired utility patent which disclosed the utilitarian
        advantage of the design sought to be registered as a trademark"

        "It may also be significant that the originator of the design touts its
        utilitarian advantages through advertising."

        "Since the effect upon competition `is really the crux of the matter,' it is, of
        course, significant that there are other alternatives available."

        "It is also significant that a particular design results from a comparatively
        simple or cheap method of manufacturing the article."

        Is the third factor consistent with TrafFix? Recall the debate between the
majority and dissent in Groeneveld. A number of courts have ruled that the
availability of alternatives remains relevant in assessing the functionality of a
claimed feature. See, e.g., Valu Engineering, Inc. v. Rexnord Corp., 278 F.3d 1268,
1276 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (though there is no need to consider alternative designs if a
feature is functional, "that does not mean that the availability of alternative designs
cannot be a legitimate source of evidence to determine whether a feature is
functional in the first place"); Au-Tomotive Gold, Inc. v. Volkswagen of America,
Inc., 457 F.3d 1062, 1072 n.8 (9th Cir. 2006); McAirlaids, Inc. v. Kimberly-Clark
Corp., 756 F.3d 307, 312 (4th Cir. 2014) ("TrafFix did not alter our precedents that
look to the availability of alternative designs when considering, as an initial matter,
whether a design affects product quality or is merely ornamental.").

          * Incidentally, Morton-Norwich involved a spray bottle design.

        Standard of review. Functionality is a fact question, and is therefore reviewed
under a clearly erroneous standard.

        Functional packaging. Can a product's packaging be functional? Consider
transparent plastic wrap. Wouldn't competitors find it useful to market their wares
in a way that would allow consumers to see a product before they buy it? The courts
agree. See, e.g., Price Food Co. v. Good Foods, Inc., 400 F.2d 662, 665 (6th Cir.
1968). But is that really a functionality question? Or something else?

        What about color? Is green functional for showing that an ice cream is, say,
mint flavored? See, e.g., Dippin' Dots, Inc. v. Frosty Bites Distribution, LLC369 F.3d
1197, 1205-06 (11th Cir. 2004) (because ice cream color indicates flavor "we
conclude that color is functional in this case because it is essential to the purpose of
the product and affects its quality."). Similar precedent exists for pill color. See, e.g.,
Inwood Laboratories, Inc. v. Ives Laboratories, Inc., 456 U.S. 844, 853 (1982) ("The
District Court . . . found that the blue and blue-red [medication] colors were
functional to patients as well as to doctors and hospitals: many elderly patients
associate color with therapeutic effect; some patients commingle medications in a
container and rely on color to differentiate one from another . . . ."). Research
indicates that changing pill color makes it less likely to be taken, suggesting that
generic drugs should be allowed to copy the color of brand names. Nicholas
Bakalar, "The Confusion of Pill Coloring," The New York Times (December 31,
2012), available at http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/31/the-confusion-of-
pill-coloring/. More recently, the Second Circuit concluded that a color system for
distinguishing components of a system for making dental adhesives was functional.
Sulzer Mixpac AG v. A&N Trading Co., 988 F.3d 174, 177 (2d Cir. 2021) ("The
evidence establishes that the colors signify mixing tip sizes, enabling users to more
easily match cartridges to the appropriate mixing tips."); id. at 183 (concluding the
color system affects the system's quality). The same idea may extend to shapes. See
PIM Brands, Inc. v. Haribo of America, Inc., 81 F.4th 317 (3d Cir. 2023)

(watermelon-colored wedge shape (this:  ) is functional because it identifies the
candy's flavor).

                             Jay Franco & Sons, Inc. v. Franek
                                 615 F.3d 855 (7th Cir. 2010)

EASTERBROOK, Chief Judge.
        The same year Huey Lewis and the News informed America that it's "Hip To

Be Square", Clemens Franek sought to trademark the circular beach towel. His
company, CLM Design, Inc., pitched the towel as a fashion statement--"the most

                                                    128
radical beach fashion item since the bikini," declared one advertisement. "Bound to
be round! Don't be square!" proclaimed another. CLM also targeted lazy
sunbathers: "The round shape eliminates the need to constantly get up and move
your towel as the sun moves across the sky. Instead merely reposition yourself."

        The product enjoyed some initial success. Buoyed by an investment and
promotional help from the actor Woody Harrelson (then a bartender on the TV
show Cheers ), CLM had sold more than 30,000 round beach towels in 32 states by
the end of 1987. To secure its status as the premier circular-towel maker, the
company in 1986 applied for a trademark on the towel's round design. The Patent
and Trademark Office registered the "configuration of a round beach towel" as
trademark No. 1,502,261 in 1988. But this was not enough to save CLM: Six years
later it dissolved. The mark was assigned to Franek, who continues to sell circular
towels.

        In 2006 Franek discovered that Jay Franco & Sons, a distributor of bath,
bedding, and beach accessories, was selling round beach towels. After settlement
negotiations failed, Franek sued two of Jay Franco's customers, Target and Walmart,
for unauthorized use of his registered trademark in violation of § 32 of the Lanham
Act. Jay Franco had agreed to indemnify and defend its customers in such suits, so it
sued Franek to invalidate his mark. (The pending suits against Target and Walmart
made the claim ripe, just as insurers can bring declaratory-judgment suits to resolve
disputes about a policy's scope once an insured has been sued and asserts that the
policy applies.) The district judge consolidated the two cases, granted summary
judgment in Jay Franco's favor, and dismissed the remaining claims and
counterclaims. Franek appeals from that judgment; Target and Walmart are not
part of the appeal.

        One way to void a trademark is to challenge its distinctiveness. A valid
trademark identifies the source of the good it marks. Designs do not inherently
communicate that information, so to be valid a product-design mark must have
acquired a "secondary meaning"--a link in the minds of consumers between the
marked item and its source. But this type of invalidation is unavailable to Jay
Franco. Franek (and before him CLM) has continuously used the round-towel mark
since its 1988 registration. That makes the mark "incontestable," 15 U.S.C. § 1065,
a status that eliminates the need for a mark's owner in an infringement suit to show
that his mark is distinctive. See 15 U.S.C. § 1115(b).

        Unfortunately for Franek, incontestable marks are not invincible. The
Lanham Act lists a number of affirmative defenses an alleged infringer can parry
with; one is a showing that the mark is "functional." See § 1115(b)(8); Specialized
Seating, Inc. v. Greenwich Industries, L.P., 616 F.3d 722, 724, 2010 WL 3155922, *1
(7th Cir.2010) (discussing functionality and other ways to defeat incontestable
marks). As our companion opinion in Specialized Seating explains, patent law alone

                                                    129
protects useful designs from mimicry; the functionality doctrine polices the division
of responsibilities between patent and trademark law by invalidating marks on
useful designs. This was the route Jay Franco pursued. The district judge agreed,
finding Franek's mark "functional" under the definition the Supreme Court gave
that concept in TrafFix Devices, Inc. v. Marketing Displays, Inc., 532 U.S. 23, 32-35,
(2001). The judge got it right.

         TrafFix says that a design is functional when it is "essential to the use or
purpose of the device or when it affects the cost or quality of the device," 532 U.S.
at 33, a definition cribbed from Inwood Laboratories, Inc. v. Ives Laboratories, Inc., 456
U.S. 844, 850 n. 10 (1982). So if a design enables a product to operate, or improves
on a substitute design in some way (such as by making the product cheaper, faster,
lighter, or stronger), then the design cannot be trademarked; it is functional because
consumers would pay to have it rather than be indifferent toward or pay to avoid it.
A qualification is that any pleasure a customer derives from the design's
identification of the product's source--the joy of buying a marked good over an
identical generic version because the consumer prefers the status conferred by the
mark--doesn't count. That broad a theory of functionality would penalize
companies for developing brands with cachet to distinguish themselves from
competitors, which is the very purpose of trademark law. In short, a design that
produces a benefit other than source identification is functional.

        Figuring out which designs meet this criterion can be tricky. Utility patents
serve as excellent cheat sheets because any design claimed in a patent is supposed to
be useful. See 35 U.S.C. § 101; Brenner v. Manson, 383 U.S. 519, 528-36 (1966). For
this reason, TrafFix held that expired utility patents provide "strong evidence that
the features therein claimed are functional." The parties in this case wrangle over
the relevance of a handful of utility patents that claim circular towels. We need
discuss only one (No. 4,794,029), which describes a round beach towel laced with
drawstrings that can be pulled to turn the towel into a satchel. This patent's first
two claims are:

        1. A towel-bag construction comprising: a non-rectangular towel;

        a casing formed at the perimeter of said towel;

        a cord threaded through said casing; and

        a section of relatively non-stretchable fabric of a shape geometrically similar
        to that of said towel attached with its edges equidistant from the edges of
        said towel.

        2. A towel-bag construction as set forth in claim 1 wherein said towel is
        circular in shape, whereby a user while sunbathing may reposition his or her

                                                    130
        body towards the changing angle of the sun while the towel remains
        stationary.

        Claim 2 sounds like Franek's advertisements, which we quoted above. The
patent's specification also reiterates, in both the summary and the detailed
description, that a circular towel is central to the invention because of its benefit to
lazy sunbathers.

        Franek argues that claim 2 does not trigger the TrafFix presumption of
functionality because his towel does not infringe the '029 patent. He notes that
claim 2 incorporates claim 1 (in patent parlance, claim 1 is "independent" and
claim 2 "dependent," see 35 U.S.C. § 112) with the added condition that the towel
be circular. An item can infringe a dependent claim only if it also violates the
independent claim incorporated by the dependent claim. Franek reasons that
because his towel lacks a perimeter casing, drawstring, and non-stretchable section
of fabric, it does not infringe claim 1, and thus cannot infringe claim 2. Even if his
towel could infringe claim 2, Franek maintains that the claim is invalid because the
towel-to-bag patent was sought in 1987, two years after Franek started selling a
round beach towel, and thus too late to claim its invention. See 35 U.S.C. § 102(b).

        Proving patent infringement can be sufficient to show that a trademarked
design is useful, as it means that the infringing design is quite similar to a useful
invention. But such proof is unnecessary. Functionality is determined by a feature's
usefulness, not its patentability or its infringement of a patent. TrafFix's ruling that
an expired patent (which by definition can no longer be infringed) may evince a
design's functionality demonstrates that proof of infringement is unnecessary. If an
invention is too useless to be patentable, or too dissimilar to a design to shed light
on its functions, then the lack of proof of patent infringement is meaningful.
Otherwise it is irrelevant. A design may not infringe a patented invention because
the invention is obvious or taught by prior art, see 35 U.S.C. §§ 102(a), 103(a), but
those and other disqualifers do not mean that the design is not useful. Just so here:
Franek's towel may lack some of the components in claim 1 necessary to infringe
claim 2, but claim 2's coverage of a circular beach towel for sunbathing is enough to
signal that a round-towel design is useful for sunbathers. Each claim in a patent is
evaluated individually, see Altoona Publix Theatres, Inc. v. American Tri-Ergon Corp.,
294 U.S. 477, 487 (1935), each must be substantially different, see 37 C.F.R. §
1.75(b); Manual of Patent Examining Procedure § 2173.05(n)(b) (8th ed., July 2010
rev.), and each is presumed valid, 35 U.S.C. § 282. We must therefore presume that
the unique component in claim 2--the round shape of the towel--is useful.

        Nor does it matter that the '029 patent application was filed two years after
Franek began selling round towels. As we've explained, a patent's invalidity for a
reason other than uselessness says nothing about the claimed design's functionality.

                                                    131
And a design patented yesterday can be as good evidence of a mark's functionality as
a design patented 50 years ago. Indeed, more recent patents are often better evidence
because technological change can render designs that were functional years ago no
longer so. The Court in TrafFix may have dealt only with expired utility patents, but
the logic it employed is not limited to them.

        To put things another way, a trademark holder cannot block innovation by
appropriating designs that under-gird further improvements. Patent holders can do
this, but a patent's life is short; trademarks can last forever, so granting trademark
holders this power could permanently stifle product development. If we found
Franek's trademark nonfunctional, then inventors seeking to build an improved
round beach towel would be out of luck. They'd have to license Franek's mark or
quell their inventiveness. That result does not jibe with the purposes of patent or
trademark law.

        This "strong evidence" of the round towel's functionality is bolstered by
Franek's own advertisements, which highlight two functional aspects of the round
beach towel's design. One, also discussed in the '029 patent, is that roundness
enables heliotropic sunbathers--tanners who swivel their bodies in unison with the
sun's apparent motion in order to maintain an even tan--to remain on their towels
as they rotate rather than exert the energy to stand up and reposition their towels
every so often, as conventional rectangular towels require.

        Franek responds that whatever its shape (golden-ratio rectangle, square,
nonagon) any towel can satisfy a heliotropic tanner if it has enough surface area--the
issue is size, not shape. That's true, and it is enough to keep the roundness of his
towel from being functional under the first prong of TrafFix's definition ("essential
to the use or purpose of the device") but not the second. For heliotropic sunbathers,
a circle surpasses other shapes because it provides the most rotational space without
waste. Any non-circle polygon will either limit full rotations (spinning on a normal
beach towel leads to sandy hair and feet) or not use all the surface area (a 6' tall
person swiveling on a 6' by 6' square towel won't touch the corners). Compared to
other shapes that permit full rotations, the round towel requires less material, which
makes it easier to fold and carry. That's evidence that the towel's circularity "affects
the ... quality of the device." (The reduction in needed material also suggests that
round towels are cheaper to produce than other-shaped towels, though Franek
contends that cutting and hemming expenses make them costlier. We express no
view on the matter.)

        But let us suppose with Franek--who opposed summary judgment and who is
thus entitled to all reasonable inferences--that round towels are not measurably
better for spinning with the sun. After all, other shapes (squircles, regular icosagons)
are similar enough to circles that any qualitative difference may be lost on tanners.
Plus, the ability to rotate 180 degrees may be an undesired luxury. Few lie out from

                                                    132
dawn 'til dusk (if only to avoid skin cancer) and the daily change in the sun's
declination means it will rise due east and set due west just twice a year, during the
vernal and autumnal equinoxes. A towel shaped like a curved hourglass that allows
only 150 or 120 degrees of rotation (or even fewer) may be all a heliotropic tanner
wants. No matter. Franek's mark still is functional.

        Franek's advertisements declare that the round towel is a fashion statement.
Fashion is a form of function. A design's aesthetic appeal can be as functional as its
tangible characteristics. See Qualitex Co. v. Jacobson Products Co., 514 U.S. 159, 169-
70 (1995); Wal-Mart, 529 U.S. at 214; TrafFix, 532 U.S. at 33; W.T. Rogers Co. v.
Keene, 778 F.2d 334 (7th Cir.1985); Publications International, Ltd. v. Landoll, Inc.,
164 F.3d 337 (7th Cir.1998); Abercrombie & Fitch Stores, Inc. v. American Eagle
Outfitters, Inc., 280 F.3d 619 (6th Cir.2002). And many cases say that fashionable
designs can be freely copied unless protected by patent law.

        The chief difficulty is distinguishing between designs that are fashionable
enough to be functional and those that are merely pleasing. Only the latter group
can be protected, because trademark law would be a cruel joke if it limited
companies to tepid or repugnant brands that discourage customers from buying the
marked wares. We discussed this problem at length in Keene. The Supreme Court
broached the subject in Qualitex when it discussed the functionality of the green-
gold color of a dry cleaning pad. Unwilling to say that the pad required a green-gold
hue or was improved by it, the Court still thought that the color would be
functional if its exclusive use by a single designer "would put competitors at a
significant non-reputation-related disadvantage." 514 U.S. at 165. This is a problem
for Franek's round-towel mark.

        Franek wants a trademark on the circle. Granting a producer the exclusive
use of a basic element of design (shape, material, color, and so forth) impoverishes
other designers' palettes. See, e.g., Brunswick Corp., v. British Seagull Ltd., 35 F.3d
1527 (Fed.Cir.1994) (black color of boat engines is functional because it is
compatible with boats of many different colors). Qualitex's determination that "color
alone, at least sometimes, can meet the basic legal requirements for use as a
trademark" (514 U.S. at 166), means that there is no per se rule against this
practice. The composition of the relevant market matters. But the more
rudimentary and general the element--all six-sided shapes rather than an irregular,
perforated hexagon; all labels made from tin rather than a specific tin label; all
shades of the color purple rather than a single shade--the more likely it is that
restricting its use will significantly impair competition. Franek's towel is of this ilk.
He has trademarked the "configuration of a round beach towel." Every other beach
towel manufacturer is barred from using the entire shape as well as any other design
similar enough that consumers are likely to confuse it with Franek's circle (most
regular polygons, for example).

                                                    133
        Contrast Franek's mark with the irregular hexagon at issue in Keene or the
green-gold hue in Qualitex. Those marks restrict few design options for competitors.
Indeed, they are so distinctive that competitors' only reason to copy them would be
to trade on the goodwill of the original designer. Cf. Service Ideas, Inc. v. Traex Corp.,
846 F.2d 1118, 1123-24 (7th Cir.1988) (purposeful copying of a beverage server's
arbitrary design indicated a lack of aesthetic functionality). That's not so here. A
circle is the kind of basic design that a producer like Jay Franco adopts because
alternatives are scarce and some consumers want the shape regardless of who
manufactures it. There are only so many geometric shapes; few are both attractive
and simple enough to fabricate cheaply. Cf. Qualitex, 514 U.S. at 168-69
(functionality doctrine invalidates marks that would create color scarcity in a
particular market). And some consumers crave round towels--beachgoers who prefer
curved edges to sharp corners, those who don't want to be "square," and those who
relish the circle's simplicity. A producer barred from selling such towels loses a
profitable portion of the market. The record does not divulge much on these
matters, but any holes in the evidence are filled by the TrafFix presumption that
Franek's mark is functional, a presumption he has failed to rebut.

        Franek chose to pursue a trademark, not a design patent, to protect the
stylish circularity of his beach towel. Cf. Kohler Co. v. Moen Inc., 12 F.3d 632, 647
(7th Cir.1993) (Cudahy, J., dissenting) (calling Franek's mark a "horrible example[]"
of a registered trademark that should have been a design patent). He must live with
that choice. We cannot permit him to keep the indefinite competitive advantage in
producing beach towels this trademark creates.

        If Franek is worried that consumers will confuse Jay Franco's round beach
towels with his, he can imprint a distinctive verbal or pictorial mark on his towels.
That will enable him to reap the benefits of his brand while still permitting healthy
competition in the beach towel market.

                                               Note

        Two kinds of channeling. As the cases discuss, functionality helps police the
boundary between trademark and patent law, directing claims of IP rights in useful
inventions into the patent regime. Note also, however, the interplay between
trademark law's subdoctrines. A strong functionality bar becomes much more
important if product design is eligible for trademark protection in the first instance.
Do you see why? Thus Two Pesos increased the importance of functionality, while
Wal-Mart may have reduced it somewhat. Perhaps, however, we can turn that
around. Did the functionality doctrine make the Two Pesos holding possible?

        In a similar vein, did Judge Easterbrook think the towel was distinctive
subject matter in the first instance? We have not studied the concept of

                                                    134
incontestable marks yet, but the case gives a good overview of one of its
consequences. Once a mark has been registered long enough, it becomes
"incontestable" and therefore immune to certain kinds of challenges, among them,
a lack of distinctiveness. Fair enough, but that makes the remaining bases of
challenge, among them functionality, all the more important.

        Think about these sorts of intra-doctrinal spillovers when reading the next
materials, which cover aesthetic functionality.

Problem

        Our client, Blue Sky HVAC, plans to bring a new thermostat onto the
market. It looks like this:

        Unfortunately, that looks like this:

        Until now, Honeywell was the only thermostat maker on the market with a
round thermostat. It may be able to show that consumers associate the round shape
with the company. Blue Sky wants to know whether it may raise a functionality
defense against prospective litigation by Honeywell.

Problems

        1. American football is a game about territory. The team with the ball
must advance downfield or turn the ball over if it fails. To make the game easier to
follow for viewers at home, broadcasters began in the late 1990s to provide a
digitally created line (the "first-down line") indicating how far the team with the ball
needed to advance in order to retain possession. Sportvision, Inc. was an early
provider of the technology. After the color yellow emerged as the choice of its
clients, Sportvision applied for a trademark registration in the color, which was
granted by the Trademark Office.

        Our client, Silvermine technologies, also provides effects services for
television broadcasters. It has a contract to provide first-down marker technology for
an upcoming football game. May it use the same color yellow as Sportvision?

        May it claim a trademark on its red wax seal? Or is the seal functional?

          Wallace Intern. Silversmiths, Inc. v. Godinger Silver Art Co., Inc.
                                  916 F.2d 76 (2d Cir. 1990)

WINTER, Circuit Judge:
        Wallace International Silversmiths ("Wallace") appeals from Judge Haight's

denial of its motion for a preliminary injunction under Section 43(a) of the Lanham
Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a) (1988), prohibiting Godinger Silver Art Co., Inc.
("Godinger") from marketing a line of silverware with ornamentation that is
substantially similar to Wallace's GRANDE BAROQUE line. Judge Haight held
that the GRANDE BAROQUE design is "a functional feature of `Baroque' style
silverware" and thus not subject to protection as a trademark. We affirm.

                                       BACKGROUND
        Wallace, a Delaware corporation, has sold sterling silver products for over
one hundred years. Its GRANDE BAROQUE pattern was introduced in 1941 and
is still one of the best-selling silverware lines in America. Made of fine sterling silver,
a complete place setting costs several thousand dollars. Total sales of GRANDE
BAROQUE silverware have exceeded fifty million dollars. The GRANDE
BAROQUE pattern is fairly described as "ornate, massive and flowery [with]
indented, flowery roots and scrolls and curls along the side of the shaft, and flower
arrangements along the front of the shaft." Wallace owns a trademark registration
for the GRANDE BAROQUE name as applied to sterling silver flatware and
hollowware. The GRANDE BAROQUE design is not patented, but on December
11, 1989, Wallace filed an application for trademark registration for the GRANDE
BAROQUE pattern. This application is still pending.
        Godinger, a New York corporation, is a manufacturer of silver-plated
products. The company has recently begun to market a line of baroque-style silver-
plated serving pieces. The suggested retail price of the set of four serving pieces is
approximately twenty dollars. Godinger advertised its new line under the name
20TH CENTURY BAROQUE and planned to introduce it at the Annual New
York Tabletop and Accessories Show, the principal industry trade show at which
orders for the coming year are taken. Like Wallace's silverware, Godinger's pattern
contains typical baroque elements including an indented root, scrolls, curls, and
flowers. The arrangement of these elements approximates Wallace's design in many
ways, although their dimensions are noticeably different. The most obvious
difference between the two designs is that the Godinger pattern extends further
down the handle than the Wallace pattern does. The Wallace pattern also tapers
from the top of the handle to the stem while the Godinger pattern appears bulkier
overall and maintains its bulk throughout the decorated portion of the handle.
Although the record does not disclose the exact circumstances under which
Godinger's serving pieces were created, Godinger admits that its designers were
"certainly inspired by and aware of [the Wallace] design . . ."

                                                    137
        On the afternoon of April 23, 1990, Leonard Florence of Wallace learned
from a wholesale customer, Michael C. Fina Company, that Godinger had placed
an advertisement for its 20TH CENTURY BAROQUE serving pieces in an
industry trade magazine. George Fina, the company's president, said that he was
"confused" when he saw what he believed to be a pattern identical to GRANDE
BAROQUE being advertised by another company. He asked Mr. Florence whether
Wallace had licensed the design to Godinger or whether "the Godinger product was
simply a `knock-off.' " Two days after this conversation, Wallace filed the complaint
in the instant matter stating various federal trademark and state unfair competition
claims . . . [and] sought a preliminary injunction . . . .

        . . . . It is a first principle of trademark law that an owner may not use the
mark as a means of excluding competitors from a substantial market. Where a mark
becomes the generic term to describe an article, for example, trademark protection
ceases. 15 U.S.C. § 1064(3) (1988); see Abercrombie & Fitch Co. v. Hunting World, Inc.,
537 F.2d 4 (2d Cir.1976). Where granting trademark protection to the use of
certain colors would tend to exclude competitors, such protection is also limited. See
First Brands Corp. v. Fred Meyer, Inc., 809 F.2d 1378 (9th Cir.1987); J. McCarthy,
Trademarks and Unfair Competition, § 7:16 et seq. Finally, as discussed supra, design
features of products that are necessary to the product's utility may be copied by
competitors under the functionality doctrine.

        In the instant matter, Wallace seeks trademark protection, not for a precise
expression of a decorative style, but for basic elements of a style that is part of the
public domain. As found by the district court, these elements are important to
competition in the silverware market. We perceive no distinction between a claim
to exclude all others from use on silverware of basic elements of a decorative style
and claims to generic names, basic colors or designs important to a product's utility.
In each case, trademark protection is sought, not just to protect an owner of a mark
in informing the public of the source of its products, but also to exclude
competitors from producing similar products. We therefore . . . adopt the Draft
Restatement's view that, where an ornamental feature is claimed as a trademark and
trademark protection would significantly hinder competition by limiting the range
of adequate alternative designs, the aesthetic functionality doctrine denies such
protection. See Third Restatement of the Law, Unfair Competition (Preliminary
Draft No. 3), Ch. 3, § 17(c) at 213-14. This rule requir[es] a finding of foreclosure of
alternatives2 while still ensuring that trademark protection does not exclude
competitors from substantial markets.3

          2 . . . . .Illustration 6 reads as follows:

                                                    138
        Of course, if Wallace were able to show secondary meaning in a precise
expression of baroque style, competitors might be excluded from using an identical
or virtually identical design. In such a case, numerous alternative baroque designs
would still be available to competitors. Although the Godinger design at issue here
was found by Judge Haight to be "substantially similar," it is not identical or
virtually identical, and the similarity involves design elements necessary to compete
in the market for baroque silverware. Because according trademark protection to
those elements would significantly hinder competitors by limiting the range of
adequate alternative designs, we agree with Judge Haight's denial of a preliminary
injunction.

                                              Notes

        The Qualitex test. Recall that TrafFix refers to two functionality tests. Its
outcome turned on the first, sometimes referred to as the Inwood test. The second is
the one typically raised in aesthetic functionality cases. In Qualitex, Justice Breyer
observed:

          A manufactures china. Among the products marketed by A is a set of china bearing a particular
          "overall" pattern covering the entire upper surface of each dish. Evidence indicates that aesthetic
          factors play an important role in the purchase of china, that A's design is attractive to a significant
          number of consumers, and that the number of alternative patterns is virtually unlimited. In the
          absence of evidence indicating that similarly attractive "overall" patterns are unavailable to
          competing manufacturers, A's pattern design is not functional under the rule stated in this Section.

          3 Draft Restatement Illustrations 7 and 8 reflect this aspect of the rule. They read as follows:

          7. The facts being otherwise as stated in Illustration 6, A's design consists solely of a thin gold band
          placed around the rim of each dish. Evidence indicates that a significant number of consumers
          prefer china decorated with only a gold rim band. Because the number of alternative designs
          available to satisfy the aesthetic desires of these prospective purchasers is extremely limited, the rim
          design is functional under the rule stated in this Section.

          8. A is the first seller to market candy intended for Valentine's Day in heart-shaped boxes. Evidence
          indicates that the shape of the box is an important factor in the appeal of the product to a
          significant number of consumers. Because there are no alternative designs capable of satisfying the
          aesthetic desires of these prospective purchasers, the design of the box is functional under the rule
          stated in this Section.

                                                    139
        The upshot is that, where a color serves a significant nontrademark
        function--whether to distinguish a heart pill from a digestive medicine or to
        satisfy the "noble instinct for giving the right touch of beauty to common
        and necessary things," G.K. Chesterton, Simplicity and Tolstoy 61 (1912)--
        courts will examine whether its use as a mark would permit one competitor
        (or a group) to interfere with legitimate (nontrademark-related) competition
        through actual or potential exclusive use of an important product ingredient.
        That examination should not discourage firms from creating aesthetically
        pleasing mark designs, for it is open to their competitors to do the same.

        In TrafFix Justice Kennedy elaborated:

        It is proper to inquire into a "significant non-reputation-related
        disadvantage" in cases of esthetic functionality, the question involved in
        Qualitex. Where the design is functional under the Inwood formulation there
        is no need to proceed further to consider if there is a competitive necessity
        for the feature. In Qualitex, by contrast, esthetic functionality was the central
        question, there having been no indication that the green-gold color of the
        laundry press pad had any bearing on the use or purpose of the product or
        its cost or quality.

        Of course, the central question in Qualitex was whether color could be
trademarked, but oh well.

        A dangerous doctrine? Does extending functionality beyond the utilitarian
context create problems? Some commentators think so. See, e.g., WILLIAM M.
LANDES & RICHARD A. POSNER, THE ECONOMIC STRUCTURE OF INTELLECTUAL
PROPERTY LAW 199-200 (2003) (arguing that protecting an aesthetic feature as a
mark does not disadvantage other firms so long as the feature does not become "an
attribute of the product" in consumer mind). The Second Circuit grappled with this
problem in Wallace, rejecting an earlier precedent that suggested any attractive
design could be copied without regard to competitive need.

        Limited acceptance. McCarthy's treatise reports that most circuits resist
aesthetic functionality claims. 1 MCCARTHY § 7:80 (surveying federal circuit courts
and observing that most have either explicitly rejected aesthetic functionality or
expressed doubts as to its validity). Similarly, many cases that may look like
candidates for application of the principle of aesthetic functionality are treated as
raising other issues. See, e.g., Brunswick Corp. v. British Seagull Ltd., 35 F.3d 1527,
1533 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (pre-TrafFix case affirming denial of registration for black
color for outboard motors, explaining "the Board did not improperly deny

                                                    140
registration to Mercury merely because black served purely aesthetic functions.
Color compatibility and ability to decrease apparent motor size are not in this case
mere aesthetic features. Rather these non-trademark functions supply a competitive
advantage"). Likewise, recall the note on the functionality of color in the previous
chapter.

        The Trademark Office view. The TMEP discusses aesthetic functionality as
follows:

                          1202.02(a)(vi) Aesthetic Functionality

        "Aesthetic functionality" refers to situations where the feature may not
provide a truly utilitarian advantage in terms of product performance, but provides
other competitive advantages. For example, in Brunswick Corp. v. British Seagull Ltd.,
35 F.3d 1527, 1531, 1533, 32 USPQ2d 1120, 1122, 1124 (Fed. Cir. 1994), cert.
denied, 514 U.S. 1050 (1995), the Federal Circuit affirmed the Board's
determination that the color black for outboard motors was functional because,
while it had no utilitarian effect on the mechanical working of the engines, it
nevertheless provided other identifiable competitive advantages, i.e., ease of
coordination with a variety of boat colors and reduction in the apparent size of the
engines.

        The concept of "aesthetic functionality" (as opposed to "utilitarian
functionality") has for many years been the subject of much confusion. While the
Court of Customs and Patent Appeals (the predecessor to the Court of Appeals for
the Federal Circuit) appeared to reject the doctrine of aesthetic functionality in In re
DC Comics, Inc., 689 F.2d 1042, 1047-1050 (C.C.P.A. 1982), the Supreme Court
later referred to aesthetic functionality as a valid legal concept in TrafFix Devices, Inc.
v. Mktg. Displays, Inc., 532 U.S. 23, 33 (2001). The confusion regarding aesthetic
functionality stems in part from widespread misuse of the term "aesthetic
functionality" in cases involving ornamentation issues, with some courts having
mistakenly expanded the category of "functional" marks to include matter that is
solely ornamental, essentially on the theory that such matter serves an "aesthetic
function" or "ornamentation function." It is this incorrect use of the term "aesthetic
functionality" in connection with ornamentation cases that was rejected by the
Court of Customs and Patent Appeals. See In re DC Comics, Inc., 689 F.2d 1042,
1047-1050 (C.C.P.A. 1982) (majority opinion and Rich, J., concurring) (holding, in
a case involving features of toy dolls, that the Board had improperly "intermingled
the concepts of utilitarian functionality and what has been termed `aesthetic
functionality;'" and rejecting the concept of aesthetic functionality where it is used

                                                    141
as a substitute for "the more traditional source identification principles of
trademark law," such as the ornamentation and functionality doctrines).

        Where the issue presented is whether the proposed mark is ornamental in
nature, it is improper to refer to "aesthetic functionality," because the doctrine of
"functionality" is inapplicable to such cases. The proper refusal is that the matter is
ornamental and, thus, does not function as a mark under §§1, 2, and 45 of the
Trademark Act, 15 U.S.C. §§1051, 1052, and 1127. See TMEP §§1202.03-
1202.03(g) regarding ornamentation.

        The Supreme Court's use of the term "aesthetic functionality" in
the TrafFix case appears limited to cases where the issue is one of actual
functionality, but where the nature of the proposed mark makes it difficult to
evaluate the functionality issue from a purely utilitarian standpoint. This is the case
with color marks and product features that enhance the attractiveness of the
product. The color or feature does not normally give the product a truly utilitarian
advantage (in terms of making the product actually perform better), but may still be
found to be functional because it provides other real and significant competitive
advantages and, thus, should remain in the public domain. See Qualitex Co. v.
Jacobson Prods. Co., 514 U.S. 159, 165 (1995) (stating that a product color might be
considered functional if its exclusive use "would put competitors at a significant
non-reputation-related disadvantage," even where the color was not functional in
the utilitarian sense).

        In M-5 Steel Mfg., Inc. v. O'Hagin's Inc., 61 USPQ2d 1086, 1096 (TTAB
2001), the Board considered the proper use of the aesthetic functionality doctrine
in connection with product designs for metal ventilating ducts and vents for tile or
concrete roofs:

        This case seems to involve elements of both utilitarian and aesthetic
        functionality. Here, for example, there is evidence of utility in applicant's
        patent application, as well as statements touting the superiority of applicant's
        design in applicant's promotional literature, and statements that applicant's
        design results in reduced costs of installation. On the other hand, there is no
        question that applicant's roof designs which match the appearance of
        surrounding roof tiles are more pleasing in appearance because the venting
        tiles in each case are unobtrusive.
        Citing extensively from the TrafFix, Qualitex, and Brunswick cases, the Board
concluded that the product designs were functional for a combination of utilitarian
and aesthetic reasons. Id. at 1097.
        Note that this type of functionality determination - while employed in
connection with a normally "aesthetic" feature such as color - is a proper use of the
functionality doctrine, necessitating a §2(e)(5) refusal where the evidence establishes
that a color or other matter at issue provides identifiable competitive advantages
and, thus, should remain in the public domain. In In re Florists' Transworld Delivery

                                                    142
Inc., 106 USPQ2d 1784 (TTAB 2013), for example, the record included evidence
reflecting that, in the floral industry, color has significance and communicates
particular messages (e.g., elegance, bereavement, Halloween), which extend to floral
packaging. The Board found, therefore, that the examining attorney had
demonstrated a competitive need for others in the industry to use black in
connection with floral arrangements and packaging therefor and concluded that the
proposed mark was functional under §2(e)(5). This is the opposite of an
ornamentation refusal, where the matter at issue serves no identifiable purpose
other than that of pure decoration.

        Generally speaking, examining attorneys should exercise caution in the use
of the term "aesthetic functionality," in light of the confusion that historically has
surrounded this issue. In most situations, reference to aesthetic functionality will be
unnecessary, since a determination that the matter sought to be registered is purely
ornamental in nature will result in an ornamentation refusal under §§1, 2, and 45
of the Trademark Act, and a determination that the matter sought to be registered
is functional will result in a functionality refusal under §2(e)(5). Use of the term
"aesthetic functionality" may be appropriate in limited circumstances where the
proposed mark presents issues similar to those involved in the Florists' Transworld
Delivery, M-5 Steel, and Brunswick cases discussed above - i.e., where the issue is one
of true functionality under §2(e)(5), but where the nature of the mark makes the
functionality determination turn on evidence of particular competitive advantages
that are not necessarily categorized as "utilitarian" in nature. Any such use of the
term "aesthetic functionality" should be closely tied to a discussion of specific
competitive advantages resulting from use of the proposed mark at issue, so that it is
clear that the refusal is properly based on the functionality doctrine and not on an
incorrect use of "aesthetic functionality" to mean ornamentation.

                                 696 F.3d 206 (2d Cir. 2012)

CABRANES, Circuit Judge
        This appeal arises out of an action for injunctive relief and enforcement of a

trademark brought by Louboutin, together with the corporate entities that
constitute his eponymous French fashion house, against YSL, a venerable French
fashion institution. Louboutin is best known for his emphasis upon the otherwise-
largely-ignored outsole of the shoe. Since their development in 1992, Louboutin's
shoes have been characterized by their most striking feature: a bright, lacquered red
outsole, which nearly always contrasts sharply with the color of the rest of the
shoe. . . .

                                                    143
        In 2011, YSL prepared to market a line of "monochrome" shoes in purple,
green, yellow, and red. YSL shoes in the monochrome style feature the same color
on the entire shoe, so that the red version is all red, including a red insole, heel,
upper, and outsole. . . . [Louboutin sued.]

        . . . . As the District Court saw it, the "narrow question" presented by the
case was "whether the Lanham Act extends protection to a trademark composed of
a single color used as an expressive and defining quality of an article of wear
produced in the fashion industry"--that is, "whether there is something unique
about the fashion world that militates against extending trademark protection to a
single color."

        Interpreting the Supreme Court's holding in Qualitex, the District Court
explained that color is protectable as a trademark only if it " `acts as a symbol that
distinguishes a firm's goods and identifies their source, without serving any other
significant function.' " (quoting Qualitex, 514 U.S. at 166) (alteration omitted). The
District Court further observed, albeit without citation to authority, that "whatever
commercial purposes may support extending trademark protection to a single color
for industrial goods do not easily fit the unique characteristics and needs--the
creativity, aesthetics, taste, and seasonal change--that define production of articles of
fashion." For that reason, the District Court held that, in the fashion industry,
single-color marks are inherently "functional" and that any such registered
trademark would likely be held invalid. The Court therefore held that Louboutin
was unlikely to be able to prove that the Red Sole Mark was eligible for trademark
protection, and denied Louboutin's motion for a preliminary injunction. This
appeal followed. . . .

        . . . . At the start, we address the two prongs of the Inwood test, asking
whether the design feature is either "essential to the use or purpose" or "affects the
cost or quality" of the product at issue. Next, if necessary, we turn to a third prong,
which is the competition inquiry set forth in Qualitex. In other words, if a design
feature would, from a traditional utilitarian perspective, be considered "essential to
the use or purpose" of the article, or to affect its cost or quality, then the design
feature is functional under Inwood and our inquiry ends. But if the design feature is
not "functional" from a traditional perspective, it must still pass the fact-intensive
Qualitex test and be shown not to have a significant effect on competition in order
to receive trademark protection. . . .

         On the one hand, " `[w]here an ornamental feature is claimed as a
trademark and trademark protection would significantly hinder competition by
limiting the range of adequate alternative designs, the aesthetic functionality
doctrine denies such protection.' " Forschner Grp., Inc. v. Arrow Trading Co., 124 F.3d
402, 409-10 (2d Cir.1997) (quoting Wallace Int'l Silversmiths, Inc., 916 F.2d at 81).
But on the other hand, " `distinctive and arbitrary arrangements of predominantly

                                                    144
ornamental features that do not hinder potential competitors from entering the
same market with differently dressed versions of the product are non-functional[,]
and [are] hence eligible for [trademark protection].' " Fabrication Enters., Inc., 64 F.3d
at 59 (quoting Stormy Clime, 809 F.2d at 977) (emphasis added).

         In short, a mark is aesthetically functional, and therefore ineligible for
protection under the Lanham Act, where protection of the mark significantly
undermines competitors' ability to compete in the relevant market. In making this
determination, courts must carefully weigh "the competitive benefits of protecting
the source-identifying aspects" of a mark against the "competitive costs of
precluding competitors from using the feature." Fabrication Enters., Inc., 64 F.3d at
59.

         Finally, we note that a product feature's successful source indication can
sometimes be difficult to distinguish from the feature's aesthetic function, if any.
See, e.g., Jay Franco & Sons, Inc. v. Franek, 615 F.3d 855, 857 (7th Cir.2010) (noting
that "[f]iguring out which designs [produce a benefit other than source
identification] can be tricky"). Therefore, in determining whether a mark has an
aesthetic function so as to preclude trademark protection, we take care to ensure
that the mark's very success in denoting (and promoting) its source does not itself
defeat the markholder's right to protect that mark. . . .

        We now turn to the per se rule of functionality for color marks in the fashion
industry adopted by the District Court--a rule that would effectively deny trademark
protection to any deployment of a single color in an item of apparel. As noted
above, the Qualitex Court expressly held that "sometimes [ ] a color will meet
ordinary legal trademark requirements[, a]nd, when it does so, no special legal rule
prevents color alone from serving as a trademark." Qualitex, 514 U.S. at 161. In
other words, the Supreme Court specifically forbade the implementation of a per se
rule that would deny protection for the use of a single color as a trademark in a
particular industrial context. Qualitex requires an individualized, fact-based inquiry
into the nature of the trademark, and cannot be read to sanction an industry-based
per se rule. The District Court created just such a rule, on the theory that "there is
something unique about the fashion world that militates against extending
trademark protection to a single color."

        Even if Qualitex could be read to permit an industry-specific per se rule of
functionality (a reading we think doubtful), such a rule would be neither necessary
nor appropriate here. We readily acknowledge that the fashion industry, like other
industries, has special concerns in the operation of trademark law; it has been
argued forcefully that United States law does not protect fashion design adequately.
Indeed, the case on appeal is particularly difficult precisely because, as the District
Court well noted, in the fashion industry, color can serve as a tool in the palette of a
designer, rather than as mere ornamentation.

                                                    145
        Nevertheless, the functionality defense does not guarantee a competitor "the
greatest range for [his] creative outlet," but only the ability to fairly compete within a
given market. . . .

                Au-Tomotive Gold, Inc. v. Volkswagen of America, Inc.
                                457 F.3d 1062 (9th Cir. 2006)

McKEOWN, Circuit Judge.
        This case centers on the trademarks of two well-known automobile

manufacturers--Volkswagen and Audi. The question is whether the Lanham Act
prevents a maker of automobile accessories from selling, without a license or other
authorization, products bearing exact replicas of the trademarks of these famous car
companies. Au-Tomotive Gold, Inc. ("Auto Gold") argues that, as used on its key
chains and license plate covers, the logos and marks of Volkswagen and Audi are
aesthetic functional elements of the product-that is, they are "the actual benefit that
the consumer wishes to purchase"--and are thus unprotected by the trademark laws.

        Accepting Auto Gold's position would be the death knell for trademark
protection. It would mean that simply because a consumer likes a trademark, or
finds it aesthetically pleasing, a competitor could adopt and use the mark on its own
products. Thus, a competitor could adopt the distinctive Mercedes circle and tri-
point star or the well-known golden arches of McDonald's, all under the rubric of
aesthetic functionality.

        The doctrine of aesthetic functionality has a somewhat checkered history. In
broad strokes, purely aesthetic product features may be protected as a trademark
where they are source identifying and are not functional. On the other hand, where
an aesthetic product feature serves a "significant non trademark function," the
doctrine may preclude protection as a trademark where doing so would stifle
legitimate competition. Qualitex Co. v. Jacobson Products Co., 514 U.S. 159, 170
(1995). Taken to its limits, as Auto Gold advocates, this doctrine would permit a
competitor to trade on any mark simply because there is some "aesthetic" value to
the mark that consumers desire. This approach distorts both basic principles of
trademark law and the doctrine of functionality in particular.

        Auto Gold's incorporation of Volkswagen and Audi marks in its key chains
and license plates appears to be nothing more than naked appropriation of the
marks. The doctrine of aesthetic functionality does not provide a defense against
actions to enforce the trademarks against such poaching. Consequently, we reverse
the district court's grant of summary judgment in favor of Auto Gold on the basis of
aesthetic functionality. We also reverse the denial of Volkswagen and Audi's motion
for summary judgment with respect to infringement and dilution and remand for
further proceedings.

                                                    146
                                       BACKGROUND
        Volkswagen and Audi are manufacturers of automobiles, parts and
accessories that bear well-known trademarks, including the names Volkswagen and
Audi, the encircled VW logo, the interlocking circles of the Audi logo, and the
names of individual car models. The marks are registered in the United States and
have been in use since the 1950s.
        Auto Gold produces and sells automobile accessories to complement specific
makes of cars, including Cadillac, Ford, Honda, Lexus, Jeep, Toyota, and others. In
1994, Auto Gold began selling license plates, license plate frames and key chains
bearing Volkswagen's distinctive trademarks and, in 1997, began selling similar
products bearing Audi's distinctive trademarks. The marks used are exact replicas of
the registered trademarks or, in at least some cases, genuine trademark medallions
purchased from Volkswagen dealers; Auto Gold states that it "applies authentic
[Volkswagen and Audi] logos to its marquee license plates."
        According to Auto Gold, its goods serve a unique market. Consumers want
these accessories "to match the chrome on their cars; to put something on the
empty space where the front license tag would otherwise go; or because the car is a
[Volkswagen or Audi], they want a [Volkswagen or Audi]-logo plate." Both Auto
Gold and Volkswagen and Audi serve this market. Auto Gold sells its license plates,
license plate covers, and key rings with Volkswagen and Audi trademarks to the
wholesale market, including car dealers, auto accessory dealers and other merchants.
Volkswagen and Audi, for their operations in the United States, license an
independent marketing firm to sell license plates, covers, and key chains directly to
consumers.
        Auto Gold has license and marketing agreements with several car
manufacturers, authorizing sales of auto accessories bearing those companies'
trademarks. Despite several attempts to secure similar arrangements with
Volkswagen and Audi, Auto Gold is not authorized to sell products with their
trademarks. Instead, Auto Gold products are accompanied by disclaimers that deny
any connection to Volkswagen or Audi. The disclaimers are not visible once the
product is removed from the packaging and in use, nor are the disclaimers always
clear. For example, some labels state that the product "may or may not" be dealer
approved, and Auto Gold's website identifies its goods as "Factory authorized
licensed products."
        In the mid-1990s, another car maker aggrieved by unauthorized sales of
trademarked accessories sued Auto Gold for trademark infringement and obtained
an injunction prohibiting Auto Gold from selling any products that incorporate
replicas of its registered marks. See BMW of North America, Inc. v. Au-Tomotive Gold,
Inc., 1996 WL 1609124 (M.D.Fla., June 19, 1996). Fearful that the decision would
invite further trademark claims, Auto Gold filed suit against Volkswagen and

                                                    147
Audi . . . . [It] sought a declaratory judgment that its activities did not constitute
trademark infringement or trademark counterfeiting under 15 U.S.C. § 1114,
unfair competition under 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a) . . . .

        Volkswagen and Audi filed counterclaims for trademark infringement under
15 U.S.C. § 1114(1)(a); false designation of origin under 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a) . . . .
In ruling for Auto Gold, the district court found that "[t]he VW and Audi logos are
used not because they signify that the license plate or key ring was manufactured or
sold (i.e., as a designation of origin) by Volkswagen or Audi, but because there is
a[n] aesthetic quality to the marks that purchasers are interested in having.". . . .

        A trademark is a "word, name, symbol, or device" that is intended "to
identify and distinguish [the mark holder's] goods, including a unique product,
from those manufactured or sold by others and to indicate the source of the goods."
15 U.S.C. § 1127. A valid, registered trademark entitles the holder to prevent
others from using the mark where (1) "such use is likely to cause confusion, or to
cause mistake or deceive," 15 U.S.C. § 1114(1)(a) (so-called "trademark
infringement") . . . .

        The principal role of trademark law is to ensure that consumers are able to
identify the source of goods. Qualitex, 514 U.S. at 164. Protecting the source-
identifying role of trademarks serves two goals. First, it quickly and easily assures a
potential customer that this item--the item with the mark--is made by the same
producer as other similarly marked products. At the same time, the law helps
"assure a producer that it (and not an imitating competitor) will reap the financial,
reputation-related rewards associated with a desirable product." Id.

        A functional product feature does not, however, enjoy protection under
trademark law. The Supreme Court has instructed that a feature is functional if it is
"essential to the use or purpose of the article [or] affects [its] cost or quality." Inwood
Labs., Inc. v. Ives Labs., Inc., 456 U.S. 844, 851 n. 10 (1982). The Inwood Laboratories
definition is often referred to as "utilitarian" functionality, as it relates to the
performance of the product in its intended purpose. Thus, "[t]he functionality
doctrine prevents trademark law, which seeks to promote competition by protecting
a firm's reputation, from instead inhibiting legitimate competition by allowing a
producer to control a useful product feature." Qualitex, 514 U.S. at 164.

        Extending the functionality doctrine, which aims to protect "useful" product
features, to encompass unique logos and insignia is not an easy transition. Famous
trademarks have assumed an exalted status of their own in today's consumer culture
that cannot neatly be reduced to the historic function of trademark to designate
source. Consumers sometimes buy products bearing marks such as the Nike
Swoosh, the Playboy bunny ears, the Mercedes tri-point star, the Ferrari stallion,
and countless sports franchise logos, for the appeal of the mark itself, without
regard to whether it signifies the origin or sponsorship of the product. As demand

                                                    148
for these marks has risen, so has litigation over the rights to their use as claimed
"functional" aspects of products. See, e.g., Vuitton et Fils S.A. v. J. Young Enters., Inc.,
644 F.2d 769 (9th Cir.1981) (reversing and remanding for trial a district court
determination that the Louis Vuitton logo and trademarked purse material were
functional); Boston Prof. Hockey Ass'n, Inc. v. Dallas Cap & Emblem Mfg., Inc., 510 F.2d
1004 (5th Cir.1975) (holding that reproductions of professional hockey franchise's
logo sold alone are not "functional" and can be protected); Ford Motor Co. v. Lloyd
Design Corp., 184 F.Supp.2d 665 (E.D.Mich.2002) (holding that a car maker's
trademarks are not functional aspects of defendant's car accessories).

        The results reached in these various aesthetic functionality cases do not easily
weave together to produce a coherent jurisprudence, although as a general matter
courts have been loathe to declare unique, identifying logos and names as
functional. To understand how the concept of functionality applies to the case
before us, broad invocations of principle are not particularly helpful. Instead, we
find it useful to follow the chronological development and refinement of the
doctrine.

        The doctrine of aesthetic functionality is often traced to a comment in the
1938 Restatement of Torts:

        When goods are bought largely for their aesthetic value, their features may be
        functional because they definitely contribute to that value and thus aid the
        performance of an object for which the goods are intended.

Restatement of Torts § 742, comment a (1938) (see Restatement 3d of Unfair
Competition, § 17 (1995)). Two examples of products with aesthetic functional
features were offered, with very little comment--a heart-shaped candy box and a
distinctive printing typeface.

        Nearly fifteen years later, the doctrine blossomed in Pagliero v. Wallace China
Co., an action by Wallace China, a manufacturer of vitrified china, to prohibit a
competitor from using a series of decorative patterns and a corresponding list of
names. See 198 F.2d 339 (9th Cir.1952). Neither the patterns nor the names were
covered by registered trademarks or patents; instead, Wallace claimed secondary
meaning, primarily that customers associated the patterns with Wallace, due to
extensive advertising and a reputation for quality. In ruling on Wallace's claim, we
loosely echoed the 1938 Restatement in articulating the line between aesthetic
appeal and functionality:

        [W]here the features are "functional" there is normally no right to relief.
        "Functional" in this sense might be said to connote other than a trade-mark
        purpose. If the particular feature is an important ingredient in the
        commercial success of the product, the interest in free competition permits

                                                    149
        its imitation in the absence of a patent or copyright. On the other hand,
        where the feature or, more aptly, design, is a mere arbitrary embellishment, a
        form of dress for the goods primarily adopted for purposes of identification
        and individuality and hence, unrelated to basic consumer demands in
        connection with the product, imitation may be forbidden where the requisite
        showing of secondary meaning is made. Under such circumstances, since
        effective competition may be undertaken without imitation, the law grants
        protection.

Id. at 343 (internal citations omitted).
        Applying that test, the china patterns were deemed "functional" because the

"attractiveness and eye-appeal" of the design is the primary benefit that consumers
seek in purchasing china. Thus, Wallace's designs were not "mere arbitrary
embellishment," but were at the heart of basic consumer demand for the product
and could not be protected as trademarks.

        Almost thirty years later, Pagliero was revived in a Ninth Circuit case
involving an effort by the International Order of Job's Daughters to preclude a
jewelry maker from selling jewelry bearing the Job's Daughters insignia. See
International Order of Job's Daughters v. Lindeburg & Co., 633 F.2d 912 (9th Cir.1980).
Because the defendant's products bearing the Job's Daughters mark were sold "on
the basis of their intrinsic value, not as a designation of origin or sponsorship," the
defendant argued that they were functional under Pagliero.

        The court acknowledged that a "name or emblem" could, in some cases,
"serve simultaneously as a functional component of a product and a trademark,"
and accordingly called for a "close analysis of the way in which [the defendant] is
using the Job's Daughters insignia." The court observed that Job's Daughters had
submitted no evidence that the defendant's use of the mark either caused confusion
as to source or was likely to do so and suggested that the emblem did not designate
a source at all.4 Accordingly, the Job's Daughters insignia, as used by the defendant,
was unprotected.

        Job's Daughters, with its collective mark, was a somewhat unique case and its
broad language was soon clarified and narrowed. In Vuitton, we confronted bare
counterfeiting of Louis Vuitton handbags with minor alterations to the familiar LV

          4 The marks at issue in Job's Daughters were "collective marks," which are trademarks "used by the

members of a cooperative, an association, or other collective group or organization, ... and include [ ] marks

indicating membership in a union, an association, or other organization." 15 U.S.C. § 1127. This explains,

in part, why there was no likelihood of confusion. Because the Job's Daughters insignia was sold by

numerous unlicensed jewelers, the possibility that consumers might think that it denoted source was

insubstantial.

                                                    150
logo and fleur-de-lis insignia. 644 F.2d at 774. Not unlike Auto Gold here, the
defendant argued that, under Pagliero and Job's Daughters, its use of the Vuitton
marks was functional because the marks were "related to the reasons consumers
purchase [the] product" and that without using the marks, it could not compete
with Vuitton in selling Louis Vuitton-marked purses. We rejected these arguments.
First, the defendant's use of the Vuitton marks was not functional in a utilitarian
sense. Id. at 776-77 ("Vuitton luggage without the distinctive trademark would still
be the same luggage. It would carry the same number of items, last just as long, and
be just as serviceable."). Significantly, in Vuitton, we emphatically rejected the notion
that "any feature of a product which contributes to the consumer appeal and
saleability of the product is, as a matter of law, a functional element of that
product." Indeed, "a trademark which identifies the source of goods and
incidentally services another function may still be entitled to protection." Under
Vuitton, the mere fact that the mark is the "benefit that the consumer wishes to
purchase" will not override trademark protection if the mark is source-identifying.
With Vuitton, aesthetic functionality was dealt a limiting but not fatal blow; the case
was remanded for trial.

        Since Vuitton, the Ninth Circuit has not directly revisited aesthetic
functionality in the context of unique source-identifying trademarks. . . . [T]he
doctrine, albeit restricted over the years, retains some limited vitality.

        The Supreme Court has yet to address aesthetic functionality as it applies to
logos and insignia, in contrast to product features. The Court has, however,
outlined the general contours of functionality and aesthetic functionality. As noted
earlier, in Inwood Laboratories, the Court offered a simple definition of functionality:
"a product feature is functional if it is essential to the use or purpose of the article
or if it affects the cost or quality of the article." 456 U.S. at 850 n. 10.

        More recently, in Qualitex, the Court considered whether a color (a
distinctive green-gold used on dry cleaning press pads) could be protected as a
trademark. Observing that color alone can meet the basic legal requirement for a
trademark, namely that it acts "as a symbol that distinguishes a firm's goods and
identifies their source," the Court concluded that the use of color as a trademark is
not per se barred by the functionality doctrine. Qualitex, 514 U.S. at 165-66 ("And,
this latter fact-the fact that sometimes color is not essential to a product's use or
purpose and does not affect cost or quality-indicates that the doctrine of
`functionality' does not create an absolute bar to the use of color alone as a mark").
The green-gold color of the dry cleaner pads served a trademark (i.e., source-
identifying) function. Additionally, the use of some color on the pads served a non-
trademark function-namely, to "avoid noticeable stains." The Court underscored,
however, that functionality protects against a competitive disadvantage "unrelated to
recognition or reputation." Accordingly, because "the [district] court found `no

                                                    151
competitive need in the press pad industry for the green-gold color, since other
colors are equally usable,' " functionality did not defeat protection.6

        The Court's most recent explication of aesthetic functionality is found in a
case surprisingly not cited by the parties--TrafFix Devices, Inc. v. Marketing Displays,
Inc., 532 U.S. 23 (2001). In TrafFix, a company that held an expired patent for a
dual-spring road sign design argued that the visible appearance of the design
constituted protectable trade dress. In considering whether the dual spring
mechanism was a functional aspect of the product, the Court clarified Qualitex's
emphasis on competitive necessity and the overall test for functionality. Rather than
paraphrase the decision, and to be absolutely clear, we quote extensively from the
passages that set out the appropriate inquiry for functionality.

        The Supreme Court emphasized that Qualitex did not displace the traditional
Inwood Laboratories utilitarian definition of functionality. " `[I]n general terms, a
product feature is functional,' and cannot serve as a trademark, `if it is essential to
the use or purpose of the article or if it affects the cost or quality of the article.' "
TrafFix, 532 U.S. at 32, (quoting Qualitex, 514 U.S. at 165); see also Inwood Labs., 456
U.S. at 850 n. 10. The Court noted that Qualitex "expand[ed] upon" the Inwood
Laboratories definition, by observing that "a functional feature is one the `exclusive
use of [which] would put competitors at a significant non-reputation-related
disadvantage.' " TrafFix, 532 U.S. at 32 (quoting Qualitex, 514 U.S. at 165) (alteration
in original).

        The Court explained the interplay between these two statements of
functionality. If a feature is functional under Inwood Laboratories, the inquiry ends
and the feature cannot be protected under trademark law. As the Court elaborated,
"there is no need to proceed further to consider if there is a competitive necessity
for the feature." Thus, in TrafFix, once the dual-spring mechanism met the
traditional functionality test by making the signs more wind resistant, "there [was]
no need to proceed further to consider if there is competitive necessity for the
feature" and likewise no need "to engage ... in speculation about other design
possibilities."

        By contrast, the Court went on to suggest that "[i]t is proper to inquire into a
`significant non-reputation-related disadvantage' in cases of aesthetic functionality,
the question involved in Qualitex." The Court described aesthetic functionality as
"the central question [in Qualitex ], there having been no indication that the green-

          6 In contrast, an example of an aesthetic product feature the protection of which would hinder

legitimate competition is the use of color to signify the type of medication in pills--the question addressed in

Inwood Laboratories. See 456 U.S. at 853 (noting that "[s]ome patients commingle medications in a container

and rely on color to differentiate one from another").

                                                    152
gold color of the laundry press pad had any bearing on the use or purpose of the
product or its cost or quality."7

        As to functionality, we read the Court's decision to mean that consideration
of competitive necessity may be an appropriate but not necessary element of the
functionality analysis. If a design is determined to be functional under the
traditional test of Inwood Laboratories there is no need to go further to consider
indicia of competitive necessity, such as the availability of alternative designs.
However, in the context of aesthetic functionality, such considerations may come
into play because a "functional feature is one the `exclusive use of [which] would put
competitors at a significant non-reputation related disadvantage.' " TrafFix, 532 U.S.
at 32 (quoting Qualitex, 514 U.S. at 165).

        B. AESTHETIC FUNCTIONALITY AND AUTO GOLD'S USE OF
VOLKSWAGEN AND AUDI'S PRODUCTS

        So where do we stand in the wake of forty years of trademark law scattered
with references to aesthetic functionality? After Qualitex and TrafFix, the test for
functionality proceeds in two steps. In the first step, courts inquire whether the
alleged "significant non-trademark function" satisfies the Inwood Laboratories
definition of functionality--"essential to the use or purpose of the article [or]
affects[its] cost or quality." TrafFix, 532 U.S. at 32-33 (citing Inwood Laboratories, 456
U.S. at 850, n. 10). If this is the case, the inquiry is over--the feature is functional
and not protected.8 In the case of a claim of aesthetic functionality, an alternative
test inquires whether protection of the feature as a trademark would impose a
significant non-reputation-related competitive disadvantage.

        We now address the marks at issue in this case. Volkswagen and Audi's
trademarks are registered and incontestable, and are thus presumed to be valid,

          7 The Court's treatment of Qualitex in TrafFix has caused some consternation among commentators.

See, e.g., 1 McCarthy on Trademark and Unfair Competition § 7.80 (4th ed.) (describing as "amazing and

incomprehensible" the statement in TrafFix "that in the 1995 Qualitex case, `aesthetic functionality was the

central question.' "); Jerome Gilson, Trademark Protection and Practice § 2A.04[5][b] (2006) ("The Supreme

Court was incorrect in TrafFix to declare that aesthetic functionality was the `central question' in the Qualitex

case. The central question in Qualitex was whether color alone could serve as a valid trademark.").

          8 Our long-standing test for functionality largely excluded aesthetic considerations, instead asking:

(1) whether the feature delivers any utilitarian advantage, (2) whether alternative designs are possible, (3)

whether advertising touts utilitarian benefits of the feature, and (4) whether the feature results in economies

in manufacture or use. Following TrafFix, we reiterated the[m . . .] as legitimate considerations in determining

whether a product feature is functional. Talking Rain Beverage Co. v. South Beach Beverage Co., 349 F.3d 601,

603-04 (9th Cir.2003) (applying the four factors to conclude that a bottle design was utilitarian). We noted

that "the existence of alternative designs cannot negate a trademark's functionality," but "may indicate

whether the trademark itself embodies functional or merely ornamental aspects of the product." Id. at 603.

                                                    153
distinctive and non-functional. Auto Gold, thus, must show that the marks are
functional under the test set forth above. To satisfy this requirement, Auto Gold
argues that Volkswagen and Audi trademarks are functional features of its products
because "the trademark is the feature of the product which constitutes the actual
benefit the consumer wishes to purchase." While that may be so, the fact that a
trademark is desirable does not, and should not, render it unprotectable. Auto Gold
has not shown that Volkswagen and Audi's marks are functional features of Auto
Gold's products. The marks are thus entitled to trademark protection.

        At the first step, there is no evidence on the record, and Auto Gold does not
argue, that Volkswagen and Audi's trademarks are functional under the utilitarian
definition in Inwood Laboratories as applied in the Ninth Circuit in Talking Rain. See
349 F.3d at 603-04. That is to say, Auto Gold's products would still frame license
plates and hold keys just as well without the famed marks. Similarly, use of the
marks does not alter the cost structure or add to the quality of the products.

        We next ask whether Volkswagen and Audi's marks, as they appear on Auto
Gold's products, perform some function such that the " `exclusive use of [the marks]
would put competitors at a significant non-reputation-related disadvantage.' "
TrafFix, 532 U.S. at 32 (quoting Qualitex, 514 U.S. at 165). As an initial matter, Auto
Gold's proffered rational--that the trademarks "constitute[ ] the actual benefit the
consumer wishes to purchase"--flies in the face of existing caselaw. We have squarely
rejected the notion that "any feature of a product which contributes to the
consumer appeal and saleability of the product is, as a matter of law, a functional
element of that product." Vuitton, 644 F.2d at 773. Such a rule would eviscerate the
very competitive policies that functionality seeks to protect. This approach is
consistent with the view of our sister circuits. See e.g., Pebble Beach Co. v. Tour 18 I
Ltd., 155 F.3d 526, 539 (5th Cir.1998) ("To define functionality based upon
commercial success ... does not promote innovation, nor does it promote
competition.") superceded on other grounds as recognized in Eppendorf-Netheler-Hinz, 289
F.3d at 356; W.T. Rogers Co. v. Keene, 778 F.2d 334, 341-43 (7th Cir.1985); Keene
Corp. v. Paraflex Indus., Inc., 653 F.2d 822, 825 (3d Cir.1981) ("The difficulty with
accepting such a broad view of aesthetic functionality, which relates the doctrine to
the commercial desirability of the feature at issue without consideration of its
utilitarian function, is that it provides a disincentive for development of imaginative
and attractive design. The more appealing the design, the less protection it would
receive.").

        Even viewing Auto Gold's position generously, the rule it advocates injects
unwarranted breadth into our caselaw. Pagliero, Job's Daughters, and their progeny
were careful to prevent "the use of a trademark to monopolize a design feature
which, in itself and apart from its identification of source, improves the usefulness or
appeal of the object it adorns." Vuitton, 644 F.2d at 774 (discussing Pagliero, 198 F.2d

                                                    154
339) (emphasis added). The concept of an "aesthetic" function that is non-
trademark-related has enjoyed only limited application. In practice, aesthetic
functionality has been limited to product features that serve an aesthetic purpose
wholly independent of any source-identifying function. See Qualitex, 514 U.S. at 166
(coloring dry cleaning pads served nontrademark purpose by avoiding visible stains);
Publications Int'l, Ltd. v. Landoll, Inc., 164 F.3d 337, 342 (7th Cir.1998) (coloring
edges of cookbook pages served nontrademark purpose by avoiding color "bleeding"
between pages); Brunswick Corp. v. British Seagull Ltd., 35 F.3d 1527, 1532
(Fed.Cir.1994) (color black served nontrademark purpose by reducing the apparent
size of outboard boat engine); Pagliero, 198 F.2d at 343 (china patterns at issue were
attractive and served nontrademark purpose because "one of the essential selling
features of hotel china, if, indeed, not the primary, is the design").

        It is difficult to extrapolate from cases involving a true aesthetically
functional feature, like a box shape or certain uses of color, to cases involving well-
known registered logos and company names, which generally have no function apart
from their association with the trademark holder. The present case illustrates the
point well, as the use of Volkswagen and Audi's marks is neither aesthetic nor
independent of source identification. That is to say, there is no evidence that
consumers buy Auto Gold's products solely because of their "intrinsic" aesthetic
appeal. Instead, the alleged aesthetic function is indistinguishable from and tied to
the mark's source-identifying nature.

        By Auto Gold's strident admission, consumers want "Audi" and
"Volkswagen" accessories, not beautiful accessories. This consumer demand is
difficult to quarantine from the source identification and reputation-enhancing
value of the trademarks themselves. See Playboy Enters., Inc. v. Netscape Commc'ns
Corp., 354 F.3d 1020, 1030-31 (9th Cir.2004) ("Nothing about the marks used to
identify [the trademark holder's] products is a functional part of the design of those
products.... The fact that the marks make [the junior user's product] more
functional is irrelevant."). The demand for Auto Gold's products is inextricably tied
to the trademarks themselves. See Qualitex, 514 U.S. at 170, 115 S.Ct. 1300
(identifying "legitimate (nontrademark-related ) competition" as the relevant focus in
determining functionality) (emphasis added).9 Any disadvantage Auto Gold claims

          9 Auto Gold complains that if precluded from using the famous marks, it would be unable to

compete in the market for auto accessories bearing Volkswagen and Audi's marks. This argument is just

another way of saying "If I can't trade on your trademark, I can't compete." But this argument has no traction

here because the mark is not a functional feature that places a competitor at a "significant non-reputation-

related advantage." TrafFix, 532 U.S. at 33.

                                                    155
in not being able to sell Volkswagen or Audi marked goods is tied to the reputation
and association with Volkswagen and Audi.

        In the end, we take comfort that the doctrine of aesthetic functionality, as we
apply it in this case, has simply returned from whence it came. The 1938
Restatement of Torts includes this reminder of the difference between an aesthetic
function and a trademark function:

        A feature which merely associates goods with a particular source may be, like
        a trade-mark or trade name, a substantial factor in increasing the
        marketability of the goods. But if that is the entire significance of the feature,
        it is non-functional; for its value then lies only in the demand for goods
        associated with a particular source rather than for goods of a particular
        design.

Restatement of Torts § 742, comment a (1938). Volkswagen and Audi's trademarks
undoubtedly increase the marketability of Auto Gold's products. But their "entire
significance" lies in the demand for goods bearing those non-functional marks.
Today, as in 1938, such poaching is not countenanced by the trademark laws.

        We hold that Volkswagen and Audi's marks are not functional aspects of
Auto Gold's products. These marks, which are registered and have achieved
incontestable status, are properly protected under the Lanham Act against
infringement, dilution, false designation of source and other misappropriations.

                                              Notes

        The "the death knell for trademark protection." Do you agree with the court that
allowing an aesthetic functionality defense would have destroyed the trademarks at
issue? Is that a necessary consequence? Or could the holding have been more
limited? In that light, consider the following:*

        [While the trademark infringement claim was based on an expansion of the
        traditional trademark cause of action, which the court accepted uncritically,
        n]o similar flexibility accompanied the court's analysis and rejection of the
        aesthetic functionality defense. Part of the problem stemmed from the fact
        that in the typical case, the functionality defense is strong medicine. The
        defendant's contention normally is that the mark in question does not merit
        protection. But the defendant could have made a different conceptual claim

          * From Michael Grynberg, Things Are Worse Than We Think: Trademark Defenses in a "Formalist" Age,
24 Berkeley Tech. L.J. 897 (2009) (footnotes omitted).

                                                    156
        in Au-Tomotive Gold. That the carmaker logos were functional in context need
        not have undermined their distinctiveness as marks. For the panel, however,
        the broad strokes of the functionality doctrine suggested an extreme
        outcome--the loss of trademark protection for Volkswagen's and Audi's
        logos--which would have meant the "death knell for trademark protection."

        What is telling is that the court showed no inclination to adjust trademark
        defenses to accommodate a practice that arguably offers consumers the
        benefits of enhanced price competition. The court never considered the
        prospect that the functionality doctrine could be malleable enough to
        recognize functionality in the limited context of an adjacent market without
        endangering the protectability of the plaintiffs' marks in their core markets--
        where the marks do perform a source-identifying function--because to do so
        would render the "aesthetic function . . . indistinguishable from and tied to
        the mark's source-identifying nature."

        A problem of functionality or distinctiveness? Query whether the problem in
aesthetic functionality cases is not so much that an attractive feature is functional
(as in it might threaten competition) rather than non-distinctive? The TMEP excerpt
quoted above reflects this concern. In this vein, consider Professor McCarthy's
attack on the notion of aesthetic functionality:

        Advocates of the theory of aesthetic functionality will often use the 1938
        Restatement's example of a Valentine's Day candy box in the shape of a
        heart to help prove their theory. The assumption is that no one candy
        purveyor should have the legal right to exclusive use of a heart-shaped candy
        box and that only the theory of aesthetic functionality can accomplish the
        job of preventing such an unfair result. My response is that there is no need
        to invent a theory of "aesthetic functionality" to achieve the desired result.
        One way to bar a heart-shaped candy box from trade dress status is to invoke
        the traditional utilitarian functionality rule. The heart shape is just as
        "utilitarian" from a marketing viewpoint as any engineering analysis of
        rectangular versus circular box sizes and shipping stability and cost of
        manufacture. Or, to forego the whole functionality view, a heart-shaped
        candy box is such a standard, oft-used shape as to be a "generic" shape,
        incapable of trade dress status. Or, as suggested above, no one candy seller
        could ever prove that it had achieved trademark status and not just
        decorative appeal, in such a hackneyed design as candy box in the shape of a
        heart. A heart-shaped candy box is no more capable of trade dress protection
        under any of these alternatives to "aesthetic functionality" than would be
        Christmas wrapping paper in red and green showing images of Santa Claus.

                                                    157
        Trademark law and policy does not need the theory of "aesthetic
        functionality." The policy it purports to serve can be more fairly and
        accurately performed by the tried and true rule of "merely ornamental,"
        where customer perception is the guide, not a court's notion of what is "an
        important ingredient in the commercial success of the product."
1 MCCARTHY § 7:81; cf. id. § 7:82 (arguing against a notion of "defensive" aesthetic
functionality as properly handled under likelihood-of-confusion analysis).
        But what if the bar on mere ornamental features is not observed (or is
insufficiently robust--do we know what is ornamental?)? Could underenforcement
of one doctrine necessitate the creation of another? And what does it mean to be
"`utilitarian' from a marketing viewpoint"? Aesthetically pleasing? Ornamental?
        Fair competition? Leaving aside your opinion of the Ninth Circuit's analysis in
Au-Tomotive Gold, do you think the defendant's conduct should have been enjoined?
What are the consequences of doing so? If you agree with the plaintiffs, what
underlying theories of trademark are you employing? Same question if you support
the defendant. Is Au-tomotive Gold fundamentally just an anti-free riding opinion?
        What kind of marks? Do your views of aesthetic functionality depend on the
kind of mark at issue? Should logos, for example, be easier to protect than trade
dress?

8. Non-Traditional Marks

        May the following be trademarked?

        A perfume scent
        The quacking sound of a city tours given in "duck" boats (amphibious tour
        vehicles that can travel on both roads and water).
        A movie scene
        The interior design of a building; the exterior design of a building
        A book's title
        A book's content
        As you read on, think about what you think the answers should be and why.
Recall from our earlier readings that the Lanham Act excludes little from trademark
as a categorical matter.

                    Section 2 of the Lanham Act (15 U.S.C. § 1052)

        No trademark by which the goods of the applicant may be distinguished
from the goods of others shall be refused registration on the principal register on
account of its nature unless [statutory exclusions omitted]

       Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act (15 U.S.C. § 1125) (emphasis added)

        [Liability for use in commerce of] any word, term, name, symbol, or device, or any
combination thereof, or any false designation of origin, false or misleading description
of fact, or false or misleading representation of fact, which--

        (A) is likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive as to the
affiliation, connection, or association of such person with another person, or as to
the origin, sponsorship, or approval of his or her goods, services, or commercial
activities by another person, or

        (B) in commercial advertising or promotion, misrepresents the nature,
characteristics, qualities, or geographic origin of his or her or another person's
goods, services, or commercial activities . . .

                    Section 45 of the Lanham Act (15 U.S.C. § 1127)

                                                    159
        The term "trademark" includes any word, name, symbol, or device, or any
combination thereof . . . [used] to identify and distinguish . . . goods . . . from those
manufactured or sold by others and to indicate the source of the goods[.]"

The Intersection of Trademark and Copyright Law

        To this point, our reading has indicated few per se limits on trademark
subject matter. But are some matters simply incapable of identifying and
distinguishing a product in the marketplace? In addition, might some trademark
claims run afoul of other IP regimes?

        On this latter question, consider copyright law, which protects original works
of authorship fixed in a tangible medium of expression. Although it gives authors
powerful rights, copyright law also contains important limits. It denies protection to
ideas and permits some copying under the "fair use" doctrine. (The boundaries of
fair use are difficult to define, but some paradigmatic fair uses are copying as part of
a book review or commentary. The Supreme Court has held that home recording
television programming on a VCR in order to view it at a later time is fair use.)
Copyright law once required authors to take certain steps in order to obtain and
preserve a copyright. Failure to comply would place the work in the public domain.
Can an author circumvent these limitations by invoking trademark law?*

                  Dastar Corp. v. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp.
                                       539 U.S. 23 (2003)

Justice SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court.
        In this case, we are asked to decide whether § 43(a) of the Lanham Act, 15

U.S.C. § 1125(a), prevents the unaccredited copying of a work, and if so, whether a
court may double a profit award under § 1117(a), in order to deter future infringing
conduct.

                                                  I
        In 1948, three and a half years after the German surrender at Reims,
General Dwight D. Eisenhower completed Crusade in Europe, his written account
of the allied campaign in Europe during World War II. Doubleday published the
book, registered it with the Copyright Office in 1948, and granted exclusive
television rights to an affiliate of respondent Twentieth Century Fox Film
Corporation (Fox). Fox, in turn, arranged for Time, Inc., to produce a television

          * To the extent the discussion below implicates design, it is worth noting that design patents are
another avenue of protection. 35 U.S.C. § 171 provides that "[w]hoever invents any new, original, and
ornamental design for an article of manufacture may obtain a patent therefor." The term is fifteen years.

                                                    160
series, also called Crusade in Europe, based on the book, and Time assigned its
copyright in the series to Fox. The television series, consisting of 26 episodes, was
first broadcast in 1949. It combined a soundtrack based on a narration of the book
with film footage from the United States Army, Navy, and Coast Guard, the British
Ministry of Information and War Office, the National Film Board of Canada, and
unidentified "Newsreel Pool Cameramen." In 1975, Doubleday renewed the
copyright on the book as the " `proprietor of copyright in a work made for hire.' "
Fox, however, did not renew the copyright on the Crusade television series, which
expired in 1977, leaving the television series in the public domain.

        In 1988, Fox reacquired the television rights in General Eisenhower's book,
including the exclusive right to distribute the Crusade television series on video and
to sublicense others to do so. Respondents SFM Entertainment and New Line
Home Video, Inc., in turn, acquired from Fox the exclusive rights to distribute
Crusade on video. SFM obtained the negatives of the original television series,
restored them, and repackaged the series on videotape; New Line distributed the
videotapes.

        Enter petitioner Dastar. In 1995, Dastar decided to expand its product line
from music compact discs to videos. Anticipating renewed interest in World War II
on the 50th anniversary of the war's end, Dastar released a video set entitled World
War II Campaigns in Europe. To make Campaigns, Dastar purchased eight beta
cam tapes of the original version of the Crusade television series, which is in the
public domain, copied them, and then edited the series. Dastar's Campaigns series
is slightly more than half as long as the original Crusade television series. Dastar
substituted a new opening sequence, credit page, and final closing for those of the
Crusade television series; inserted new chapter-title sequences and narrated chapter
introductions; moved the "recap" in the Crusade television series to the beginning
and retitled it as a "preview"; and removed references to and images of the book.
Dastar created new packaging for its Campaigns series and (as already noted) a new
title.

        Dastar manufactured and sold the Campaigns video set as its own product.
The advertising states: "Produced and Distributed by: Entertainment Distributing "
(which is owned by Dastar), and makes no reference to the Crusade television series.
Similarly, the screen credits state "DASTAR CORP presents" and "an
ENTERTAINMENT DISTRIBUTING Production," and list as executive producer,
producer, and associate producer employees of Dastar. The Campaigns videos
themselves also make no reference to the Crusade television series, New Line's
Crusade videotapes, or the book. Dastar sells its Campaigns videos to Sam's Club,
Costco, Best Buy, and other retailers and mail-order companies for $25 per set,
substantially less than New Line's video set.

                                                    161
        In 1998, respondents Fox, SFM, and New Line brought this action alleging
that Dastar's sale of its Campaigns video set infringes Doubleday's copyright in
General Eisenhower's book and, thus, their exclusive television rights in the book.
Respondents later amended their complaint to add claims that Dastar's sale of
Campaigns "without proper credit" to the Crusade television series constitutes
"reverse passing off"1 in violation of § 43(a) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. §
1125(a), and in violation of state unfair-competition law. On cross-motions for
summary judgment, the District Court found for respondents on all three counts,
treating its resolution of the Lanham Act claim as controlling on the state-law
unfair-competition claim because "the ultimate test under both is whether the
public is likely to be deceived or confused." The court awarded Dastar's profits to
respondents and doubled them pursuant to § 35 of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. §
1117(a), to deter future infringing conduct by petitioner.

        The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the judgment for
respondents on the Lanham Act claim, but reversed as to the copyright claim and
remanded. (It said nothing with regard to the state-law claim.) With respect to the
Lanham Act claim, the Court of Appeals reasoned that "Dastar copied substantially
the entire Crusade in Europe series created by Twentieth Century Fox, labeled the
resulting product with a different name and marketed it without attribution to Fox[,
and] therefore committed a `bodily appropriation' of Fox's series." It concluded that
"Dastar's `bodily appropriation' of Fox's original [television] series is sufficient to
establish the reverse passing off."2 The court also affirmed the District Court's
award under the Lanham Act of twice Dastar's profits. We granted certiorari.

                                                 II
        The Lanham Act was intended to make "actionable the deceptive and
misleading use of marks," and "to protect persons engaged in ... commerce against
unfair competition." 15 U.S.C. § 1127. While much of the Lanham Act addresses
the registration, use, and infringement of trademarks and related marks, § 43(a), 15

          1 Passing off (or palming off, as it is sometimes called) occurs when a producer misrepresents his
own goods or services as someone else's. See, e.g., O. & W. Thum Co. v. Dickinson, 245 F. 609, 621 (C.A.6

1917). "Reverse passing off," as its name implies, is the opposite: The producer misrepresents someone else's

goods or services as his own. See, e.g., Williams v. Curtiss-Wright Corp., 691 F.2d 168, 172 (C.A.3 1982).

          2 As for the copyright claim, the Ninth Circuit held that the tax treatment General Eisenhower

sought for his manuscript of the book created a triable issue as to whether he intended the book to be a work
for hire, and thus as to whether Doubleday properly renewed the copyright in 1976. See 34 Fed.Appx., at
314. The copyright issue is still the subject of litigation, but is not before us. We express no opinion as to

whether petitioner's product would infringe a valid copyright in General Eisenhower's book.

                                                    162
U.S.C. § 1125(a) is one of the few provisions that goes beyond trademark
protection. As originally enacted, § 43(a) created a federal remedy against a person
who used in commerce either "a false designation of origin, or any false description
or representation" in connection with "any goods or services." As the Second
Circuit accurately observed with regard to the original enactment, however--and as
remains true after the 1988 revision--§ 43(a) "does not have boundless application
as a remedy for unfair trade practices," Alfred Dunhill, Ltd. v. Interstate Cigar Co., 499
F.2d 232, 237 (C.A.2 1974). "[B]ecause of its inherently limited wording, § 43(a)
can never be a federal `codification' of the overall law of `unfair competition,' " 4 J.
McCarthy, Trademarks and Unfair Competition § 27:7, p. 27-14 (4th ed. 2002)
(McCarthy), but can apply only to certain unfair trade practices prohibited by its
text.

        Although a case can be made that a proper reading of § 43(a), as originally
enacted, would treat the word "origin" as referring only "to the geographic location
in which the goods originated," Two Pesos, Inc. v. Taco Cabana, Inc., 505 U.S. 763,
777 (1992) (STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment),3 the Courts of Appeals
considering the issue, beginning with the Sixth Circuit, unanimously concluded
that it "does not merely refer to geographical origin, but also to origin of source or
manufacture," Federal-Mogul-Bower Bearings, Inc. v. Azoff, 313 F.2d 405, 408 (C.A.6
1963), thereby creating a federal cause of action for traditional trademark
infringement of unregistered marks. See 4 McCarthy § 27:14; Two Pesos, supra, at
768. Moreover, every Circuit to consider the issue found § 43(a) broad enough to
encompass reverse passing off. The Trademark Law Revision Act of 1988 made
clear that § 43(a) covers origin of production as well as geographic origin.4 Its

          3 In the original provision, the cause of action for false designation of origin was arguably "available

only to a person doing business in the locality falsely indicated as that of origin," 505 U.S., at 778, n. 3. As

adopted in 1946, § 43(a) provided in full:

          "Any person who shall affix, apply, or annex, or use in connection with any goods or services, or any

          container or containers for goods, a false designation of origin, or any false description or

          representation, including words or other symbols tending falsely to describe or represent the same,

          and shall cause such goods or services to enter into commerce, and any person who shall with

          knowledge of the falsity of such designation of origin or description or representation cause or

          procure the same to be transported or used in commerce or deliver the same to any carrier to be

          transported or used, shall be liable to a civil action by any person doing business in the locality

          falsely indicated as that of origin or the region in which said locality is situated, or by any person

          who believes that he is or is likely to be damaged by the use of any such false description or

          representation." 60 Stat. 441.

          4 Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act now provides:

                                                    163
language is amply inclusive, moreover, of reverse passing off--if indeed it does not
implicitly adopt the unanimous court-of-appeals jurisprudence on that subject. See,
e.g., ALPO Petfoods, Inc. v. Ralston Purina Co., 913 F.2d 958, 963-964, n. 6
(C.A.D.C.1990) (Thomas, J.).

        Thus, as it comes to us, the gravamen of respondents' claim is that, in
marketing and selling Campaigns as its own product without acknowledging its
nearly wholesale reliance on the Crusade television series, Dastar has made a "false
designation of origin, false or misleading description of fact, or false or misleading
representation of fact, which ... is likely to cause confusion ... as to the origin ... of
his or her goods." § 43(a). That claim would undoubtedly be sustained if Dastar had
bought some of New Line's Crusade videotapes and merely repackaged them as its
own. Dastar's alleged wrongdoing, however, is vastly different: It took a creative
work in the public domain--the Crusade television series--copied it, made
modifications (arguably minor), and produced its very own series of videotapes. If
"origin" refers only to the manufacturer or producer of the physical "goods" that are
made available to the public (in this case the videotapes), Dastar was the origin. If,
however, "origin" includes the creator of the underlying work that Dastar copied,
then someone else (perhaps Fox) was the origin of Dastar's product. At bottom, we
must decide what § 43(a)(1)(A) of the Lanham Act means by the "origin" of
"goods."

                                                III
        The dictionary definition of "origin" is "[t]he fact or process of coming into
being from a source," and "[t]hat from which anything primarily proceeds; source."
Webster's New International Dictionary 1720-1721 (2d ed.1949). And the

                     "Any person who, on or in connection with any goods or services, or any container for
                     goods, uses in commerce any word, term, name, symbol, or device, or any combination
                     thereof, or any false designation of origin, false or misleading description of fact, or false or
                     misleading representation of fact, which-

                     "(A) is likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive as to the affiliation,
                     connection, or association of such person with another person, or as to the origin,
                     sponsorship, or approval of his or her goods, services, or commercial activities by another
                     person, or

                     "(B) in commercial advertising or promotion, misrepresents the nature, characteristics,
                     qualities, or geographic origin of his or her or another person's goods, services, or

                     shall be liable in a civil action by any person who believes that he or she is or is likely to be
                     damaged by such act." 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a)(1).

                                                    164
dictionary definition of "goods" (as relevant here) is "[w]ares; merchandise." Id., at
1079. We think the most natural understanding of the "origin" of "goods"--the
source of wares--is the producer of the tangible product sold in the marketplace, in
this case the physical Campaigns videotape sold by Dastar. The concept might be
stretched (as it was under the original version of § 43(a))5 to include not only the
actual producer, but also the trademark owner who commissioned or assumed
responsibility for ("stood behind") production of the physical product. But as used
in the Lanham Act, the phrase "origin of goods" is in our view incapable of
connoting the person or entity that originated the ideas or communications that
"goods" embody or contain. Such an extension would not only stretch the text, but
it would be out of accord with the history and purpose of the Lanham Act and
inconsistent with precedent.

        Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act prohibits actions like trademark
infringement that deceive consumers and impair a producer's goodwill. It forbids,
for example, the Coca-Cola Company's passing off its product as Pepsi-Cola or
reverse passing off Pepsi-Cola as its product. But the brand-loyal consumer who
prefers the drink that the Coca-Cola Company or PepsiCo sells, while he believes
that that company produced (or at least stands behind the production of) that
product, surely does not necessarily believe that that company was the "origin" of
the drink in the sense that it was the very first to devise the formula. The consumer
who buys a branded product does not automatically assume that the brand-name
company is the same entity that came up with the idea for the product, or designed
the product--and typically does not care whether it is. The words of the Lanham Act
should not be stretched to cover matters that are typically of no consequence to
purchasers.

        It could be argued, perhaps, that the reality of purchaser concern is different
for what might be called a communicative product--one that is valued not primarily
for its physical qualities, such as a hammer, but for the intellectual content that it
conveys, such as a book or, as here, a video. The purchaser of a novel is interested
not merely, if at all, in the identity of the producer of the physical tome (the
publisher), but also, and indeed primarily, in the identity of the creator of the story

          5 Under the 1946 version of the Act, § 43(a) was read as providing a cause of action for trademark

infringement even where the trademark owner had not itself produced the goods sold under its mark, but

had licensed others to sell under its name goods produced by them--the typical franchise arrangement. This

stretching of the concept "origin of goods" is seemingly no longer needed: The 1988 amendments to § 43(a)

now expressly prohibit the use of any "word, term, name, symbol, or device," or "false or misleading

description of fact" that is likely to cause confusion as to "affiliation, connection, or association ... with

another person," or as to "sponsorship, or approval" of goods. 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a).

                                                    165
it conveys (the author). And the author, of course, has at least as much interest in
avoiding passing off (or reverse passing off) of his creation as does the publisher. For
such a communicative product (the argument goes) "origin of goods" in § 43(a)
must be deemed to include not merely the producer of the physical item (the
publishing house Farrar, Straus and Giroux, or the video producer Dastar) but also
the creator of the content that the physical item conveys (the author Tom Wolfe,
or--assertedly--respondents).

        The problem with this argument according special treatment to
communicative products is that it causes the Lanham Act to conflict with the law of
copyright, which addresses that subject specifically. The right to copy, and to copy
without attribution, once a copyright has expired, like "the right to make [an article
whose patent has expired]--including the right to make it in precisely the shape it
carried when patented--passes to the public." Sears, Roebuck & Co. v. Stiffel Co., 376
U.S. 225, 230 (1964); see also Kellogg Co. v. National Biscuit Co., 305 U.S. 111, 121-
122 (1938). "In general, unless an intellectual property right such as a patent or
copyright protects an item, it will be subject to copying." TrafFix Devices, Inc. v.
Marketing Displays, Inc., 532 U.S. 23, 29 (2001). The rights of a patentee or copyright
holder are part of a "carefully crafted bargain," Bonito Boats, Inc. v. Thunder Craft
Boats, Inc., 489 U.S. 141, 150-151 (1989), under which, once the patent or copyright
monopoly has expired, the public may use the invention or work at will and without
attribution. Thus, in construing the Lanham Act, we have been "careful to caution
against misuse or over-extension" of trademark and related protections into areas
traditionally occupied by patent or copyright. TrafFix, 532 U.S., at 29. "The Lanham
Act," we have said, "does not exist to reward manufacturers for their innovation in
creating a particular device; that is the purpose of the patent law and its period of
exclusivity." Id., at 34. Federal trademark law "has no necessary relation to invention
or discovery," In re Trade-Mark Cases, 100 U.S. 82, 94 (1879), but rather, by
preventing competitors from copying "a source-identifying mark," "reduce[s] the
customer's costs of shopping and making purchasing decisions," and "helps assure a
producer that it (and not an imitating competitor) will reap the financial,
reputation-related rewards associated with a desirable product," Qualitex Co. v.
Jacobson Products Co., 514 U.S. 159, 163-164 (1995) (internal quotation marks and
citation omitted). Assuming for the sake of argument that Dastar's representation of
itself as the "Producer" of its videos amounted to a representation that it originated
the creative work conveyed by the videos, allowing a cause of action under § 43(a)
for that representation would create a species of mutant copyright law that limits
the public's "federal right to `copy and to use' " expired copyrights, Bonito Boats,
supra, at 165.

        When Congress has wished to create such an addition to the law of
copyright, it has done so with much more specificity than the Lanham Act's

                                                    166
ambiguous use of "origin." The Visual Artists Rights Act of 1990, § 603(a), 104
Stat. 5128, provides that the author of an artistic work "shall have the right ... to
claim authorship of that work." 17 U.S.C. § 106A(a)(1)(A). That express right of
attribution is carefully limited and focused: It attaches only to specified "work[s] of
visual art," § 101, is personal to the artist, §§ 106A(b) and (e), and endures only for
"the life of the author," § 106A(d)(1). Recognizing in § 43(a) a cause of action for
misrepresentation of authorship of noncopyrighted works (visual or otherwise)
would render these limitations superfluous. A statutory interpretation that renders
another statute superfluous is of course to be avoided.

        Reading "origin" in § 43(a) to require attribution of uncopyrighted materials
would pose serious practical problems. Without a copyrighted work as the
basepoint, the word "origin" has no discernable limits. A video of the MGM film
Carmen Jones, after its copyright has expired, would presumably require attribution
not just to MGM, but to Oscar Hammerstein II (who wrote the musical on which
the film was based), to Georges Bizet (who wrote the opera on which the musical
was based), and to Prosper Merimee (who wrote the novel on which the opera was
based). In many cases, figuring out who is in the line of "origin" would be no simple
task. Indeed, in the present case it is far from clear that respondents have that
status. Neither SFM nor New Line had anything to do with the production of the
Crusade television series--they merely were licensed to distribute the video version.
While Fox might have a claim to being in the line of origin, its involvement with
the creation of the television series was limited at best. Time, Inc., was the principal,
if not the exclusive, creator, albeit under arrangement with Fox. And of course it
was neither Fox nor Time, Inc., that shot the film used in the Crusade television
series. Rather, that footage came from the United States Army, Navy, and Coast
Guard, the British Ministry of Information and War Office, the National Film
Board of Canada, and unidentified "Newsreel Pool Cameramen." If anyone has a
claim to being the original creator of the material used in both the Crusade
television series and the Campaigns videotapes, it would be those groups, rather
than Fox. We do not think the Lanham Act requires this search for the source of
the Nile and all its tributaries.

        Another practical difficulty of adopting a special definition of "origin" for
communicative products is that it places the manufacturers of those products in a
difficult position. On the one hand, they would face Lanham Act liability for failing
to credit the creator of a work on which their lawful copies are based; and on the
other hand they could face Lanham Act liability for crediting the creator if that
should be regarded as implying the creator's "sponsorship or approval" of the copy,
15 U.S.C. § 1125(a)(1)(A). In this case, for example, if Dastar had simply "copied
[the television series] as Crusade in Europe and sold it as Crusade in Europe,"
without changing the title or packaging (including the original credits to Fox), it is

                                                    167
hard to have confidence in respondents' assurance that they "would not be here on
a Lanham Act cause of action," Tr. of Oral Arg. 35.

        Finally, reading § 43(a) of the Lanham Act as creating a cause of action for,
in effect, plagiarism--the use of otherwise unprotected works and inventions
without attribution--would be hard to reconcile with our previous decisions. For
example, in Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Samara Brothers, Inc., 529 U.S. 205 (2000), we
considered whether product-design trade dress can ever be inherently distinctive.
Wal-Mart produced "knockoffs" of children's clothes designed and manufactured by
Samara Brothers, containing only "minor modifications" of the original designs. Id.,
at 208. We concluded that the designs could not be protected under § 43(a)
without a showing that they had acquired "secondary meaning," id., at 214, so that
they " `identify the source of the product rather than the product itself,' " id., at 211
(quoting Inwood Laboratories, Inc. v. Ives Laboratories, Inc., 456 U.S. 844, 851, n. 11
(1982)). This carefully considered limitation would be entirely pointless if the
"original" producer could turn around and pursue a reverse-passing-off claim under
exactly the same provision of the Lanham Act. Samara would merely have had to
argue that it was the "origin" of the designs that Wal-Mart was selling as its own
line. It was not, because "origin of goods" in the Lanham Act referred to the
producer of the clothes, and not the producer of the (potentially) copyrightable or
patentable designs that the clothes embodied.

        Similarly under respondents' theory, the "origin of goods" provision of §
43(a) would have supported the suit that we rejected in Bonito Boats, 489 U.S. 141,
where the defendants had used molds to duplicate the plaintiff's unpatented boat
hulls (apparently without crediting the plaintiff). And it would have supported the
suit we rejected in TrafFix: The plaintiff, whose patents on flexible road signs had
expired, and who could not prevail on a trade-dress claim under § 43(a) because the
features of the signs were functional, would have had a reverse-passing-off claim for
unattributed copying of his design.

        In sum, reading the phrase "origin of goods" in the Lanham Act in
accordance with the Act's common-law foundations (which were not designed to
protect originality or creativity), and in light of the copyright and patent laws (which
were), we conclude that the phrase refers to the producer of the tangible goods that
are offered for sale, and not to the author of any idea, concept, or communication
embodied in those goods. Cf. 17 U.S.C. § 202 (distinguishing between a
copyrighted work and "any material object in which the work is embodied"). To
hold otherwise would be akin to finding that § 43(a) created a species of perpetual
patent and copyright, which Congress may not do. See Eldred v. Ashcroft, 537 U.S.
186, 208 (2003).

        The creative talent of the sort that lay behind the Campaigns videos is not
left without protection. The original film footage used in the Crusade television

                                                    168
series could have been copyrighted, see 17 U.S.C. § 102(a)(6), as was copyrighted (as
a compilation) the Crusade television series, even though it included material from
the public domain, see § 103(a). Had Fox renewed the copyright in the Crusade
television series, it would have had an easy claim of copyright infringement. And
respondents' contention that Campaigns infringes Doubleday's copyright in
General Eisenhower's book is still a live question on remand. If, moreover, the
producer of a video that substantially copied the Crusade series were, in advertising
or promotion, to give purchasers the impression that the video was quite different
from that series, then one or more of the respondents might have a cause of action--
not for reverse passing off under the "confusion ... as to the origin" provision of §
43(a)(1)(A), but for misrepresentation under the "misrepresents the nature,
characteristics [or] qualities" provision of § 43(a)(1)(B). For merely saying it is the
producer of the video, however, no Lanham Act liability attaches to Dastar.

                                               * * *
        Because we conclude that Dastar was the "origin" of the products it sold as
its own, respondents cannot prevail on their Lanham Act claim. We thus have no
occasion to consider whether the Lanham Act permitted an award of double
petitioner's profits. The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is
reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this
opinion.
        It is so ordered.
        Justice BREYER took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.

                                              Notes

        Jurisprudence. How would you characterize the reasoning in Dastar? Do you
think the drafters of the Lanham Act contemplated its issue? If not, how should that
affect the outcome of the case?

        Fair to authors? Leaving aside your feelings about whether a reverse passing off
claim should have been available, what do you make of the Court's giving short
shrift to concerns of authorial integrity?

        This is an area where U.S. and European law are at odds. Continental
Europe has a strong tradition of "moral rights" law. Moral rights law allows authors
to claim authorship of their works, demand attribution, prevent misattribution, and
protect the integrity of their works (e.g., by preventing destruction in the case of a
painting). These rights exist in addition to the copyright, so a moral right may be
asserted even if the author has assigned the copyright. By contrast, United States law
has traditionally not provided for moral rights beyond the ability of copyright rights
to vindicate them. The Visual Artists Rights Act, 17 U.S.C. § 106A, which extends

                                                    169
rights of attribution and integrity to the creators of certain works of visual art, is an
exception.

        Note that Dastar uses the existence of § 106A to buttress its conclusion that
no similar rights exist for authors of other works. Was Dastar a good case to raise
the concern? How would you tweak the case's facts to bring the issue of authorial
integrity to the fore? Can you think of ways to reconcile the Court's concerns in
Dastar with authorial interests? Are such efforts worth it? What about the consumer
interest in purchasing from particular authors? Isn't trademark law supposed to be
about getting the product you want? Can another consumer information doctrine
fill the gap?

        Overreading Dastar? Refer back to the cause of action in § 43(a). Notice that it
contains a distinct provision that reaches false advertising. What if the plaintiffs in
Dastar had claimed that the defendants falsely suggested that their work was
affiliated with the plaintiffs? The reasoning of Dastar (resting on a statutory
construction of the term "origin") does not appear to preclude analogous false
advertising claims (assuming they otherwise meet the requirements of false
advertising law). That said, see 5 MCCARTHY ON TRADEMARKS AND UNFAIR
COMPETITION § 27:78 (5th ed.). But cf. Gensler v. Strabala, 764 F.3d 735 (7th Cir.
2014).

Other Non-traditional Marks

        Look at the text of § 2 of the Act. It (and the definition of a trademark in §
45) seems to welcome anything as a mark. So why would we ever withhold
trademark protection? One possible reason should be familiar by now. A trademark
claim might actually be an effort to prevent competition in functional subject
matter.

        Another objection is perhaps more fundamental. Trademarks identify and
distinguish products. Since we need them to do so (or at least we think we do)
should we then be skeptical of non-obviously distinguishing marks (assuming we
know them when we see them)? Similarly, might some exotic marks describe
product attributes rather than identify the product?

        Titles. In this vein, think of titles. Does Romeo and Juliet identify the work as
distinct from others? Sure, but it also describes the play directly (i.e., it is about
someone named Romeo and someone named Juliet). What does this imply? That's
right, titles are treated as descriptive marks and are not protectable absent secondary
meaning. Note that this is true even when the title is not directly descriptive of the
work. Could one say that any title is by definition descriptive (i.e., "the name of this

                                                    170
work is . . .")? Or at that level of generality are all trademarks in some sense
descriptive (i.e., "the source of this product is the owner of this mark")? Is the
distinction that each literary title refers to a work that is in some ways unique? Note
that the Trademark Office goes even further than traditional trademark law and
rejects efforts to register titles. TMEP § 1202.08; see also Herbko Intern., Inc. v.
Kappa Books, Inc., 308 F.3d 1156, 1163 n.2 (Fed. Cir. 2002) ("While titles of single
works are not registrable, they may be protected under section 43(a) of the Lanham
Act upon a showing of secondary meaning.").

        Series titles may, however, be registered. TMEP § 1202.08(c) also explains:

        The name of a series of books or other creative works may be registrable if it
        serves to identify and distinguish the source of the goods. An applicant must
        submit evidence that the title is used on at least two different creative works.
        A series is not established when only the format of the work is changed, that
        is, the same title used on a printed version of a book and a recorded version
        does not establish a series. See Mattel Inc. v. Brainy Baby Co., 101 USPQ2d
        1140, 1143 (TTAB 2011) (finding that a program recorded on both a VHS
        tape and a DVD were the same creative work, and that the addition of minor
        enhancements in the DVD did not transform this single work into a series).
        Likewise, use of the title on unabridged and abridged versions of the same
        work, or on collateral goods such as posters, mugs, bags, or t-shirts does not
        establish a series.

        For example, if an application for the mark HOW TO RETIRE EARLY for
        "books" is refused because the specimen shows the mark used on a single
        creative work, the applicant may submit copies of other book covers showing
        use of the mark HOW TO RETIRE EARLY and any additional evidence to
        establish that the book is published each year with different content. It is not
        necessary to show that the mark was used on the other works in the series
        prior to the filing date of the application or the allegation of use. However,
        evidence that the applicant intends to use the mark on a series is insufficient.

        Slogans. Some of the issues arising with marks based on titles also crop up
with respect to slogans. See, e.g., TMEP § 1213.05(b)(i) ("[I]if a mark consists entirely
of a slogan that is generic, merely descriptive, merely informational, or that is
otherwise not being used as a mark, registration must be refused."); id. § 1213(b)(iv)
("when an entire unitary phrase or slogan is generic, descriptive, or merely
informational, it remains unregistrable. To illustrate, `common laudatory phrases or
statements that would ordinarily be used in business or in the particular trade or
industry' are unregistrable despite the fact that they may be unitary phrases or

                                                    171
slogans. See In re Boston Beer Co. L.P., 198 F.3d 1370, 53 USPQ2d 1056 (Fed. Cir.
1999) (THE BEST BEER IN AMERICA for beer and ale)."); Damn I'm Good Inc.
v. Sakowitz, Inc., 514 F. Supp. 1357 (S.D.N.Y. 1981) (concluding that "DAMN I'M
GOOD" when inscribed on bracelets lacked significance as a source-identifier
absent secondary meaning).

        Scents. Would you allow the protection of a scent? The Trademark Office
would.

        TMEP 1202.13 Scent, Fragrance, or Flavor

        The scent of a product may be registrable if it is used in a nonfunctional
        manner. See In re Clarke, 17 USPQ2d 1238, 1239-40 (TTAB 1990) (holding
        that the scent of plumeria blossoms functioned as a mark for "sewing thread
        and embroidery yarn"). Scents that serve a utilitarian purpose, such as the
        scent of perfume or an air freshener, are functional and not registrable. . . .
        The amount of evidence required to establish that a scent or fragrance
        functions as a mark is substantial.

        Note, however, that both concerns about registration of non-traditional
marks crop up. In particular, note the evidentiary hurdle that the office places on
registering a scent mark. Is the game worth the candle? The same section of the
TEMP also alludes to the unlikely possibility of a flavor mark.

        Flavor. Just as with a scent or fragrance, a flavor can never be inherently
        distinctive because it is generally seen as a characteristic of the goods. In re
        Pohl-Boskamp GmbH & Co., 106 USPQ2d at 1048 (finding that peppermint
        flavor mark for "pharmaceutical formulations of nitroglycerin" failed to
        function as a mark); In re N.V. Organon, 79 USPQ2d 1639 (TTAB 2006)
        (affirming refusal to register "an orange flavor" for "pharmaceuticals for
        human use, namely, antidepressants in quick-dissolving tablets and pills," on
        the grounds that the proposed mark was functional under §2(e)(5) and failed
        to function as a mark within the meaning of §§1, 2, and 45 of the
        Trademark Act). The Board has observed that it is unclear how a flavor could
        function as a source indicator because flavor or taste generally performs a
        utilitarian function and consumers generally have no access to a product's
        flavor or taste prior to purchase. Id. at 1650-51. Thus, an application to
        register a flavor "requires a substantial showing of acquired distinctiveness."

the NBC three-tone chimes and the MGM Lion's roar. How would you draw the

Problems

        1. Behold the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame:

        You might notice that a representation of the building is being used as a logo
at the bottom left-hand of the poster. Assume that to whatever extent the building
can be used as a trademark that the museum owns the mark. Do the museum's
rights let it sue a photographer who sells a poster (created by and from a picture

                                                    173

consumers believe that the museum is the source of such posters?

        2. Stargazer entertainment distributes karaoke video tracks that provide
music, words, and visual images to accompany participants at karaoke bars to sing
along to favorite songs. When displayed, the videos contain a Stargazer logo visible

Enterprise bar (which also offers karaoke) gets a hold of a Stargazer disc and copies
it onto a hard drive. It then uses the hard drive to display the tracks to Enterprise
patrons. Does Stargazer have a trademark claim against Enterprise or does Dastar
control?

9. Obtaining Trademark Rights Through
Use of the Mark

Problem

        Strisk Technologies markets a tablet computer under the UNIVERSITY
mark. Because the tablet had a particularly bright light that indicated when its Wi-Fi
function was activated, its users started calling it the "firefly" tablet. Strisk now
wants to claim a trademark in FIREFLY. Before it can act, however, Boomer
Computer (a competitor) filed an intent-to-use application for the FIREFLY mark
under section 1(b) of the Lanham Act (reprinted below). Another competitor,
Sooner Computer also would like to market a "firefly" tablet. It has yet to make any
sales, but it has begun a "buzz" marketing campaign built around ads in which
people sit down to coffee and are joined by an animated illuminated firefly that
buzzes around the room leaving a train of light. As the screen fades out, the coffee
drinkers exchange meaningful glances, smile, and whisper intensely, "Firefly!" As
the screen fades to black, the title appears, "Changing Everything . . . coming soon."

        The reading should let you figure out the basis of claims of priority for the
three companies. As a matter of trademark policy (not doctrine) who do you think
should (not will) prevail and be awarded the registration?

Statutory Provisions

        This chapter is about the acquisition of trademark rights. As you will see,
American trademark rights are largely based on use. One needs to use a trademark
in order to secure rights in the mark. Use also usually establishes one's priority in a
trademark. If I am the first to use EAGLE as a mark for widgets, that will usually
mean that I will have rights to the mark that are superior to one using the same
mark on widgets after I commence use. As § 1(b) of the Lanham Act makes clear,
however, there is a potential exception if someone else previously filed an "intent-to-
use" application for the mark and then perfected that application with a use in
commerce within the time frame set forth by the statute. Stated another way, the
ITU allows one to establish a place in line, but there still needs to be a use for
trademark rights to exist.

        This leads to interesting questions about what is a valid "use," which are
explored below, but let's first review the relevant statutory provisions.

                                                    175
                           Lanham Act § 45 (15 U.S.C. § 1127)
        The term "use in commerce" means the bona fide use of a mark in the
ordinary course of trade, and not made merely to reserve a right in a mark. For
purposes of this Act, a mark shall be deemed to be in use in commerce--
        (1) on goods when--

                (A) it is placed in any manner on the goods or their containers or the
        displays associated therewith or on the tags or labels affixed thereto, or if the
        nature of the goods makes such placement impracticable, then on
        documents associated with the goods or their sale, and

                (B) the goods are sold or transported in commerce, and
        (2) on services when it is used or displayed in the sale or advertising of
services and the services are rendered in commerce, or the services are rendered in
more than one State or in the United States and a foreign country and the person
rendering the services is engaged in commerce in connection with the services.

                            Lanham Act § 1 (15 U.S.C. § 1051)
        (a)(1) The owner of a trademark used in commerce may request registration
of its trademark on the principal register hereby established by paying the prescribed
fee and filing in the Patent and Trademark Office an application and a verified
statement, in such form as may be prescribed by the Director, and such number of
specimens or facsimiles of the mark as used as may be required by the Director.
        (2) The application shall include . . . the date of the applicant's first use of
the mark, the date of the applicant's first use of the mark in commerce, the goods in
connection with which the mark is used, and a drawing of the mark . . . .
        (b)(1) A person who has a bona fide intention, under circumstances showing
the good faith of such person, to use a trademark in commerce may request
registration of its trademark on the principal register hereby established by paying
the prescribed fee and filing in the Patent and Trademark Office an application and
a verified statement, in such form as may be prescribed by the Director. . . .
        (d) Verified statement that trademark is used in commerce.
        (1)Within six months after the date on which the notice of allowance with
respect to a mark is issued under section 13(b)(2) [15 USC 1063(b)(2)] to an
applicant under subsection (b) of this section, the applicant shall file in the Patent
and Trademark Office, together with such number of specimens or facsimiles of the
mark as used in commerce as may be required by the Director and payment of the
prescribed fee, a verified statement that the mark is in use in commerce and
specifying the date of the applicant's first use of the mark in commerce and those
goods or services specified in the notice of allowance on or in connection with
which the mark is used in commerce. Subject to examination and acceptance of the

                                                    176
statement of use, the mark shall be registered in the Patent and Trademark Office, a
certificate of registration shall be issued for those goods or services recited in the
statement of use for which the mark is entitled to registration, and notice of
registration shall be published in the Official Gazette of the Patent and Trademark
Office. Such examination may include an examination of the factors set forth in
subsections (a) through (e) of section 2 [15 USC 1052]. The notice of registration
shall specify the goods or services for which the mark is registered.

        (2)The Director shall extend, for one additional 6-month period, the time for
filing the statement of use under paragraph (1), upon written request of the
applicant before the expiration of the 6-month period provided in paragraph (1). In
addition to an extension under the preceding sentence, the Director may, upon a
showing of good cause by the applicant, further extend the time for filing the
statement of use under paragraph (1) for periods aggregating not more than 24
months, pursuant to written request of the applicant made before the expiration of
the last extension granted under this paragraph. Any request for an extension under
this paragraph shall be accompanied by a verified statement that the applicant has a
continued bona fide intention to use the mark in commerce and specifying those
goods or services identified in the notice of allowance on or in connection with
which the applicant has a continued bona fide intention to use the mark in
commerce. Any request for an extension under this paragraph shall be accompanied
by payment of the prescribed fee. The Director shall issue regulations setting forth
guidelines for determining what constitutes good cause for purposes of this
paragraph. . . .

                         Lanham Act § 7(c) (15 U.S.C. § 1057(c)):
        Application to register mark considered constructive use. Contingent on the
registration of a mark on the principal register provided by this Act, the filing of the
application to register such mark shall constitute constructive use of the mark,
conferring a right of priority, nationwide in effect, on or in connection with the
goods or services specified in the registration against any other person except for a
person whose mark has not been abandoned and who, prior to such filing--
        (1) has used the mark;
        (2) has filed an application to register the mark which is pending or has
resulted in registration of the mark; or
        (3) has filed a foreign application to register the mark on the basis of which
he or she has acquired a right of priority, and timely files an application under
section 44(d) [15 USC 1126(d)] to register the mark which is pending or has
resulted in registration of the mark.

Establishing Trademark Rights Through Use

                            FN Herstal SA v. Clyde Armory Inc.
                               838 F.3d 1071 (11th Cir. 2016)

COOGLER:
        This trademark infringement action arises out of the parties' use of the

marks "SCAR" and "SCAR-Stock" in the firearms industry. . . .
                                      I. BACKGROUND
                                             A. Facts
                                      1. FN's SCAR Mark

        In January 2004, the United States Special Operations Command
("USSOCOM") issued a solicitation requesting bids from firearms manufacturers to
design and manufacture a new fully automatic assault-rifle system for various units
of the United States military, including Navy SEALs, Army Rangers, and Green
Berets. The solicitation and other documents referred to the rifle as the "Special
Operations Forces Combat Assault Rifle," abbreviated with the acronym SCAR.
However, the U.S. military did not use SCAR as a trademark or otherwise claim any
rights in the name SCAR. The solicitation generated significant publicity and media
coverage in the firearms community, as it was the first open competition for a new
military rifle since the M16 trials held in the 1960s.

        FN is a firearms and weapons manufacturer headquartered in Belgium. In
2004, FN and other firearm manufacturers, including Colt Defense LLC and Cobb
Manufacturing, Inc., submitted prototypes in response to USSOCOM's solicitation.
While not required to do so, FN chose to label its submission with the SCAR mark,
placing the mark above the firearm's trigger. FN branded its rifles as such to draw
on the double entendre from the military's use of the term and the everyday
meaning of "scar" as a mark left by the healing of injured tissue. For instance, FN's
brochures and other promotional materials drew on the ordinary meaning of "scar"
through slogans like "BATTLE SCARS."

        On November 5, 2004, FN won the competition, and USSOCOM awarded
it a ten-year contract, placing a large initial order for SCAR firearms totaling over
$634,000. From that point forward, FN regularly shipped SCAR-branded rifles to
the U.S. military for use by special forces. By November 2007, FN had sold over $11
million in SCAR rifles and accessories to the military pursuant to the USSOCOM
contract.

        The media, law enforcement, and civilian firearms consumers closely
followed the USSOCOM competition and FN's development of the SCAR rifle. In
the years 2004 to 2006, journalists regularly sought to examine FN's SCAR rifles,
and at least one article per month covered FN's development and distribution of
the SCAR rifle in publications such as Small Arms Review, National Defense, Army

                                                    178
Times, and Guns and Ammo. As the district court found, an expectation exists in the
firearms market that guns developed for the military will subsequently be offered to
law enforcement and civilians. As a result, FN received many inquiries concerning
when FN's SCAR rifles would be available for general consumption.

        On February 22, 2005, FN began promoting its SCAR rifle to law
enforcement and civilians, though it did not yet have a semi-automatic version of
the weapon available for purchase by civilian consumers. Indeed, FN dedicated one-
fourth of its advertising budget to promote the SCAR rifle to the firearms market.
Throughout 2005 and 2006, FN showcased its military SCAR rifle at hundreds of
trade shows, including one of the largest firearms shows in the world, the Shooting,
Hunting, and Outdoor Trade Show ("SHOT Show"), as well as National Rifle
Association shows, the National Defense Industrial Association Small Arms forum,
the Association of the United States Army show, International Chiefs of Police
shows, the National Sheriff Show, the Mock Prison Riot, the SWAT Round Up, the
Police and Security Expo, and others. At these shows, FN routinely told attendees
that it intended to introduce a semi-automatic version within two years. FN also
distributed hats, T-shirts, key chains, brochures, flyers, and other promotional
materials with the SCAR mark. Public interest in the rifle was high; for example, at
the February 2006 SHOT Show held in Las Vegas, Nevada, hundreds of people
lined up at FN's booth to see FN's SCAR rifle, and FN had to dedicate three
employees to answering attendees' nonstop questions about its weapon. According
to Bucky Mills, the Senior Director of Law Enforcement Sales and Training at FN,
FN's SCAR rifle was "big news" and was "the number one talked about firearm at
the whole SHOT Show in 2006." The fact that ninety percent of SHOT Show
attendees are not affiliated with the U.S. military but are instead comprised of law
enforcement personnel, distributors and retailers of firearms, and civilian
consumers, speaks to the excitement among civilians about the prospect that FN
would be introducing a semi-automatic SCAR rifle. In March 2006, FN issued a
press release entitled, "The Making of the 21st Century Assault Rifle: SCAR SOF
Combat Assault Rifle," which detailed the ongoing development of its SCAR rifle
for USSOCOM. The press release also announced that the semi-automatic version
of the SCAR "[would] potentially be available in the next two years."

        FN was not able to release the civilian version of the SCAR rifle until
November 2008 because, according to the testimony of Frank Spaniel ("Spaniel"),
the Assistant Vice President of Research and Development at FN, it took several
years to test the prototypes in various environments, make modifications that would
prevent a civilian from converting it into a fully automatic weapon, and ensure that
its factories could produce increasing quantities of the weapons while maintaining
quality. FN also had to seek government approval from the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (the "ATF") to sell the semi-automatic SCAR to

                                                    179
the wider commercial market, which took months. Finally, FN was contractually
obligated to fill military orders before satisfying civilian demand for the weapon.
However, the pent-up demand from 2004 to 2008 resulted in FN selling over $100
million worth of SCAR firearms after receiving ATF approval.

         To enforce its rights in the SCAR mark, FN filed three trademark
applications with the United States Patent and Trademark Office ("USPTO"). The
first was for the use of SCAR on firearms and related items, which at the point of
the district court proceedings was still pending before the USPTO. The second was
for SCAR (and Design) for use in connection with firearms and related items,
which indicated a date of first use of November 1, 2008. The USPTO registered the
SCAR and Design mark in June 2010. The third was for SCAR for use in
connection with games, toy replicas of weapons, and other related items, which was
registered by the USPTO in February 2012.

                           2. Clyde Armory's SCAR-Stock Mark
        Clyde Armory is a firearms retailer located in Georgia owned by Andrew
Clyde ("Clyde"). Clyde has been in the firearms business since 1991. He has long
been familiar with FN, having sold FN products since 2002. He was also an FN
distributor from approximately 2006 to 2011.
        In 2005, Clyde contacted Sage International, Ltd. ("Sage") President John
Klein ("Klein") about manufacturing a replacement stock for certain rifles made by
Sturm Ruger & Co., including the Mini-14, Mini-30, and AC-556. At the
February 2006 SHOT Show, the same show in which long lines of attendees waited
to see FN's SCAR rifle, the two met and planned the specific configuration for this
replacement stock.
        In April 2006, Clyde Armory selected the name SCAR-Stock or SCAR-
CQB-Stock in connection with its replacement stocks. Clyde Armory claims that its
use of the term SCAR is an acronym for "Sage Clyde Armory Rifle" stock. However,
Klein had no recollection of this. At the time Clyde Armory adopted the SCAR-
Stock mark, Clyde knew about the USSOCOM solicitation to create a combat rifle
system. Clyde further knew that the rifle was abbreviated as the SCAR, and that
USSOCOM had awarded FN the development contract to produce it, as he had
seen an article in Small Arms Review announcing that FN won the bid to create the
SCAR for USSOCOM.
        Joshua Smith ("Smith"), Clyde Armory's former Chief Operations Officer,
testified that FN's SCAR rifle was well known in the firearms world. He stated that
when Clyde disclosed his plan to use SCAR-Stock in association with its stocks,
Smith expressed concern that the SCAR "name was already taken ... [b]y FN."
Smith testified that Clyde Armory's intent was to "take advantage of marketing of
the SCAR being a popular name already" and to "take advantage of the SCAR
product name being on the market." Although Clyde testified that such a discussion

                                                    180
never occurred, and although Smith left Clyde Armory in 2009 under bad
circumstances, the district court found Smith's testimony credible in light of Clyde's
admitted knowledge about FN's SCAR rifles.

        Throughout the spring and summer of 2006, Clyde Armory worked with
Sage to finalize its replacement stock system, and it shipped its first SCAR-Stock
product to a consumer on September 18, 2006. The stocks were engraved with the
mark SCAR-CQB-Stock in the same font, color, and size as the SCAR mark on
FN's rifles, using a laser just as FN used. Clyde Armory began promoting SCAR-
Stock stocks through its website www.clydearmory.com, online advertising, print
ads, and trade show displays. In early 2007, it began using the domain name
www.scarstock.com, which channels Internet traffic to www.clydearmory.com.
Through April 2015, Clyde Armory had sold 913 SCAR-Stock units, for a total
gross revenue of approximately $450,000.

                                    B. Procedural History
        . . . .
        [FN brought infringement and related claims against Clyde Armory. Clyde
Armory defended by claiming priority of its use of the SCAR-Stock mark. After a
bench trial, the district court held that FN had priority to the SCAR mark and
ruled in FN's favor on the merits. Clyde Armory appealed on a number of issues,
including the question of priority.]

                                       II. DISCUSSION
        . . .
   1. The District Court's Finding that FN Used the SCAR Mark in Commerce

                   before Clyde Armory Used the SCAR-Stock Mark
        A trademark on goods is used in commerce when "it is placed in any manner
on the goods or their containers or the displays associated therewith [and] the goods
are sold or transported in commerce." 15 U.S.C. § 1127. "Rights in a trademark are
determined by the date of the mark's first use in commerce. The party who first uses
a mark in commerce is said to have priority over other users." Hana Fin., Inc. v.
Hana Bank, --- U.S. ----, 135 S.Ct. 907, 909 (2015). We review the district
court's factual findings underlying its priority determination for clear error. . . .
        This Court uses a two-part test to determine whether a party has
demonstrated prior use of a mark in commerce:
        [E]vidence showing, first, adoption, and, second, use in a way sufficiently
        public to identify or distinguish the marked goods in an appropriate segment
        of the public mind as those of the adopter of the mark, is competent to
        establish ownership, even without evidence of actual sales.

Planetary Motion[, Inc. v. Techsplosion, Inc.,], 261 F.3d [1188,] 1195 [(11th Cir. 2001)]
(quoting New Eng. Duplicating Co. v. Mendes, 190 F.2d 415, 418 (1st Cir. 1951))

                                                    181
(footnotes omitted). The typical evidence of use in commerce is the sale of goods
bearing the mark. However, in the absence of actual sales, advertising, publicity, and
solicitation can sufficiently meet the public identification prong of the test. The
district court and the parties use the term "analogous use" to describe these
promotional efforts, which is derived from other courts' analysis of this issue. See,
e.g., Am. Express Co. v. Goetz, 515 F.3d 156, 161 (2d Cir. 2008) ("[T]he analogous use
doctrine, where it applies, eases the technical requirements for trademarks and
services marks in favor of a competing claimant who asserts priority on the basis of
earlier analogous use of the mark."); T.A.B. Sys. v. Pactel Teletrac, 77 F.3d 1372, 1375
(Fed. Cir. 1996) (analogous use refers to pre-sale promotional efforts such as
"advertising brochures, catalogs, newspaper ads, and articles in newspapers and
trade publications"). However, "activities claimed to constitute analogous use must
have substantial impact on the purchasing public." T.A.B. Sys., 77 F.3d at 1376. "At
the very least analogous use must be use that is open and notorious [or] of such a
nature and extent that the mark has become popularized in the public mind so that
the relevant segment of the public identifies the marked goods with the mark's
adopter." Goetz, 515 F.3d at 161-62 (internal quotation marks and citations
omitted). The promotional activities must also occur within a commercially
reasonable period of time prior to actual use of the mark to be considered
analogous use of the mark. See id. at 162.

        Considerable evidence supports the district court's factual finding that FN
used the SCAR mark in commerce prior to Clyde Armory's first sale of a
replacement stock bearing the SCAR-Stock mark September 2006. On November
5, 2004, USSOCOM entered into a ten-year contract with FN and ordered SCAR
brand rifles in an amount totaling over $634,000. Thereafter, FN continuously sold
and transported firearms bearing its SCAR mark from Belgium to USSOCOM in
the United States for use by military special forces. By November 5, 2007, FN had
sold over $11 million worth of SCAR firearms and accessories to the military
pursuant to the USSOCOM contract. All the while, FN received extensive media
attention, which credited FN with winning the USSOCOM bid and tracked the
development of FN's SCAR weapon system for the military. Clyde Armory asserts
that FN's sales solely to one governmental entity should not constitute "use in
commerce," but these facts support the district court's conclusion that FN's sales to
the military were nonetheless "sufficiently public to identify or distinguish the
marked goods in an appropriate segment of the public mind as those of [FN,] the
adopter of the mark." Planetary Motion, 261 F.3d at 1195.

        Nor does the fact that FN did not have a semi-automatic SCAR weapon
available for law enforcement and civilian purchase until late 2008 change our
analysis because, in addition to military sales, FN established prior use through
analogous use: that is, extensive pre-sale advertising and promotional activities for

                                                    182
its semi-automatic SCAR rifle dating back to 2005. Almost immediately after it
began shipping and selling to USSOCOM, FN started marketing SCAR brand rifles
to law enforcement and civilians, dedicating one-fourth of its advertising budget to
showcase its SCAR rifles at hundreds of trade shows and events in 2005 and 2006,
including the February 2006 SHOT Show where its SCAR rifle was "the number
one talked about firearm," further promoting the SCAR rifles with accompanying
hats, T-shirts, keychains, brochures, and other promotional materials all bearing the
SCAR mark, and issuing a press release in March 2006 detailing its intent to
develop the semi-automatic version within two years. Although actual sales were not
made until late 2008, these "open and notorious" promotional activities in 2005
and 2006 sufficiently created an association in the relevant portion of the public's
mind so that they identified the SCAR rifles with FN.

        We also note that although Clyde Armory states that it is relevant that FN
listed a first use date of November 1, 2008, on one of its trademark applications, its
USPTO applications and registrations are not relevant to the foregoing analysis.
Neither federal nor Georgia law requires that a party assert a trademark registration
before bringing Lanham Act or state law claims. FN thus appropriately relied on its
common law rights in the SCAR mark derived through actual use dating back to
2004. Nor is Clyde Armory's suggestion well-taken that because USSOCOM
invented the term SCAR, FN could not develop trademark rights. A leading treatise
on trademarks states, "Unlike patent law, rights in trademarks are not gained
through discovery or invention of the mark, but only through actual usage." J.
Thomas McCarthy, 2 McCarthy on Trademarks & Unfair Competition § 16:11
(4th ed. 2015); see Blue Bell, Inc. v. Farah Mfg. Co., 508 F.2d 1260, 1265 (5th Cir.
1975) ("conception of the mark" does not establish trademark rights at common
law).

        In sum, FN's sales of SCAR rifles to USSOCOM alone are sufficient to
establish FN's priority of use as early as 2004. In addition to this use, FN's
marketing efforts establish priority in 2005 and 2006 because they constitute "use
analogous to trademark use" and were followed by sales to law enforcement and
civilians within a commercially reasonable period of time.

                                              Notes

        Intent-to-use registrations. Section 1(b) refers to "Intent to Use" (ITU)
registrations. Prior to the amendment of the Lanham Act in 1988 to allow such
registrations, the United States had a wholly use-based registration system. It was
impossible to register one's mark until that mark was actually used in commerce.
One consequence was that those who wanted to claim a trademark, but were not
ready for full-scale commercial activities, had an incentive to engage in "token"

                                                    183
uses--transactions that only existed to claim trademark rights. Note that the statute
now excludes such uses from the kind of use that secures priority in a mark.

        What are the advantages and drawbacks of a pure first-to-use registration
system? Of a first-to-register? Is the ITU system the best of both worlds? Or not?

        For a discussion of what constitutes a bona fide intent to use, see Kelly
Services, Inc. v. Creative Harbor, LLC, 846 F.3d 857, 865 (6th Cir. 2017). In that
case, the court held that where genuine intent is established for some, but not all,
goods and services in the application, the remedy is to limit the application, rather
than voiding it in its entirety. Id. at 875.

        How much use? Decisions vary on just how much use creates trademark rights.
Compare Lucent Information Management, Inc. v. Lucent Technologies, Inc., 186
F.3d 311 (3d Cir. 1999) (single sale insufficient to confer priority), with Blue Bell,
Inc. v. Farah Mfg. Co., 508 F.2d 1260, 1265 (5th Cir. 1975) ("[E]ven a single use in
trade may sustain trademark rights if followed by continuous commercial
utilization.").

        Courts often employ a contextual analysis "to determine whether the market
penetration of a trademark in an area is sufficient to warrant protection." Lucent,
186 F.3d at 317 (considering "(1) the volume of sales of the trademarked product;
(2) the growth trends (both positive and negative) in the area; (3) the number of
persons actually purchasing the product in relation to the potential number of
customers; and (4) the amount of product advertising in the area") (quoting Natural
Footwear Ltd. v. Hart, Schaffner & Marx, 760 F.2d 1383, 1398-99 (3d Cir. 1985)
(citations omitted)); see also TMEP § 901.02 ("[S]ome factors to consider when
determining compliance with the statutory requirement for a `bona fide use of a
mark in the ordinary course of trade' are: (1) the amount of use; (2) the nature or
quality of the transaction; and (3) what is typical use within a particular industry.").

        Can a product distribution without sales establish priority? If your gut tells
you no, what would that do to the business model of companies that initially rely on
the distribution of free product as a means of brand building? See, e.g., Planetary
Motion, Inc. v. Techsplosion, Inc., 261 F.3d 1188 (11th Cir. 2001) (free
distribution of trademarked software created priority in the mark).

        "Bona fide" uses, or why discovery is your friend. For a use to be bona fide, it
cannot be made simply to secure trademark rights. Social Techs. LLC v. Apple, Inc., 4
F.4th 811 (9th Cir. 2021), illustrates this principle in action. The litigation
concerned rights to the MEMOJI mark. Apple had purchased rights to the mark
from another user of the term. Apple then faced litigation from Social Tech, which
claimed to be the first user of the mark. The court disagreed, and explained why
Social Tech's claimed uses were not bona fide.

                                                    184
        [E]mails exchanged with [Social Tech's] software developer make clear that its
        use of the MEMOJI mark was merely to reserve its rights for a lawsuit against
        Apple. . . . "The lawsuit is coming together nicely. ... [W]e are just waiting for
        the trademark registration to file the lawsuit and get PAID," "[w]e are lining up all of
        our information, in preparation for a nice lawsuit against Apple, Inc! We are looking
        REALLY good. Get your Lamborghini picked out!" and "[i]t's better if we split up the
        updates, so it looks like we have more of them for the lawsuit." The significance of
        this correspondence is obvious. The timing of these emails, during the three
        weeks the application was almost entirely developed and immediately
        following the application's launch, and the content of these emails, leave no
        doubt as to Social Tech's intention in developing its Memoji application.
        The correspondence compels the conclusion that Social Tech's intention to
        develop and release its Memoji application was not a bona fide engagement
        of the mark in commerce, but merely an attempt to reserve its MEMOJI
        trademark and provide a basis for its lawsuit against Apple.

Soc. Techs. LLC v. Apple Inc., 4 F.4th 811, 820-21 (9th Cir. 2021).

        "Analogous" use. Section 2(d) of the Lanham Act (15 U.S.C. § 1052(d)) bars
registration if the mark in question "so resembles a mark registered in the Patent
and Trademark Office, or a mark or trade name previously used in the United States by
another and not abandoned, as to be likely, when used on or in connection with
the goods of the applicant, to cause confusion." In practice, the Trademark Office
will bar registrations when the opposer's prior use in question is merely "analogous"
to a trademark use. Stated another way, even a non-trademark use may be enough to
prevent a third-party registration. Herbko Intern., Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308
F.3d 1156 (Fed. Cir. 2002) ("Before a prior use becomes an analogous use sufficient
to create proprietary rights, the petitioner must show prior use sufficient to create
an association in the minds of the purchasing public between the mark and the
petitioner's goods. A showing of analogous use does not require direct proof of an
association in the public mind. Nevertheless, the activities claimed to create such an
association must reasonably be expected to have a substantial impact on the
purchasing public before a later user acquires proprietary rights in a mark."
(citations omitted)); T.A.B. Systems v. Pactel Teletrac, 77 F.3d 1372, 1375 (Fed. Cir.
1996) ("It is well settled that one may ground one's opposition to an application on
the prior use of a term in a manner analogous to service mark or trademark use.
Such an `analogous use' opposition can succeed, however, only where the analogous
use is of such a nature and extent as to create public identification of the target term
with the opposer's product or service." (citations omitted)).

        Note that analogous use capable of giving priority is still not the same as use
that supports registration. As the TTAB explained:

        Use analogous to trademark use ... is non-technical use of a trademark in
        connection with the promotion or sale of a product under circumstances
        which do not provide a basis for an application to register, usually because
        the statutory requirement for use on or in connection with the sale of goods
        in commerce has not been met. Although never considered an appropriate basis
        for an application to register, such use has consistently been held sufficient use
        to establish priority rights as against subsequent users of the same or similar
        marks.

Shalom Children's Wear Inc. v. In-Wear A/S, 26 U.S.P.Q.2d 1516, 1519 (T.T.A.B.
1993) (emphasis added).

        Abandonment. The question of what kind of use is necessary to obtain mark
rights carries with it the issue of how much use is needed to maintain them. Failure
to use a mark may lead to the loss of rights due to abandonment. Trademark
abandonment is the subject of a later chapter.

        Which market? Suppose priority is established in one market, will it lead to
priority in similar, but not identical, markets? In other words, suppose a company
establishes the EAGLE mark for fast-food hamburgers in 2000. In 2005 another
company begins using EAGLE for fast-food burritos. In 2007, may the hamburger
company enter the burrito market and claim priority to the EAGLE mark? Perhaps.
Its success will depend on the facts. According to McCarthy, "[w]hat is or is not a
`natural expansion' in fact is determined by the perception of customers at the time
of the junior user's first use of mark A on product line Z." MCCARTHY § 24:20.
This means that sometimes it will be the junior user who has priority to the market
in question. Id. (collecting examples of senior and junior users prevailing). Delay on
the part of the senior user will affect outcomes here as well.

        Excelled Sheepskin & Leather Coat Corp. v. Oregon Brewing Co., 897 F.3d 413
(2d Cir. 2018), raised this issue for merchandising markets. The case adjudicated
mark priority between a clothes maker (Excelled) and a brewing company (OBC).
OBC sold beer under the ROGUE mark, and used the mark on promotional
merchandise, including clothing. Did the promotional uses give it priority in the
clothing market generally? Reversing the district court, the Second Circuit said yes.

         . . . . Excelled contends and the district court found that OBC's rights to the
        ROGUE mark were inferior to those of Excelled "with respect to sales in

                                                    186
department and clothing stores," and that any trademark rights that OBC
might have with respect to use of ROGUE on clothing are limited to "sales
as complements to and in promotion of its beer business." The court
explained that the first use of a mark does not give the user exclusive rights
over the mark "as to all goods or services and across all markets." Prior to
2000 (the date of Excelled's first PTO application), there was no evidence of
OBC sales of ROGUE clothing unrelated to the promotion of its beer, and
the evidence showed OBC did not begin selling ROGUE clothing in
department or clothing-only stores until 2011.

We disagree with the district court's conclusion. Common law trademark
rights derive from "initial appropriation and use [ ] accompanied by an
intention to continue exploiting the mark commercially." La Societe Anonyme
des Parfums le Galion v. Jean Patou, Inc., 495 F.2d at 1271. . . . The district
court found that OBC deliberately and continuously sold ROGUE-branded
clothing throughout the United States since 1989. Even if those uses were
intended primarily to support OBC's ROGUE trademark for beer, they were
nonetheless bona fide continuous nationwide sales in significant quantities
and were sufficient to establish a protectable priority in use of the mark for
the sale of such goods. While it is correct, as the district court reasoned, that
first use of a mark does not give the owner exclusive rights over the mark "as
to all goods or services and across all markets," it does not follow that the
owner's rights are limited to the types of stores in which the owner has
previously exploited the mark. The law does not limit the owner's trademark
rights to the types of stores in which it has sold, leaving the mark up for
grabs in any other type of store. The fact that, prior to 2011, OBC did not
sell in department stores and clothing-only stores does not mean that a new
user was free to usurp OBC's priority in such stores.

To be sure, the senior user of a mark does not preserve its priority as to
expansion into other unrelated goods or services. See, e.g., Patsy's Brand, Inc. v.
I.O.B. Realty, Inc., 317 F.3d 209, 216-17 (2d Cir. 2003) (leaving open whether
"the sauce market [was] sufficiently related to the restaurant market such that
the proprietor of a mark for a restaurant can prevent another's use of a
similar mark in the sauce market"). But expanding into new product lines in
which someone else has priority is different from beginning to sell the goods
on which one has nationwide priority in a new category of stores (where a
junior user is making infringing sales under the senior user's mark). This
dispute does not involve OBC newly undertaking to use ROGUE on goods
for which Excelled had established priority. OBC maintained its senior
common law rights against Excelled's intervening junior use of the mark for

                                           187
        the same items of ROGUE-branded clothing that OBC has sold
        continuously since 1989. . . .

        . . . . OBC was the senior user of ROGUE on several categories of apparel
        nationwide and established a protectible priority in the mark's use for such
        goods. The fact that it had not sold in department or clothing-only stores did
        not mean that Excelled, as a junior user, was free to usurp OBC's mark in
        those stores. As a result, Excelled cannot show that it holds a protectible
        priority in the mark for the same categories of apparel and, thus, as a matter
        of law cannot prevail on its trademark infringement claims.

        Whose use? If a new product comes on the market, and multiple sellers
distribute it to the public, it is clear enough that the use of the mark gives rights to
the maker of the product. But what if the manufacturer and the distributor are in
an exclusive relationship? Of course parties can bargain over the matter beforehand,
but what if they don't? A common approach is a test proposed by Professor
McCarthy:

        where initial ownership between a manufacturer and its exclusive distributor
        is at issue and no contract exists, the manufacturer is the presumptive
        trademark owner unless the distributor rebuts that presumption using a
        multi-factor balancing test designed to examine the distribution agreement in
        effect between the parties. The six factors that should be considered are: (1)
        "[w]hich party invented or created the mark"; (2) "[w]hich party first affixed
        the mark to goods sold"; (3) "[w]hich party's name appeared on packaging
        and promotional materials in conjunction with the mark"; (4) "[w]hich party
        exercised control over the nature and quality of goods on which the mark
        appeared"; (5) "[t]o which party did customers look as standing behind the
        goods, e.g., which party received complaints for defects and made
        appropriate replacement or refund"; and (6) "[w]hich party paid for
        advertising and promotion of the trademarked product." [Doeblers' Pa.
        Hybrids, Inc. v.] Doebler, 442 F.3d [812,] 826 [(3d Cir. 2006)] (quoting 2
        McCarthy on Trademarks § 16:48).

        The presumption and rebuttal factors of the McCarthy test place a thumb on
        the ownership scale in favor of the manufacturer, but invite courts to
        consider various indicia of ownership designed to elicit the roles and
        responsibilities of the parties and the expectations of consumers in order to
        gauge whether, in a given case, the distributor and not the manufacturer
        operated as the rightful owner of the contested mark. Thus, unlike the first
        use test, this approach allows courts to undertake a thorough, individualized

                                                    188
        analysis of each case that accounts for the unique attributes of the
        manufacturer-distributor relationship.
Covertech Fabricating, Inc. v. TVM Bldg. Prod., Inc., 855 F.3d 163, 171 (3d Cir.

        Purchasing priority. As the MEMOJI litigation discussed above indicates, the
valid assignment of rights may enable the acquisition of priority to a mark. RXD
Media, LLC v. IP Application Dev. LLC, 986 F.3d 361, 370 (4th Cir. 2021) ("When
Fujitsu assigned to Apple its rights to the `ipad' mark in March 2010, that
assignment included Fujitsu's `first use' date of January 2002 and its `priority use'
date of March 2003. Apple acquired Fujitsu's then-pending trademark application,
which had been filed on March 7, 2003." (footnote omitted)).

        Fictional use. What about fictional trademarks? Should they confer priority on
the originator in the real world? Should the makers of the Simpsons be able to control
the mark for the fictional in-universe DUFF beer? See Viacom Int'l v. IJR Capital
Investments, L.L.C., 891 F.3d 178 (5th Cir. 2018) (permitting Viacom to claim a
trademark in the KRUSTY KRAB because it is "integral" to SpongeBob Square Pants).

        Lawful commerce. The recent trend in the states of legalizing marijuana creates
some interesting trademark issues. Marijuana remains illegal under federal law, and
federal trademark law limits protection to marks that identify and distinguish legal
goods and services. See, e.g., CreAgri, Inc. v. USANA Health Scis., Inc., 474 F.3d
626, 630 (9th Cir. 2007) ("[O]nly lawful use in commerce can give rise to trademark
priority." (emphasis in original)). In the changing regulatory environment
surrounding cannabis, some, but not all, preparations derived from the hemp plant
are legal. See, e.g., AK Futures LLC v. Boyd Street Distro, LLC, 35 F.4th 682 (9th
Cir. 2022) (ruling trademark claimant's hemp-derived product legal under federal
law and thus eligible for trademark protection).

        Tacking. What happens when a mark changes its image over time? Today the
PEPSI logo looks like this:

        But in 1902, it looked like this:

                                                    189
        When marks change, there is a risk of losing priority if the mark evolves into
something that is already on the market. In such cases, there is room for the owner
of the evolving mark to nonetheless claim priority by tacking use of the modified
mark onto use of the original. The key question is whether the mark maintains
continuity in overall commercial impression. For many large shifts in a mark, e.g. a
sports team that changes its logo, there is no issue because the markholder is careful
to adopt a new mark that it is the first to use. Complications arise when priority is
an issue. Consider the following facts:

        1900: A bank begins using AMERICAN SECURITY as a mark
        1935: Another bank begins use of the name AMERICAN SECURITY
BANK
        1973: The first bank begins using AMERICAN SECURITY BANK

        Should the first bank be allowed to obtain registration for AMERICAN
SECURITY BANK?

                            Hana Financial, Inc. v. Hana Bank
                                      574 U.S. 418 (2015)

Justice SOTOMAYOR delivered the opinion of the Court.
        Rights in a trademark are determined by the date of the mark's first use in

commerce. The party who first uses a mark in commerce is said to have priority over
other users. Recognizing that trademark users ought to be permitted to make certain
modifications to their marks over time without losing priority, lower courts have
provided that, in limited circumstances, a party may clothe a new mark with the
priority position of an older mark. This doctrine is called "tacking," and lower
courts have found tacking to be available when the original and revised marks are
"legal equivalents" in that they create the same, continuing commercial impression.
The question presented here is whether a judge or a jury should determine whether
tacking is available in a given case. Because the tacking inquiry operates from the
perspective of an ordinary purchaser or consumer, we hold that a jury should make
this determination.

                                                 I
        Petitioner, Hana Financial, and respondent Hana Bank, a subsidiary of

                                                    190
respondent Hana Financial Group, both provide financial services to individuals in
the United States. Hana Bank (hereinafter respondent) was established in 1971 as a
Korean entity called Korea Investment Finance Corporation. In 1991, that entity
changed its name to "Hana Bank" and began using this name in Korea. In 1994, it
established a service called Hana Overseas Korean Club to provide financial services
to Korean expatriates, and specifically advertised that service in the United States.
Those advertisements used the name "Hana Overseas Korean Club" in both English
and Korean, and included the name "Hana Bank" in Korean and respondent's
"dancing man" logo. In 2000, respondent changed the name of the Hana Overseas
Korean Club to "Hana World Center." In 2002, respondent began operating a
bank in the United States under the name "Hana Bank." This enterprise amounted
to respondent's first physical presence in the United States.

        Petitioner was established in 1994 as a California corporation called Hana
Financial. It began using that name and an associated trademark in commerce in
1995. In 1996, it obtained a federal trademark registration for a pyramid logo with
the name "Hana Financial" for use in connection with financial services.

        In 2007, petitioner sued respondent, alleging infringement of its "Hana
Financial" mark. As relevant here, respondent denied infringement by invoking the
tacking doctrine and claiming that it had priority. The District Court initially
granted summary judgment to respondent on the infringement claim, but the Court
of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that there were genuine issues of
material fact as to priority. On remand, the infringement claim was tried before a
jury. The District Court adopted in substantial part the jury instruction proposed by
petitioner, and, without objection from petitioner, instructed the jury as follows:

        "A party may claim priority in a mark based on the first use date of a similar
        but technically distinct mark where the previously used mark is the legal
        equivalent of the mark in question or indistinguishable therefrom such that
        consumers consider both as the same mark. This is called `tacking.' The
        marks must create the same, continuing commercial impression, and the
        later mark should not materially differ from or alter the character of the
        mark attempted to be tacked."

        The jury returned a verdict in favor of respondent, and the District Court
denied petitioner's motion for judgment as a matter of law.

        The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed. The court explained
that, although tacking applies only in "exceptionally narrow circumstances," it "
`requires a highly fact-sensitive inquiry' " that is "reserved for the jury". The court
acknowledged, however, that whether tacking should be decided by juries or judges
"is the subject of a circuit split." 735 F.3d, at 1164, n. 5 (noting that the Federal and
Sixth Circuits "evaluate tacking as a question of law"); see Van Dyne-Crotty, Inc. v.
Wear-Guard Corp., 926 F.2d 1156, 1159 (C.A.Fed.1991); Data Concepts, Inc. v.

                                                    191
Digital Consulting, Inc., 150 F.3d 620, 623 (C.A.6 1998)....
                                                 II

        As discussed above, the general rule adopted by lower courts has been that
two marks may be tacked when the original and revised marks are "legal
equivalents." This term refers to two marks that "create the same, continuing
commercial impression" so that consumers "consider both as the same mark." Van
Dyne-Crotty, Inc., 926 F.2d, at 1159 (internal quotation marks omitted); see, e.g.,
George & Co., LLC v. Imagination Entertainment Ltd., 575 F.3d 383, 402 (C.A.4
2009); Brookfield Communications, Inc. v. West Coast Entertainment Corp., 174 F.3d
1036, 1047-1048 (C.A.9 1999); Data Concepts, Inc., 150 F.3d, at 623. "The
commercial impression that a mark conveys must be viewed through the eyes of a

consumer." DuoProSS Meditech Corp. v. Inviro Medical Devices, Ltd., 695 F.3d 1247,
1253 (C.A.Fed.2012); see 3 J. McCarthy, Trademarks and Unfair Competition §
17:26, p. 17-71 (4th ed. 2014) (" `Commercial impression,' like most issues in
trademark law, should be determined from the perspective of the ordinary
purchaser of these kinds of goods or services").

        Application of a test that relies upon an ordinary consumer's understanding
of the impression that a mark conveys falls comfortably within the ken of a jury.
Indeed, we have long recognized across a variety of doctrinal contexts that, when the
relevant question is how an ordinary person or community would make an
assessment, the jury is generally the decisionmaker that ought to provide the fact-
intensive answer. See, e.g., United States v. Gaudin, 515 U.S. 506, 512 (1995)
(recognizing that " `delicate assessments of the inferences a "reasonable
[decisionmaker]" would draw ... [are] peculiarly one[s] for the trier of fact' " (quoting
TSC Industries, Inc. v. Northway, Inc., 426 U.S. 438, 450 (1976); first alteration in
original)); id., at 450, n. 12 (observing that the jury has a "unique competence in
applying the `reasonable man' standard"); Hamling v. United States, 418 U.S. 87,
104-105 (1974) (emphasizing "the ability of the juror to ascertain the sense of the
`average person' " by drawing upon "his own knowledge of the views of the average
person in the community or vicinage from which he comes" and his "knowledge of
the propensities of a `reasonable' person"); Railroad Co. v. Stout, 17 Wall. 657, 664
(1874) ("It is assumed that twelve men know more of the common affairs of life
than does one man, [and] that they can draw wiser and safer conclusions from
admitted facts thus occurring than can a single judge").

        This is certainly not to say that a judge may never determine whether two
marks may be tacked. If the facts warrant it, a judge may decide a tacking question
on a motion for summary judgment or for judgment as a matter of law. See Fed.
Rules Civ. Proc. 50, 56(a). And if the parties have opted to try their case before a
judge, the judge may of course decide a tacking question in his or her factfinding
capacity. We hold only that, when a jury trial has been requested and when the facts
do not warrant entry of summary judgment or judgment as a matter of law, the

                                                    192
question whether tacking is warranted must be decided by a jury.
                                                III

        Attempting to overcome our conclusion, petitioner offers four reasons why,
in its view, tacking is a question of law that should be resolved by a judge. None
persuades us.

        Petitioner first observes that the "legal equivalents" test involves the
application of a legal standard. True enough, but "the application-of-legal-standard-
to-fact sort of question ..., commonly called a `mixed question of law and fact,' has
typically been resolved by juries." Gaudin, 515 U.S., at 512; see id., at 514 ("[T]he
jury's constitutional responsibility is not merely to determine the facts, but to apply
the law to those facts and draw the ultimate conclusion ..."); Miller v. Fenton, 474
U.S. 104, 113 (1985) ("[A]n issue does not lose its factual character merely because
its resolution is dispositive of the ultimate ... question"). The "mixed" analysis that
takes place during the tacking inquiry is no different. And insofar as petitioner is
concerned that a jury may improperly apply the relevant legal standard, the solution
is to craft careful jury instructions that make that standard clear. Here, however,
petitioner can hardly criticize the instruction the District Court gave the jury, as it
was essentially the instruction petitioner proposed.

        Second, petitioner argues that tacking determinations will "create new law
that will guide future tacking disputes"--a task reserved for judges. It is not at all
clear, however, why a tacking determination in a particular case will "create new
law" any more than will a jury verdict in a tort case, a contract dispute, or a criminal
proceeding. Petitioner insists that tacking questions "have to be" resolved by
comparing two marks in a given case "against those addressed in other tacking
cases," but we do not agree. Of course, in deciding summary judgment motions, or
in making rulings in bench trials, judges may look to past cases holding that
trademark owners either were or were not entitled to tacking as a matter of law. But
petitioner offers no support for the claim that tacking cases "have to be" resolved by
reliance on precedent....

        Third, and related, petitioner worries that the predictability required for a
functioning trademark system will be absent if tacking questions are assigned to
juries. But, again, the same could be said about the tort, contract, and criminal
justice systems: In all of these areas, juries answer often-dispositive factual questions
or make dispositive applications of legal standards to facts. The fact that another
jury, hearing the same case, might reach a different conclusion may make the system
"unpredictable," but it has never stopped us from employing juries in these
analogous contexts. Petitioner has offered no reason why trademark tacking ought
to be treated differently. Moreover, decisionmaking in fact-intensive disputes
necessarily requires judgment calls. Regardless of whether those judgment calls are
made by juries or judges, they necessarily involve some degree of uncertainty,
particularly when they have to do with how reasonable persons would behave.

                                                    193
        Finally, petitioner argues that, as a historical matter, judges have resolved
tacking disputes. But petitioner relies on cases in which judges have resolved tacking
disputes in bench trials, at summary judgment, or the like. As we have noted, it is
undisputed that judges may resolve tacking disputes in those contexts. But
recognizing as much does not gainsay our conclusion that, when a jury is to be
empaneled and when the facts warrant neither summary judgment nor judgment as
a matter of law, tacking is a question for the jury....

Surrogate Uses

        Section 5 of the Lanham Act (15 U.S.C. § 1055) provides:

        Where a registered mark or a mark sought to be registered is or may be used
        legitimately by related companies, such use shall inure to the benefit of the
        registrant or applicant for registration, and such use shall not affect the
        validity of such mark or of its registration, provided such mark is not used in
        such manner as to deceive the public. If first use of a mark by a person is
        controlled by the registrant or applicant for registration of the mark with
        respect to the nature and quality of the goods or services, such first use shall
        inure to the benefit of the registrant or applicant, as the case may be.

        This section enables franchising relationships. So, for example, suppose the
Eagle Corporation enters the fast food business under the trademark EAGLE
Salads. Suppose further that Eagle operates solely as a franchisor; it does not own
any individual EAGLE establishments, preferring instead to license the name. Eagle
Corp. may still claim priority to EAGLE Salads based on the use of the mark by its
franchisees.

        What happens when the public is the first to use a term to refer to a seller--
what Graeme Dinwoodie and Mark Janis have termed a "surrogate public use"*?
Should the public use give priority to the referred-to seller?

                     Illinois High School Ass'n v. GTE Vantage Inc.
                                 99 F.3d 244 (7th Cir. 1996)

POSNER, Chief Judge.
        This is an appeal from the denial of a preliminary injunction sought by the

Illinois High School Association to protect its trademark "March Madness" against
infringement by GTE Vantage Inc. Vantage holds a license for the mark from the

          * Graeme B. Dinwoodie & Mark D. Janis, Use, Intent to Use, and Registration in the United States, in
TRADE MARK USE 313, 317 (Jeremy Phillips & Ilanah Simon eds., 2005).

                                                    194
National Collegiate Athletic Association. The appeal presents a novel issue of
trademark law.

        Since the early 1940s, the Illinois High School Association, sponsor of the
Illinois high school basketball tournament--the premier high school basketball
tournament in the United States, we are told--has used the trademark "March
Madness" to designate the tournament, held every year in March and sometimes
broadcast nationally. IHSA has licensed the use of the trademark on merchandise
associated with the tournament. Another basketball tournament--NCAA's "Final
Four" championship--is also played in March, spilling over into the early part of
April. In 1982, when CBS began televising the "Final Four" championship games,
broadcaster Brent Musburger used the term "March Madness" to designate them.
The term caught on and is now widely used by the media and the public to denote
this basketball tournament as well as IHSA's.

        In 1993 or 1994, NCAA began licensing the use of the term "March
Madness" to producers of goods and services related to its tournament. Earlier this
year one of the licensees, Vantage, began using "March Madness" to promote a CD-
ROM game that it calls "NCAA Championship Basketball." The term "March
Madness" appears in a circle on the box in which the game is to be sold and in some
of the game's computer graphics. Vantage's use of the term precipitated this suit,
which seeks injunctive relief for unfair competition under section 43(a) of the
Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a).

        IHSA argues that the use by NCAA licensees of the term "March Madness"
is likely to confuse consumers. A few will think that Vantage's game is sponsored by
IHSA or otherwise connected with the Illinois high school basketball tournament,
but more will think that the IHSA tournament is sponsored by NCAA or that the
trademark "March Madness" affixed to merchandise licensed by IHSA actually
refers to the NCAA tournament. The latter effect--what the cases call "reverse
confusion," where a powerful junior user of the trademark (NCAA dwarfs IHSA)
swamps the senior's use of it with advertising and other publicity that extinguishes
consumer demand for the senior user's product is likely to impair IHSA's ability to
make money by licensing its trademark on merchandise and other incidentals.

        The issue of likelihood of confusion does not arise, however, until it is
determined that the plaintiff has a trademark that the law will protect; and the
district judge thought that IHSA does not, so far as the use of the term "March
Madness" in connection with the NCAA tournament is concerned. It has been
many years since the media first appropriated the term to describe the NCAA
tournament (if "appropriation" is the right word--it may be a case of independent
discovery). Most people know what they know about college basketball from the
media. If the media call the NCAA tournament "March Madness," that is what the
public will call it, or know it as.

                                                    195
        IHSA argues that it is unfair to make its rights depend on the whims of the
media. Because a court could not, without violating the free-speech clause of the
First Amendment, have enjoined (or used other legal remedies to prevent or deter)
the media from calling the NCAA tournament "March Madness," IHSA was
helpless to prevent its trademark from being transformed into the name of another
product. Its property right should not, it argues, depend on events over which it has
no control.

        It is true that IHSA could not have sued Musburger or CBS for referring to
"March Madness" in a news program (including a program of sports news), or even
in advertising if the term were used merely for identification. But it could have sued
them (with what success we need not speculate--a suit at this late date would surely
be barred by laches) for using its trademark to promote CBS's broadcast of the
NCAA championship. And it could have supplicated them not to spoil its
trademark by using it to name something else. A serious trademark holder is
assiduous in endeavoring to convince dictionary editors, magazine and newspaper
editors, journalists and columnists, judges, and other lexicographically influential
persons to avoid using his trademark to denote anything other than the
trademarked good or service. These efforts sometimes succeed. IHSA was not
assiduous. But that is a detail--is in fact irrelevant, for no defense of laches has been
pleaded by Vantage or, so far as the record suggests, would succeed.

        What matters is that a trademark is not nearly so secure an entitlement as a
property right. It is mainly just a designation of source, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1114(1),
1125(a), and dies when it ceases to designate, for whatever reason other than the
culpable conduct of the defendant. Were NCAA responsible for blotting out the
exclusive association of "March Madness" with the Illinois high school basketball
tournament, IHSA might have a remedy on a theory of reverse confusion, though
probably not an injunctive remedy since that would promote confusion among
consumers, most of whom now identify the term with the NCAA tournament. But
IHSA blames CBS, which is not a defendant, rather than NCAA, much less
Vantage, for the blotting out.

        . . . . When a trademark becomes generic, such as "aspirin" or "thermos,"
and so loses trademark protection, because the public, perhaps egged on by the
omnipresent media, decides to use the trademark to designate not the particular
manufacturer's brand but the entire product comprising all the competing brands,
the trademark is dead no matter how vigorously the holder has tried to prevent this
usage. . . .

        IHSA acknowledges this point but seeks to deflect it by pointing out that
"March Madness" has not become generic. It is not the name of basketball
tournaments, or any other set of events, that occur in March. It is the name of two
basketball tournaments, IHSA's and the NCAA's. (It has also been used to promote

                                                    196
special discount sales of cars, Jennifer Cobb, "March Madness Not Confined to
Hoops," Tulsa World, March 22, 1995, p. 2, but these uses are too remote to bear
significantly on this case.) We cannot see what difference that makes. There is no
magic in labels. Let "March Madness" be called not a quasi-generic term, or a term
on its way to becoming generic, but a dual-use term. Whatever you call it, it's a
name that the public has affixed to something other than, as well as, the Illinois
high school basketball tournament. A trademark owner is not allowed to withdraw
from the public domain a name that the public is using to denote someone else's
good or service, leaving that someone and his customers speechless. No case so
holds, other than the cases involving generic names, but no case holds the contrary,
either. It is an issue of first impression, and we think that for the sake of protecting
effective communication it should be resolved against trademark protection, thus
assimilating dual-use or multiple-use terms to generic terms. . . .

        We do not opine on the scope of the trademark rights that either IHSA or
NCAA has, beyond ruling that IHSA's rights do not extend to the NCAA
tournament and to merchandise such as Vantage's game that is sold in connection
with that tournament.

        AFFIRMED WITH REMAND.

10. Geographic protection

        Once trademark rights are established, how far do they extend? This chapter
begins by considering the reach of "common law" trademark rights. From there, it
discusses the nationwide priority that comes with trademark registration. It
concludes by considering the territorial scope of trademark rights.

"Common Law" Trademark Rights

        The traditional rule regarding the geographic scope of trademark rights was
set by two Supreme Court cases in the 1910s, United Drug Co. v. Theodore Rectanus
Co., 248 U.S. 90 (1918), and Hanover Star Milling Co. v. Metcalf, 240 U.S. 403
(1916). Under the resulting "Tea Rose/Rectanus" doctrine, the user of a trademark
has priority over junior users in the areas in which he/she actually operates or has
established a reputation (plus a "zone of natural expansion"). For example, assume
that Barrister's Ball coffee shop in Oklahoma City began operation in 2000 and has
no website. It uses the mark, BARRISTER'S BALL, but does not register it. In
2005, an unrelated company opens BARRISTER'S BALL coffee in Boston,
Massachusetts. Under the Tea Rose doctrine, the Oklahoma mark holder cannot
enjoin the Boston use of the mark, even though the Oklahoma use was first. Things
might be different, however, with respect to a competitor in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

                       United Drug Co. v. Theodore Rectanus Co.
                                       248 U.S. 90 (1918)

Mr. Justice PITNEY delivered the opinion of the Court.
        This was a suit in equity brought September 24, 1912, in the United States

District Court for the Western District of Kentucky by the present petitioner, a
Massachusetts corporation, against the respondent, a Kentucky corporation,
together with certain individual citizens of the latter state, to restrain infringement
of trade-mark and unfair competition. . . .

        The essential facts are as follows: About the year 1877 Ellen M. Regis, a
resident of Haverhill, Mass., began to compound and distribute in a small way a
preparation for medicinal use in cases of dyspepsia and some other ailments, to
which she applied as a distinguishing name the word `Rex'--derived from her
surname. The word was put upon the boxes and packages in which the medicine
was placed upon the market, after the usual manner of a trade-mark. At first alone,
and afterwards in partnership with her son under the firm name of `E. M. Regis &
Co.,' she continued the business on a modest scale; in 1898 she recorded the word
`Rex' as a trade-mark under the laws of Massachusetts; in 1900 the firm procured its

                                                    198
registration in the United States Patent Office under the Act of March 3, 1881 (21
Stat. 502, c. 138); in 1904 the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts sustained
their trade-mark right under the state law as against a concern that was selling
medicinal preparations of the present petitioner under the designation of `Rexall
Remedies' (Regis v. Jaynes, 185 Mass. 458, 70 N. E. 480); afterwards the firm
established priority in the mark as against petitioner in a contested proceeding in
the Patent Office; and subsequently, in the year 1911, petitioner purchased the
business with the trade-mark right, and has carried it on in connection with its
other business, which consists in the manufacture of medicinal preparations, and
their distribution and sale through retail drug stores, known as `Rexall stores,'
situate in the different states of the Union, four of them being in Louisville, Ky.

        Meanwhile, about the year 1883, Theodore Rectanus, a druggist in
Louisville, familiarly known as `Rex,' employed this word as a trade-mark for a
medicinal preparation known as a `blood purifier.' He continued this use to a
considerable extent in Louisville and vicinity, spending money in advertising and
building up a trade, so that--except for whatever effect might flow from Mrs. Regis'
prior adoption of the word in Massachusetts, of which he was entirely ignorant--he
was entitled to use the word as his trade-mark. In the year 1906 he sold his business,
including the right to the use of the word, to respondent; and the use of the mark
by him and afterwards by respondent was continuous from about the year 1883
until the filing of the bill in the year 1912.

        Petitioner's first use of the word `Rex' in connection with the sale of drugs in
Louisville or vicinity was in April, 1912, when two shipments of `Rex Dyspepsia
Tablets,' aggregating 150 boxes and valued at $22.50, were sent to one of the
`Rexall' stores in that city. Shortly after this the remedy was mentioned by name in
local newspaper advertisements published by those stores. In the previous
September, petitioner shipped a trifling amount--5 boxes--to a drug store in
Franklin, Ky., approximately 120 miles distant from Louisville. There is nothing to
show that before this any customer in or near Kentucky had heard of the Regis
remedy, with or without the description `Rex,' or that this word ever possessed any
meaning to the purchasing public in that state, except as pointing to Rectanus and
the Rectanus Company and their `blood purifier.' That it did and does convey the
latter meaning in Louisville and vicinity is proved without dispute. Months before
petitioner's first shipment of its remedy to Kentucky, petitioner was distinctly
notified (in June, 1911) by one of its Louisville distributors, that respondent was
using the word `Rex' to designate its medicinal preparations, and that such use had
been commenced by Mr. Rectanus as much as 16 or 17 years before that time.

        There was nothing to sustain the allegation of unfair competition, aside from
the question of trade-mark infringement. As to this, both courts found, in
substance, that the use of the same mark upon different but somewhat related

                                                    199
preparations was carried on by the parties and their respective predecessors
contemporaneously, but in widely separated localities, during the period in
question--between 25 and 30 years--in perfect good faith; neither side having any
knowledge or notice of what was being done by the other. The District Court held
that, because the adoption of the mark by Mrs. Regis antedated its adoption by
Rectanus, petitioner's right to the exclusive use of the word in connection with
medicinal preparations intended for dyspepsia and kindred diseases of the stomach
and digestive organs must be sustained, but without accounting for profits or
assessment of damages for unfair trade. The Circuit Court of Appeals held that in
view of the fact that Rectanus had used the mark for a long period of years in entire
ignorance of Mrs. Regis' remedy or of her trade-mark, had expended money in
making his mark well known, and had established a considerable though local
business under it in Louisville and vicinity, while on the other hand during the
same long period Mrs. Regis had done nothing, either by sales agencies or by
advertising, to make her medicine or its mark known outside of the New England
States, saving sporadic sales in territory adjacent to those states, and had made no
effort whatever to extend the trade to Kentucky, she and her successors were bound
to know that, misled by their silence and inaction, others might act, as Rectanus
and his successors did act, upon the assumption that the field was open, and
therefore were estopped to ask for an injunction against the continued use of the
mark in Louisville and vicinity by the Rectanus Company.

        The entire argument for the petitioner is summed up in the contention that
whenever the first user of a trade-mark has been reasonably diligent in extending the
territory of his trade, and as a result of such extension has in good faith come into
competition with a later user of the same mark who in equal good faith has
extended his trade locally before invasion of his field by the first user, so that finally
it comes to pass that the rival traders are offering competitive merchandise in a
common market under the same trade-mark, the later user should be enjoined at
the suit of the prior adopter, even though the latter be the last to enter the
competitive field and the former have already established a trade there. Its
application to the case is based upon the hypothesis that the record shows that Mrs.
Regis and her firm, during the entire period of limited and local trade in her
medicine under the Rex mark, were making efforts to extend their trade so far as
they were able to do with the means at their disposal. There is little in the record to
support this hypothesis; but, waiving this, we will pass upon the principal
contention.

        The asserted doctrine is based upon the fundamental error of supposing that
a trade-mark right is a right in gross or at large, like a statutory copyright or a patent
for an invention, to either of which, in truth, it has little or no analogy. There is no
such thing as property in a trade-mark except as a right appurtenant to an

                                                    200
established business or trade in connection with which the mark is employed. The
law of trade-marks is but a part of the broader law of unfair competition; the right
to a particular mark grows out of its use, not its mere adoption; its function is
simply to designate the goods as the product of a particular trader and to protect his
good will against the sale of another's product as his; and it is not the subject of
property except in connection with an existing business. Hanover Milling Co. v.
Metcalf, 240 U. S. 403, 412-414.

        The owner of a trade-mark may not, like the proprietor of a patented
invention, make a negative and merely prohibitive use of it as a monopoly.

        In truth, a trade-mark confers no monopoly whatever in a proper sense, but
is merely a convenient means for facilitating the protection of one's good-will in
trade by placing a distinguishing mark or symbol--a commercial signature--upon the
merchandise or the package in which it is sold.

        It results that the adoption of a trade-mark does not, at least in the absence
of some valid legislation enacted for the purpose, project the right of protection in
advance of the extension of the trade, or operate as a claim of territorial rights over
areas into which it thereafter may be deemed desirable to extend the trade. And the
expression, sometimes met with, that a trade-mark right is not limited in its
enjoyment by territorial bounds, is true only in the sense that wherever the trade
goes, attended by the use of the mark, the right of the trader to be protected against
the sale by others of their wares in the place of his wares will be sustained.

        Property in trade-marks and the right to their exclusive use rest upon the
laws of the several states, and depend upon them for security and protection; the
power of Congress to legislate on the subject being only such as arises from the
authority to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several states
and with the Indian tribes. Trade-Mark Cases, 100 U. S. 82, 93, 25 L. Ed. 550.

        Conceding everything that is claimed in behalf of the petitioner, the entire
business conducted by Mrs. Regis and her firm prior to April, 1911, when
petitioner acquired it, was confined to the New England States, with inconsiderable
sales in New York, New Jersey, Canada, and Nova Scotia. There was nothing in all
of this to give her any rights in Kentucky, where the principles of the common law
obtain. . . . There was nothing to prevent the state of Kentucky (saving, of course,
what Congress might do within the range of its authority) from conferring
affirmative rights upon Rectanus, exclusive in that commonwealth as against others
whose use of the trade-mark there began at a later time than his; but whether he had
such rights, or respondent now has them, is a question not presented by the record;
there being no prayer for an injunction to restrain petitioner from using the mark
in the competitive field.

        It is not contended, nor is there ground for the contention, that registration
of the Regis trade-mark under either the Massachusetts statute or the act of

                                                    201
Congress, or both, had the effect of enlarging the rights of Mrs. Regis or of
petitioner beyond what they would be under common-law principles. Manifestly the
Massachusetts statute could have no extraterritorial effect. . . .

        Undoubtedly, the general rule is that, as between conflicting claimants to the
right to use the same mark, priority of appropriation determines the question. But
the reason is that purchasers have come to understand the mark as indicating the
origin of the wares, so that its use by a second producer amounts to an attempt to
sell his goods as those of his competitor. The reason for the rule does not extend to
a case where the same trade-mark happens to be employed simultaneously by two
manufacturers in different markets separate and remote from each other, so that the
mark means one thing in one market, an entirely different thing in another. It
would be a perversion of the rule of priority to give it such an application in our
broadly extended country that an innocent party who had in good faith employed a
trade-mark in one state, and by the use of it had built up a trade there, being the
first appropriator in that jurisdiction, might afterwards be prevented from using it,
with consequent injury to his trade and good will, at the instance of one who
theretofore had employed the same mark, but only in other and remote
jurisdictions, upon the ground that its first employment happened to antedate that
of the first-mentioned trader.

        In several cases federal courts have held that a prior use of a trade-mark in a
foreign country did not entitle its owner to claim exclusive trade-mark rights in the
United States as against one who in good faith had adopted a like trade-mark here
prior to the entry of the foreigner into this market.

        The same point was involved in Hanover Milling Co. v. Metcalf, 240 U. S.
403, 415, where we said:

        `In the ordinary case of parties competing under the same mark in the same
        market, it is correct to say that prior appropriation settles the question. But
        where two parties independently are employing the same mark upon goods
        of the same class, but in separate markets wholly remote the one from the
        other, the question of prior appropriation is legally insignificant, unless at
        least it appear that the second adopter has selected the mark with some
        design inimical to the interests of the first user, such as to take the benefit of
        the reputation of his goods, to forestall the extension of his trade, or the
        like.'

        In this case, as already remarked, there is no suggestion of a sinister purpose
on the part of Rectanus or the Rectanus Company; hence the passage quoted
correctly defines the status of the parties prior to the time when they came into
competition in the Kentucky market. And it results, as a necessary inference from
what we have said, that petitioner, being the newcomer in that market, must enter it

                                                    202
subject to whatever rights had previously been acquired there in good faith by the
Rectanus Company and its predecessor. To hold otherwise-to require Rectanus to
retire from the field upon the entry of Mrs. Regis' successor-would be to establish
the right of the latter as a right in gross, and to extend it to territory wholly remote
from the furthest reach of the trade to which it was annexed, with the effect not
merely of depriving Rectanus of the benefit of the good will resulting from his long-
continued use of the mark in Louisville and vicinity, and his substantial
expenditures in building up his trade, but of enabling petitioner to reap substantial
benefit from the publicity that Rectanus has thus given to the mark in that locality,
and of confusing if not misleading the public as to the origin of goods thereafter
sold in Louisville under the Rex mark, for, in that market, until petitioner entered
it, `Rex' meant the Rectanus product, not that of Regis. . . .

        . . . . Mrs. Regis and her firm, having during a long period of years confined
their use of the `Rex' mark to a limited territory wholly remote from that in
controversy, must be held to have taken the risk that some innocent party might in
the meantime hit upon the same mark, apply it to goods of similar character, and
expend money and effort in building up a trade under it; and since it appears that
Rectanus in good faith, and without notice of any prior use by others, selected and
used the `Rex' mark, and by the expenditure of money and effort succeeded in
building up a local but valuable trade under it in Louisville and vicinity before
petitioner entered that field, so that `Rex' had come to be recognized there as the
`trade signature' of Rectanus and of respondent as his successor, petitioner is
estopped to set up their continued use of the mark in that territory as an
infringement of the Regis trade-mark. Whatever confusion may have arisen from
conflicting use of the mark is attributable to petitioner's entry into the field with
notice of the situation; and petitioner cannot complain of this. As already stated,
respondent is not complaining of it.

                                              Notes

        Zone of natural expansion. The principle is straightforward. It is natural for a
business that is successful in Oklahoma City to potentially expand to Tulsa before
setting sights on Boston, but defining the range is difficult. It depends on several
variables (how long has the senior user been operating? Has it expanded at all? How
long since it expanded? How long has the remote user been operating without
conflict? Has the plaintiff's area of operations shrunk? Has the junior user's area of
operations expanded?). McCarthy's treatise reports that in general, courts have
taken a narrow view of the zone. 5 MCCARTHY § 26:20. The Restatement rejects the
theory altogether. RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF UNFAIR COMPETITION § 19, comment
c (1995).

                                                    203
        Good faith use. Note the mention in Rectanus of the junior user's good faith.
Many cases hold that the adoption of the senior user's mark with knowledge of its
existence suffices to destroy a defense based on geographically remote use. Some
cases, however, do not view such knowledge as per se establishing bad faith. See, e.g.,
Stone Creek, Inc. v. Omnia Italian Design, Inc., 875 F.3d 426, 437 (9th Cir. 2017)
(describing circuit split and taking the view "that there is no good faith if the junior
user had knowledge of the senior user's mark"). Does the internet make such cases
more likely? More local marks will be known outside of their region, but that does
not necessarily mean that their copying is an attempt to free ride off of the
markholder's goodwill. The Restatement view is that a junior user's knowledge of a
senior user in a remote market raises an inference of bad faith. RESTATEMENT
(THIRD) OF UNFAIR COMPETITION § 19, comment d (1995).

        Reputation. Since trademarks embody the goodwill of the user, it is possible
that that goodwill--and the reputation associated with the mark--may extend beyond
the area in which the trademark owner engages in marketing activities. Champions
Golf Club v. Champions Golf Club, 78 F.3d 1111, 1124 (6th Cir. 1996) ("If [the
senior user] had achieved nationwide recognition, then, even though [the junior
user] had not heard of it, [the junior user] could not become an innocent junior
user."). Thus could Caesar's Palace Casino in Nevada enjoin a New Jersey
beautician's use of Caesar's Palace hair salon. Caesars World, Inc. v. Caesar's
Palace, 490 F. Supp. 818 (D.N.J. 1980).

        The post-Rectanus advent of national markets, media, and the internet creates
difficulties in applying the reputation rule, as it is much more likely now that marks
may be known nationally without nationally directed activities. Similarly, jet travel
and the national highway system increased the likelihood of consumers
encountering a remote junior user in travels away from the senior user's market.
Should that bother the courts?

Registration and Nationwide Priority

        The passage of the Lanham Act created an avenue for trademark holders to
obtain nationwide priority without nationwide use. This is one of the major
advantages of obtaining a federal trademark registration. 15 U.S.C. § 1057(c)
("Contingent on the registration of a mark on the principal register provided by this
chapter, the filing of the application to register such mark shall constitute
constructive use of the mark, conferring a right of priority, nationwide in effect, on
or in connection with the goods or services specified in the registration against any
other person except for a person [with prior use or registration rights]."). What does

                                                    204
that mean for a junior user who commences post-registration use in an area where
the registrant does not operate? This situation is covered by the Dawn Donut rule.

                       Dawn Donut Co. v. Hart's Food Stores, Inc.
                                 267 F.2d 358 (2d Cir. 1959)

LUMBARD, Circuit Judge.
        The principal question is whether the plaintiff, a wholesale distributor of

doughnuts and other baked goods under its federally registered trademarks `Dawn'
and `Dawn Donut,' is entitled under the provisions of the Lanham Trade-Mark Act
to enjoin the defendant from using the mark `Dawn' in connection with the retail
sale of doughnuts and baked goods entirely within a six county area of New York
State surrounding the city of Rochester. The primary difficulty arises from the fact
that although plaintiff licenses purchasers of its mixes to use its trademarks in
connection with the retail sales of food products made from the mixes, it has not
licensed or otherwise exploited the mark at the retail level in defendant's market
area for some thirty years.

        We hold that because no likelihood of public confusion arises from the
concurrent use of the mark in connection with retail sales of doughnuts and other
baked goods in separate trading areas, and because there is no present likelihood
that plaintiff will expand its retail use of the mark into defendant's market area,
plaintiff is not now entitled to any relief under the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C.A. §
1114. Accordingly, we affirm the district court's dismissal of plaintiff's complaint.

        This is not to say that the defendant has acquired any permanent right to use
the mark in its trading area. On the contrary, we hold that because of the effect of
the constructive notice provision of the Lanham Act, should the plaintiff expand its
retail activities into the six county area, upon a proper application and showing to
the district court, it may enjoin defendant's use of the mark. . . .

        Plaintiff, Dawn Donut Co., Inc., of Jackson, Michigan since June 1, 1922 has
continuously used the trademark `Dawn' upon 25 to 100 pound bags of doughnut
mix which it sells to bakers in various states, including New York, and since 1935 it
has similarly marketed a line of sweet dough mixes for use in the baking of coffee
cakes, cinnamon rolls and oven goods in general under that mark. . . .

        The district court found that with the exception of one Dawn Donut Shop
operated in the city of Rochester, New York during 1926-27, plaintiff's licensing of
its mark in connection with the retail sale of doughnuts in the state of New York
has been confined to areas not less than 60 miles from defendant's trading area. . . .

        The defendant, Hart Food Stores, Inc., owns and operates a retail grocery
chain within [several] New York counties[. Its product distribution is confined] to
an area within a 45 mile radius of Rochester. Its advertising of doughnuts and other

                                                    205
baked products over television and radio and in newspapers is also limited to this
area. Defendant's bakery corporation was formed on April 13, 1951 and first used
the imprint `Dawn' in packaging its products on August 30, 1951. The district court
found that the defendant adopted the mark `Dawn' without any actual knowledge
of plaintiff's use or federal registration of the mark, selecting it largely because of a
slogan `Baked at midnight, delivered at Dawn' which was originated by defendant's
president and used by defendant in its bakery operations from 1929 to 1935.
Defendant's president testified, however, that no investigation was made prior to
the adoption of the mark to see if anyone else was employing it. Plaintiff's marks
were registered federally in 1927, and their registration was renewed in 1947.
Therefore by virtue of the Lanham Act, the defendant had constructive notice of
plaintiff's marks as of July 5, 1947, the effective date of the Act.

        Defendant's principal contention is that because plaintiff has failed to
exploit the mark `Dawn' for some thirty years at the retail level in the Rochester
trading area, plaintiff should not be accorded the exclusive right to use the mark in
this area.

        We reject this contention as inconsistent with the scope of protection
afforded a federal registrant by the Lanham Act.

        Prior to the passage of the Lanham Act courts generally held that the owner
of a registered trademark could not sustain an action for infringement against
another who, without knowledge of the registration, used the mark in a different
trading area from that exploited by the registrant so that public confusion was
unlikely. By being the first to adopt a mark in an area without knowledge of its prior
registration, a junior user of a mark could gain the right to exploit the mark
exclusively in that market.

        But the Lanham Act, provides that registration of a trademark on the
principal register is constructive notice of the registrant's claim of ownership. Thus,
by eliminating the defense of good faith and lack of knowledge, § 1072 affords
nationwide protection to registered marks, regardless of the areas in which the
registrant actually uses the mark. . . .

        That such is the purpose of Congress is further evidenced by 15 U.S.C.A. §
1115(a) and (b) which make the certificate of registration evidence of the registrant's
`exclusive right to use the * * * mark in commerce.' `Commerce' is defined in 15
U.S.C.A. 1127 to include all the commerce which may lawfully be regulated by
Congress. These two provisions of the Lanham Act make it plain that the fact that
the defendant employed the mark `Dawn,' without actual knowledge of plaintiff's
registration, at the retail level in a limited geographical area of New York state
before the plaintiff used the mark in that market, does not entitle it either to
exclude the plaintiff from using the mark in that area or to use the mark

                                                    206
concurrently once the plaintiff licenses the mark or otherwise exploits it in
connection with retail sales in the area.

        Plaintiff's failure to license its trademarks in defendant's trading area during
the thirty odd years that have elapsed since it licensed them to a Rochester baker
does not work an abandonment of the rights in that area. We hold that 15
U.S.C.A. § 1127, which provides for abandonment in certain cases of non-use,
applies only when the registrant fails to use his mark, within the meaning of § 1127,
anywhere in the nation. Since the Lanham Act affords a registrant nationwide
protection, a contrary holding would create an insoluble problem of measuring the
geographical extent of the abandonment. Even prior to the passage of the Lanham
Act, when trademark protection flowed from state law and therefore depended on
use within the state, no case, as far as we have been able to ascertain, held that a
trademark owner abandoned his rights within only part of a state because of his
failure to use the mark in that part of the state.

        Accordingly, since plaintiff has used its trademark continuously at the retail
level, it has not abandoned its federal registration rights even in defendant's trading
area. . . .

        Accordingly, we turn to the question of whether on this record plaintiff has
made a sufficient showing to warrant the issuance of an injunction against
defendant's use of the mark `Dawn' in a trading area in which the plaintiff has for
thirty years failed to employ its registered mark.

        The Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C.A. § 1114, sets out the standard for awarding a
registrant relief against the unauthorized use of his mark by another. It provides that
the registrant may enjoin only that concurrent use which creates a likelihood of
public confusion as to the origin of the products in connection with which the
marks are used. Therefore if the use of the marks by the registrant and the
unauthorized user are confined to two sufficiently distinct and geographically
separate markets, with no likelihood that the registrant will expand his use into
defendant's market,4 so that no public confusion is possible, then the registrant is
not entitled to enjoin the junior user's use of the mark.

          4 To sustain a claim for injunctive relief, the plaintiff need not show that the marks are actually

being used concurrently in the same trading area. Since the statutory standard for the invocation of

injunctive relief is the likelihood of confusion, it is enough that expansion by the registrant into the

defendant's market is likely in the normal course of its business. Even prior to the passage of the Lanham Act

the courts held that the second user of a mark was not entitled to exclude the registered owner of the mark

from using it in a territory which the latter would probably reach in the normal expansion of his business.

Certainly, under the Lanham Act, evincing a congressional purpose to afford a registrant nationwide

protection, the subsequent user is not entitled to any greater immunity.

                                                    207
        As long as plaintiff and defendant confine their use of the mark `Dawn' in
connection with the retail sale of baked goods to their present separate trading areas
it is clear that no public confusion is likely.

        The district court took note of what it deemed common knowledge, that
`retail purchasers of baked goods, because of the perishable nature of such goods,
usually make such purchases reasonably close to their homes, say within about 25
miles, and retail purchases of such goods beyond that distance are for all practical
considerations negligible.' No objection is made to this finding and nothing appears
in the record which contradicts it as applied to this case.

        Moreover, we note that it took plaintiff three years to learn of defendant's
use of the mark and bring this suit, even though the plaintiff was doing some
wholesale business in the Rochester area. This is a strong indication that no
confusion arose or is likely to arise either from concurrent use of the marks at the
retail level in geographically separate trading areas or from its concurrent use at
different market levels, viz. retail and wholesale in the same area.

        The decisive question then is whether plaintiff's use of the mark `Dawn' at
the retail level is likely to be confined to its current area of use or whether in the
normal course of its business, it is likely to expand the retail use of the mark into
defendant's trading area. If such expansion were probable, then the concurrent use
of the marks would give rise to the conclusion that there was a likelihood of
confusion.

        The district court found that in view of the plaintiff's inactivity for about
thirty years in exploiting its trademarks in defendant's trading area at the retail level
either by advertising directed at retail purchasers or by retail sales through
authorized licensed users, there was no reasonable expectation that plaintiff would
extend its retail operations into defendant's trading area. There is ample evidence in
the record to support this conclusion and we cannot say that it is clearly erroneous.

        We note not only that plaintiff has failed to license its mark at the retail level
in defendant's trading area for a substantial period of time, but also that the trend
of plaintiff's business manifests a striking decrease in the number of licensees
employing its mark at the retail level in New York state and throughout the country.
In the 1922-1930 period plaintiff had 75 to 80 licensees across the country with 11
located in New York. At the time of the trial plaintiff listed only 16 active licensees
not one of which was located in New York.

        The normal likelihood that plaintiff's wholesale operations in the Rochester
area would expand to the retail level is fully rebutted and overcome by the decisive
fact that plaintiff has in fact not licensed or otherwise exploited its mark at retail in
the area for some thirty years.

        Accordingly, because plaintiff and defendant use the mark in connection
with retail sales in distinct and separate markets and because there is no present

                                                    208
prospect that plaintiff will expand its use of the mark at the retail level into
defendant's trading area, we conclude that there is no likelihood of public
confusion arising from the concurrent use of the marks and therefore the issuance
of an injunction is not warranted. A fortiori plaintiff is not entitled to any
accounting or damages. However, because of the effect we have attributed to the
constructive notice provision of the Lanham Act, the plaintiff may later, upon a
proper showing of an intent to use the mark at the retail level in defendant's market
area, be entitled to enjoin defendant's use of the mark.

        Since we have held that upon a proper subsequent showing the plaintiff may
be entitled to injunctive relief, it is appropriate that we answer here the defendant's
argument that such relief is beyond the constitutional reach of Congress because the
defendant uses the mark only in intrastate commerce. Clearly Congress has the
power under the commerce clause to afford protection to marks used in interstate
commerce. That being so, the only relevant question is whether the intrastate
activity forbidden by the Act is `sufficiently substantial and adverse to Congress'
paramount policy declared in the Act. * * *' Mandeville Island Farms, Inc. v. American
Crystal Sugar Co., 1948, 334 U.S. 219, 234, 68 S.Ct. 996, 1005, 92 L.Ed. 1328. The
answer to such an inquiry seems plain in this case. If a registrant's right to employ
its trademark were subject within every state's borders to preemption or concurrent
use by local business, the protection afforded a registrant by the Lanham Act would
be rendered virtually meaningless. Therefore we think it is within Congress'
`necessary and proper' power to preclude a local intrastate user from acquiring any
right to use the same mark. . . .

                                              Notes

        Dawn Donut. To some extent, the Dawn Donut rule checks the effect of
traveler mobility and national advertising by requiring a senior user to wait for a
likelihood of confusion to arise before seeking an injunction to enjoin the junior
user. That said, if the mark's fame has already reached the market in question, then
the senior user's market has, in effect, already expanded into the junior user's,
which warrants a remedy.

        The ease with which mark fame may spread across the United States makes
some courts leery of continuing to apply Dawn Donut. After all, if a mark's
reputation reaches a remote market, it is possible that consumers in that market
may be misled into purchasing the junior user's product. Circuit City Stores, Inc. v.
CarMax, Inc., 165 F.3d 1047, 1057 (6th Cir. 1999) (Jones, J., concurring) ("The
Dawn Donut Rule was enunciated in 1959. Entering the new millennium, our
society is far more mobile than it was four decades ago. For this reason, and given
that recent technological innovations such as the Internet are increasingly

                                                    209
deconstructing geographical barriers for marketing purposes, it appears to me that a
re-examination of precedents would be timely to determine whether the Dawn
Donut Rule has outlived its usefulness."). In a similar vein, see Westmont Living,
Inc. v. Retirement Unlimited, Inc., 132 F.4th 288, 291 (4th Cir. 2025) (error for
district court to rely "solely on the fact that the parties' physical facilities were on
opposite coasts, without considering the numerous other factors that might bear"
on whether plaintiff might establish a likelihood of confusion).

        Concurrent use rights. What happens when two parties are using the same
mark in good faith in remote locations and one seeks a federal registration? The
Lanham Act allows for the possibility of concurrent use rights as a means of
mediating between the parties. 15 U.S.C. § 1052(d) explains:

        [If] confusion, mistake, or deception is not likely to result from the
        continued use by more than one person of the same or similar marks . . .
        concurrent registrations may be issued to such persons when they have
        become entitled to use such marks as a result of their concurrent lawful use
        in commerce prior to [] the earliest of the filing dates of the applications
        pending or of any registration issued under this Act . . . . Use prior to the
        filing date of any pending application or a registration shall not be required
        when the owner of such application or registration consents to the grant of a
        concurrent registration to the applicant. Concurrent registrations may also
        be issued by the Commissioner when a court of competent jurisdiction has
        finally determined that more than one person is entitled to use the same or
        similar marks in commerce. In issuing concurrent registrations, the
        Commissioner shall prescribe conditions and limitations as to the mode or
        place of use of the mark or the goods on or in connection with which such
        mark is registered to the respective persons.

        Sounds good, but who gets priority to the parts of the country in which
neither user currently operates? The traditional answer is the senior user.
Application of Beatrice Foods Co., 429 F.2d 466, 474 (C.C.P.A. 1970) ("[The prior
user's] rights and, therefore, his registration, should be limited only to the extent
that any other subsequent user, who can establish the existence of rights earlier than
the prior user's application for registration, can also prove a likelihood of confusion,
mistake or deception."). The case noted three potential exceptions to this general
presumption. First, the parties might agree to divide national territory. Second, the
junior user may be a prior registrant (and the concurrent use proceeding is initiated
after the junior user receives a registration). Third, the use patterns of the parties
may require that no one receive rights to unclaimed national territory.

                                                    210
        Another potential wrinkle concerns the "static" senior user and an
expansionist junior user. The TTAB sometimes favors a more active junior user and
restricts the registration of the senior user to its zone of activity, even though the
senior user was the first to register. Nark, Inc. v. Noah's, Inc., 212 U.S.P.Q. 934
(T.T.A.B. 1981) (contending that the senior user "abandoned or relinquished its
right to obtain nationwide protection for its mark as a result of its inactivity or
failure to expand over a reasonable period of time"); see generally 3 MCCARTHY §
20:84.

Priority based on foreign use

        To indulge a cliché, we live in a global economy. Borders tell us little about
the corporations and trademarks we may encounter in our day-to-day lives. Yet
trademark law retains a strict territoriality principle. Rights to a trademark are
generally confined to the nation in which they are obtained. One uncomfortable
result is that some famous marks--SCRABBLE is an example--are controlled by one
entity in the United States and another elsewhere. This opens the door to some
questionable conduct. What happens if a mark is used outside of the United States
and an enterprising soul decides to copy it domestically and profit off of the
goodwill? The issue was raised by Person's Co., Ltd. v. Christman, 900 F.2d 1565
(Fed. Cir. 1990). The facts:

        In 1977, Takaya Iwasaki first applied a stylized logo bearing the name
        "PERSON'S" to clothing in his native Japan. Two years later Iwasaki formed
        Person's Co., Ltd., a Japanese corporation, to market and distribute the
        clothing items in retail stores located in Japan.

        In 1981, Larry Christman, a U.S. citizen and employee of a sportswear
        wholesaler, visited a Person's Co. retail store while on a business trip to
        Japan. Christman purchased several clothing items bearing the "PERSON'S"
        logo and returned with them to the United States. After consulting with
        legal counsel and being advised that no one had yet established a claim to the
        logo in the United States, Christman developed designs for his own
        "PERSON'S" brand sportswear line based on appellant's products he had
        purchased in Japan. In February 1982, Christman contracted with a clothing
        manufacturer to produce clothing articles with the "PERSON'S" logo
        attached. These clothing items were sold, beginning in April 1982, to
        sportswear retailers in the northwestern United States. Christman formed
        Team Concepts, Ltd., a Washington corporation, in May 1983 to continue
        merchandising his sportswear line, which had expanded to include
        additional articles such as shoulder bags. All the sportswear marketed by

                                                    211
        Team Concepts bore either the mark "PERSON'S" or a copy of appellant's
        globe logo; many of the clothing styles were apparently copied directly from
        appellant's designs.

        Christman registered the mark in 1984. In the meantime, the original
Japanese company, which was very successful in its home market, had begun
activities in the United States. The marks thus came into conflict, leading to
litigation. In resolving it, the Federal Circuit relied on a strong territoriality rule for
trademark protection.

        Section 1 of the Lanham Act states that "[t]he owner of a trademark used in
        commerce may register his trademark...." The term "commerce" is defined in
        Section 45 of the Act as ".... all commerce which may be lawfully regulated by
        Congress." No specific Constitutional language gives Congress power to
        regulate trademarks, so the power of the federal government to provide for
        trademark registration comes only under its commerce power. The term
        "used in commerce" in the Lanham Act refers to a sale or transportation of
        goods bearing the mark in or having an effect on: (1) United States interstate
        commerce; (2) United States commerce with foreign nations; or (3) United
        States commerce with the Indian Tribes.

        In the present case, appellant Person's Co. relies on its use of the mark in
        Japan in an attempt to support its claim for priority in the United States.
        Such foreign use has no effect on U.S. commerce and cannot form the basis
        for a holding that appellant has priority here. The concept of territoriality is
        basic to trademark law; trademark rights exist in each country solely
        according to that country's statutory scheme. Christman was the first to use
        the mark in United States commerce and the first to obtain a federal
        registration thereon. Appellant has no basis upon which to claim priority
        and is the junior user under these facts.16

          16 Section 44 of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1126 (1982), permits qualified foreign applicants who
own a registered mark in their country of origin to obtain a U.S. trademark registration without alleging
actual use in U.S. commerce. If a U.S. application is filed within six months of the filing of the foreign
application, such U.S. registration will be accorded the same force and effect as if filed in the United States
on the same date on which the application was first filed in the foreign country. The statutory scheme set
forth in § 44 is in place to lower barriers to entry and assist foreign applicants in establishing business
goodwill in the United States. Person's Co. does not assert rights under § 44, which if properly applied,
might have been used to secure priority over Christman.

                                                    212
        The court also rejected the claim that Christman's adoption of the mark with
knowledge of the prior foreign use constituted bad faith.

        As the Board noted below, Christman's prior use in U.S. commerce cannot
        be discounted solely because he was aware of appellant's use of the mark in
        Japan. While adoption of a mark with knowledge of a prior actual user in
        U.S. commerce may give rise to cognizable equities as between the parties, no
        such equities may be based upon knowledge of a similar mark's existence or
        on a problematical intent to use such a similar mark in the future.
        Knowledge of a foreign use does not preclude good faith adoption and use in
        the United States. While there is some case law supporting a finding of bad
        faith where (1) the foreign mark is famous here23 or (2) the use is a nominal
        one made solely to block the prior foreign user's planned expansion into the
        United States,24 as the Board correctly found, neither of these circumstances
        is present in this case.

                                              Notes

        But see International Bancorp, LLC v. Societe des Bains de Mer et du Cercle
des Estrangers a Monaco, 329 F.3d 359 (4th Cir. 2003). There, the Fourth Circuit
held, over a dissent, that a casino's overseas sales to U.S. residents coupled with
advertising in the United States sufficed to give domestic priority over its name. The
opinion is one of the more painful pieces of judicial writing you'll ever see. You'd
have to pay me to read it, which I was. Since no one is paying you, I'll just give you a
taste.

        Indeed, the very fact that the Board in Mother's Restaurant would
        acknowledge that foreign trademarks deemed "famous" can, with neither a
        demonstrated connection to qualifying commerce nor a demonstrated use or
        display of the mark in order to advertise or sell services in such qualifying
        commerce, enjoy Lanham Act protection illustrates the very real interest that
        our trademark laws have in minimizing consumer confusion, so that our
        economy may enjoy the greatest possible of efficiencies and confirms that
        trademarks developed overseas can themselves lead to such undesirable and
        inefficient consumer confusion here at home.

          23 See, e.g., Vaudable v. Montmartre, Inc., 20 Misc.2d 757, 193 N.Y.S.2d 332, 123 USPQ 357
(N.Y.Sup.Ct.1959); Mother's Restaurants, Inc. v. Mother's Other Kitchen, Inc., 218 USPQ 1046 (TTAB 1983).

        And that's just a single sentence. Twenty-one more pages where that came
from in the Federal Reporter. As for the holding, the TTAB does not follow it, and
other cases reject the contention that U.S. advertising can create trademark priority
for a mark solely used for sales outside of the U.S. See Buti v. Perosa, S.R.L., 139
F.3d 98 (2d Cir. 1998).

        Registration of foreign marks. The Lanham Act provides an avenue for holders
of foreign trademark registrations to register in the United States. 15 U.S.C. §
1126. In addition, the Madrid Protocol, of which the United States is a member,
offers a streamlined mechanism for obtaining foreign registrations. Under the
protocol, trademark holders may first register in their home country and then have
that registration sent to the International Bureau of the World Intellectual Property
Organization in Geneva, Switzerland. The bureau then forwards requests for
extensions of protection to participating nations selected by the registrant. These
requests are reviewed by the trademark offices of the selected countries. The
advantage for the registrant is that the protocol eliminates the need for filing
individual applications in each individual nation. Foreign registrants proceeding
under the protocol may obtain protection prior to engaging in use in the United
States, but they must still perfect their rights by using the marks in U.S. commerce.
See 15 U.S.C. §§ 1141-1141n.

        Famous foreign marks. What happens to the territoriality principle if the
foreign mark is famous in the United States notwithstanding the absence of U.S.
operations? The issue is raised by note 23 of the Person's excerpt, and the Ninth and
Second Circuits have split on this question. In Grupo Gigante SA De CV v. Dallo &
Co., Inc., the Ninth Circuit relied on policy considerations to create an exception to
the territoriality principle for famous foreign marks. 391 F.3d 1088, 1094 (9th Cir.
2004). The court stated:

        An absolute territoriality rule without a famous-mark exception would
        promote consumer confusion and fraud. Commerce crosses borders. In this
        nation of immigrants, so do people. Trademark is, at its core, about
        protecting against consumer confusion and "palming off." There can be no
        justification for using trademark law to fool immigrants into thinking that
        they are buying from the store they liked back home.

        The Second Circuit disagreed in ITC Ltd. v. Punchgini, Inc., 482 F.3d 135,
159 (2d Cir. 2007), arguing that the exception finds no basis in the Lanham Act.
For more on this potential exception to the territoriality rule, see 5 MCCARTHY §
29:4.

        And now for something completely different. Complicating all of the above (and
potentially much more), the Fourth Circuit dropped this ruling in 2016.

                       Belmora LLC v. Bayer Consumer Care AG
                                 819 F.3d 697 (4th Cir. 2016)

AGEE, Circuit Judge:
        . . . .
        BCC registered the trademark FLANAX in Mexico for pharmaceutical

products, analgesics, and anti-inflammatories. It has sold naproxen sodium tablets
under the FLANAX brand in Mexico since 1976. FLANAX sales by BCC have
totaled hundreds of millions of dollars, with a portion of the sales occurring in
Mexican cities near the United States border. BCC's FLANAX brand is well-known
in Mexico and other Latin American countries, as well as to Mexican-Americans
and other Hispanics in the United States, but BCC has never marketed or sold its
FLANAX in the United States. Instead, BCC's sister company, BHC, sells naproxen
sodium pain relievers under the brand ALEVE in the United States market.

        Belmora LLC began selling naproxen sodium tablets in the United States as
FLANAX in 2004. The following year, Belmora registered the FLANAX mark in the
United States. Belmora's early FLANAX packaging (below, left) closely mimicked
BCC's Mexican FLANAX packaging (right), displaying a similar color scheme, font
size, and typeface.

        Belmora later modified its packaging (below), but the color scheme, font size,
and typeface remain similar to that of BCC's FLANAX packaging.

        In addition to using similar packaging, Belmora made statements implying
that its FLANAX brand was the same FLANAX product sold by BCC in Mexico.
For example, Belmora circulated a brochure to prospective distributors that stated,

                                                    215
        For generations, Flanax has been a brand that Latinos have turned to for
        various common ailments. Now you too can profit from this highly
        recognized topselling brand among Latinos. Flanax is now made in the U.S.
        and continues to show record sales growth everywhere it is sold. Flanax acts
        as a powerful attraction for Latinos by providing them with products they
        know, trust and prefer.

        Belmora also employed telemarketers and provided them with a script
containing similar statements. . . .

        Bayer points to evidence that these and similar materials resulted in
Belmora's distributors, vendors, and marketers believing that its FLANAX was the
same as or affiliated with BCC's FLANAX. . . .

        [BCC sought a cancellation of Belmora's registration for the FLANAX mark.
The TTAB ordered the cancellation, concluding that Belmora had misrepresented
the source of the FLANAX goods. Bayer then filed suit in the Southern District of
California, bringing § 43(a) and other claims against Belmora. For its part, Belmora
appealed the TTAB's cancellation order by bringing a civil action in the Eastern
District of Virginia. The cases were consolidated in the Virginia action, and the
district court ruled in favor of Belmora.]

         The district court acknowledged that "Belmora's FLANAX ... has a similar
trade dress to Bayer's FLANAX and is marketed in such a way that capitalizes on the
goodwill of Bayer's FLANAX." It nonetheless "distilled" the case "into one single
question":

        Does the Lanham Act allow the owner of a foreign mark that is not
        registered in the United States and further has never used the mark in
        United States commerce to assert priority rights over a mark that is registered
        in the United States by another party and used in United States commerce?

        The district court concluded that "[t]he answer is no" based on its reading of
the Supreme Court's decision in Lexmark International, Inc. v. Static Control
Components, Inc., 134 S.Ct. 1377 (2014). . . .

        The district court dismissed Bayer's false association and false advertising
claims because, in its view, the claims failed to satisfy the standards set forth by the
Supreme Court in Lexmark. At the core of the district court's decision was its
conclusion that 1) Bayer's claims fell outside the Lanham Act's "zone of interests"--
and are not cognizable--"because Bayer does not possess a protectable interest in the
FLANAX mark in the United States," and 2) that a "cognizable economic loss
under the Lanham Act" cannot exist as to a "mark that was not used in United
States commerce."

        On appeal, Bayer contends these conclusions are erroneous as a matter of
law because they conflict with the plain language of § 43(a) and misread Lexmark.

                                                    216
                                                 1.
        "While much of the Lanham Act addresses the registration, use, and
infringement of trademarks and related marks, § 43(a) ... goes beyond trademark
protection." Dastar Corp. v. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp., 539 U.S. 23, 28-29
(2003). Written in terms of the putative defendant's conduct, § 43(a) sets forth
unfair competition causes of action for false association and false advertising:
        Any person who, on or in connection with any goods or services, or any
        container for goods, uses in commerce any word, term, name, symbol, or
        device, or any combination thereof, or any false designation of origin, false
        or misleading description of fact, or false or misleading representation of
        fact, which--

        (A) [False Association:] is likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to
        deceive as to the affiliation, connection, or association of such person with
        another person, or as to the origin, sponsorship, or approval of his or her
        goods, services, or commercial activities by another person, or

        (B) [False Advertising:] in commercial advertising or promotion,
        misrepresents the nature, characteristics, qualities, or geographic origin of his
        or her or another person's goods, services, or commercial activities,

        shall be liable in a civil action by any person who believes that he or she is or
        is likely to be damaged by such act.

15 U.S.C. § 1125(a)(1). . . .
        Significantly, the plain language of § 43(a) does not require that a plaintiff

possess or have used a trademark in U.S. commerce as an element of the cause of
action. Section 43(a) stands in sharp contrast to Lanham Act § 32, which is titled as
and expressly addresses "infringement." 15 U.S.C. § 1114 (requiring for liability the
"use in commerce" of "any reproduction, counterfeit, copy, or colorable imitation of
a registered mark " (emphasis added)). Under § 43(a), it is the defendant's use in
commerce--whether of an offending "word, term, name, symbol, or device" or of a
"false or misleading description [or representation] of fact"--that creates the injury
under the terms of the statute. And here the alleged offending "word, term, name,
symbol, or device" is Belmora's FLANAX mark.

         What § 43(a) does require is that Bayer was "likely to be damaged" by
Belmora's "use[ ] in commerce" of its FLANAX mark and related advertisements.
The Supreme Court recently considered the breadth of this "likely to be damaged"
language in Lexmark, a false advertising case arising from a dispute in the used-
printer-cartridge market. . . . The Supreme Court . . . observed that the real question
in Lexmark was "whether Static Control has a cause of action under the statute."

                                                    217
This query, in turn, hinged on "a straightforward question of statutory
interpretation" to which it applied "traditional principles" of interpretation. . . .

        The Court concluded that § 43(a)'s broad authorization--permitting suit by
"any person who believes that he or she is or is likely to be damaged"--should not be
taken "literally" to reach the limits of Article III standing, but is framed by two
"background principles," which may overlap.

        First, a plaintiff's claim must fall within the "zone of interests" protected by
the statute. The scope of the zone of interests is not "especially demanding," and the
plaintiff receives the "benefit of any doubt." Because the Lanham Act contains an
"unusual, and extraordinarily helpful" purpose statement in § 45, identifying the
statute's zone of interests "requires no guesswork." Section 45 provides:

        The intent of this chapter is to regulate commerce within the control of
        Congress by making actionable the deceptive and misleading use of marks in
        such commerce; to protect registered marks used in such commerce from
        interference by State, or territorial legislation; to protect persons engaged in
        such commerce against unfair competition; to prevent fraud and deception
        in such commerce by the use of reproductions, copies, counterfeits, or
        colorable imitations of registered marks; and to provide rights and remedies
        stipulated by treaties and conventions respecting trademarks, trade names,
        and unfair competition entered into between the United States and foreign
        nations.

Lanham Act § 45, 15 U.S.C. § 1127.
        The Supreme Court observed that "[m]ost of the enumerated purposes are

relevant to a false-association case," while "a typical false-advertising case will
implicate only the Act's goal of `protecting persons engaged in commerce within the
control of Congress against unfair competition.' " Lexmark, 134 S.Ct. at 1389. . . .

        The second Lexmark background principle is that "a statutory cause of action
is limited to plaintiffs whose injuries are proximately caused by violations of the
statute." The injury must have a "sufficiently close connection to the conduct the
statute prohibits." In the § 43(a) context, this means "show[ing] economic or
reputational injury flowing directly from the deception wrought by the defendant's
advertising; and that that occurs when deception of consumers causes them to
withhold trade from the plaintiff.". . .

                                                 2.
                                                 a.
        We first address the position, pressed by Belmora and adopted by the district
court, that a plaintiff must have initially used its own mark in commerce within the
United States as a condition precedent to a § 43(a) claim. In dismissing BCC's §
43(a) claims, the district court found dispositive that "Bayer failed to plead facts

                                                    218
showing that it used the FLANAX mark in commerce in [the] United States." Upon
that ground, the district court held "that Bayer does not possess a protectable
interest in the [FLANAX] mark."

        As noted earlier, such a requirement is absent from § 43(a)'s plain language
and its application in Lexmark. Under the statute, the defendant must have "use[d] in
commerce" the offending "word, term, name, [or] symbol," but the plaintiff need
only "believe[ ] that he or she is or is likely to be damaged by such act." Lanham Act
§ 43(a), 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a).

        It is important to emphasize that this is an unfair competition case, not a
trademark infringement case. Belmora and the district court conflated the Lanham
Act's infringement provision in § 32 (which authorizes suit only "by the registrant,"
and thereby requires the plaintiff to have used its own mark in commerce) with
unfair competition claims pled in this case under § 43(a). Section 32 makes clear
that Congress knew how to write a precondition of trademark possession and use
into a Lanham Act cause of action when it chose to do so. It has not done so in §
43(a).

        Given that Lexmark advises courts to adhere to the statutory language,
"apply[ing] traditional principles of statutory interpretation," Lexmark, 134 S.Ct. at
1388, we lack authority to introduce a requirement into § 43(a) that Congress
plainly omitted. Nothing in Lexmark can be read to suggest that § 43(a) claims have
an unstated requirement that the plaintiff have first used its own mark (word, term,
name, symbol, or device) in U.S. commerce before a cause of action will lie against a
defendant who is breaching the statute.

        The district court thus erred in requiring Bayer, as the plaintiff, to have pled
its prior use of its own mark in U.S. commerce when it is the defendant's use of a
mark or misrepresentation that underlies the § 43(a) unfair competition cause of
action. Having made this foundational error, the district court's resolution of the
issues requires reversal.

        Admittedly, some of our prior cases appear to have treated a plaintiff's use of
a mark in United States commerce as a prerequisite for a false association claim. See
Lamparello v. Falwell, 420 F.3d 309, 313 (4th Cir.2005) ("Both infringement [under
§ 32] and false designation of origin [under § 43(a) ] have [the same] five
elements."); People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals v. Doughney, 263 F.3d 359, 364
(4th Cir.2001) (same); Int'l Bancorp, 329 F.3d at 361 n. 2 ("[T]he tests for trademark
infringement and unfair competition ... are identical."); Lone Star Steakhouse &
Saloon v. Alpha of Va., Inc., 43 F.3d 922, 930 (4th Cir.1995) ("[T]o prevail under §§
32(1) and 43(a) of the Lanham Act for trademark infringement and unfair
competition, respectively, a complainant must demonstrate that it has a valid,
protectible trademark[.]"). However, none of these cases made that consideration
the ratio decidendi of its holding or analyzed whether the statute in fact contains such

                                                    219
a requirement. See, e.g., 5 J. Thomas McCarthy, Trademarks and Unfair
Competition § 29:4 (4th ed.2002) (observing that International Bancorp merely
"assumed that to trigger Lanham Act § 43(a), the plaintiff's mark must be `used in
commerce' "). Moreover, all of these cases predate Lexmark, which provides the
applicable Supreme Court precedent interpreting § 43(a).

        Although the plaintiffs' use of a mark in U.S. commerce was a fact in
common in the foregoing cases, substantial precedent reflects that § 43(a) unfair
competition claims come within the statute's protectable zone of interests without
the preconditions adopted by the district court and advanced by Belmora. As the
Supreme Court has pointed out, § 43(a) "goes beyond trademark protection."
Dastar Corp., 539 U.S. at 29. For example, a plaintiff whose mark has become
generic--and therefore not protectable--may plead an unfair competition claim
against a competitor that uses that generic name and "fail[s] adequately to identify
itself as distinct from the first organization" such that the name causes "confusion
or a likelihood of confusion." Blinded Veterans Ass'n v. Blinded Am. Veterans Found.,
872 F.2d 1035, 1043 (D.C.Cir.1989); see also Kellogg Co. v. Nat'l Biscuit Co., 305
U.S. 111, 118-19 (1938) (requiring the defendant to "use reasonable care to inform
the public of the source of its product" even though the plaintiff's "shredded wheat"
mark was generic and therefore unprotectable); Singer Mfg. Co. v. June Mfg. Co., 163
U.S. 169, 203-04 (1896) (same, for "Singer" sewing machines).

        Likewise, in a "reverse passing off" case, the plaintiff need not have used a
mark in commerce to bring a § 43(a) action. . . .

        The generic mark and reverse passing off cases illustrate that § 43(a) actions
do not require, implicitly or otherwise, that a plaintiff have first used its own mark
in United States commerce. If such a use were a condition precedent to bringing a §
43(a) action, the generic mark and reverse passing off cases could not exist.

        In sum, the Lanham Act's plain language contains no unstated requirement
that a § 43(a) plaintiff have used a U.S. trademark in U.S. commerce to bring a
Lanham Act unfair competition claim. The Supreme Court's guidance in Lexmark
does not allude to one, and our prior cases either only assumed or articulated as
dicta that such a requirement existed. Thus, the district court erred in imposing
such a condition precedent upon Bayer's claims.

        As Bayer is not barred from making a § 43(a) claim, the proper Lexmark
inquiry is twofold. Did the alleged acts of unfair competition fall within the
Lanham Act's protected zone of interests? And if so, did Bayer plead proximate
causation of a cognizable injury?. . . .

        [The court noted that one enumerated purpose of the Lanham Act is
"making actionable the deceptive and misleading use of marks" in "commerce
within the control of Congress." Lanham Act § 45, 15 U.S.C. § 1127. It held that
BCC's false association claim "advances that purpose," given the allegation that

                                                    220
"Belmora's misleading association with BCC's FLANAX has caused BCC customers
to buy the Belmora FLANAX in the United States instead of purchasing BCC's
FLANAX in Mexico." With respect to proximate causation, "[T]he complaint can
fairly be read to allege `economic or reputational injury flowing directly from the
deception wrought by the defendant's' conduct."].

        . . . .
        We thus conclude that the Lanham Act permits Bayer to proceed with its
claims under § 43(a) . . . .
        In granting Bayer that chance, we are not concluding that BCC has any
specific trademark rights to the FLANAX mark in the United States. Belmora owns
that mark. But trademark rights do not include using the mark to deceive customers
as a form of unfair competition, as is alleged here. Should Bayer prevail and prove
its § 43(a) claims, an appropriate remedy might include directing Belmora to use the
mark in a way that does not sow confusion. See Lanham Act § 34(a), 15 U.S.C. §
1116(a) (authorizing injunctions based on "principles of equity"). Of course, the
precise remedy would be a determination to be made by the district court in the
first instance upon proper evidence. We leave any potential remedy to the district
court's discretion should this case reach that point. We only note that any remedy
should take into account traditional trademark principles relating to Belmora's
ownership of the mark.

                                               Note

        What does it all mean? Belmora casts doubt on several principles on which
trademark practitioners normally rely. The first is territoriality. The fact that the
plaintiff has trademark rights to FLANEX outside of the United States would not
normally (outside, potentially, the very limited famous marks exception) affect
domestic rights, and Bayer was not using FLANEX domestically. This expectation is
reinforced by the defendant's registration, which creates a prima facie presumption
of its right to use the mark in the United States. 15 U.S.C. § 1057. The result in
Belmora therefore raised any number of eyebrows. See, e.g., Meenaxi Enter., Inc. v.
Coca-Cola Co., 38 F.4th 1067 (Fed. Cir. 2022) ("While Belmora suggests that the
Lanham Act applies to foreign commerce and, accordingly, that commercial injury
to a company's sales in a foreign country qualifies as damage for purposes of . . . §
43(a), this view has been much criticized in the academic literature.").

        Belmora gets around the territoriality principle by focusing on the section
43(a) cause of action, 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a). This brings us to the second expectation
undermined by Belmora, which requires a brief discussion of infringement even
though we will not cover infringement in detail until later.

                                                    221
        Section 43(a) is often thought of as providing the ability to sue for
infringement of unregistered trademarks. On this view, its operation and scope
parallels the rules that apply to registered marks. Belmora takes a different tack,
focusing on the broad language of section 43(a), which does not explicitly require
the plaintiff to have a valid trademark. It simply targets defendant conduct that "is
likely to cause confusion . . . as to the affiliation, connection, or association of such
person with another person, or as to the origin, sponsorship, or approval of his or
her goods." And as the Fourth Circuit concluded, "the plain language of § 43(a)
does not require that a plaintiff possess or have used a trademark in U.S. commerce
as an element of the cause of action."

        Does this set different parts of the Lanham Act against each other? What
does it mean if the holder of a trademark registration cannot rely on it? (Note, of
course, that Bayer's litigation efforts included an attempt to cancel the defendant's
registration.) Can it really be the case that the cause of action encompassing
unregistered marks is broader than the one applying to registered marks? Does that
seem backwards? At the very least, shouldn't the two causes of action share the same
limitations? Or is the section 43(a) cause of action simply different in kind from
trademark infringement and deserving of its own case law? Recall (from chapter
one) that unfair competition and trademark law used to be distinct bodies of law.

11. Abandonment

Problems

        1. For decades, the Seattle Supersonics, an NBA team, played basketball
in Seattle. The Sonics, as they were known, had a strong fan base and won an NBA
title in 1979. In 2006 the team was sold to an ownership group led by Oklahoma
City businessman Clayton Bennett. Two years later, the team relocated to
Oklahoma City, where it was renamed the Oklahoma City Thunder.

        Since moving to Oklahoma City, the Thunder largely ceased activities under
the Supersonics mark. It does, however, retain the domain name supersonics.com,
which redirects to the Thunder's web page. It also plans to operate in the
memorabilia market and sell throwback jerseys of famous Sonics players, but no
such activities are ongoing.

        Disappointed by the departure of his favorite team, Seattle resident Oscar
Gamble operates a website called rememberthesonics.com. In addition, he operates
a touring basketball team (which plays local teams from colleges, high schools, etc.)
that he has named the Seattle Supersonics. The Thunder have sent him a cease and
desist letter. He claims the Sonics trademark has been abandoned. You are an
attorney in the Thunder's GC office. Advise the team.

        2. A group of law students start a blog that lists their complaints about
and suggestions for improvement of their school. It's called "The Ronin." The site
becomes popular, spurring students at other law schools to start similar blogs. Some
of these blogs coordinate closely with the originating students and place a banner
on their site that reads "Part of the Ronin Network." As the blogs become more
popular, the originating students receive requests for permission for other student
blogs to use the banner. Some sites have used the banner without permission. Any
advice?

Statutory provisions

                           Lanham Act § 45 (15 U.S.C. § 1127)

        A mark shall be deemed to be "abandoned" . . . . When its use has been
discontinued with intent not to resume such use. Intent not to resume may be
inferred from circumstances. Nonuse for 3 consecutive years shall be prima facie
evidence of abandonment. "Use" of a mark means the bona fide use of such mark
made in the ordinary course of trade, and not made merely to reserve a right in a

                                                    223
mark. [Or w]hen any course of conduct of the owner, including acts of omission as
well as commission, causes the mark to become the generic name for the goods or
services on or in connection with which it is used or otherwise to lose its
significance as a mark. Purchaser motivation shall not be a test for determining
abandonment under this paragraph.

                            Lanham Act § 5 (15 U.S.C. § 1055)

        Where a registered mark or a mark sought to be registered is or may be used
legitimately by related companies, such use shall inure to the benefit of the
registrant or applicant for registration, and such use shall not affect the validity of
such mark or of its registration, provided such mark is not used in such manner as
to deceive the public. If first use of a mark by a person is controlled by the registrant
or applicant for registration of the mark with respect to the nature and quality of
the goods or services, such first use shall inure to the benefit of the registrant or
applicant, as the case may be.

Abandonment

        The principles of abandonment fit nicely within the basic framework of
trademark law. Trademark rights are use-based. No use, no rights. To generalize
more broadly, a mark is supposed to embody the goodwill of the user and allow
consumers to identify and distinguish the goods and services of the user in the
marketplace. If the user is not using the mark, then the mark cannot perform a
trademark function, leaving it open for others. Simple enough, but, as always, there
are wrinkles galore.

        Standards of proof. Because abandonment strips a trademark holder of any
rights in the mark, courts are generally reluctant to find it. Most judges require clear
and convincing evidence of abandonment. The Federal Circuit, however, accepts a
simple preponderance of the evidence. Cerveceria Centroamericana, S.A. v. Cerveceria
India, Inc., 892 F.2d 1021 (Fed. Cir. 1989).

        The Lanham Act shifts the presumption with respect to marks that have not
been used for three years, providing that "[n]onuse for 3 consecutive years shall be
prima facie evidence of abandonment." 15 U.S.C. § 1127. Some courts declare that
while three years of non-use shifts the burden of production to the trademark
holder, the burden of persuasion remains with the party seeking a declaration of
abandonment. Cumulus Media, Inc. v. Clear Channel Communications, Inc., 304
F.3d 1167 (11th Cir. 2002).

                                                    224
        Brand maintenance programs. Courts generally reject efforts to preserve
trademark rights with token uses. Exxon Corp. v. Humble Exploration Co., Inc.,
695 F.2d 96, 101 (5th Cir. 1982) ("[A]rranged sales in which the mark was not
allowed to play its basic role of identifying source [is] not `use' in the sense of
section 1127 of the Lanham Act"). The modern statute reflects this view by
requiring bona fide sales.

        Loss of goodwill through low sales/interrupted sales. If there are no sales, then the
mark will cease to embody a seller's goodwill. But of course in the normal ebb and
flow of trade and fortune, a company may cease sales of a product line only to
resume them at a more opportune moment. As the D.C. Circuit put it, trademark
law rejects the notion that "the slightest cessation of use causes a trademark to roll
free, like a fumbled football, so that it may be pounced on by any alert opponent."
Continental Distilling Corp. v. Old Charter Distillery Co., 188 F.2d 614, 619 (D.C.
Cir. 1950). And sometimes the interruption in use stems from unusual
circumstances. See Cash Processing Services v. Ambient Entertainment, Inc., 418 F.
Supp. 2d 1227 (D. Nev. 2006).

        Courts generally find that a mark will survive periods of low sales and
occasional interruptions of use. Good faith efforts usually suffice to preserve a mark.
Likewise, courts will enjoin potentially confusing uses by others during these down
times. "[G]oodwill does not ordinarily disappear or completely lose its value
overnight. Erosion from nonuse is a gradual process. As long as the mark has
significant remaining value and the owner intends to use it in connection with
substantially the same business or service, the public is not deceived." Defiance
Button Machine Co. v. C & C Metal Products Corp., 759 F.2d 1053, 1060 (2d Cir.
1985) (no abandonment despite sale of assets because holder intended to resume
activities and business retained goodwill). In a similar vein, Perry v. H.J. Heinz
Company Brands, L.L.C., 994 F.3d 466 (5th Cir. 2021), rejected an effort to ground
abandonment on a failure to operate outside the trademark holder's home state.
The court noted that the Lanham Act's "use in commerce" requirement can be met
by intrastate commerce.

        Failure to sue. If you follow trademark law, you'll see any number of
suits/cease-and-desist letters that make the trademark holder look, well, stupid
because the challenged conduct is so trivial. So why bother? One possibility is the
belief that failing to protect trademark rights aggressively might lead a court to find
abandonment. This fear is largely unjustified except in extreme cases (e.g., Coke
tolerating the sales of a rival soda under the COKE name). As Professor McCarthy
notes in his treatise, the key is whether a mark has lost its distinctiveness, not
whether a trademark holder has tolerated the conduct of any particular potential

                                                    225
defendant. "The owner of a mark is not required to constantly monitor every nook
and cranny of the entire nation and to fire both barrels of his shotgun instantly
upon spotting a possible infringer. Lawyers and lawsuits come high and a financial
decision must be made in every case as to whether the gain of prosecution is worth
the candle." Engineered Mechanical Services, Inc. v. Applied Mechanical
Technology, Inc., 584 F. Supp. 1149, 1160 (M.D. La. 1984). And with respect to
any particular defendant, delay in filing suit should pertain to a potential equitable
defense of laches, not trademark abandonment. 3 MCCARTHY § 17:17.

        What happens after abandonment? What should the fate of a mark be after it is
abandoned? Should it be up for grabs? Or should residual consumer goodwill
dissipate first? Does the answer depend on whether you think trademark law is
about protecting sellers or consumers? The general approach is that an abandoned
mark is available under traditional rules of first use. Dial-A-Mattress Operating
Corp. v. Mattress Madness, Inc., 841 F. Supp. 1339, 1355 (E.D.N.Y. 1994) ("Once
abandoned, the mark reverts back to the public domain whereupon it may be
appropriated by anyone who adopts the mark for his or her own use."). As seen with
generic marks, however, sometimes courts will require those appropriating the
abandoned marks to distinguish themselves from the prior user. RESTATEMENT
(THIRD) OF UNFAIR COMPETITION § 30, comment a (1995) (noting that use of an
abandoned mark is not trademark infringement but may, depending on the
circumstances, create liability for misrepresentation of source; "Subsequent users,
although free to use the abandoned designation, may thus be required to take
precautions necessary to avoid a likelihood of confusion if the designation retains its
association with the former user."); In re Wielinski, 49 U.S.P.Q.2d 1754 (T.T.A.B.
1998) ("It is well settled, however, that after a mark has become abandoned, if it is
then adopted and used by an entity unrelated to the original owner, the rights to
the mark vest with the first to adopt and use it, provided that the new user takes
reasonable precautions to prevent confusion.").

        Breaking up is hard to do. A somewhat related issue concerns mark ownership
when the owning entity divides or otherwise ceases to be a single body. What then?
See Lyons v. Am. Coll. of Veterinary Sports Med. & Rehab., 859 F.3d 1023, 1029
(Fed. Cir. 2017) (agreeing that the "three main factors to be considered in
ownership disputes surrounding service marks as between a departing member and
the remnant group" are (1) the parties' objective intentions or expectations; (2) who
the public associates with the mark; and (3) to whom the public looks to stand
behind the quality of goods or services offered under the mark.)").

                                                    226
Assignments

        Trademark law prohibits assignments in gross of a mark (the sale of a mark
without its accompanying goodwill). "A trade name or mark is merely a symbol of
goodwill; it has no independent significance apart from the goodwill it symbolizes. .
. . [It therefore] cannot be sold or assigned apart from the goodwill it symbolizes."
Marshak v. Green, 746 F.2d 927, 929 (2d Cir. 1984); see also 15 U.S.C. § 1060(a)(1)
("A registered mark or a mark for which an application to register has been filed
shall be assignable with the good will of the business in which the mark is used, or
with that part of the good will of the business connected with the use of and
symbolized by the mark."). The traditional view is that allowing a naked assignment
could defraud the public. Marshak, 746 F.2d at 929 ("Use of the mark by the
assignee in connection with a different goodwill and different product would result
in a fraud on the purchasing public who reasonably assume that the mark signifies
the same thing, whether used by one person or another.").

        Does that explanation sound plausible to you? If it does, then why doesn't
trademark law punish a markholder for altering product quality? What's the
difference between allowing quality to drop and making an assignment in gross?

        What must pass for "goodwill" to be part of the transaction? Things seem
clear enough if the sale of a mark is accompanied by the sale of the entire
underlying business. But what if we just have the sale of some (but not all) of a
company's tangible assets? Or a purported assignment of a mark and its "goodwill"
without anything more? Courts look to the substance of the transaction, not the
form, in trying to decide these issues. RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF UNFAIR
COMPETITION § 34, comment b (1995) (noting that how the mark is used after the
assignment matters in determining whether the sale "disrupt[s] the associational
significance of the designation. The traditional rule requiring an accompanying
transfer of "good will" can thus be seen as a requirement that the assignment
preserve the significance of the mark to consumers.").

        For commentary on how the anti-assignment in gross rule interacts with the
creation of security interests, see 3 MCCARTHY § 18:7.

Licensing and Abandonment

        Abandonment issues often accompany efforts to license a trademark.
Consider the importance of trademarks to a franchising relationship. Most
McDonald's franchises are not owned by the McDonald's corporation. Instead,
local entrepreneurs receive a license to use the McDONALD'S mark. They, in turn,
must follow certain rules set by the company, which ensure that the consumer
experience is more or less the same from one franchise to the next. As you might
expect, franchising relationships can be complex and are frequent litigation fodder.

                                                    227
        Although franchising plays a major role in everyday life, it was not initially
clear that the trademarks of a franchisor could be used by a franchisee. After all,
they were not the same entity and therefore not the same source of a product as the
franchisor. Justice Scalia noted the issue in passing in Dastar, where he admitted
what he had denied in his Two Pesos concurrence: The early text of the Lanham Act
did not fully encompass actual trademark practices.

        Under the 1946 version of the Act, § 43(a) was read as providing a cause of
        action for trademark infringement even where the trademark owner had not
        itself produced the goods sold under its mark, but had licensed others to sell
        under its name goods produced by them--the typical franchise arrangement.
        This stretching of the concept "origin of goods" is seemingly no longer
        needed: The 1988 amendments to § 43(a) now expressly prohibit the use of
        any "word, term, name, symbol, or device," or "false or misleading
        description of fact" that is likely to cause confusion as to "affiliation,
        connection, or association ... with another person," or as to "sponsorship, or
        approval" of goods. 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a).

Dastar Corp. v. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp., 539 U.S. 23, 32 (2003). As
indicated by the quote, judicial expansion of trademark law (as ratified by Congress)
enabled trademarks to support franchising relationships.

                         FreecycleSunnyvale v. Freecycle Network
                                 626 F.3d 509 (9th Cir. 2010)

CALLAHAN, Circuit Judge:
        FreecycleSunnyvale ("FS") is a member group of The Freecycle Network

("TFN"), an organization devoted to facilitating the recycling of goods. FS filed a
declaratory action against TFN arising from a trademark licensing dispute, alleging
noninfringement of TFN's trademarks and tortious interference with FS's business
relations. FS moved for partial summary judgment on the issue of whether its naked
licensing defense to trademark infringement allowed it to avoid a finding of
infringement as a matter of law.1 TFN argued that it had established adequate
quality control standards over its licensees' services and use of the trademarks to

          1 Naked licensing occurs when a licensor does not exercise adequate quality control over its
licensee's use of a licensed trademark such that the trademark may no longer represent the quality of the
product or service the consumer has come to expect. See Barcamerica Int'l USA Trust v. Tyfield Importers,
Inc., 289 F.3d 589, 595-96 (9th Cir.2002). By not enforcing the terms of the trademark's use, the licensor
may forfeit his rights to enforce the exclusive nature of the trademark. . . .

                                                    228
avoid a finding of naked licensing and abandonment of its trademarks. The district
court granted summary judgment to FS. We hold that TFN (1) did not retain
express contractual control over FS's quality control measures, (2) did not have
actual controls over FS's quality control measures, and (3) was unreasonable in
relying on FS's quality control measures. Because we find that TFN engaged in
naked licensing and thereby abandoned its trademarks, we affirm.

                                                      I
                                                     A
        In March 2003, Deron Beal ("Beal") founded TFN, an umbrella non-profit
Arizona corporation dedicated to "freecycling." The term "freecycling" combines the
words "free" and "recycling" and refers to the practice of giving an unwanted item
to a stranger so that it can continue to be used for its intended purpose, rather than
disposing of it. As practiced by TFN, freecycling is primarily a local activity
conducted by means of internet groups, which are created by volunteers through
online service providers like Yahoo! Groups and Google Groups. Although not
required to do so, most TFN member groups use Yahoo! Groups as a forum for
members to coordinate their freecycling activities. TFN also maintains its own
website, www. freecycle. org, which provides a directory of member groups as well as
resources for volunteers to create new groups. The website also includes a section
devoted to etiquette guidelines.
        TFN asserts that it maintains a "Freecycle Ethos"--a democratic leadership
structure, in which decisions are made through a process of surveys and discussions
among volunteer moderators. Local volunteer moderators are responsible for
enforcing TFN's rules and policies, but the moderators have flexibility in
enforcement depending on the moderators' assessment of their local communities.
        Since May 2003, TFN has been using three trademarks, FREECYCLE, THE
FREECYCLE NETWORK, and a logo (collectively "the trademarks") to identify
TFN's services and to identify member groups' affiliation with TFN. Federal
registration of the trademarks is currently pending in the United States, but the
trademarks have been registered in other countries. TFN permits member groups to
use the trademarks. When TFN first started, Beal personally regulated the use of the
trademarks but, as TFN has grown, it has relied on local moderators to regulate
member groups' use of the trademarks.
        Lisanne Abraham ("Abraham") founded FS on October 7, 2003, in
Sunnyvale, California, without TFN's knowledge or involvement. She established
the group by entering into a service contract with Yahoo! Groups and becoming the
group's moderator. Upon establishing FS, Abraham adapted etiquette guidelines
and instructions for how to use FS from either TFN's or one of TFN's member
group's website. On October 7, 2003, Abraham emailed Beal directly asking for a
logo for FS, and they spoke over the phone within days of the email

                                                    229
communication. After the phone conversation, Beal emailed Abraham on October
9, 2003, stating: "You can get the neutral logo from www. freecycle. org, just don't
use it for commercial purposes or you [sic] maybe Mark or Albert can help you to do
your own fancy schmancy logo!"4 This email is the only record of a direct
communication between FS and TFN regarding the use of any of the trademarks.

        Between October 7, 2003, and October 9, 2003, FS was added to TFN's list
of online freecycling groups displayed on TFN's website. Then, on October 9, 2003,
Abraham received an email from Beal addressed to nineteen moderators of new
freecycle Yahoo! Groups which, among other things, welcomed them to TFN. The
email did not discuss or include any restrictions or guidance on the use of TFN's
trademarks. On October 13, 2003, Abraham received another email from TFN, this
time an invitation to join the "freecyclemodsquad" Yahoo! Group ("modsquad
group"), an informal discussion forum exclusively for the moderators of freecycle
Yahoo! Groups to share ideas.

        Before 2004, TFN had only a few suggested guidelines in the etiquette
section of its website, including a "Keep it Free" rule. Then, on January 4, 2004,
Beal sent an email to the modsquad group, asking whether TFN should also limit
listed items to those that were legal. Ultimately, Beal proposed the adoption of a
"Keep it Free, Legal & Appropriate for All Ages" rule and asked "that all
moderators vote on whether they feel this is the one rule that should apply to ALL
local groups or not." Between January 4 and January 11, 2004, a majority of the
modsquad group voted to require all local groups to adopt the rule and, on January
11, Beal informed the group that "I'm glad to say ... we now have one true guiding
principle." Although the moderators adopted the "Keep it Free, Legal &
Appropriate for All Ages" rule, following its adoption, they frequently discussed
what the actual meaning of the rule was and, ultimately, its definition and
enforcement varied from group to group.

        Although the underlying reason is not evident from the record or the parties'
briefs, on November 1 and November 14, 2005, TFN sent emails to FS ordering the
group to cease and desist using the Freecycle name and logo and threatening to have
Yahoo! terminate FS's Yahoo! Group if FS did not comply. On November 5, FS
emailed Yahoo! and disputed TFN's ability to forbid the use of the trademarks by
informing Yahoo! of the license that TFN allegedly had granted FS in October 2003
(i.e., Beal's October 9, 2003 email authorizing Abraham to use the logo). On

          4 Mark Messinger is the moderator for the Olympia, Washington, freecycle group. He helped

Abraham fashion a unique freecycle logo for Sunnyvale. Albert Kaufman apparently introduced Abraham to

freecycling.

                                                    230
November 21, Yahoo! terminated the FS Yahoo! Group at TFN's request, after
receiving a claim from TFN that FS was infringing on TFN's trademark rights.

                                                 B
        On January 18, 2006, FS filed a declaratory judgment action against TFN in
the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, alleging
noninfringement of TFN's trademarks and tortious interference with FS's business
relations. TFN brought counterclaims for trademark infringement and unfair
competition under the Lanham Act and California Business and Professions Code
section 17200.
        FS then moved for summary judgment on the issue of whether its naked
licensing defense to trademark infringement allowed it to avoid a finding of
infringement as a matter of law. FS argued that TFN had abandoned its trademarks
because it engaged in naked licensing when it granted FS the right to use the
trademarks without either (1) the right to control or (2) the exercise of actual
control over FS's activities. On March 13, 2008, the district court granted summary
judgment in favor of FS, holding that TFN engaged in naked licensing and
therefore abandoned its rights to the trademarks. The parties stipulated to dismiss
the remaining claims, and final judgment was entered on May 20, 2008. TFN
thereafter timely filed its appeal.

                                                 II
        . . . . In ruling on a motion for summary judgment, our inquiry "necessarily
implicates the substantive evidentiary standard of proof that would apply at the trial
on the merits." We have held that the proponent of a naked license theory of
trademark abandonment must meet a "stringent standard of proof." Barcamerica,
289 F.3d at 596 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Prudential Ins. Co. of Am.
v. Gibraltar Fin. Corp. of Cal., 694 F.2d 1150, 1156 (9th Cir.1982) ("Abandonment
of a trademark, being in the nature of forfeiture, must be strictly proved."); Edwin K.
Williams & Co. v. Edwin K. Williams & Co. E., 542 F.2d 1053, 1059 (9th. Cir.1976)
("[A] person who asserts insufficient control [of a trademark] must meet a high
burden of proof.").
        We have yet to determine, however, whether this high standard of proof
requires "clear and convincing" evidence or a "preponderance of the evidence."
Indeed, in Grocery Outlet Inc. v. Albertson's Inc., 497 F.3d 949, 952-54 (9th Cir.2007)
(per curiam), Judges Wallace and McKeown disagreed in separate concurrences as to
which standard applies. Judge Wallace advocated the clear and convincing standard,
while Judge McKeown argued that the preponderance of the evidence standard
applied . . . .
        Here, we need not decide which standard of proof applies because, even
applying the higher standard of proof--clear and convincing--and viewing the
evidence in the light most favorable to TFN as the non-moving party, FS has

                                                    231
demonstrated that TFN engaged in naked licensing and consequently abandoned
the trademarks.

                                                III
        An introduction to "naked licensing" of trademarks is in order, as this issue
has seldom arisen in this circuit or in our sister circuits. Our only discussion of this
subject is in Barcamerica, 289 F.3d at 598 (holding that Barcamerica, a vintner,
engaged in naked licensing and abandoned its trademark by failing to retain or
otherwise exercise adequate quality control over the trademark it had licensed to
another company), and that decision informs and guides our discussion here.
        As a general matter, trademark owners have a duty to control the quality of
their trademarks. McCarthy § 18:48. "It is well-established that `[a] trademark owner
may grant a license and remain protected provided quality control of the goods and
services sold under the trademark by the licensee is maintained.' " Barcamerica, 289
F.3d at 595-96 (quoting Moore Bus. Forms, Inc. v. Ryu, 960 F.2d 486, 489 (5th
Cir.1992)).
        "Naked licensing" occurs when the licensor "fails to exercise adequate quality
control over the licensee." Id. at 596. Naked licensing may result in the trademark's
ceasing to function as a symbol of quality and a controlled source. We have
previously declared that naked licensing is "inherently deceptive and constitutes
abandonment of any rights to the trademark by the licensor." Id. at 598.
"Consequently, where the licensor fails to exercise adequate quality control over the
licensee, `a court may find that the trademark owner has abandoned the trademark,
in which case the owner would be estopped from asserting rights to the
trademark.' " Id. at 596 (quoting Moore, 960 F.2d at 489).

                                                 A
         At issue here is whether there is clear and convincing evidence, viewed in
the light most favorable to TFN, that TFN allowed FS to use the trademarks with so
few restrictions as to compel a finding that TFN engaged in naked licensing and
abandoned the trademarks. TFN contends that disputed issues of material fact
remain as to whether TFN's quality control standards, during the relevant time
period, were sufficient. Although TFN concedes that it did not have an express
license agreement, it alleges that a reasonable jury could find that it had adequate
quality control measures in place when FS was authorized to use the trademarks,
making summary judgment inappropriate.

                                                 1
        When deciding summary judgment on claims of naked licensing, we first
determine whether the license contained an express contractual right to inspect and
supervise the licensee's operations. The absence of an agreement with provisions
restricting or monitoring the quality of goods or services produced under a
trademark supports a finding of naked licensing.

                                                    232
        TFN concedes that it did not have an express license agreement with FS
regarding FS's use of the trademarks. Without an express license agreement, TFN
necessarily lacks express contractual rights to inspect and supervise FS. However,
TFN argues that the October 9, 2003 email, in which Beal advised Abraham that:
"You can get the neutral logo from www. freecycle. org, just don't use it for commercial
purposes....", reflects an implied license. Emphasis added.

        Even assuming that Beal's emailed admonition to Abraham not to use the
trademarks for commercial purposes constitutes an implied licensing agreement, it
contained no express contractual right to inspect or supervise FS's services and no
ability to terminate FS's license if FS used the trademarks for commercial purposes.
We therefore hold that, by TFN's own admission, there is no disputed issue of
material fact as to whether TFN maintained an express contractual right to control
quality.

                                                 2
        TFN next contends that, despite its lack of an express contractual right to
control quality, a material issue of fact remains as to whether TFN maintained
actual control over its member groups' services and use of the trademarks when FS
was granted use of the trademarks in October 2003. "The lack of an express
contract right to inspect and supervise a licensee's operations is not conclusive
evidence of lack of control." Barcamerica, 289 F.3d at 596. However, where courts
have excused the lack of a contractual right to control quality, they have still
required that the licensor demonstrate actual control through inspection or
supervision.
        TFN asserts that it exercised actual control over the trademarks because it
had several quality control standards in place, specifically: (1) the "Keep it Free,
Legal, and Appropriate for all Ages" standard and TFN's incorporation of the
Yahoo! Groups' service terms; (2) the non-commercial services requirement
(expressed in Beal's October 9, 2003 email); (3) the etiquette guidelines listed on
TFN's website; and (4) TFN's "Freecycle Ethos" which, TFN contends, establishes
policies and procedures for member groups, even if local member groups are
permitted flexibility in how to apply those policies and procedures. In addition,
TFN cites Birthright v. Birthright, Inc., 827 F.Supp. 1114 (D.N.J.1993) for the
principle that loosely organized non-profits like TFN and FS that share "the
common goals of a public service organization" are subject to less stringent quality
control requirements.
        First, we disagree with TFN's contentions that the "Keep it Free, Legal, and
Appropriate for all Ages" standard and its incorporation of the Yahoo! Groups'

                                                    233
service terms constituted actual controls over its member groups.6 The undisputed
evidence showed that TFN's licensees were not required to adopt the "Keep it Free,
Legal, and Appropriate for all Ages" standard, nor was it uniformly applied or
interpreted by the local groups. Similarly, FS was not required to use Yahoo!
Groups and was not asked to agree to the Yahoo! Groups' service terms as a
condition of using TFN's trademarks. Moreover, the Yahoo! Groups' service terms,
which regulate generic online activity like sending spam messages and prohibiting
harassment, cannot be considered quality controls over TFN's member groups'
services and use of the trademarks. The service terms apply to every Yahoo! Group,
and do not control the quality of the freecycling services that TFN's member groups
provide. Thus, the "Keep it Free, Legal and Appropriate for All Ages" standard and
the Yahoo! Groups' service terms were not quality controls over FS's use of the
trademarks.

        Second, we conclude that TFN's non-commercial requirement says nothing
about the quality of the services provided by member groups and therefore does not
establish a control requiring member groups to maintain consistent quality. Thus, it
is not an actual control in the trademark context. Third, because member groups
may freely adopt and adapt TFN's listed rules of etiquette and because of the
voluntary and amorphous nature of these rules, they cannot be considered an actual
control. For example, FS modified the etiquette that was listed on TFN's website
and TFN never required FS to conform to TFN's rules of etiquette. Fourth, TFN
admits that a central premise of its "Freecycle Ethos" is local enforcement with local
variation. By definition, this standard does not maintain consistency across member
groups, so it is not an actual control.

        Even assuming that TFN's asserted quality control standards actually relate
to the quality of its member groups' services, they were not adequate quality
controls because they were not enforced and were not effective in maintaining the
consistency of the trademarks. Indeed, TFN's alleged quality controls fall short of
the supervision and control deemed inadequate in other cases in which summary
judgment on naked licensing has been granted to the licensee. See, e.g., Barcamerica,
289 F.3d at 596-97 (finding no express contractual right to inspect and supervise the

          6 Notably, Beal did not propose, and the modsquad did not adopt, this standard until January 2004,

more than three months after Abraham founded FS in October 2003. The only standard listed in TFN's

etiquette section on its website in 2003 was "Keep it Free," but there was no requirement that member

groups adopt this standard. Similarly, TFN's incorporation of the Yahoo! Groups' service terms was not done

until after FS was given use of the trademarks in October 2003. Because we hold that TFN did not exercise

actual control no matter what time period is considered, we do not address whether actual supervision would

be sufficient if it starts at some point after the granting of a license to use a trademark.

                                                    234
use of the marks coupled with licensor's infrequent wine tastings and unconfirmed
reliance on the winemaker's expertise was inadequate evidence of quality controls to
survive summary judgment); Stanfield, 52 F.3d at 871 (granting summary judgment
to the licensee where the license agreement lacked a right to inspect or supervise
licensee's operations, and alleged actual controls were that the licensor examined
one swine heating pad, looked at other pet pads, and occasionally reviewed
promotional materials and advertising).

        Moreover, even if we were inclined to accept the premise allegedly set forth
in Birthright, that loosely organized non-profits that share common goals are subject
to less stringent quality control requirements for trademark purposes, the result
would be the same. In Birthright, the court held that the license was not naked
because the licensor "monitored and controlled" its licensees' use of the trademarks.
827 F.Supp. at 1139-40; see also Barcamerica, 289 F.3d at 596 (holding that a licensor
may overcome the lack of a formal agreement if it exercises actual control over its
licensees). Here, TFN exercised no actual control over its licensees, so even under a
less stringent standard, TFN has not raised a material issue of fact as to whether it
exercised actual control over FS's use of the trademarks.

                                                 3
        TFN contends that even if it did not exercise actual control, it justifiably
relied on its member groups' quality control measures. Although "courts have
upheld licensing agreements where the licensor is familiar with and relies upon the
licensee's own efforts to control quality," Barcamerica, 289 F.3d at 596 (internal
quotation marks and brackets omitted), we, like the other circuits that have
considered this issue, have required that the licensor and licensee be involved in a
"close working relationship" to establish adequate quality control in the absence of
a formal agreement, id. at 597. In Barcamerica, we cited four examples of "close
working relationships" that would allow the licensor to rely on the licensee's own
quality control: (1) a close working relationship for eight years; (2) a licensor who
manufactured ninety percent of the components sold by a licensee and with whom
it had a ten year association and knew of the licensee's expertise; (3) siblings who
were former business partners and enjoyed a seventeen-year business relationship;
and (4) a licensor with a close working relationship with the licensee's employees,
and the pertinent agreement provided that the license would terminate if certain
employees ceased to be affiliated with the licensee.
        Here, TFN and FS did not enjoy the type of close working relationship that
would permit TFN to rely on FS's quality control measures. TFN had no long term
relationship with Abraham or the FS group. In fact, the October 9, 2003 email
between Beal and Abraham, which mentions using the TFN logo, was the parties'
first and only written communication about the trademarks prior to TFN's requests
to stop using them in November 2006. In addition, TFN had no experience with FS

                                                    235
that might have supported its alleged confidence in FS's quality control measures.
Thus, even considered in a light most favorable to TFN, no evidence showed the
type of close working relationship necessary to overcome TFN's lack of quality
controls over FS.

        Furthermore, we have held that, while reliance on a licensee's own quality
control efforts is a relevant factor, such reliance is not alone sufficient to show that a
naked license has not been granted.7 See Transgo, Inc. v. Ajac Transmission Parts Corp.,
768 F.2d 1001, 1017-18 (9th Cir.1985) (noting that, although the licensor had
worked closely with the licensee for ten years, the licensor did not rely solely on his
confidence in the licensee, but exercised additional control by, inter alia, periodically
inspecting those goods and was consulted regarding any changes in the product).
Because sole reliance on a licensee's own control quality efforts is not enough to
overcome a finding of naked licensing without other indicia of control, and because
TFN lacked a close working relationship with FS and failed to show any other
indicia of actual control, we conclude that TFN could not rely solely on FS's own
quality control efforts.

                                                 B
        TFN's three remaining arguments also fail to raise a material issue of fact
that precludes a grant summary of judgment for FS. First, TFN asserts that it should
be subject to a lesser level of quality control standard because its services are not
dangerous to the public and the public expects local variation in services so the
probability of deception is low. We have stated that the "standard of quality control
and the degree of necessary inspection and policing by the licensor will vary."
Barcamerica, 289 F.3d at 598. The licensor need only exercise "control sufficient to
meet the reasonable expectations of customers." McCarthy, § 18:55. However,
because TFN did not establish any quality control requirements for its member
groups, we do not need to decide what efforts to oversee a licensee's performance
might meet a low standard of quality control.
        TFN's remaining two arguments--(1) that FS must show both naked licensing
and a loss of trademark significance, and (2) that FS is estopped from supporting its
naked licensing defense with evidence that demonstrates that TFN did not

          7 Other circuits have also relied on the licensor's confidence in the licensee only where there were

additional indicia of control. See, e.g., Stanfield, 52 F.3d at 872 (holding summary judgment for the licensee

appropriate where no special relationship between the parties existed and no evidence of actual control over

the licensee existed); Land O'Lakes Creameries, Inc. v. Oconomowoc Canning Co., 330 F.2d 667 (7th Cir.1964)

(upholding trademark where licensor's name appeared on trademark product label, and product was sold

under license for forty years without complaints about quality).

                                                    236
adequately control the services offered by FS when using the trademarks--are both
raised for the first time on appeal, so we decline to reach them.

                                                IV
    We determine, viewing the record in the light most favorable to TFN, that TFN
(1) did not retain express contractual control over FS's quality control measures, (2)
did not have actual control over FS's quality control measures, and (3) was
unreasonable in relying on FS's quality control measures. Therefore, we conclude
that TFN engaged in naked licensing and consequently abandoned the
trademarks....

                      Westco Group, Inc. v. K.B. & Associates, Inc.
                           128 F.Supp.2d 1082 (N.D. Ohio 2001)

GWIN, District Judge.
        With this order, the Court rules on the parties' cross-motions for summary

judgment. For the reasons set forth below, the Court grants Plaintiff Westco Group,
Inc.'s motion for summary judgment, and denies Defendant K.B. & Associates'
motion for summary judgment.

                                                     I.
        This case involves a dispute between two mattress retailers. Plaintiff Westco,
Inc. ("Westco"), operates more than fifty retail mattress stores featuring the Mattress
Warehouse trademark and trade name. Defendant K.B. & Associates, Inc. ("K.B. &
Associates"), operates approximately fourteen retail stores using this trademark and
trade name. Westco says K.B. & Associates is using the trademark and trade name
in violation of its licensing agreement with Westco, as well as in violation of federal
and state laws preserving Westco's right to control the use of the trademark and
trade name. K.B. & Associates denies these claims and asserts two counterclaims. In
these counterclaims, K.B. & Associates seeks a declaratory judgment that it has not
infringed the trademark and trade name and that Westco has abandoned the
trademark and trade name. . . .
        . . . Defendant K.B. & Associates solicited authority from Plaintiff Westco to
use the Mattress Warehouse trademark and trade name in Ashland, Kentucky. In
1995, the parties entered an agreement whereby K.B. & Associates could use the
trademark and trade name at is Ashland location. . . . The agreement required K.B.
& Associates to receive permission from Westco to use the trademark and trade
name at any other locations.
        In early 2000, Defendant K.B. & Associates sought permission to use the
Mattress Warehouse trademark at a Pikeville, Kentucky location. After negotiations,
K.B. & Associates and Plaintiff Westco could not reach an agreement as to the fee
K.B. & Associates would pay Westco to use the trademark at the Pikeville location.
        Plaintiff Westco says it later discovered that Defendant K.B. & Associates,

                                                    237
without permission, was using the Mattress Warehouse trademark and trade name
at its Pikeville location. And Westco contends that it thereafter learned that K.B. &
Associates had used and is currently using the trademark and trade name at seven
other unauthorized locations. . . .

                                                III.
        Plaintiff Westco seeks summary judgment on its breach of contract,
trademark infringement, and unfair competition claims. Westco says the
undisputed facts show Defendant K.B. & Associates broke its licensing agreement
regarding the Mattress Warehouse trademark and trade name. With this breach,
Westco contends that K.B. & Associates infringed its trademark and competed
unfairly as a matter of law.
        Defendant K.B. & Associates says it never breached its licensing agreement
with Plaintiff Westco. In any event, K.B. & Associates contends that Westco
abandoned the Mattress Warehouse trademark and trade name. Thus, K.B. &
Associates says it is entitled to summary judgment on all of Westco's claims, as well
as its own counterclaims.
        As explained below, the Court finds that Plaintiff Westco has shown that
Defendant K.B. & Associates failed to abide by the terms of its licensing agreement
with Westco. The Court further finds no merit in K.B. & Associates' abandonment
claim. Hence, the Court grants Westco's motion for summary judgment and denies
K.B. & Associates's motion for summary judgment. . . .
        With regard to the Mattress Warehouse trade name, Defendant K.B. &
Associates contends that the 1995 Agreement did not give Plaintiff Westco the right
to restrict its use of the trade name. Specifically, K.B. & Associates says Westco has
only registered "Mattress Warehouse" as a fictitious name in Kentucky. Such a
registration, according to K.B. & Associates, is insufficient to give Westco a
substantive right to the Mattress Warehouse trade name.
         However, the doctrine of licensee estoppel prevents K.B. & Associates from
challenging Westco's right to license the trade name.
        The doctrine of licensee estoppel provides that a "licensee is estopped from
claiming any rights against the licensor which are inconsistent with the terms of the
license." 3 Rudolf Callmann, Unfair Competition, Trademark & Monopolies §
19.48 (Louis Altman 4th ed.1998 and 2000 cum. supp.). For example, a trademark
licensee cannot challenge a licensor's ownership of a trademark.
        Here, Defendant K.B. & Associates conceded Westco's rights in the trade
name when it entered the 1995 Agreement. As a licensee, K.B. & Associates cannot
now claim that Westco lacked the right to license the trade name in the 1995
Agreement. . . .
        . . . . Defendant K.B. & Associates has used the Mattress Warehouse
trademark and trade name in a manner inconsistent with the 1995 Agreement.

                                                    238
Unless Plaintiff Westco has abandoned the trademark and trade name, K.B. &
Associates broke its contract and violated the trademark laws. . . .

        The Court now turns to Defendant K.B. & Associates' abandonment
defense. K.B. & Associates says Plaintiff Westco has abandoned both the Mattress
Warehouse trademark and trade name through "naked licensing." As a result of this
abandonment, K.B. & Associates says it is not liable for breaching the 1995
Agreement or for any other claim made by Westco.

        A trademark and trade name operate as indicators of origin, assuring
consumers that the goods and services sold thereunder are of a uniform nature and
quality. Edward K. Esping, Annotation, Granting of "naked" or unsupervised license to
third party as abandonment of trademark, 118 A.L.R. Fed. 211 (1994) ("The
commercial purpose of a trademark or trade name is to identify, and provide
consumers assurances regarding the nature and quality of, the marked goods or
services."). In order for a trademark or trade name to provide such an assurance to
consumers, the owner of the trademark or trade name must control the nature and
quality of the marked goods and services. Absent such control, the message of the
trademark or trade name "is false because without control of quality, the goods and
services are not truly genuine." J. McCarthy, McCarthy on Trademarks and Unfair
Competition § 18:42 (4th ed.1997) (internal quotations omitted).

        Thus, when an owner licenses a trademark or trade name to third parties,
the owner "has the duty to control quality." J. McCarthy, supra, at § 18:42;
Gorenstein Enterprises, Inc. v. Quality-Care-USA, Inc., 874 F.2d 431, 435 (7th Cir.1989)
("The owner of a trademark has a duty to ensure the consistency of the trademarked
good or service."). If the owner does not fulfill this duty, the owner has issued a
"naked" or "bare" license.

        Because naked licensing defeats the purpose of a trademark or trade name, a
licensor who engages in naked licensing abandons the trademark or trade name.
Gorenstein Enterprises, Inc., 874 F.2d at 435; J. McCarthy, supra, at § 18:42 ("Thus,
not only does the trademark owner have the right to control quality, when it
licenses, it has the duty to control quality.").

        The Lanham Act specifically provides for the abandonment of a trademark
when a licensor engages in naked licensing. 15 U.S.C. § 1127(2) (defining
abandonment as "any course of conduct of the owner ... [that] causes the mark to ...
lose its significance as a mark."). . . .

        Here, Defendant K.B. & Associates says the 1995 Agreement is a naked
license. According to K.B. & Associates, Plaintiff Westco has failed to take any
meaningful steps to ensure K.B. & Associates is selling quality products or
providing quality services in its stores operated under the Mattress Warehouse
trademark and trade name. Specifically, K.B. & Associates offers evidence showing
Westco never visited or inspected any of K.B. & Associates' retail stores. Further,

                                                    239
Westco allegedly failed to play any role in deciding how K.B. & Associates should
handle customer complaints or from whom K.B. & Associates should purchase its
inventory.

        Even assuming this evidence is sufficient to show the 1995 Agreement is a
naked license, Defendant K.B. & Associates is estopped from asserting that its
license agreement is a naked license. As previously explained, the doctrine of
licensee estoppel stops a licensee from contesting "the validity of the licensor's title
during the course of the licensing arrangement." Professional Golfers Ass'n of America
v. Bankers Life & Casualty Co., 514 F.2d 665, 670 (5th Cir.1975).

        However, Defendant K.B. & Associates insists the doctrine of licensee
estoppel does not prevent a licensee from raising a naked licensing defense. In
support of this proposition, K.B. & Associates relies on the United States Court of
Appeals for the Sixth Circuit's opinion in E.F. Prichard Co. v. Consumers Brewing Co.,
136 F.2d 512 (6th Cir.1943). In Prichard, the Sixth Circuit allowed a licensee to
raise a naked licensing defense against a licensor, while still applying the doctrine of
licensee estoppel to bar the licensee's other challenges to the licensor's ownership of
the trademark in question.

        As Defendant K.B. & Associates acknowledges, in Prichard the Sixth Circuit
did not discuss whether the doctrine of licensee estoppel stops a naked licensing
claim. The court offered no analysis as to the relationship between licensee estoppel
and a naked licensing defense. Nevertheless, K.B. & Associates asks the Court to
rely on Prichard's "implicit" meaning and allow its naked licensing claim despite the
doctrine of licensee estoppel.

        The Court will not do so. The majority of courts to consider the issue in the
wake of Prichard have found that the doctrine of licensee estoppel bars a licensee
from asserting a naked licensing defense. The leading commentators have likewise
found the doctrine of licensee estoppel applicable to naked licensing claims:

        The licensee is estopped from claiming any rights against the licensor which
        are inconsistent with the terms of the license. This is true even after the
        license expires. He is estopped from contesting the validity of the mark, ... or
        challenging the license agreement as void or against public policy, e.g., because it
        granted a naked license. But he may challenge the licensor's title to the mark
        based on events which occurred after the license expired.

Rudolf Callmann, supra, at § 19.48 (footnotes and citations omitted, emphasis
added); 2 Jerome Gilson, Trademark Protection and Practice § 6.03[7] (2000).

        Moreover, the rationale undergirding the application of licensee estoppel to
naked licensing claims is compelling. By entering a licensing agreement, the licensee
covenants not to challenge the licensor's right to issue the license. This covenant

                                                    240
includes challenges based on naked licensing . . . .
        And further, a licensee claiming that its own license is a naked license

essentially seeks to benefit from its own misfeasance. By asserting a naked licensing
defense, the licensee contends that the licensed trademark or trade name has lost its
significance as a source of origin because the licensor has failed to police the
licensee's operations. Thus, by relying on its own ability to offer inferior or
nonuniform goods and services under the trademark or trade name, the licensee
seeks to free itself of the constraints imposed by the licensor's ownership of the
trademark or trade name. Not surprisingly, the Restatement (Third) of Unfair
Competition observes that the case for applying licensee estoppel is strongest in
such a case. Restatement (Third) of Unfair Competition § 33 (1995) ("The case for
estoppel is strongest when the licensee's challenge rests on its own conduct under
the license, such as ... a claim of abandonment based on inadequate supervision of the
licensee by the licensor.") (emphasis added).

        In the absence of any controlling authority from either the United States
Supreme Court or the Sixth Circuit, the Court follows the persuasive authority
cited above. Accordingly, Defendant K.B. & Associates cannot raise a naked
licensing defense based on Plaintiff Westco's failure to adequately control the
quality of K.B. & Associates' operations.

        Defendant K.B. & Associates next argues that, even if barred from raising a
naked licensing defense based on its own license, it can assert a naked licensing
claim arising from Plaintiff Westco's failure to assert quality control over its other
licensees. At least one court has accepted this proposition. STX, Inc. v. Bauer USA,
Inc., 43 U.S.P.Q.2d 1492, 1501, 1997 WL 337578 (N.D.Cal.1997). And the
Restatement (Third) of Unfair Competition also provides some support for allowing
such a naked licensing defense. Restatement (Third) of Unfair Competition § 30,
comment d (1995).

        The doctrine of licensee estoppel is equitable in nature. Accordingly, the
doctrine is not subject to rigid application. Instead, a court considering the
doctrine's application " `remains free to consider the particular circumstances of the
case, including the nature of the licensee's claim....' " J. McCarthy, supra, at § 18:63
(quoting Restatement (Third) of Unfair Competition § 30, comment d (1995)).

        The Court finds that licensee estoppel does not stop Defendant K.B. &
Associates' claim that Plaintiff Westco abandoned the trademark and trade name
through naked licensing to a third party. The case for applying the licensee estoppel
doctrine is "weak when the licensee asserts a lack of control by the licensor over
other users." Restatement (Third) of Unfair Competition § 30, comment d (1995).

        When a licensor fails to control the quality of goods or services sold by other
licensees, a licensee loses the value of its license. In such a situation, the licensor has
abandoned the trademark or trade name, rendering it useless as an indicator of

                                                    241
origin. Yet the licensee remains subject to the terms of the license, and perhaps even
continues to compensate the licensor for its rights to the trademark or trade name.
This result is avoided by allowing a licensee to raise a naked licensing claim based
on the licensor's relations with third-party licensees.

        Accordingly, the Court will permit Defendant K.B. & Associates to raise its
naked licensing claim based on Westco's alleged failure to control the quality of a
third-party licensee's operation.

        But Defendant K.B. & Associates faces a "stringent" burden in asserting this
claim. Exxon Corp., 109 F.3d at 1075-76. A party asserting a naked licensing claim
must show the trademark or trade name "has lost its significance as an indicator of
origin." Id. at 1079-80.

        Defendant K.B. & Associates bases its naked licensing claim on the license
agreement between Plaintiff Westco and Richard Good, who operates a retail
mattress store in Indiana. K.B. & Associates offers evidence that Westco had almost
no contact with Good after issuing him a license to use the Mattress Warehouse
trademark and trade name in 1998.

        But Plaintiff Westco offers evidence that it competently monitors the quality
of Good's retail operation. Westco says that Good's license specifically requires him
to sell "name brand mattresses and bedding products, accessories and related
items." Westco offers evidence that it polices Good's compliance with this provision
through contact with "industry sources" and "name brand mattress and bedding
sales representatives." And Westco argues that it need not engage in any additional
monitoring because Good, by his own admission, has only sold quality products.

        Defendant K.B. & Associates does not dispute this evidence. Rather, K.B. &
Associates merely argues that Plaintiff Westco's monitoring approach is insufficient
to avoid a finding of abandonment. The Court disagrees.

        Courts determine whether a licensor has abandoned a trademark or trade
name on a case-by-case basis. The degree of control a licensor must exercise to avoid
a finding of abandonment necessarily depends on the factual circumstances at hand,
including the nature of the trademark or trade name in question.

        Here, the Mattress Warehouse trademark and trade name do not relate to a
particular brand of mattress products. Rather, the evidence before the Court shows
that the trademark and trade name serve the limited purpose of assuring customers
the mattress products sold thereunder are "name brand."

        Plaintiff Westco need not engage in extensive control over its licensees to
preserve such a limited trademark and trade name. In particular, by monitoring
Good's operation through industry sources and name brand mattress product sales
representatives, Westco exercised sufficient control over the nature and quality of
the mattress products sold under the trademark and trade name.

        Moreover, even if the Court found that Plaintiff Westco issued Good a

                                                    242
naked license, such a finding would not necessarily establish that Westco
abandoned the Mattress Warehouse trademark and trade name in the areas where
Defendant K.B. & Associates operates its retail stores. Good operates only one retail
store in Indiana. K.B. & Associates, in contrast, operates approximately fourteen
retail stores in Ohio, Kentucky, and West Virginia. The record does not include any
evidence showing that a naked license in Indiana would diminish the trademark
and trade name as a source of origin in this localized market area.

        For these reasons, the Court finds no merit in Defendant K.B. & Associates'
abandonment defense. The Court therefore grants Plaintiff Westco summary
judgment on K.B. & Associates' counterclaim for a judgment that Westco
abandoned the Mattress Warehouse trademark and trade name. . . .

                                              Notes

        Quality control. Because a trademark embodies the markholder's goodwill,
trademark doctrine requires those who license their marks to control the quality of
the use. Otherwise, it is reasoned, the mark would cease to identify a single source
of goods and services. Draeger Oil Co., Inc. v. Uno-Ven Co., 314 F.3d 299, 301
(7th Cir. 2002) ("The economic function of a trademark is to provide the
consuming public with a concise and unequivocal signal of the trademarked
product's source and character, and that function is thwarted if the quality and
uniformity of the trademarked product are allowed to vary significantly without
notice to the consumer." (citation omitted)).

        Naked licensing and the loss of trademark rights. If a licensor does not exercise
quality control, but rather grants a "naked" license, the consequence is a loss of
trademark rights (as the mark will no longer denote a single source of either a
product or guarantor of quality). The loss of protection has been referred to as a
form of abandonment, though one might quibble with the terminology if one views
abandonment as a cessation of use.

        Merger. Westco shows that one danger of obtaining a license to use a mark is
potential estoppel from challenging its validity. A related risk is the problem of
merger. Suppose a company #1 uses a mark but then takes a license to use that
mark from company #2 (perhaps due to apprehension that the second company
might have priority, or out of a desire to operate in the second party's territory). At
the termination of the license, whatever preexisting rights company #1 had are lost.
They merged into the licensed rights of company #2. Bunn-O-Matic Corp. v. Bunn
Coffee Service, Inc., 88 F. Supp. 2d 914, 923 (C.D. Ill. 2000) ("A licensee's prior
claims of any independent rights to a trademark are lost, or merged into the license,

                                                    243
when he accepts his position as licensee, thereby acknowledging the licensor owns
the marks and that his rights are derived from the licensor and enure to the benefit
of the licensor."); see also 15 U.S.C. §1055 ("Where a registered mark or a mark
sought to be registered is or may be used legitimately by related companies, such use
shall inure to the benefit of the registrant or applicant for registration . . . .").

        Degree of quality control. There is no uniform standard of quality control
required to protect trademark rights. The contextual nature of the inquiry leads to a
range of results in the case law, with some cases accepting an unexercised
contractual right of quality control as sufficing. Other cases accept reliance on the
licensee's own quality control measures if the circumstances suggest their adequacy.
Some do so only if there is some sort of "special relationship" between the parties
(e.g., a familial relationship) to justify such reliance. And there are stricter
precedents that demand actual quality control.

        Signing your name away. Suppose you license a mark that doubles as your
name. What personal uses does that limit going forward? What about social media?
See JLM Couture, Inc. v. Gutman, 24 F.4th 785 (2d Cir. 2022) (affirming
preliminary injunction barring licensor from using her name in trade or commerce
but rejecting requirement that she turn over control of her social media accounts);
id. at 802 (Newman, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (arguing that
injunction should be limited to stop licensor from using her name to market bridal
wear, but objecting that injunction overreached in prohibiting general use of her
name in commerce and maintaining that "her former employer has no right to such
a sweeping prohibition on Gutman's use of her name").

        Do we need the naked licensing bar? The Second Circuit has explained that:

        The public is hardly in a position to uncover deceptive uses of a trademark
        before they occur and will be at best slow to detect them after they happen.
        Thus, unless the licensor exercises supervision and control over the
        operations of its licensees the risk that the public will be unwittingly deceived
        will be increased and this is precisely what the [Lanham] Act is in part
        designed to prevent.

Dawn Donut Co. v. Hart's Food Stores, Inc., 267 F.2d 358, 367 (2d Cir. 1959). Do
you find this argument compelling? Again, we do not require trademark holders to
maintain the quality of their goods. If they are free to weaken their marks by
diluting product quality, why not use naked licensing to do the same?

12. Registration

                            Lanham Act § 2 (15 U.S.C. § 1052):

        No trademark by which the goods of the applicant may be distinguished
        from the goods of others shall be refused registration on the principal
        register on account of its nature unless it--

        (a) Consists of or comprises immoral, deceptive, or scandalous matter; or
        matter which may disparage or falsely suggest a connection with persons,
        living or dead, institutions, beliefs, or national symbols, or bring them into
        contempt, or disrepute; or a geographical indication which, when used on or
        in connection with wines or spirits, identifies a place other than the origin of
        the goods and is first used on or in connection with wines or spirits by the
        applicant on or after one year after the date on which the WTO Agreement
        (as defined in section 3501 (9) of title 19) enters into force with respect to
        the United States.

        (b) Consists of or comprises the flag or coat of arms or other insignia of the
        United States, or of any State or municipality, or of any foreign nation, or
        any simulation thereof.

        (c) Consists of or comprises a name, portrait, or signature identifying a
        particular living individual except by his written consent, or the name,
        signature, or portrait of a deceased President of the United States during the
        life of his widow, if any, except by the written consent of the widow.

        (d) Consists of or comprises a mark which so resembles a mark registered in
        the Patent and Trademark Office, or a mark or trade name previously used
        in the United States by another and not abandoned, as to be likely, when
        used on or in connection with the goods of the applicant, to cause
        confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive . . . .

        (e) Consists of a mark which

        (1) when used on or in connection with the goods of the applicant is merely
        descriptive or deceptively misdescriptive of them,

        (2) when used on or in connection with the goods of the applicant is
        primarily geographically descriptive of them, except as indications of regional
        origin may be registrable under section 1054 of this title,

                                                    245
     (3) when used on or in connection with the goods of the applicant is
     primarily geographically deceptively misdescriptive of them,

     (4) is primarily merely a surname, or

     (5) comprises any matter that, as a whole, is functional.

     (f) Except as expressly excluded in subsections (a), (b), (c), (d), (e)(3), and
     (e)(5) of this section, nothing in this chapter shall prevent the registration of
     a mark used by the applicant which has become distinctive of the applicant's
     goods in commerce. The Director may accept as prima facie evidence that
     the mark has become distinctive, as used on or in connection with the
     applicant's goods in commerce, proof of substantially exclusive and
     continuous use thereof as a mark by the applicant in commerce for the five
     years before the date on which the claim of distinctiveness is made. . . .

     A mark which would be likely to cause dilution by blurring or dilution by
     tarnishment under section 1125 (c) of this title, may be refused registration
     only pursuant to a proceeding brought under section 1063 of this title. A
     registration for a mark which would be likely to cause dilution by blurring or
     dilution by tarnishment under section 1125 (c) of this title, may be canceled
     pursuant to a proceeding brought under either section 1064 of this title or
     section 1092 of this title.

Trademark Registration Basics

     Why register? Registration is not a prerequisite to protection for a mark. So

why  bother?  Quoth                         the  Trademark  Office

(http://www.uspto.gov/faq/trademarks.jsp):

     Owning a federal trademark registration on the Principal Register provides
     several advantages, including:

             Public notice of your claim of ownership of the mark;

             A legal presumption of your ownership of the mark and your
             exclusive right to use the mark nationwide on or in connection with
             the goods/services listed in the registration;

             The ability to bring an action concerning the mark in federal court;

             The use of the U.S. registration as a basis to obtain registration in
             foreign countries;

                               246
                The ability to record the U.S. registration with the U.S. Customs and
                Border Protection (CBP) Service to prevent importation of infringing
                foreign goods;

                The right to use the federal registration symbol ® and

                Listing in the United States Patent and Trademark Office's online
                databases.

        Nationwide priority looms especially large, as discussed in the chapter on
geographic rights.

        Researching registrations. You can look for mark registrations online at
https://tmsearch.uspto.gov/ .

        The Sweetness of the ®. While anyone can slap a TM or SM designation on
anything, only registrants may use the ®. One benefit of doing so is to eliminate the
need of proving that a defendant had notice of a registration in an action that seeks
to recover damages or a defendant's profits. 15 U.S.C. § 1111.

        Filing details. The details of filing can get technical, so we won't go too far
into the weeds. Some requirements include a/an:

        List of goods and services for which mark will be used;

        Drawing of mark where applicable;

        The legal basis on which you are filing (e.g. actual use in commerce, a bona
        fide intent to use the mark, a claim of priority based on earlier foreign
        application, registration in applicant's country of origin, or a filing under the
        Madrid Protocol); and

        Example of use

        Trademark classes. Registration applications must designate a class or classes
for the goods or services. The USPTO explains
(https://www.uspto.gov/trademarks/basics/goods-and-services):

        Your application must include a list of the goods and services you use or
        have a bona fide intent to use with your trademark. . . .

        During the examination process, we will compare your descriptions to other
        trademark applications and registrations to determine whether there is a
        conflicting trademark. . . .

                                                    247
        Trademark classes are a way for us to organize the goods or services used in
        applications, assess fees, and aid in searching our database of registered and
        pending trademarks. All goods and services are "classified" or organized into
        broad categories of goods or services, as determined by international
        agreement. Each category of goods or services is assigned a number from 1 to
        45, also known as an international class. There are many items listed in each
        class; however, goods and services are never in the same class.

        . . . . Your application filing fee is based on the total number of international
        classes in your application. . . .

        For example, you might have a clothing line of golf shirts, dress shirts, and t-
        shirts. These shirts all fall under the same international class, so your TEAS
        Plus filing fee would be $250 for the one class. However, if you also provide
        custom t-shirt printing services, you would have goods and services in two
        different international classes. In that case, your TEAS Plus filing fee would
        be $500 ($250 plus $250).

        Good or Service? Registration is an area where the distinction between a
trademark and service mark matters insofar as one must be specific about what one
seeks to protect. For example, may the maker of computer software that assists with
job placement claim a service mark as well as a trademark? The Federal Circuit ruled
that it depends on consumer perception. "The question is whether a user would
associate the mark with `personnel placement and recruitment' services performed
by JobDiva, even if JobDiva's software performs each of the steps of the service." In
re Jobdiva, Inc., 843 F.3d 936, 941 (Fed. Cir. 2016).

        Oppositions and cancellations and Article III standing. 15 U.S.C. § 1063 provides
that "[a]ny person who believes that he would be damaged by the registration of a
mark upon the principal register . . . may, upon payment of the prescribed fee, file
an opposition in the Patent and Trademark Office." One may also challenge a mark
after it has been registered by bringing a petition for cancellation. 15 U.S.C. § 1064.

        As you may recall from earlier courses, the law of standing requires plaintiffs
in federal cases to demonstrate an "injury in fact" before their claim can be heard.
Determining which harms clear this hurdle is the subject of many precedents. In
general, however, courts demand a stake greater than subjective concern. That is, an
environmentalist cannot sue to enjoin the clear cutting of a forest located several
states away. They must show a more direct personal harm (e.g., that the plaintiff
hikes in the very patch of trees that will be cut).

        Should the same requirement apply to trademark oppositions and
cancellations? Article III, the purported source of the constitutional standing

                                                    248
requirement, does not strictly require an injury in fact in trademark oppositions, as
the proceeding is an administrative one (in other words, the adjudicator is an
Article I agency, not an Article III court). In general, however, one filing a petition
to cancel is expected to be more than a "mere intermeddler" and have "a real
interest and reasonable belief of damage" from the registration. Australian
Therapeutic Supplies Pty. Ltd. v. Naked TM, LLC, 965 F.3d 1370, 1376 (Fed. Cir.
2020).

        The result of an opposition may be appealed to the Federal Circuit (or made
the subject of a new federal action, see 15 U.S.C. § 1071), which is an Article III
court. So though standing requirements may be looser for opposing a registration
before the USPTO, Article III standing rules apply in full force if an opposer wishes
to challenge an adverse outcome in a federal court. Brooklyn Brewery Corp. v.
Brooklyn Brew Shop, 17 F.4th 129, 137 (Fed. Cir. 2021) ("[Federal statute] does not
set forth the exclusive test for standing when a decision of an administrative agency
is appealed in federal court. The appellant must also satisfy the requirements of
Article III."); id. at 138-39 ("[A]n opposer must demonstrate a concrete and
particularized risk of interference with the rights that flow to it from registration of
its own mark, or some other Article III injury.").

        The Article III bar aside, any opposer must also fall within the "zone of
interests" of the Lanham Act as established by Lexmark International, Inc. v. Static
Control Components, Inc., 572 U.S. 118 (2014). This was too high a bar for an
opposition filed by a consumer who alleged a registration would lead to
monopolization and higher prices. Curtin v. United Trademark Holdings, Inc., 137
F.4th 1359, 1370 (Fed. Cir. 2025) ("The Board's holding that only commercial
actors affected by the mark's registration fall within the zone of interests to oppose
the registration as generic, descriptive, or functional under § 1063 is not
inconsistent with the Lanham Act's purpose of protecting consumers.").

        The standard for allowing participation by those seeking to oppose and to
cancel registrations is the same. Id. at 1365; 3 MCCARTHY § 20:7.

        Narrowing grounds. If one moves to cancel five or more years after a
registration the grounds for cancellation become more limited, but, per 15 U.S.C. §
1064, one may seek to cancel at any time if:

        the registered mark becomes the generic name for the goods or services, or a
        portion thereof, for which it is registered, or is functional, or has been
        abandoned, or its registration was obtained fraudulently or contrary to the
        provisions of section 4 [15 U.S.C. § 1054] or of subsection (a), (b), or (c) of
        section 2 [15 U.S.C. § 1052] for a registration under this Act, or contrary to
        similar prohibitory provisions of such prior Acts for a registration under such

                                                    249
        Acts, or if the registered mark is being used by, or with the permission of, the
        registrant so as to misrepresent the source of the goods or services on or in
        connection with which the mark is used.

        Maintenance. Registrations are subject to renewal at ten-year intervals. 15
U.S.C. § 1059. Note the contrast with copyright, another long-lived IP right. Patent
rights, which expire quicker, require maintenance payments during their term (as
explained here: https://www.uspto.gov/patents/maintain). (N.B., copyright law
used to require renewal, but no longer does so). Failure to renew a trademark
registration does not cut off state or common law rights.

        Registration bars. The various bars to registration set forth in section 2 of the
Lanham Act are discussed in greater detail below. Some registration exclusions
(being descriptive, deceptively misdescriptive, primarily geographically descriptive, or
primarily merely a surname) may be overcome by showing secondary meaning. The
others are absolute bars to registration.

        In addition, the PTO will sometimes refuse registration if a mark fails to
function as a mark. This reason for refusal is discussed in the notes following the
Brunetti case.

Deceptive, Deceptively Misdescriptive, and Descriptive marks (§§
2(a) and 2(e)(1)).

        As you know, descriptive marks are only protected upon a showing of
secondary meaning. The same is true in the registration context (§ 2(e)(1) + § 2(f)).
Deceptively misdescriptive marks also may be registered if secondary meaning is
established. Deceptive marks, by contrast, may never be registered (§ 2(a)). What's
the difference?

                                  In re Budge Mfg. Co., Inc.
                                857 F.2d 773 (Fed. Cir. 1988)

NIES, Circuit Judge.
        Budge Manufacturing Co., Inc., appeals from the final decision of the

United States Trademark Trial and Appeal Board refusing registration of LOVEE
LAMB for "automotive seat covers," application Serial No. 507,974 filed November
9, 1984. The basis for rejection is that the term LAMB is deceptive matter within
the meaning of section 2(a) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1052(a) (1982), as
applied to Budge's goods which are made wholly from synthetic fibers. We affirm.

                                             Opinion

                                                    250
        Section 2(a) of the Lanham Act bars registration of a mark which: "Consists
of or comprises ... deceptive ... matter...." As stated in In re Automatic Radio Mfg. Co.,
404 F.2d 1391, 1396, 160 USPQ 233, 236 (CCPA 1969): "The proscription [of
section 2(a) ] is not against misdescriptive terms unless they are also deceptive."
Thus, that a mark or part of a mark may be inapt or misdescriptive as applied to an
applicant's goods does not make it "deceptive." Id. (AUTOMATIC RADIO not a
deceptive mark for air conditioners, ignition systems, and antennas). Recognizing
that premise, the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board has sought to articulate a
standard by which "deceptive matter" under section 2(a) can be judged. In this case,
the board applied the three-part test which was stated in In re Shapely, Inc., 231
USPQ 72, 73 (TTAB 1986): (1) whether the term is misdescriptive as applied to the
goods, (2) if so, whether anyone would be likely to believe the misrepresentation,
and (3) whether the misrepresentation would materially affect a potential
purchaser's decision to buy the goods. . . .

        . . . . Where the issue relates to deceptive misdescriptiveness within the
meaning of 2(a), we are in general agreement with the standard set out by the board
in Shapely, with the following amplification in part drawn from Simmons:

        (1) Is the term misdescriptive of the character, quality, function, composition
        or use of the goods?

        (2) If so, are prospective purchasers likely to believe that the misdescription
        actually describes the goods?

        (3) If so, is the misdescription likely to affect the decision to purchase?

        In ex parte prosecution, the burden is initially on the Patent and Trademark
Office (PTO) to put forth sufficient evidence that the mark for which registration is
sought meets the above criteria of unregistrability. Mindful that the PTO has
limited facilities for acquiring evidence--it cannot, for example, be expected to
conduct a survey of the marketplace or obtain consumer affidavits2--we conclude
that the evidence of record here is sufficient to establish a prima facie case of
deceptiveness. That evidence shows with respect to the three-pronged test:

        (1) Budge admits that its seat covers are not made from lamb or sheep
products. Thus, the term LAMB is misdescriptive of its goods.

        (2) Seat covers for various vehicles can be and are made from natural
lambskin and sheepskin. Applicant itself makes automobile seat covers of natural
sheepskin. Lambskin is defined, inter alia, as fine-grade sheep skin. See Webster's

          2 See, e.g., In re Loew's Theatres, Inc., 769 F.2d 764, 768, 226 USPQ 865, 868 (Fed.Cir.1985) ("The

practicalities of the limited resources available to the PTO are routinely taken into account in reviewing its

administrative action.").

                                                    251
Third New International Dictionary 639 (unabr. 1976). The board's factual inference is
reasonable that purchasers are likely to believe automobile seat covers denominated
by the term LAMB or SHEEP are actually made from natural sheep or lamb skins.

        (3) Evidence of record shows that natural sheepskin and lambskin is more
expensive than simulated skins and that natural and synthetic skins have different
characteristics. Thus, the misrepresentation is likely to affect the decision to
purchase.

        Faced with this prima facie case against registration, Budge had the burden to
come forward with countering evidence to overcome the rejection. It wholly failed
to do so.

        Budge argues that its use of LAMB as part of its mark is not misdescriptive
when considered in connection with the text in its advertising, which states that the
cover is of "simulated sheepskin."3 Some, but not all, of Budge's specimen labels
also have this text. This evidence is unpersuasive. In R. Neumann & Co. v. Overseas
Shipments, Inc., 326 F.2d 786, 51 CCPA 946, 140 USPQ 276 (1964), a similar
argument was made that the mark DURA-HYDE on shoes was not deceptive as an
indication of leather because of tags affixed to the shoes proclaiming the legend
"Outwears leather." In discounting the evidence, the court stated: "The legends
constitute advertisement material separate and apart from any trademark
significance." To the same effect is In re Bonide Chemical Co., 46 F.2d 705, 18 CCPA
909, 8 USPQ 297 (1931). There the court held, with respect to a clarifying
statement made in advertising circulars, which the applicant urged negated the
deceptive nature of the mark, "This argument is beside the issue. It is the word of
the mark, not the statement of an advertising circular which appellant seeks to
register...."

        Thus, we conclude that the board properly discounted Budge's advertising
and labeling which indicate the actual fabric content. Misdescriptiveness of a term
may be negated by its meaning in the context of the whole mark inasmuch as the
combination is seen together and makes a unitary impression. A.F. Gallun & Sons
Corp. v. Aristocrat Leather Prods., Inc., 135 USPQ 459, 460 (TTAB 1962) (COPY
CALF not misdescriptive, but rather suggests imitation of calf skin). The same is not
true with respect to explanatory statements in advertising or on labels which
purchasers may or may not note and which may or may not always be provided. The
statutory provision bars registration of a mark comprising deceptive matter.
Congress has said that the advantages of registration may not be extended to a mark

          3 During board proceedings, Budge offered an amendment to change the goods in its application to

read "simulated sheepskin automotive seat covers." Either way the goods are specified, our opinion remains

the same.

                                                    252
which deceives the public. Thus, the mark standing alone must pass muster, for that
is what the applicant seeks to register, not extraneous explanatory statements.

        Budge next argues that no reasonable purchaser would expect to purchase
lambskin automobile seat covers because none made of lambskin are on the market.
Only sheepskin automobile seat covers are being made, per Budge. Not only was no
evidence submitted on the point Budge seeks to make, only statements of Budge's
attorney, but also the argument is without substance. The board properly equated
sheepskin and lambskin based on the dictionary definition which indicates that the
terms may be used interchangeably. In addition, while Budge would discount the
evidence presented that bicycle and airline seat coverings are made of lambskin, we
conclude that it does support the board's finding that there is nothing incongruous
about automobile seat covers being made from lambskin. We also agree with the
board's conclusion that any differences between sheepskin and lambskin would not
be readily apparent to potential purchasers of automobile seat covers. The board's
finding here that purchasers are likely to believe the misrepresentation is not clearly
erroneous.

        To overturn the board's finding that misdescribing synthetic fabric as "lamb"
would affect a purchaser's decision to purchase the item, Budge merely reiterates its
argument that its advertising negates the possibility of misdescriptiveness. We find
that argument no more persuasive in this context than previously and, in any event,
wholly unresponsive to this issue.

        Finally, we note the evidence of Budge's extensive sales since 1974 under the
mark. However, it is too well established for argument that a mark which includes
deceptive matter is barred from registration and cannot acquire distinctiveness.

                                            Conclusion
        None of the facts found by the board have been shown to be clearly
erroneous nor has the board erred as a matter of law. Accordingly, we affirm the
board's decision that Budge's mark LOVEE LAMB for automobile seat covers made
from synthetic fibers is deceptive within the meaning of 15 U.S.C. § 1052(a) and is,
thus, barred from registration.
        AFFIRMED.

NICHOLS, Senior Circuit Judge, concurring.
        I agree that the TTAB decision should be affirmed, and with most of what

the court well says. There is one matter, however, as to which I do not wholly agree,
much as I respect the court's expertise in this field.

        We have an unfortunate tendency to believe we must always utter the last
word and lay down the ultimate law on all the subjects confided to us. Here we have
a TTAB decision with which we find nothing wrong, and two previous TTAB
decisions dealing with the same general subject. That is, all three are concerned with
the Lanham Act provision barring from registration, trademarks which are

                                                    253
"deceptive," and in all three the alleged deception was words making it appear that
material actually of synthetic fibers was natural. The task consisted of applying one
word in a statute to the few words or single word of a trademark, in light of the
actual composition as acknowledged by the applicant. Lawyers are ostensibly, and I
hope often actually, trained to construe statutes and other written words according
to the intent of those who utter them and the understanding of those who read
them. The task in the three cases was one for lawyers, and the three opinions afford
internal evidence that the TTAB suffers no shortage of those who know how to do
it well. They do not need us to tell them how to do it. If we do so, we clamp down a
rigid formula for them to conform to, with a prospect of their being harried by
lawyers for alleged nonconformity to the formula forever thereafter, with the simple
ultimate issue forgotten.

        No one can tell what future cases will bring or whether our formula will aid
the solution of future cases, or hinder it. In re Simmons, Inc., one of our three cases,
well illustrates my point. The mark: "White Sable" for paint brush bristles, is
construed in light of the fact that the animal, sable, is extremely dark and that is so
well known that "sable" as an adjective, serves as a synonym for black, as in "sable
plumage." As the white sable is a fictitious animal, the mark "white sable" cannot
deceptively represent that the hairs in the brush came from a real animal. Who
could prescribe beforehand how to deal with such a case? To deal with it after it
arose, by an unhampered board, was no trick at all.

        In the case before us, the board asked itself: "is anyone likely to believe the
product is made of lamb or sheepskin?" The question might, perhaps ideally, be "is
any reasonable person * * * " because unreasonable persons are likely to believe
anything. It is clearly what the board meant. This court transforms that question in
its formula to this:

        If so, are prospective purchasers likely to believe that the misdescription
actually describes the goods?

        Thus "anyone," a single individual, is transmuted into a class of persons. I
readily can picture the fun future counsel will have with this. They can demand that
the board, with its limited investigative facilities as we acknowledge, first define who
are the prospective purchasers, old, young, Ph.D's, illiterates, etc.? Then, what are
their tastes, their intellectual quirks, their degree of gullibility?

        A simple issue, mostly or wholly of law, is transmuted into a wide-ranging
factual inquiry. Is the board to indulge in guesswork and speculation as to this
supposititious class, and its mores? We reprehended this approach in a recent
"likelihood of confusion" case, Amalgamated v. Amalgamated, 842 F.2d 1270, 6
USPQ2d 1305 (Fed.Cir.1988); (cf. B.V.D. Licensing Corp. v. Body Action Design, Inc.,
846 F.2d 727, 6 USPQ2d 1719 (Fed.Cir.1988)). Is it to conduct a sweeping inquest,

                                                    254
the process known outside the Beltway as "making a federal case out of it." Far
better, it seems to me, is not to fix anything when nothing is broke.

Geographic exclusions

                       15 U.S.C. §1052

        No trademark by which the goods of the applicant may be distinguished
        from the goods of others shall be refused registration on the principal
        register on account of its nature unless it-

        (a) Consists of or comprises ... deceptive ... matter;... or a geographical
        indication which, when used on or in connection with wines or spirits,
        identifies a place other than the origin of the goods and is first used on or in
        connection with wines or spirits by the applicant on or after [January 1,
        1996].

        ...

        (e) Consists of a mark which ... (2) when used on or in connection with the
        goods of the applicant is primarily geographically descriptive of them, except
        as indications of regional origin may be registrable under section 1054 of this
        title, (3) when used on or in connection with the goods of the applicant is
        primarily geographically deceptively misdescriptive of them....

        A mark that is geographically descriptive is registrable with secondary
meaning, while a mark that is "geographically deceptively misdescriptive" cannot be
registered. The Federal Circuit has interpreted section 2(e)(3) (primarily
geographically deceptively misdescriptive marks) to have a materiality component.*
Thus TMEP § 1210.01(a) provides:

To establish a prima facie case for refusal to register a mark as primarily
geographically descriptive, the examining attorney must show that:

(1) the primary significance of the mark is a generally known geographic
location (see TMEP §§1210.02-1210.02(b)(iv));

(2) the goods or services originate in the place identified in the mark (see
TMEP §1210.03); and

          * The court's requiring materiality here rests on a misreading of the statute, but don't get me started.
For a brief explanation of the issue, see Michael Grynberg, More Than IP: Trademark Among the Consumer
Information Laws, 55 Wm. & Mary L. Rev. 1429, 1449 (2014).

                                                    255
        (3) purchasers would be likely to believe that the goods or services originate
        in the geographic place identified in the mark (see TMEP §§1210.04-
        1210.04(d)). Note: If the mark is remote or obscure, the public is unlikely to
        make a goods/place or services/place association (see TMEP §1210.04(c)).

The test for whether a mark that is geographically deceptively misdescriptive adds
the element of materiality, asking whether "the misrepresentation is a material
factor in a significant portion of the relevant consumer's decision to buy the goods
or use the services." Id. § 1210.01(b).

        Geographical Indications. The limited exclusions of section 2 provide little hint
of the importance of geographical indications of origin ("GIs"), previously discussed
in the chapter on generic marks. As noted in that reading, the World Trade
Organization Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights
("TRIPs") requires (in Article 22) that signatories provide means to prevent the false
suggestions of geographic origin with further protections (in Article 23) for GIs for
wines and spirits. The latter protections are to be in force independent of confusion
as to origin, though the terms may be used where generic.

        The Lanham Act's accommodations to GIs include the registration
exclusions in section 2 as well as the existence of certification marks. Section 2(a)
specifically refers to GIs for wines and spirits. TMEP §1210.08(a) also provides:

        To establish a prima facie case for refusal to register a mark under the "wines
        and spirits" provision of §2(a), the following is required:

        (1) The primary significance of the relevant term or design is geographic, e.g.,
        a place name, abbreviation, nickname, or symbol; or an outline or map of a
        geographic area (see TMEP §§1210.02(a)-1210.02(b)(iv));

        (2) Purchasers would be likely to think that the goods originate in the
        geographic place identified in the mark, i.e., purchasers would make a
        goods/place association (see TMEP §§1210.04-1210.04(d));

        (3) The goods do not originate in the place identified in the mark (see TMEP
        §1210.03);

        (4) A purchaser's erroneous belief as to the geographic origin of the goods
        would materially affect the purchaser's decision to buy the goods (see TMEP
        §§1210.05(c)-1210.05(c)(ii)); and

        (5) The mark was first used in commerce by the applicant on or after January
        1, 1996.

                                                    256
Other exclusions

        False Connections with persons, institutions, beliefs, or national symbols (Section
2(a)).

        To establish that a proposed mark falsely suggests a connection with a person
        or an institution, it must be shown that:

        1 the mark is the same as, or a close approximation of, the name or identity
        previously used by another person or institution;

        2 the mark would be recognized as such, in that it points uniquely and
        unmistakably to that person or institution;

        3 the person or institution named by the mark is not connected with the
        activities performed by the applicant under the mark; and

        4 the fame or reputation of the person or institution is such that, when the
        mark is used with the applicant's goods or services, a connection with the
        person or institution would be presumed.

TMEP § 1203.03(c)(i).

        Consisting of or simulating a flag or coat of arms. As for a section 2(b) refusal
based on consisting of or simulating "the flag or coat of arms or other insignia of
the United States, or of any State or municipality, or of any foreign nation," the
Manual explains, "[w]hether a mark comprises a simulation must be determined
from a visual comparison of the proposed mark vis-à-vis replicas of the flag, coat of
arms, or other insignia in question. The focus is on the general recollection of the
flag or insignia by purchasers, without a careful analysis and side-by-side
comparison." Id. § 1204 (citations and quotations omitted). Merely being suggestive
of the symbol, however, is not enough. Id. This opens the door to more registerable
use than you might think. The Manual explains that § 2(b) refusals are
inappropriate if the flag is used to form another shape, is obscured in large part by
other design elements, is not in a flag shape, has a different color scheme than the
flag normally does, or has a significant feature altered or excised.

        Surname marks. Section 2(e)(4) blocks the registration of marks that are
primarily "merely" surnames (absent secondary meaning). Recall the reasons that
the common law also imposed a secondary meaning requirement in thinking about
the question of what should qualify.

        A problem in administering section 2(e)(4), and the common law exclusion
of unregistered surname marks without secondary meaning, is of course the overlap

                                                    257
between names and everyday words. "King" is a common surname, but it is also a
word with many other meanings, including a head of state, a chess piece, and, more
connotatively, one who is preeminent in one's field. How then to draw the line?
Pointing to TTAB precedent, the TMEP test is as follows:

        (1) whether the surname is rare (see TMEP §1211.01(a)(v));

        (2) whether the term is the surname of anyone connected with the applicant
        (see TMEP §1211.02(b)(iv));

        (3) whether the term has any recognized meaning other than as a surname
        (see TMEP §§1211.01(a)-1211.01(a)(vii));

        (4) whether it has the "structure and pronunciation" of a surname (see
        TMEP §1211.01(a)(vi)); and

        (5) whether the stylization of lettering is distinctive enough to create a
        separate commercial impression (see TMEP §1211.01(b)(ii)).

TMEP § 1211.01.
        If you were a trademark examiner, would you accept the claimed mark

BYRNE? What if the applicant pointed to the dictionary meaning of "burn"? See,
e.g., In re Pickett Hotel Co., 229 USPQ 760 (TTAB 1986) (concluding that
PICKETT SUITE HOTEL is primarily merely a surname despite claim that would-
be mark is the phonetic equivalent of the word "picket").

        A mark "identifying a particular living individual"(§ 2(c)). In 1989 Debbie Sauer
applied to register BO BALL for "an oblong shaped ball made of white leather with
red stitching at the seams." In essence the ball looked like a cross between a baseball
and a football. Does "BO" identify a particular living person? It might help if you
knew that at the time, Bo Jackson was famous for playing both professional football
and baseball, and he starred in a number of commercials for the apparel maker
Nike that played up his intersport abilities. Is that grounds for a § 2(c) rejection?
After all, the name BO BALL is not the same as BO JACKSON BALL. Would you
reject the registration? The TTAB did. In re Sauer, 27 U.S.P.Q.2d 1073 (TTAB
1993). What about the applicant's argument that "`Bo' is also the given name of
several other widely recognized celebrities, such as Bo Diaz, Bo Belinsky, Bo Bo
Osborne and Bo Schembechler, and that therefore "Bo" would not necessarily be
understood to refer to Bo Jackson"? In answering the question, it's only fair to
assume that you've heard of any of those four (I confess to only recognizing one).
How would you have defended the TTAB's judgment on appeal? Do any other
provisions of section 2 support the TTAB's ruling?

                                                    258
        2(d) rejections. Section 2(d) provides for rejection of marks that are likely to
cause confusion with previously used marks, and the end of section 2 provides for
oppositions based on likely dilution of famous marks. While the substance of these
doctrines are for later, note the difficulty faced by the trademark office in many
cases. Thanks to the filing of intent-to-use applications, it will be evaluating many
marks, and their potential to cause confusion with other marks, before they go on
the market, limiting the available evidence.

Problems

        1. Our client operates a restaurant called CAFETERIA. It is a sit-down
restaurant that offers a high-end dining experience. It has achieved secondary
meaning in its area of operation. May it obtain a registration?

        2. The Swiss Army Knife is a popular multi-use knife. The trademark
SWISS ARMY KNIFE is held by Wenger S.A. and Victorinox A.G., which has
actually provided knives to the Swiss armed forces. Suppose those companies are
purchased by interests hostile to the Swiss government. The Swiss government hires
you to bring a cancellation proceeding against the SWISS ARMY KNIFE mark.
Assume that the quality of the knives is unchanged and that the registration is less
than five years old (so any basis for challenge is eligible). What are likely avenues for
attack? Will they succeed?

        3. John Smith is a (fictional) baseball player born with an extra finger on
his throwing hand. He becomes a star pitcher. Along the way, he picks up the
nickname "Deep Six," and his fans frequently chant the phrase during his starts.
Smith's team has just made the World Series. You represent All-Star clothing, which
wants to trademark "Deep Six" for use on T-shirts. Any advice on seeking
registration?

Exclusions and the First Amendment.

        Section 2(a) contains exclusions for "scandalous matter; or matter which may
disparage or falsely suggest a connection with persons, living or dead, institutions,
beliefs, or national symbols, or bring them into contempt, or disrepute." The
disparagement provision was the basis for efforts to cancel the former trademark of
the Washington NFL team. The TTAB ordered cancellation, and its ruling was
upheld by a federal district court. See Blackhorse v. Pro-Football, Inc., 111
U.S.P.Q.2d 1080 (Trademark Tr. & App. Bd. June 18, 2014), 2014 WL 2757516;
Pro-Football, Inc. v. Blackhorse, 112 F. Supp. 3d 439 (E.D. Va. 2015). As that

                                                    259
ruling was being appealed, the Federal Circuit struck down the section 2(a)
disparagement bar altogether. In re Tam, 808 F.3d 1321 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (en banc).
The Supreme Court granted cert and affirmed in Matal v. Tam, 582 U.S. 218
(2017), concluding that the bar represents viewpoint discrimination that is
unconstitutional under the First Amendment. Soon after, the Supreme Court faced
the question of the constitutionality of the bar to registering immoral or scandalous
matter.

                                       Iancu v. Brunetti
                                      588 U.S. 388 (2019)

Justice KAGAN delivered the opinion of the Court.
        . . . .
        Respondent Erik Brunetti is an artist and entrepreneur who founded a

clothing line that uses the trademark FUCT. According to Brunetti, the mark
(which functions as the clothing's brand name) is pronounced as four letters, one
after the other: F-U-C-T. See Brief for Respondent 1. But you might read it
differently and, if so, you would hardly be alone. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 5 (describing
the brand name as "the equivalent of [the] past participle form of a well-known
word of profanity"). That common perception caused difficulties for Brunetti when
he tried to register his mark with the U. S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO).

        . . . .
        This case involves another of the Lanham Act's prohibitions on registration--
one applying to marks that "[c]onsist[ ] of or comprise[ ] immoral[ ] or scandalous
matter." § 1052(a). The PTO applies that bar as a "unitary provision," rather than
treating the two adjectives in it separately. To determine whether a mark fits in the
category, the PTO asks whether a "substantial composite of the general public"
would find the mark "shocking to the sense of truth, decency, or propriety"; "giving
offense to the conscience or moral feelings"; "calling out for condemnation";
"disgraceful"; "offensive"; "disreputable"; or "vulgar."
        Both a PTO examining attorney and the PTO's Trademark Trial and Appeal
Board decided that Brunetti's mark flunked that test. . . . On review, the Board
stated that the mark was "highly offensive" and "vulgar," and that it had "decidedly
negative sexual connotations." As part of its review, the Board also considered
evidence of how Brunetti used the mark. It found that Brunetti's website and
products contained imagery, near the mark, of "extreme nihilism" and "anti-social"
behavior. In that context, the Board thought, the mark communicated "misogyny,
depravity, [and] violence." The Board concluded: "Whether one considers [the
mark] as a sexual term, or finds that [Brunetti] has used [the mark] in the context of

                                                    260
extreme misogyny, nihilism or violence, we have no question but that [the term is]
extremely offensive."

        Brunetti then brought a facial challenge to the "immoral or scandalous" bar
in the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. That court found the prohibition to
violate the First Amendment. As usual when a lower court has invalidated a federal
statute, we granted certiorari. . . .

        . . . . So the key question becomes: Is the "immoral or scandalous" criterion
in the Lanham Act viewpoint-neutral or viewpoint-based?

        It is viewpoint-based. The meanings of "immoral" and "scandalous" are not
mysterious, but resort to some dictionaries still helps to lay bare the problem. When
is expressive material "immoral"? According to a standard definition, when it is
"inconsistent with rectitude, purity, or good morals"; "wicked"; or "vicious."
Webster's New International Dictionary 1246 (2d ed. 1949). Or again, when it is
"opposed to or violating morality"; or "morally evil." Shorter Oxford English
Dictionary 961 (3d ed. 1947). So the Lanham Act permits registration of marks that
champion society's sense of rectitude and morality, but not marks that denigrate
those concepts. And when is such material "scandalous"? Says a typical definition,
when it "giv[es] offense to the conscience or moral feelings"; "excite[s] reprobation";
or "call[s] out condemnation." Webster's New International Dictionary, at 2229. Or
again, when it is "shocking to the sense of truth, decency, or propriety";
"disgraceful"; "offensive"; or "disreputable." Funk & Wagnalls New Standard
Dictionary 2186 (1944). So the Lanham Act allows registration of marks when their
messages accord with, but not when their messages defy, society's sense of decency
or propriety. Put the pair of overlapping terms together and the statute, on its face,
distinguishes between two opposed sets of ideas: those aligned with conventional
moral standards and those hostile to them; those inducing societal nods of approval
and those provoking offense and condemnation. The statute favors the former, and
disfavors the latter. "Love rules"? "Always be good"? Registration follows. "Hate
rules"? "Always be cruel"? Not according to the Lanham Act's "immoral or
scandalous" bar.

        The facial viewpoint bias in the law results in viewpoint-discriminatory
application. Recall that the PTO itself describes the "immoral or scandalous"
criterion using much the same language as in the dictionary definitions recited
above. The PTO, for example, asks whether the public would view the mark as
"shocking to the sense of truth, decency, or propriety"; "calling out for
condemnation"; "offensive"; or "disreputable." Brief for Petitioner 6 (internal
quotation marks omitted). Using those guideposts, the PTO has refused to register
marks communicating "immoral" or "scandalous" views about (among other things)
drug use, religion, and terrorism. But all the while, it has approved registration of
marks expressing more accepted views on the same topics. See generally Gilson &

                                                    261
LaLonde, Trademarks Laid Bare, 101 Trademark Reporter 1476, 1510-1513,
1518-1522 (2011); Brief for Barton Beebe et al. as Amici Curiae 28-29.

        Here are some samples. The PTO rejected marks conveying approval of drug
use (YOU CAN'T SPELL HEALTHCARE WITHOUT THC for pain-relief
medication, MARIJUANA COLA and KO KANE for beverages) because it is
scandalous to "inappropriately glamoriz[e] drug abuse." PTO, Office Action of Aug.
28, 2010, Serial No. 85038867; see Office Action of Dec. 24, 2009, Serial No.
77833964; Office Action of Nov. 17, 2009, Serial No. 77671304. But at the same
time, the PTO registered marks with such sayings as D.A.R.E. TO RESIST DRUGS
AND VIOLENCE and SAY NO TO DRUGS--REALITY IS THE BEST TRIP IN
LIFE. See PTO, Reg. No. 2975163 (July 26, 2005); Reg. No. 2966019 (July 12,
2005). Similarly, the PTO disapproved registration for the mark BONG HITS 4
JESUS because it "suggests that people should engage in an illegal activity [in
connection with] worship" and because "Christians would be morally outraged by a
statement that connects Jesus Christ with illegal drug use." Office Action of Mar.
15, 2008, Serial No. 77305946. And the PTO refused to register trademarks
associating religious references with products (AGNUS DEI for safes and
MADONNA for wine) because they would be "offensive to most individuals of the
Christian faith" and "shocking to the sense of propriety." Ex parte Summit Brass &
Bronze Works, 59 U.S.P.Q. 22, 23 (Dec. Com. Pat. 1943); In re Riverbank Canning
Co., 95 F.2d 327, 329 (CCPA 1938). But once again, the PTO approved marks--
PRAISE THE LORD for a game and JESUS DIED FOR YOU on clothing--whose
message suggested religious faith rather than blasphemy or irreverence. See Reg. No.
5265121 (Aug. 15, 2017); Reg. No. 3187985 (Dec. 19, 2006). Finally, the PTO
rejected marks reflecting support for al-Qaeda (BABY AL QAEDA and AL-QAEDA
on t-shirts) "because the bombing of civilians and other terrorist acts are shocking to
the sense of decency and call out for condemnation." Office Action of Nov. 22,
2004, Serial No. 78444968; see Office Action of Feb. 23, 2005, Serial No.
78400213. Yet it approved registration of a mark with the words WAR ON
TERROR MEMORIAL. Reg. No. 5495362 (Jun. 19, 2018). Of course, all these
decisions are understandable. The rejected marks express opinions that are, at the
least, offensive to many Americans. But as the Court made clear in Tam, a law
disfavoring "ideas that offend" discriminates based on viewpoint, in violation of the
First Amendment. 582 U. S., at ----, 137 S.Ct., at 1751 (opinion of ALITO, J.);
see id., at ---- - ----, 137 S.Ct., at 1762-1763; id., at ---- - ----, 137 S.Ct., at
1765-1766 (opinion of Kennedy, J.)

        How, then, can the Government claim that the "immoral or scandalous" bar
is viewpoint-neutral? The Government basically asks us to treat decisions like those
described above as PTO examiners' mistakes. Still more, the Government tells us to
ignore how the Lanham Act's language, on its face, disfavors some ideas. In urging

                                                    262
that course, the Government does not dispute that the statutory language--and
words used to define it--have just that effect. At oral argument, the Government
conceded: "[I]f you just looked at the words like `shocking' and `offensive' on their
face and gave them their ordinary meanings[,] they could easily encompass material
that was shocking [or offensive] because it expressed an outrageous point of view or
a point of view that most members" of society reject. Tr. of Oral Arg. 6. But no
matter, says the Government, because the statute is "susceptible of" a limiting
construction that would remove this viewpoint bias. Id., at 7 (arguing that the Court
should "attempt to construe [the] statute in a way that would render it
constitutional"). The Government's idea, abstractly phrased, is to narrow the
statutory bar to "marks that are offensive [or] shocking to a substantial segment of
the public because of their mode of expression, independent of any views that they
may express." Id., at 11 (emphasis added); see Brief for Petitioner 27-28. More
concretely, the Government explains that this reinterpretation would mostly restrict
the PTO to refusing marks that are "vulgar"--meaning "lewd," "sexually explicit or
profane." Id., at 27, 30. Such a reconfigured bar, the Government says, would not
turn on viewpoint, and so we could uphold it.

        But we cannot accept the Government's proposal, because the statute says
something markedly different. This Court, of course, may interpret "ambiguous
statutory language" to "avoid serious constitutional doubts." FCC v. Fox Television
Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 516 (2009). But that canon of construction applies only
when ambiguity exists. "We will not rewrite a law to conform it to constitutional
requirements." United States v. Stevens, 559 U.S. 460, 481 (2010) (internal quotation
marks and alteration omitted). So even assuming the Government's reading would
eliminate First Amendment problems, we may adopt it only if we can see it in the
statutory language. And we cannot. The "immoral or scandalous" bar stretches far
beyond the Government's proposed construction. The statute as written does not
draw the line at lewd, sexually explicit, or profane marks. Nor does it refer only to
marks whose "mode of expression," independent of viewpoint, is particularly
offensive. Brief for Petitioner 28 (internal quotation marks omitted). It covers the
universe of immoral or scandalous--or (to use some PTO synonyms) offensive or
disreputable--material. Whether or not lewd or profane. Whether the scandal and
immorality comes from mode or instead from viewpoint. To cut the statute off
where the Government urges is not to interpret the statute Congress enacted, but to
fashion a new one. . . .

Justice ALITO, concurring.
        . . . . Our decision does not prevent Congress from adopting a more carefully

focused statute that precludes the registration of marks containing vulgar terms that
play no real part in the expression of ideas. The particular mark in question in this

                                                    263
case could be denied registration under such a statute. The term suggested by that
mark is not needed to express any idea and, in fact, as commonly used today,
generally signifies nothing except emotion and a severely limited vocabulary. The
registration of such marks serves only to further coarsen our popular culture. But we
are not legislators and cannot substitute a new statute for the one now in force.

Chief Justice ROBERTS, concurring in part and dissenting in part.
        The Lanham Act directs the Patent and Trademark Office to refuse

registration to marks that consist of or comprise "immoral, deceptive, or scandalous
matter." 15 U.S.C. § 1052(a). Although the statute lists "immoral" and
"scandalous" separately, the PTO has long read those terms together to constitute a
unitary bar on "immoral or scandalous" marks.

        The Government concedes that the provision so read is broad enough to
reach not only marks that offend because of their mode of expression (such as
vulgarity and profanity) but also marks that offend because of the ideas they convey.
The Government urges, however, that the provision can be given a narrowing
construction--it can be understood to cover only marks that offend because of their
mode of expression.

        The Court rejects that proposal on the ground that it would in effect rewrite
the statute. I agree with the majority that the "immoral" portion of the provision is
not susceptible of a narrowing construction that would eliminate its viewpoint bias.
As Justice SOTOMAYOR explains, however, the "scandalous" portion of the
provision is susceptible of such a narrowing construction. Standing alone, the term
"scandalous" need not be understood to reach marks that offend because of the
ideas they convey; it can be read more narrowly to bar only marks that offend
because of their mode of expression--marks that are obscene, vulgar, or profane. . . .

        I also agree that . . . refusing registration to obscene, vulgar, or profane marks
does not offend the First Amendment. Whether such marks can be registered does
not affect the extent to which their owners may use them in commerce to identify
goods. No speech is being restricted; no one is being punished. The owners of such
marks are merely denied certain additional benefits associated with federal
trademark registration. The Government, meanwhile, has an interest in not
associating itself with trademarks whose content is obscene, vulgar, or profane. The
First Amendment protects the freedom of speech; it does not require the
Government to give aid and comfort to those using obscene, vulgar, and profane
modes of expression. For those reasons, I concur in part and dissent in part.

Justice SOTOMAYOR, with whom Justice BREYER joins, concurring in part and
dissenting in part.

        The Court's decision today will beget unfortunate results. With the Lanham
Act's scandalous-marks provision, 15 U.S.C. § 1052(a), struck down as

                                                    264
unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination, the Government will have no statutory
basis to refuse (and thus no choice but to begin) registering marks containing the
most vulgar, profane, or obscene words and images imaginable.

        The coming rush to register such trademarks--and the Government's
immediate powerlessness to say no--is eminently avoidable. Rather than read the
relevant text as the majority does, it is equally possible to read that provision's bar
on the registration of "scandalous" marks to address only obscenity, vulgarity, and
profanity. Such a narrowing construction would save that duly enacted legislative
text by rendering it a reasonable, viewpoint-neutral restriction on speech that is
permissible in the context of a beneficial governmental initiative like the trademark-
registration system. I would apply that narrowing construction to the term
"scandalous" and accordingly reject petitioner Erik Brunetti's facial challenge.

        . . . .
        . . . . [A]s for the word "immoral," I agree with the majority that there is no
tenable way to read it that would ameliorate the problem. The word clearly
connotes a preference for "rectitude and morality" over its opposite.
        It is with regard to the word "scandalous" that I part ways with the majority.
Unquestionably, "scandalous" can mean something similar to "immoral" and thus
favor some viewpoints over others. But it does not have to be read that way. To say
that a word or image is "scandalous" can instead mean that it is simply indecent,
shocking, or generally offensive. See Funk & Wagnalls New Standard Dictionary
2186 (1944) (Funk & Wagnalls) ("shocking to the sense of truth, decency, or
propriety; disgraceful, offensive" (emphasis added)); Webster's New International
Dictionary 2229 (1942) ("exciting reprobation; calling out condemnation"); 9
Oxford English Dictionary 175 (1933) ("Of the nature of, or causing, a `stumbling-
block' or occasion of offence"); 8 Century Dictionary and Cyclopedia 5374 (1911)
(Century Dictionary) ("Causing scandal or offense; exciting reproach or
reprobation; extremely offensive to the sense of duty or propriety; shameful;
shocking"); see also Webster's New College Dictionary 1008 (3d ed. 2005)
("shocking or offensive"). That offensiveness could result from the views expressed,
but it could also result from the way in which those views are expressed: using a
manner of expression that is "shocking to [one's] sense of ... decency," Funk &
Wagnalls 2186, or "extremely offensive to the sense of ... propriety," 8 Century
Dictionary 5374.
        The word "scandalous" on its own, then, is ambiguous: It can be read
broadly (to cover both offensive ideas and offensive manners of expressing ideas), or
it can be read narrowly (to cover only offensive modes of expression). That alone
raises the possibility that a limiting construction might be appropriate. But the
broader text confirms the reasonableness of the narrower reading, because the word

                                                    265
"scandalous" appears in the statute alongside other words that can, and should, be
read to constrain its scope.

        It is foundational "that a statute is to be read as a whole, since the meaning
of statutory language, plain or not, depends on context." King v. St. Vincent's
Hospital, 502 U.S. 215, 221 (1991) (citation omitted). " `Words are not pebbles in
alien juxtaposition; they have only a communal existence; and not only does the
meaning of each interpenetrate the other, but all in their aggregate take their
purport from the setting in which they are used.' " Ibid. (quoting NLRB v. Federbush
Co., 121 F.2d 954, 957 (C.A.2 1941) (L. Hand, J.)). Accordingly, and relatedly,
courts should, to the extent possible, read statutes so that " `no clause, sentence, or
word shall be superfluous, void, or insignificant.' " TRW Inc. v. Andrews, 534 U.S.
19, 31 (2001).

        Here, Congress used not only the word "scandalous," but also the words
"immoral" and "disparage," in the same block of statutory text--each as a separate
feature that could render a mark unregistrable. Tam already decided that
"disparage" served to prohibit marks that were offensive because they derided a
particular person or group. That defines one of the three words. Meanwhile, as the
majority explains, the word "immoral" prohibits marks that are offensive because
they transgress widely held moral beliefs. That defines a second of the three words.

        With marks that are offensive because they are disparaging and marks that
are offensive because they are immoral already covered, what work did Congress
intend for "scandalous" to do? A logical answer is that Congress meant for
"scandalous" to target a third and distinct type of offensiveness: offensiveness in the
mode of communication rather than the idea. The other two words cover marks
that are offensive because of the ideas they express; the "scandalous" clause covers
marks that are offensive because of the mode of expression, apart from any
particular message or idea. . . .

        . . . . [W]hile the majority offers a reasonable reading of "scandalous," it also
unnecessarily and ill-advisedly collapses the words "scandalous" and "immoral."
Instead, it should treat them as each holding a distinct, nonredundant meaning,
with "immoral" covering marks that are offensive because they transgress social
norms, and "scandalous" covering marks that are offensive because of the mode in
which they are expressed.

        What would it mean for "scandalous" in § 1052(a) to cover only offensive
modes of expression? The most obvious ways--indeed, perhaps the only conceivable
ways--in which a trademark can be expressed in a shocking or offensive manner are
when the speaker employs obscenity, vulgarity, or profanity. Obscenity has long
been defined by this Court's decision in Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15 (1973). As
for what constitutes "scandalous" vulgarity or profanity, I do not offer a list, but I do
interpret the term to allow the PTO to restrict (and potentially promulgate guidance

                                                    266
to clarify) the small group of lewd words or "swear" words that cause a visceral
reaction, that are not commonly used around children, and that are prohibited in
comparable settings. Cf. 18 U.S.C. § 1464 (prohibiting "obscene, indecent, or
profane language" in radio communications); FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U.S.
726, 746, and n. 22 (1978) (opinion of Stevens, J.) (regulator's objection to a
monologue containing various "four-letter words" was not to its "point of view, but
to the way in which it [wa]s expressed"); 46 C.F.R. § 67.117(b)(3) (2018) (Coast
Guard regulation prohibiting vessel names that "contain" or are "phonetically
identical to obscene, indecent, or profane language, or to racial or ethnic epithets");
see also Jacobs, The Public Sensibilities Forum, 95 Nw. U. L. Rev. 1357, 1416-
1417, and n. 432 (2001) (noting that "swear words" are "perhaps more than any
other categor[y] capable of specific articulation" and citing one state agency's list).
Of course, "scandalous" offers its own limiting principle: if a word, though not
exactly polite, cannot be said to be "scandalous"--e.g., "shocking" or "extremely
offensive," 8 Century Dictionary 5374--it is clearly not the kind of vulgarity or
profanity that Congress intended to target. Everyone can think of a small number of
words (including the apparent homonym of Brunetti's mark) that would, however,
plainly qualify.5

        . . . .
        Adopting a narrow construction for the word "scandalous"--interpreting it to
regulate only obscenity, vulgarity, and profanity--would save it from
unconstitutionality. Properly narrowed, "scandalous" is a viewpoint-neutral form of
content discrimination that is permissible in the kind of discretionary governmental
program or limited forum typified by the trademark-registration system. . . .
        Freedom of speech is a cornerstone of our society, and the First Amendment
protects Brunetti's right to use words like the one at issue here. The Government
need not, however, be forced to confer on Brunetti's trademark (and some more
extreme) the ancillary benefit of trademark registration, when "scandalous" in §
1052(a) can reasonably be read to bar the registration of only those marks that are
obscene, vulgar, or profane. Though I concur as to the unconstitutionality of the
term "immoral" in § 1052(a), I respectfully dissent as to the term "scandalous" in

          5 There is at least one particularly egregious racial epithet that would fit this description as well.

While Matal v. Tam removed a statutory basis to deny the registration of racial epithets in general, the

Government represented at oral argument that it is holding in abeyance trademark applications that use that

particular epithet. As a result of today's ruling, the Government will now presumably be compelled to register

marks containing that epithet as well rather than treating it as a "scandalous" form of profanity under §

1052(a).

                                                    267
the same statute and would instead uphold it under the narrow construction
discussed here.

                                     Notes and Questions

        Are disparaging and scandalous marks good marks? How well do scandalous
marks perform the trademark function? Suppose someone tries to register a racial
epithet after Tam and Brunetti. Is the PTO really without a recourse to refuse the
registration?

        In my view, the bars could have been justified on the basis that they were
excluding marks that failed to perform the trademark function effectively.

        The [disparagement] bar reflects a policy that promotes effective trademarks
        by favoring, to a large, albeit imperfect, extent, signifiers that are initially
        irrelevant to the market context in which they will be deployed. Such marks
        are better able to serve as receptacles of source-identifying meaning and, in
        turn, to be a shorthand for other information about the product or service in
        question. By contrast, trademark law disfavors and often excludes would-be
        marks that bring market-relevant information to the table. . . .

        Although they do not necessarily bring the same kind of market-relevant
        information as, say, a generic term, disparaging marks share the characteristic
        of being infused with non-source meaning. Unlike arbitrary or fanciful
        marks, disparaging marks fail the irrelevance test because they embody
        meanings that interfere with their ability to perform a source-identifying
        function. In context, they are not the empty vessels that trademark law
        idealizes because consumers perceive a disparaging message. Just as APPLE
        lacks trademark significance when applied to the fruit instead of computers,
        and penguin-shaped cocktail shakers denote a product more than its source,
        slurs leave less room for trademark meanings than do the comparatively
        neutral terms that trademark law traditionally favors.

Michael Grynberg, A Trademark Defense of the Disparagement Bar, 126 Yale L.J.
Forum 178, 184, 187-88 (2016).

        Failure to function. One possible way of managing the consequences of Tam
and Brunetti is greater use of the "failure to function" principle--previously
mentioned in the notes in chapter 2--which requires that would-be trademarks
actually "function" as marks before they can receive protection. As discussed there,
the doctrine has been most associated with how a mark is used, and the PTO uses it
to police the submission of specimens in registration applications. See TMEP §
904.07(b); § 1202.03. Under these rules, examining attorneys should "consider the

                                                    268
size, location, and dominance of the proposed mark, as applied to the goods, to
determine whether ornamental matter serves a trademark function." TMEP §
1202.03(a).

        Failure to function is increasingly being used to turn away marks based on
their semantic meaning. See Note, Lucas Daniel Cuatrecasas, Failure to Function and
Trademark Law's Outermost Bound, 96 N.Y.U. L. REV. 1312, 1328 (2021) ("[A] mark's
semantic meaning and inherent nature have become essential to today's failure-to-
function cases."); id. at 1326 (charting refusals). The TMEP already directs
examining attorneys to reject "merely informational matter," TMEP § 1202.04
("Merely informational matter fails to function as a mark to indicate source and
thus is not registrable."), and this provision has been used to block attempted
registrations that appear to be efforts to capitalize on slogans, memes, and other
phrases prominent in popular culture. For example, this provision was used to turn
away an attempt to register the phrase, "I can't breathe," which is associated with
protests against police brutality. See, e.g., U.S. Patent & Trademark Office, Office
Action (Official Letter) About Applicant's Trademark Application (Mar. 4, 2015),
http://tsdr.uspto.gov/documentviewer?caseId=sn86479784&docId=OOA2015030
4094857 .

        The principle may be able to fill some of the gap left by Tam and Brunetti. In
2021, the TTAB used failure-to-function analysis to reject an attempt to register a
variant of the most offensive slur in the English language. See In re Snowflake
Enters., No. 87496454, (T.T.A.B. June 24, 2021) (non-precedential).

        What will the Federal Circuit say? The case law is developing. See In re: GO
& Associates, LLC., 90 F.4th 1354, 1357 (Fed. Cir. 2024) ("[W]e conclude that the
Board's determination that `EVERYBODY VS RACISM' does not function as a
source identifier for GO's products (i.e., tote bags and apparel) or services (i.e.,
promoting awareness of the need for racial reconciliation) was supported by
substantial evidence."); In re Vox Populi Registry Ltd., 25 F.4th 1348, 1351 (Fed.
Cir. 2022) (affirming refusal to register .SUCKS and noting that "though our court
has had limited occasion to address the issue, the source identifier requirement is
broader than just whether a proposed mark is generic or descriptive").

        Are other registration bars in danger? Tam and Brunetti naturally raised the
question whether other registration bars may be at risk. In 2022, the Federal Circuit
held that applying the section 2(c) bar--which prohibits registration of matter that
"[c]onsists of or comprises a name, portrait, or signature identifying a particular
living individual" without consent--to refuse to register the mark TRUMP TOO
SMALL violates the First Amendment. In re Elster, 26 F.4th 1328 (Fed. Cir. 2022).

        The Supreme Court reversed in Vidal v. Elster, 602 U.S. 286 (2024). Vidal
treats section 2(c) as a content-based (albeit viewpoint-neutral) restriction,

                                                    269
potentially increasing First Amendment scrutiny. Such scrutiny would raise difficult
questions for trademark law, as its doctrine is rife with content-based
determinations (e.g., does this word signal source? Does this mark cause
confusion?). Rather that throw trademark law into chaos, Vidal determines that
although content-based speech regulations are "presumptively unconstitutional,"
"[s]everal features of trademark counsel against a per se rule of applying heightened
scrutiny to viewpoint-neutral, but content-based trademark regulations."

        Although the Court unanimously upheld section 2(c), it sharply divided on
how to approach the question, reflecting larger ongoing debates about
constitutional interpretation that are typically external to trademark law.

                                         Vidal v. Elster
                                      602 U.S. 286 (2024)

Justice THOMAS announced the judgment of the Court and delivered the opinion
of the Court with respect [to the portions reprinted below].

        [In his opinion, Justice Thomas focused on the claim that history establishes
that something like the section 2(c) bar, which the Court called the "names clause,"
has long lived in peace with the First Amendment, finding historical antecedents for
restricting trademark rights in names while still allowing sellers to obtain marks
containing their own names (so long as they did not exclude others with the same
name from using it). At the same time, "[w]e see no evidence that the common law
afforded protection to a person seeking a trademark of another living person's
name. To the contrary, English courts recognized that selling a product under
another person's name could be actionable fraud. This recognition carried over to
our country. . . . The common-law approach to trademarking names thus protected
only a person's right to use his own name." These understandings were then
translated into statutory law.

        Justice Thomas then observed that these rules jibe with trademark law's
purposes of accurately identifying goods and protecting the reputation of the
markholder. This latter concern is especially at play when dealing with one's name.
Taken together:]

        We conclude that a tradition of restricting the trademarking of names has
coexisted with the First Amendment, and the names clause fits within that
tradition. Though the particulars of the doctrine have shifted over time, the
consistent through line is that a person generally had a claim only to his own name.
The names clause reflects this common-law tradition by prohibiting a person from
obtaining a trademark of another living person's name without consent, thereby
protecting the other's reputation and goodwill.

        None of this is to say that the Government cannot innovate when it comes
to trademark law. A firm grounding in traditional trademark law is sufficient to

                                                    270
justify the content-based trademark restriction before us, but we do not opine on
what may be required or sufficient in other cases. . . . [A] case presenting a content-
based trademark restriction without a historical analogue may require a different
approach. But, we need not develop such a comprehensive theory to address the
relatively simple case before us today. . . .

Justice KAVANAUGH, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE joins, concurring in
part.

        . . . . I agree with the Court that the names clause is constitutional,
particularly in light of the long history of restricting the use of another's name in a
trademark. In my view, a viewpoint-neutral, content-based trademark restriction
might well be constitutional even absent such a historical pedigree. We can address
that distinct question as appropriate in a future case.

Justice BARRETT, with whom Justice KAGAN joins [and joined in part by Justices
SOTOMAYOR and JACKSON], concurring in part.

        [Justice Barrett would have justified section 2(c) by reference to trademark
law's goal of promoting source identification via the registration system, which she
analogized to a limited public forum. In such forums, content-based restrictions may
be necessary in order to carry out the purposes of the forum. Just so with
registration:]

        Congress provided for "national protection of trademarks in order to secure
to the owner of the mark the goodwill of his business and to protect the ability of
consumers to distinguish among competing producers," matching trademark's
historical goals. Park `N Fly, Inc. v. Dollar Park & Fly, Inc., 469 U.S. 189, 198 (1985).
A mark can only fulfill those goals to the extent that it "tells the public who is
responsible for [the] product." Jack Daniel's [Properties, Inc. v. VIP Products LLC, 599
U.S. 140, 146 (2023)]. This is a content-based requirement.

        Content-based criteria for trademark registration do not abridge the right to
free speech so long as they reasonably relate to the preservation of the markowner's
goodwill and the prevention of consumer confusion. A particular restriction will
serve those goals if it helps ensure that registered marks actually function as source
identifiers. . . .

        The names clause passes muster under this test. A trademark that includes
another living person's name without her consent has the obvious potential to
create source confusion. Further, the clause helps protect producer goodwill. By
freely using another person's name in her mark, the markowner can unfairly
capitalize on the reputation of the named individual, who may be a producer in her
own right. Conversely, if the markowner's goods or services are shoddy, she might
jeopardize the named individual's reputation.

                                                    271
        Elster protests that consumers would not assume that Donald Trump is
responsible for the mark " `Trump too small.' " Thus, he argues that even if the
names clause generally guards against source confusion, refusing to register his
proposed mark does not. But Congress is entitled to make categorical judgments,
particularly where heightened scrutiny does not apply. The Government can
reasonably determine that, on the whole, protecting marks that include another
living person's name without consent risks undermining the goals of trademark.
The names clause is therefore constitutional, both facially and as applied to Elster's
mark.

        [Barrett then explained her objections to the majority approach. First, she
disagreed that the historical record offered clear justification of the names clause. In
particular, it was not clear that the common law prevented a person from using
another living person's name as a trademark. "And if such a common-law rule
existed, the majority opinion does not identify it. Instead, the Court draws from
sources suggesting that a person could not enforce a trademark with another
individual's name against that individual. Nor could she fraudulently attempt to
pass off her goods as those of another person, using that person's name. So far, so
good. Yet the names clause prevents other uses of someone else's name that the
common law may have allowed. And on that score, the Court does not fully grapple
with countervailing evidence."

        The ambiguity of historical evidence aside, Justice Barrett objected to
framing the inquiry around a hunt for historical antecedents to the names clause.]

        But I cannot agree with the Court that the existence of a "common-law
tradition" and a "historical analogue" is sufficient to resolve this case. Even if the
Court's evidence were rock solid, I still would not adopt this approach. To be sure,
tradition has a legitimate role to play in constitutional adjudication. For instance,
the longstanding practice of the political branches can reinforce our understanding
of the Constitution's original meaning. . . . The views of preceding generations can
persuade, and, in the realm of stare decisis, even bind. But tradition is not an end in
itself--and I fear that the Court uses it that way here.

        The Court does not (and could not) argue that the late-19th and early-20th
century names-restriction tradition serves as evidence of the original meaning of the
Free Speech Clause. Nor does it treat the history it recites as a persuasive data point.
Instead, it presents tradition itself as the constitutional argument; the late-19th and
early-20th century evidence is dispositive of the First Amendment issue. Yet what is
the theoretical justification for using tradition that way?

        Relying exclusively on history and tradition may seem like a way of avoiding
judge-made tests. But a rule rendering tradition dispositive is itself a judge-made test.
And I do not see a good reason to resolve this case using that approach rather than
by adopting a generally applicable principle. (After all, there is a tradition of the

                                                    272
latter approach too. See, e.g., McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 421, 17 U.S.
316 (1819) (adopting standard for application of the Necessary and Proper Clause).)
In the course of applying broadly worded text like the Free Speech Clause, courts
must inevitably articulate principles to resolve individual cases. I do not think we
can or should avoid doing so here. . . . [T]he takeaway from history is that content-
based trademark restrictions have long been central to trademark's purpose of
facilitating source identification, and they have not posed a serious risk of
censorship. . . .

        Trademark protection cannot exist without content discrimination. So long
as content-based registration restrictions reasonably relate to the purposes of the
trademark system, they are constitutional . . . .

Justice SOTOMAYOR, with whom Justice KAGAN and Justice JACKSON join,
concurring in the judgment.

        . . . . The assertion that content-based distinctions in trademark law have
long played well with the First Amendment, although true, requires a more fulsome
explanation, particularly as applied to the trademark registration system. The
primary reason why viewpoint-neutral trademark registration criteria easily coexist
with the Free Speech Clause is that they do not burden expression. Instead, a denial
of registration withholds ancillary benefits that might bolster someone's expression.
When a government confers a benefit that supports some forms of expressive
activity, the decision to withhold that benefit on viewpoint-neutral grounds "
`cannot be equated with the imposition of a "penalty" on that activity,' " which
would trigger heightened scrutiny. Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173, 193 (1991)
(quoting Harris v. McRae, 448 U.S. 297, 317, n. 19 (1980)). . . .

        [T]his Court has recognized repeatedly that the First Amendment permits
governmental bodies to rely on reasonable, viewpoint-neutral, content-based criteria
when deciding to benefit certain communicative activities. See, e.g., National
Endowment for Arts v. Finley, 524 U.S. 569, 587-588 (1998) ("[T]he Government may
allocate competitive funding according to criteria that would be impermissible were
direct regulation of speech or a criminal penalty at stake").

        [V]arious strands of precedent support this point, ranging from cases about
limited public (or nonpublic) forums to those involving monetary subsidies and
noncash governmental programs (such as the collection of fees by public-sector
labor unions). In these cases, content discrimination was necessarily a part of the
governmental initiative at issue, yet the initiative was not subject to the
constitutional straitjacket of heightened scrutiny. . . .

                                                    273
        [These cases] generally stand for the proposition that the Free Speech Clause
permits governmental bodies to impose a "reasonable, viewpoint-neutral limitation"
on a "state-bestowed entitlement." Davenport, 551 U.S. at 189 . . . .

        Someone with a federally registered mark enjoys certain benefits by virtue of
that registration. Even so, free speech is not abridged when these benefits are denied
to someone based on reasonable, viewpoint-neutral criteria.

        . . . . By prohibiting trademark registration for viewpoint-neutral, content-
based reasons, Congress simply denies an applicant the opportunity to include his
mark on a list and secure "certain benefits" that are "useful in infringement
litigation." Jack Daniel's, 599 U.S. at 146. The risk of speech suppression is therefore
"attenuated" because denying a trademark holder these ancillary benefits does not
prevent him from using his mark in commerce or communicating any message
incidental to the mark. . . .

        When the U. S. Patent and Trademark Office rejected [Elster's] registration
request, it denied Elster the opportunity to secure the Government-bestowed
benefits associated with registration. Critically, the denial did not prevent Elster
from communicating his message. It also did not restrict his preferred mode of
expression. Elster can still sell shirts displaying the same message. Elster could also
use a different phrase (such as ELSTER APPAREL) as a source identifier to obtain
the desired benefits of registration while continuing to sell shirts with his preferred
message across the front. Put simply, the denial only barred Elster from registering a
mark asserting exclusive rights in another person's name without their written
consent. . . .

        Because trademark registration criteria limit statutory benefits in a necessarily
content-based scheme, the First Amendment requires the criteria to be viewpoint
neutral and reasonable. From this Court's analogous nonpublic-forum and limited-
public-forum cases, it is clear that "reasonable" means that the challenged provision
must reasonably serve the purpose of the content-based scheme. On this point, I
agree with Justice BARRETT that the challenged trademark registration criteria
must be "reasonable in light of the trademark system's purpose of facilitating source
identification.". . .

        "Content-based criteria for trademark registration do not abridge the right to
free speech so long as they reasonably relate to the preservation of the markowner's
goodwill and the prevention of consumer confusion," "goals" that a "particular
restriction will serve ... if it helps ensure that registered marks actually function as
source identifiers." Ante, at 1528 (opinion of BARRETT, J.) The names clause easily
passes this reasonableness test. Source identification is, after all, at the heart of what
the names clause does.

        Imagine someone who wants to manufacture and sell the best bats and
catchers' mitts in baseball. Unsurprisingly, that person wants to use the names of

                                                    274
Derek Jeter and Jorge Posada to capitalize on their goodwill to promote the
products. So, the manufacturer lands on JETER OUT OF THE PARK and
CATCH LIKE POSADA as marks. The names clause bars registration of these
phrases without the named individuals' written consent. It does so for good reason:
Jeter and Posada may not want consumers to misattribute these products to them,
just as consumers may not want to buy products under the false pretense that these
goods somehow are connected to the players.3 Source identification is especially
important when, for example, the named individual produces similar products--say,
Jeter and Posada sell their own baseball goods under the marks MR. NOVEMBER
BATS BY JETER and CHAMP'S MITTS BY POSADA. They would not want
manufacturers to dilute the commercial value of their name and reputation. Nor
would Jeter and Posada want a Boston Red Sox fan to manufacture cheaper goods
and use their names to promote second-rate products. The names clause prevents
that from happening.

        Congress was entitled to make this legislative judgment. . . .
        [Justice Sotomayor also criticized the majority's methodology, arguing that
the majority's "history-and-tradition approach is not just flawed as a matter of first
principles, but also highly indeterminate and unfamiliar to judges and litigants in
this area of the law. How much history is enough to clear the historical analogue bar
the five-Justice majority set up? What does that look like in this context? When it
comes to subjectivity, their preferred approach empowers judges to pick their
friends in a crowded party."]

Incontestability

        Section 15 of the Lanham Act (15 U.S.C. § 1065) provides:

        Except on a ground for which application to cancel may be filed at any time
        under paragraphs (3) and (5) of section 1064 of this title, and except to the
        extent, if any, to which the use of a mark registered on the principal register
        infringes a valid right acquired under the law of any State or Territory by use
        of a mark or trade name continuing from a date prior to the date of

          3 Other Lanham Act provisions prohibit the registration of marks that deceive or falsely suggest a
connection to a person or entity. See 15 U.S.C. § 1052(a). That there is some overlap between the false-
suggestion and names clauses does not change the fact that the names clause reasonably serves the purpose of
source identification. When heightened scrutiny is not in play, Congress is free to use belts and suspenders to
support an asserted interest. I therefore also agree with Justice BARRETT that "Congress is entitled to make
[the] categorical judgmen[t] ... that, on the whole, protecting marks that include another living person's name
without consent risks undermining the goals of trademark."

                                                    275
        registration under this chapter of such registered mark, the right of the
        registrant to use such registered mark in commerce for the goods or services
        on or in connection with which such registered mark has been in continuous
        use for five consecutive years subsequent to the date of such registration and
        is still in use in commerce, shall be incontestable: Provided, That--

        (1) there has been no final decision adverse to registrant's claim of ownership
        of such mark for such goods or services, or to registrant's right to register the
        same or to keep the same on the register; and

        (2) there is no proceeding involving said rights pending in the Patent and
        Trademark Office or in a court and not finally disposed of; and

        (3) an affidavit is filed with the Director within one year after the expiration
        of any such five-year period setting forth those goods or services stated in the
        registration on or in connection with which such mark has been in
        continuous use for such five consecutive years and is still in use in
        commerce, and other matters specified in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this
        section; and

        (4) no incontestable right shall be acquired in a mark which is the generic
        name for the goods or services or a portion thereof, for which it is registered.
        . . .

        Incontestability has been referred to as a "quiet title" provision for
trademarks. But there are numerous exceptions. Some are mentioned in the
provision above. Section 33 of the Lanham Act (15 U.S.C. § 1116) lists others. But
what about reasons for challenging an incontestable mark that are not explicitly
mentioned in the statute? Can a registered descriptive mark without secondary
meaning avoid challenge if it manages to slip by unnoticed long enough to achieve
incontestable status?

                      Park 'N Fly, Inc. v. Dollar Park and Fly, Inc.
                                      469 U.S. 189 (1985)

Justice O'CONNOR delivered the opinion of the Court.
        In this case we consider whether an action to enjoin the infringement of an

incontestable trade or service mark may be defended on the grounds that the mark
is merely descriptive. We conclude that neither the language of the relevant statutes
nor the legislative history supports such a defense.

                                                  I
        Petitioner operates long-term parking lots near airports. After starting
business in St. Louis in 1967, petitioner subsequently opened facilities in

                                                    276
Cleveland, Houston, Boston, Memphis, and San Francisco. Petitioner applied in
1969 to the United States Patent and Trademark Office (Patent Office) to register a
service mark consisting of the logo of an airplane and the words "Park 'N Fly." The
registration issued in August 1971. Nearly six years later, petitioner filed an affidavit
with the Patent Office to establish the incontestable status of the mark. As required
by § 15 of the Trademark Act of 1946 (Lanham Act), 60 Stat. 433, as amended, 15
U.S.C. § 1065, the affidavit stated that the mark had been registered and in
continuous use for five consecutive years, that there had been no final adverse
decision to petitioner's claim of ownership or right to registration, and that no
proceedings involving such rights were pending. Incontestable status provides,
subject to the provisions of § 15 and § 33(b) of the Lanham Act, "conclusive
evidence of the registrant's exclusive right to use the registered mark...." § 33(b), 15
U.S.C. § 1115(b).

        Respondent also provides long-term airport parking services, but only has
operations in Portland, Oregon. Respondent calls its business "Dollar Park and
Fly." Petitioner filed this infringement action in 1978 in the United States District
Court for the District of Oregon and requested the court permanently to enjoin
respondent from using the words "Park and Fly" in connection with its business.
Respondent counterclaimed and sought cancellation of petitioner's mark on the
grounds that it is a generic term. See § 14(c), 15 U.S.C. § 1064(c). Respondent also
argued that petitioner's mark is unenforceable because it is merely descriptive. See §
2(e), 15 U.S.C. § 1052(e). . . .

        After a bench trial, the District Court found that petitioner's mark is not
generic and observed that an incontestable mark cannot be challenged on the
grounds that it is merely descriptive. . . . Finally, the District Court found sufficient
evidence of likelihood of confusion. The District Court permanently enjoined
respondent from using the words "Park and Fly" and any other mark confusingly
similar to "Park 'N Fly."

        The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed. The District Court did
not err, the Court of Appeals held, in refusing to invalidate petitioner's mark. The
Court of Appeals noted, however, that it previously had held that incontestability
provides a defense against the cancellation of a mark, but it may not be used
offensively to enjoin another's use. Petitioner, under this analysis, could obtain an
injunction only if its mark would be entitled to continued registration without
regard to its incontestable status. Thus, respondent could defend the infringement
action by showing that the mark was merely descriptive. Based on its own
examination of the record, the Court of Appeals then determined that petitioner's
mark is in fact merely descriptive, and therefore respondent should not be enjoined
from using the name "Park and Fly."

                                                    277
        The decision below is in direct conflict with the decision of the Court of
Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in Union Carbide Corp. v. Ever-Ready Inc., 531 F.2d
366. We granted certiorari to resolve this conflict, and we now reverse.

                                                 II
        . . . . Among the new protections created by the Lanham Act were the
statutory provisions that allow a federally registered mark to become incontestable.
§§ 15, 33(b), 15 U.S.C. §§ 1065, 1115(b).
        The provisions of the Lanham Act concerning registration and
incontestability distinguish a mark that is "the common descriptive name of an
article or substance" from a mark that is "merely descriptive." §§ 2(e), 14(c), 15
U.S.C. §§ 1052(e), 1064(c). Marks that constitute a common descriptive name are
referred to as generic. A generic term is one that refers to the genus of which the
particular product is a species. Abercrombie & Fitch Co. v. Hunting World, Inc., 537
F.2d 4, 9 (CA2 1976). Generic terms are not registrable, and a registered mark may
be canceled at any time on the grounds that it has become generic. See §§ 2, 14(c),
15 U.S.C. §§ 1052, 1064(c). A "merely descriptive" mark, in contrast, describes the
qualities or characteristics of a good or service, and this type of mark may be
registered only if the registrant shows that it has acquired secondary meaning, i.e., it
"has become distinctive of the applicant's goods in commerce." §§ 2(e), (f), 15
U.S.C. §§ 1052(e), (f).
        This case requires us to consider the effect of the incontestability provisions
of the Lanham Act in the context of an infringement action defended on the
grounds that the mark is merely descriptive. Statutory construction must begin with
the language employed by Congress and the assumption that the ordinary meaning
of that language accurately expresses the legislative purpose. See American Tobacco
Co. v. Patterson, 456 U.S. 63, 68 (1982). With respect to incontestable trade or
service marks, § 33(b) of the Lanham Act states that "registration shall be conclusive
evidence of the registrant's exclusive right to use the registered mark" subject to the
conditions of § 15 and certain enumerated defenses.3 Section 15 incorporates by

          3 Section 33(b) of the Lanham Act, as set forth in 15 U.S.C. § 1115(b), provides:

          "If the right to use the registered mark has become incontestable under section 1065 of this title, the

registration shall be conclusive evidence of the registrant's exclusive right to use the registered mark in

commerce or in connection with the goods or services specified in the affidavit filed under the provisions of

said section 1065 subject to any conditions or limitations stated therein except when one of the following

defenses or defects is established:

          "(1) That the registration or the incontestable right to use the mark was obtained fraudulently; or

          "(2) That the mark has been abandoned by the registrant; or

                                                    278
reference subsections (c) and (e) of § 14, 15 U.S.C. § 1064. An incontestable mark
that becomes generic may be canceled at any time pursuant to § 14(c). That section
also allows cancellation of an incontestable mark at any time if it has been
abandoned, if it is being used to misrepresent the source of the goods or services in
connection with which it is used, or if it was obtained fraudulently or contrary to
the provisions of § 4, 15 U.S.C. § 1054, or §§ 2(a)-(c), 15 U.S.C. §§ 1052(a)-(c).

        One searches the language of the Lanham Act in vain to find any support for
the offensive/defensive distinction applied by the Court of Appeals. The statute
nowhere distinguishes between a registrant's offensive and defensive use of an
incontestable mark. On the contrary, § 33(b)'s declaration that the registrant has an
"exclusive right" to use the mark indicates that incontestable status may be used to
enjoin infringement by others. A conclusion that such infringement cannot be
enjoined renders meaningless the "exclusive right" recognized by the statute.
Moreover, the language in three of the defenses enumerated in § 33(b) clearly
contemplates the use of incontestability in infringement actions by plaintiffs. See §§
33(b)(4)-(6), 15 U.S.C. §§ 1115(b)(4)-(6).

          "(3) That the registered mark is being used, by or with the permission of the registrant or a person in
privity with the registrant, so as to misrepresent the source of the goods or services in connection with which
the mark is used; or

          "(4) That the use of the name, term, or device charged to be an infringement is a use, otherwise than
as a trade or service mark, of the party's individual name in his own business, or of the individual name of
anyone in privity with such party, or of a term or device which is descriptive of and used fairly and in good
faith only to describe to users the goods or services of such party, or their geographic origin; or

          "(5) That the mark whose use by a party is charged as an infringement was adopted without
knowledge of the registrant's prior use and has been continuously used by such party or those in privity with
him from a date prior to registration of the mark under this chapter or publication of the registered mark
under subsection (c) of section 1062 of this title: Provided, however, That this defense or defect shall apply
only for the area in which such continuous prior use is proved; or

          "(6) That the mark whose use is charged as an infringement was registered and used prior to the
registration under this chapter or publication under subsection (c) of section 1062 of this title of the
registered mark of the registrant, and not abandoned: Provided, however, That this defense or defect shall
apply only for the area in which the mark was used prior to such registration or such publication of the
registrant's mark; or

          "(7) That the mark has been or is being used to violate the antitrust laws of the United States."

                                                    279
        The language of the Lanham Act also refutes any conclusion that an
incontestable mark may be challenged as merely descriptive. A mark that is merely
descriptive of an applicant's goods or services is not registrable unless the mark has
secondary meaning. Before a mark achieves incontestable status, registration
provides prima facie evidence of the registrant's exclusive right to use the mark in
commerce. § 33(a), 15 U.S.C. § 1115(a). The Lanham Act expressly provides that
before a mark becomes incontestable an opposing party may prove any legal or
equitable defense which might have been asserted if the mark had not been
registered. Thus, § 33(a) would have allowed respondent to challenge petitioner's
mark as merely descriptive if the mark had not become incontestable. With respect
to incontestable marks, however, § 33(b) provides that registration is conclusive
evidence of the registrant's exclusive right to use the mark, subject to the conditions
of § 15 and the seven defenses enumerated in § 33(b) itself. Mere descriptiveness is
not recognized by either § 15 or § 33(b) as a basis for challenging an incontestable
mark.

        The statutory provisions that prohibit registration of a merely descriptive
mark but do not allow an incontestable mark to be challenged on this ground
cannot be attributed to inadvertence by Congress. The Conference Committee
rejected an amendment that would have denied registration to any descriptive mark,
and instead retained the provisions allowing registration of a merely descriptive
mark that has acquired secondary meaning. See H.R.Conf.Rep. No. 2322, 79th
Cong., 2d Sess., 4 (1946) (explanatory statement of House managers). The
Conference Committee agreed to an amendment providing that no incontestable
right can be acquired in a mark that is a common descriptive, i.e., generic, term. Id.,
at 5. Congress could easily have denied incontestability to merely descriptive marks
as well as to generic marks had that been its intention.

        The Court of Appeals in discussing the offensive/defensive distinction
observed that incontestability protects a registrant against cancellation of his mark.
This observation is incorrect with respect to marks that become generic or which
otherwise may be canceled at any time pursuant to §§ 14(c) and (e). Moreover, as
applied to marks that are merely descriptive, the approach of the Court of Appeals
makes incontestable status superfluous. Without regard to its incontestable status, a
mark that has been registered five years is protected from cancellation except on the
grounds stated in §§ 14(c) and (e). Pursuant to § 14, a mark may be canceled on the
grounds that it is merely descriptive only if the petition to cancel is filed within five
years of the date of registration. § 14(a), 15 U.S.C. § 1064(a). The approach
adopted by the Court of Appeals implies that incontestability adds nothing to the
protections against cancellation already provided in § 14. The decision below not
only lacks support in the words of the statute; it effectively emasculates § 33(b)
under the circumstances of this case.

        Nothing in the legislative history of the Lanham Act supports a departure
from the plain language of the statutory provisions concerning incontestability.
Indeed, a conclusion that incontestable status can provide the basis for enforcement
of the registrant's exclusive right to use a trade or service mark promotes the goals of
the statute. The Lanham Act provides national protection of trademarks in order to
secure to the owner of the mark the goodwill of his business and to protect the
ability of consumers to distinguish among competing producers. See S.Rep. No.
1333, at 3, 5. National protection of trademarks is desirable, Congress concluded,
because trademarks foster competition and the maintenance of quality by securing
to the producer the benefits of good reputation. Id., at 4. The incontestability
provisions, as the proponents of the Lanham Act emphasized, provide a means for
the registrant to quiet title in the ownership of his mark. See Hearings on H.R. 82
before the Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Patents, 78th Cong., 2d
Sess., 21 (1944) (remarks of Rep. Lanham); id., at 21, 113 (testimony of Daphne
Robert, ABA Committee on Trade Mark Legislation); Hearings on H.R. 102 et al.
before the Subcommittee on Trade-Marks of the House Committee on Patents,
77th Cong., 1st Sess., 73 (1941) (remarks of Rep. Lanham). The opportunity to
obtain incontestable status by satisfying the requirements of § 15 thus encourages
producers to cultivate the goodwill associated with a particular mark. This function
of the incontestability provisions would be utterly frustrated if the holder of an
incontestable mark could not enjoin infringement by others so long as they
established that the mark would not be registrable but for its incontestable status.
        Respondent argues, however, that enforcing petitioner's mark would conflict
with the goals of the Lanham Act because the mark is merely descriptive and should
never have been registered in the first place. Representative Lanham, respondent
notes, explained that the defenses enumerated in § 33(b) were "not intended to
enlarge, restrict, amend, or modify the substantive law of trademarks either as set
out in other sections of the act or as heretofore applied by the courts under prior
laws." 92 Cong.Rec. 7524 (1946). Respondent reasons that because the Lanham Act
did not alter the substantive law of trademarks, the incontestability provisions
cannot protect petitioner's use of the mark if it were not originally registrable.
Moreover, inasmuch as petitioner's mark is merely descriptive, respondent contends
that enjoining others from using the mark will not encourage competition by
assisting consumers in their ability to distinguish among competing producers.
        These arguments are unpersuasive. Representative Lanham's remarks, if read
in context, clearly refer to the effect of the defenses enumerated in § 33(b).6 There is

          6 Representative Lanham made his remarks to clarify that the seven defenses enumerated in § 33(b)

are not substantive rules of law which go to the validity or enforceability of an incontestable mark. 92

                                                    281
no question that the Lanham Act altered existing law concerning trademark rights
in several respects. For example, § 22, 15 U.S.C. § 1072, provides for constructive
notice of registration and modifies the common-law rule that allowed acquisition of
concurrent rights by users in distinct geographic areas if the subsequent user
adopted the mark without knowledge of prior use. See Hanover Star Milling Co. v.
Metcalf, 240 U.S. 403, 415-416 (1916) (describing pre-Lanham Act law). Similarly, §
14 cuts off certain grounds for cancellation five years after registration and thereby
modifies the previous rule that the validity of a trademark could be attacked at any
time. See White House Milk Products Co. v. Dwinell-Wright Co., 27 C.C.P.A.(Pat.)
1194, 111 F.2d 490 (1940). Most significantly, Representative Lanham himself
observed that incontestability was one of "the valuable new rights created by the
act." 92 Cong.Rec. 7524 (1946).

        Respondent's argument that enforcing petitioner's mark will not promote
the goals of the Lanham Act is misdirected. Arguments similar to those now urged
by respondent were in fact considered by Congress in hearings on the Lanham Act.
For example, the United States Department of Justice opposed the incontestability
provisions and expressly noted that a merely descriptive mark might become
incontestable. Hearings on H.R. 82, at 59-60 (statement of the U.S. Dept. of
Justice). This result, the Department of Justice observed, would "go beyond existing
law in conferring unprecedented rights on trade-mark owners," and would
undesirably create an exclusive right to use language that is descriptive of a product.
Id., at 60; see also Hearings on H.R. 102, at 106-107, 109-110 (testimony of Prof.
Milton Handler); id., at 107, 175 (testimony of attorney Louis Robertson). These
concerns were answered by proponents of the Lanham Act, who noted that a merely
descriptive mark cannot be registered unless the Commissioner finds that it has
secondary meaning. Id., at 108, 113 (testimony of Karl Pohl, U.S. Trade Mark
Assn.). Moreover, a mark can be challenged for five years prior to its attaining
incontestable status. Id., at 114 (remarks of Rep. Lanham). The supporters of the
incontestability provisions further observed that a generic mark cannot become
incontestable and that § 33(b)(4) allows the nontrademark use of descriptive terms
used in an incontestable mark. Id., at 110-111 (testimony of Wallace Martin,
chairman, ABA Committee on Trade Mark Legislation).

Cong.Rec. 7524 (1946). Instead, the defenses affect the evidentiary status of registration where the owner

claims the benefit of a mark's incontestable status. If one of the defenses is established, registration

constitutes only prima facie and not conclusive evidence of the owner's right to exclusive use of the mark.

Ibid. See also H.R.Conf.Rep. No. 2322, 79th Cong., 2d Sess., 6 (1946) (explanatory statement of House

managers).

                                                    282
        The alternative of refusing to provide incontestable status for descriptive
marks with secondary meaning was expressly noted in the hearings on the Lanham
Act. Id., at 64, 69 (testimony of Robert Byerley, New York Patent Law Assn.);
Hearings on S. 895 before the Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Patents,
77th Cong., 2d Sess., 42 (1942) (testimony of Elliot Moyer, Special Assistant to the
Attorney General). Also mentioned was the possibility of including as a defense to
infringement of an incontestable mark the "fact that a mark is a descriptive, generic,
or geographical term or device." Id., at 45, 47. Congress, however, did not adopt
either of these alternatives. Instead, Congress expressly provided in §§ 33(b) and 15
that an incontestable mark could be challenged on specified grounds, and the
grounds identified by Congress do not include mere descriptiveness.

        The dissent echoes arguments made by opponents of the Lanham Act that
the incontestable status of a descriptive mark might take from the public domain
language that is merely descriptive. As we have explained, Congress has already
addressed concerns to prevent the "commercial monopolization," of descriptive
language. The Lanham Act allows a mark to be challenged at any time if it becomes
generic, and, under certain circumstances, permits the nontrademark use of
descriptive terms contained in an incontestable mark. Finally, if "monopolization"
of an incontestable mark threatens economic competition, § 33(b)(7), 15 U.S.C. §
1115(b)(7), provides a defense on the grounds that the mark is being used to violate
federal antitrust laws. At bottom, the dissent simply disagrees with the balance
struck by Congress in determining the protection to be given to incontestable
marks.

                                                IV
        Respondent argues that the decision by the Court of Appeals should be
upheld because trademark registrations are issued by the Patent Office after an ex
parte proceeding and generally without inquiry into the merits of an application.
This argument also unravels upon close examination. The facts of this case belie the
suggestion that registration is virtually automatic. The Patent Office initially denied
petitioner's application because the examiner considered the mark to be merely
descriptive. Petitioner sought reconsideration and successfully persuaded the Patent
Office that its mark was registrable.
        More generally, respondent is simply wrong to suggest that third parties do
not have an opportunity to challenge applications for trademark registration. If the
Patent Office examiner determines that an applicant appears to be entitled to
registration, the mark is published in the Official Gazette. § 12(a), 15 U.S.C. §
1062(a). Within 30 days of publication, any person who believes that he would be
damaged by registration of the mark may file an opposition. § 13, 15 U.S.C. §
1063. Registration of a mark provides constructive notice throughout the United
States of the registrant's claim to ownership. § 22, 15 U.S.C. § 1072. Within five

                                                    283
years of registration, any person who believes that he is or will be damaged by
registration may seek to cancel a mark. § 14(a), 15 U.S.C. § 1064(a). A mark may be
canceled at any time for certain specified grounds, including that it was obtained
fraudulently or has become generic. § 14(c), 15 U.S.C. § 1064(c).

        The Lanham Act, as the dissent notes, authorizes courts to grant injunctions
"according to principles of equity." § 34, 15 U.S.C. § 1116. Neither respondent nor
the opinion of the Court of Appeals relies on this provision to support the holding
below. Whatever the precise boundaries of the courts' equitable power, we do not
believe that it encompasses a substantive challenge to the validity of an
incontestable mark on the grounds that it lacks secondary meaning. To conclude
otherwise would expand the meaning of "equity" to the point of vitiating the more
specific provisions of the Lanham Act.7 Similarly, the power of the courts to cancel
registrations and "to otherwise rectify the register," § 37, 15 U.S.C. § 1119, must be
subject to the specific provisions concerning incontestability. In effect, both
respondent and the dissent argue that these provisions offer insufficient protection
against improper registration of a merely descriptive mark, and therefore the validity
of petitioner's mark may be challenged notwithstanding its incontestable status.
Our responsibility, however, is not to evaluate the wisdom of the legislative
determinations reflected in the statute, but instead to construe and apply the
provisions that Congress enacted. . . . .

        We conclude that the holder of a registered mark may rely on
incontestability to enjoin infringement and that such an action may not be
defended on the grounds that the mark is merely descriptive. Respondent urges that
we nevertheless affirm the decision below based on the "prior use" defense
recognized by § 33(b)(5) of the Lanham Act. Alternatively, respondent argues that
there is no likelihood of confusion and therefore no infringement justifying
injunctive relief. The District Court rejected each of these arguments, but they were
not addressed by the Court of Appeals. 718 F.2d, at 331-332, n. 4. That court may
consider them on remand. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and
the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

        It is so ordered.

         [The dissenting opinion of Justice Stevens is omitted].

          7 We note, however, that we need not address in this case whether traditional equitable defenses
such as estoppel or laches are available in an action to enforce an incontestable mark. See generally

        Defenses. Section 33(b)'s list of defenses to incontestable trademarks
reprinted in the opinion has since changed. As discussed in the unit on
functionality, Congress did not initially include functionality. The produced a split
in opinions as to whether the defense nonetheless existed with respect to functional
marks. Congress amended the Lanham Act to clarify the matter, and functionality is
now listed at section 33(b)(8) (15 U.S.C. § 1115(b)(8)). The current statute likewise
includes equitable defenses (the issue noted by the Court in note 7 of the opinion).
15 U.S.C. § 1115(b)(9).

        Dissent. Justice Stevens dissented in Park 'N Fly. What do you think his
argument was? Does Congress's and the courts' treatment of functionality give you a
hint? Do different arguments apply to descriptiveness and functionality bars for
purposes of incontestability?

         What is registration for? What is the point of a registration system? Is it merely
to give the world notice of trademark claims? Or should a registration affect the
scope of the registrant's trademark rights? Suppose, for example, that one registers a
mark for use on products within a particular class of goods. Should that prevent
future infringement claims against trademarks used on products in a different class of
goods? What are the tradeoffs of using practice before the PTO to draw substantive
lines around the trademark right versus deferring such questions to future
trademark infringement litigation? Rebecca Tushnet writes:

        Applicants and the PTO spend much time and effort crafting the equivalent
        of an exquisitely detailed origami crane: a precisely delineated valid mark.
        Rather than considering the details, courts then ask the equivalent of "is this
        paper folded?" by according presumptive validity to what the mark, at first
        glance, appears to be. Not only is this process a waste of resources, but it also
        leads courts to misunderstand the proper scope of a registration.

        There are reasons to make registration procedural, which would mean that
        registration wouldn't affect the scope of rights but only offered procedural
        advantages such as presumptions and burdens of proof. There are also
        reasons to make registration substantive, which would mean treating a
        registration as having created rights that can be used to manage relationships
        between businesses regardless of consumer confusion or nonconfusion.
        None of the tensions in current law can be entirely resolved to favor only

                                                    285
        one side of the procedural/substantive divide. But by understanding their
        relationship, we may be able to improve the system.
        Courts and the PTO both have their strengths and weaknesses: just as
        registration and unfair competition protection for unregistered marks have
        functions, ex ante and ex post analysis both have a place in the inquiry. More
        comparative thought can improve the essentially random back-and-forth
        between the largely judicial approach to registration as procedural and the
        largely administrative approach to registration as substantive.

13. Trademark Use and Infringement

Defendant trademark use as a condition of infringement

        We now turn to trademark infringement. Our first topic concerns the kinds
of acts that create potential liability. The Lanham Act's infringement causes of
action require that the defendant's use of infringing matter be "in commerce."
What does that mean? Use as a trademark? "Use in commerce" as defined by
section 45? Any use that Congress may reach under the Commerce Clause?
Something else? Are there uses of a plaintiff's trademark that create a likelihood of
confusion but nonetheless fall outside of the statute?

                               Section 32 (15 U.S.C. § 1114):

        [Provides a civil action against any person using] in commerce any
reproduction, counterfeit, copy, or colorable imitation of a registered mark in
connection with the sale, offering for sale, distribution, or advertising of any goods
or services on or in connection with which such use is likely to cause confusion, or
to cause mistake, or to deceive . . .

                            Section 43(a) (15 U.S.C. § 1125(a)):

        [Provides a civil action against any person] who, on or in connection with
any goods or services, or any container for goods, uses in commerce any word, term,
name, symbol, or device [that is] likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to
deceive as to the affiliation, connection, or association of such person with another
person, or as to the origin, sponsorship, or approval of his or her goods, services, or
commercial activities by another person[.]

                               Section 45 (15 U.S.C. § 1127):

        In the construction of this chapter, unless the contrary is plainly apparent
from the context . . . .

        The term "use in commerce" means the bona fide use of a mark in the
ordinary course of trade, and not made merely to reserve a right in a mark. For
purposes of this chapter, a mark shall be deemed to be in use in commerce--

        (1) on goods when--
        (A) it is placed in any manner on the goods or their containers or the
displays associated therewith or on the tags or labels affixed thereto, or if the nature

                                                    287
of the goods makes such placement impracticable, then on documents associated
with the goods or their sale, and

        (B) the goods are sold or transported in commerce, and
        (2) on services when it is used or displayed in the sale or advertising of
services and the services are rendered in commerce, or the services are rendered in
more than one State or in the United States and a foreign country and the person
rendering the services is engaged in commerce in connection with the services.

                         Section 33(b)(4) (15 U.S.C. § 1115(b)(4)):

        [Provides a defense to a claim of infringement of an incontestable mark
where the:] use of the name, term, or device charged to be an infringement is a use,
otherwise than as a mark, of the party's individual name in his own business, or of
the individual name of anyone in privity with such party, or of a term or device
which is descriptive of and used fairly and in good faith only to describe the goods
or services of such party, or their geographic origin;

            Rescuecom Corp. v. Google Inc., 562 F.3d 123 (2d Cir. 2009)

LEVAL, Circuit Judge:
        . . . . Rescuecom is a national computer service franchising company that

offers on-site computer services and sales. Rescuecom conducts a substantial
amount of business over the Internet . . . . Since 1998, "Rescuecom" has been a
registered federal trademark, and there is no dispute as to its validity.

        . . . . [Google's search engine responds to search requests] in two ways. First,
Google provides a list of links to websites, ordered in what Google deems to be of
descending relevance to the user's search terms based on its proprietary algorithms.
Google's search engine assists the public not only in obtaining information about a
provider, but also in purchasing products and services. If a prospective purchaser,
looking for goods or services of a particular provider, enters the provider's
trademark as a search term on Google's website and clicks to activate a search,
within seconds, the Google search engine will provide on the searcher's computer
screen a link to the webpage maintained by that provider (as well as a host of other
links to sites that Google's program determines to be relevant to the search term
entered)....

        The second way Google responds to a search request is by showing context-
based advertising. When a searcher uses Google's search engine by submitting a
search term, Google may place advertisements on the user's screen. Google will do
so if an advertiser, having determined that its ad is likely to be of interest to a
searcher who enters the particular term, has purchased from Google the placement
of its ad on the screen of the searcher who entered that search term. What Google

                                                    288
places on the searcher's screen is more than simply an advertisement. It is also a link
to the advertiser's website .... Google uses at least two programs to offer such
context-based links: AdWords and Keyword Suggestion Tool.

        AdWords is Google's program through which advertisers purchase terms (or
keywords). When entered as a search term, the keyword triggers the appearance of
the advertiser's ad and link. An advertiser's purchase of a particular term causes the
advertiser's ad and link to be displayed on the user's screen whenever a searcher
launches a Google search based on the purchased search term. Advertisers pay
Google based on the number of times Internet users "click" on the advertisement,
so as to link to the advertiser's website. For example, using Google's AdWords,
Company Y, a company engaged in the business of furnace repair, can cause Google
to display its advertisement and link whenever a user of Google launches a search
based on the search term, "furnace repair." Company Y can also cause its ad and
link to appear whenever a user searches for the term "Company X," a competitor of
Company Y in the furnace repair business. Thus, whenever a searcher interested in
purchasing furnace repair services from Company X launches a search of the term X
(Company X's trademark), an ad and link would appear on the searcher's screen,
inviting the searcher to the furnace repair services of X's competitor, Company Y.
And if the searcher clicked on Company Y's link, Company Y's website would open
on the searcher's screen, and the searcher might be able to order or purchase
Company Y's furnace repair services.

        In addition to AdWords, Google also employs Keyword Suggestion Tool, a
program that recommends keywords to advertisers to be purchased. The program is
designed to improve the effectiveness of advertising by helping advertisers identify
keywords related to their area of commerce, resulting in the placement of their ads
before users who are likely to be responsive to it. Thus, continuing the example
given above, if Company Y employed Google's Keyword Suggestion Tool, the Tool
might suggest to Company Y that it purchase not only the term "furnace repair" but
also the term "X," its competitor's brand name and trademark, so that Y's ad would
appear on the screen of a searcher who searched Company X's trademark, seeking
Company X's website.

        Once an advertiser buys a particular keyword, Google links the keyword to
that advertiser's advertisement. The advertisements consist of a combination of
content and a link to the advertiser's webpage. Google displays these advertisements
on the search result page either in the right margin or in a horizontal band
immediately above the column of relevance-based search results. These
advertisements are generally associated with a label, which says "sponsored link."
Rescuecom alleges, however, that a user might easily be misled to believe that the
advertisements which appear on the screen are in fact part of the relevance-based
search result and that the appearance of a competitor's ad and link in response to a

                                                    289
searcher's search for Rescuecom is likely to cause trademark confusion as to
affiliation, origin, sponsorship, or approval of service. This can occur, according to
the Complaint, because Google fails to label the ads in a manner which would
clearly identify them as purchased ads rather than search results. The Complaint
alleges that when the sponsored links appear in a horizontal bar at the top of the
search results, they may appear to the searcher to be the first, and therefore the
most relevant, entries responding to the search, as opposed to paid
advertisements. . . .

        . . . . Rescuecom's competitors, some responding to Google's
recommendation, have purchased Rescuecom's trademark as a keyword in Google's
AdWords program, so that whenever a user launches a search for the term
"Rescuecom," seeking to be connected to Rescuecom's website, the competitors'
advertisement and link will appear on the searcher's screen. This practice allegedly
allows Rescuecom's competitors to deceive and divert users searching for
Rescuecom's website. According to Rescuecom's allegations, when a Google user
launches a search for the term "Rescuecom" because the searcher wishes to purchase
Rescuecom's services, links to websites of its competitors will appear on the
searcher's screen in a manner likely to cause the searcher to believe mistakenly that
a competitor's advertisement (and website link) is sponsored by, endorsed by,
approved by, or affiliated with Rescuecom.

        The District Court granted Google's 12(b)(6) motion and dismissed
Rescuecom's claims. . . . The district court explained its decision saying that even if
Google employed Rescuecom's mark in a manner likely to cause confusion or
deceive searchers into believing that competitors are affiliated with Rescuecom and
its mark, so that they believe the services of Rescuecom's competitors are those of
Rescuecom, Google's actions are not a "use in commerce" under the Lanham Act
because the competitor's advertisements triggered by Google's programs did not
exhibit Rescuecom's trademark. . . .

                                         DISCUSSION
. . . .
I. Google's Use of Rescuecom's Mark Was a "Use in Commerce"

         Our court ruled in 1-800 that a complaint fails to state a claim under the
Lanham Act unless it alleges that the defendant has made "use in commerce" of the
plaintiff's trademark as the term "use in commerce" is defined in 15 U.S.C. § 1127.
The district court believed that this case was on all fours with 1-800, and that its
dismissal was required for the same reasons as given in 1-800. We believe the cases
are materially different. The allegations of Rescuecom's complaint adequately plead
a use in commerce.

        In 1-800, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant infringed the plaintiff's
trademark through its proprietary software, which the defendant freely distributed

                                                    290
to computer users who would download and install the program on their computer.
The program provided contextually relevant advertising to the user by generating
pop-up advertisements to the user depending on the website or search term the user
entered in his browser. For example, if a user typed "eye care" into his browser, the
defendant's program would randomly display a pop-up advertisement of a company
engaged in the field of eye care. Similarly, if the searcher launched a search for a
particular company engaged in eye care, the defendant's program would display the
pop-up ad of a company associated with eye care. The pop-up ad appeared in a
separate browser window from the website the user accessed, and the defendant's
brand was displayed in the window frame surrounding the ad, so that there was no
confusion as to the nature of the pop-up as an advertisement, nor as to the fact that
the defendant, not the trademark owner, was responsible for displaying the ad, in
response to the particular term searched.

        Sections 32 and 43 of the Act, which we also refer to by their codified
designations, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1114 & 1125, inter alia, impose liability for unpermitted
"use in commerce" of another's mark which is "likely to cause confusion, or to
cause mistake, or to deceive," § 1114, "as to the affiliation ... or as to the origin,
sponsorship or approval of his or her goods [or] services ... by another person." §
1125(a)(1)(A). The 1-800 opinion looked to the definition of the term "use in
commerce" provided in § 45 of the Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1127. That definition provides
in part that "a mark shall be deemed to be in use in commerce ... (2) on services
when it is used or displayed in the sale or advertising of services and the services are
rendered in commerce." 15 U.S.C. § 1127. Our court found that the plaintiff failed
to show that the defendant made a "use in commerce" of the plaintiff's mark,
within that definition.

        At the outset, we note two significant aspects of our holding in 1-800, which
distinguish it from the present case. A key element of our court's decision in 1-800
was that under the plaintiff's allegations, the defendant did not use, reproduce, or
display the plaintiff's mark at all. The search term that was alleged to trigger the pop-
up ad was the plaintiff's website address. 1-800 noted, notwithstanding the similarities
between the website address and the mark, that the website address was not used or
claimed by the plaintiff as a trademark. Thus, the transactions alleged to be
infringing were not transactions involving use of the plaintiff's trademark. 1-800
suggested in dictum that is highly relevant to our case that had the defendant used
the plaintiff's trademark as the trigger to pop-up an advertisement, such conduct
might, depending on other elements, have been actionable.

        Second, as an alternate basis for its decision, 1-800 explained why the
defendant's program, which might randomly trigger pop-up advertisements upon a
searcher's input of the plaintiff's website address, did not constitute a "use in
commerce," as defined in § 1127. In explaining why the plaintiff's mark was not

                                                    291
"used or displayed in the sale or advertising of services," 1-800 pointed out that,
under the defendant's program, advertisers could not request or purchase keywords
to trigger their ads. . . . The display of a particular advertisement was controlled by
the category associated with the website or keyword, rather than the website or
keyword itself. . . . To the extent that an advertisement for a competitor of the
plaintiff was displayed when a user opened the plaintiff's website, the trigger to
display the ad was not based on the defendant's sale or recommendation of a
particular trademark.

        The present case contrasts starkly with those important aspects of the 1-800
decision. First, in contrast to 1-800, where we emphasized that the defendant made
no use whatsoever of the plaintiff's trademark, here what Google is recommending
and selling to its advertisers is Rescuecom's trademark. Second, in contrast with the
facts of 1-800 where the defendant did not "use or display," much less sell,
trademarks as search terms to its advertisers, here Google displays, offers, and sells
Rescuecom's mark to Google's advertising customers when selling its advertising
services. In addition, Google encourages the purchase of Rescuecom's mark through
its Keyword Suggestion Tool. Google's utilization of Rescuecom's mark fits literally
within the terms specified by 15 U.S.C. § 1127. According to the Complaint,
Google uses and sells Rescuecom's mark "in the sale ... of [Google's advertising]
services ... rendered in commerce." § 1127.

        Google, supported by amici, argues that 1-800 suggests that the inclusion of a
trademark in an internal computer directory cannot constitute trademark use.
Several district court decisions in this Circuit appear to have reached this
conclusion. This over-reads the 1-800 decision. First, regardless of whether Google's
use of Rescuecom's mark in its internal search algorithm could constitute an
actionable trademark use, Google's recommendation and sale of Rescuecom's mark
to its advertising customers are not internal uses. Furthermore, 1-800 did not imply
that use of a trademark in a software program's internal directory precludes a
finding of trademark use. Rather, influenced by the fact that the defendant was not
using the plaintiff's trademark at all, much less using it as the basis of a commercial
transaction, the court asserted that the particular use before it did not constitute a
use in commerce. We did not imply in 1-800 that an alleged infringer's use of a
trademark in an internal software program insulates the alleged infringer from a
charge of infringement, no matter how likely the use is to cause confusion in the
marketplace. If we were to adopt Google and its amici's argument, the operators of
search engines would be free to use trademarks in ways designed to deceive and

                                                    292
cause consumer confusion.4 This is surely neither within the intention nor the letter
of the Lanham Act.

        Google and its amici contend further that its use of the Rescuecom
trademark is no different from that of a retail vendor who uses "product placement"
to allow one vender to benefit from a competitors' name recognition. An example
of product placement occurs when a store-brand generic product is placed next to a
trademarked product to induce a customer who specifically sought out the
trademarked product to consider the typically less expensive, generic brand as an
alternative. Google's argument misses the point. From the fact that proper, non-
deceptive product placement does not result in liability under the Lanham Act, it
does not follow that the label "product placement" is a magic shield against liability,
so that even a deceptive plan of product placement designed to confuse consumers
would similarly escape liability. It is not by reason of absence of a use of a mark in
commerce that benign product placement escapes liability; it escapes liability
because it is a benign practice which does not cause a likelihood of consumer
confusion. In contrast, if a retail seller were to be paid by an off-brand purveyor to
arrange product display and delivery in such a way that customers seeking to
purchase a famous brand would receive the off-brand, believing they had gotten the
brand they were seeking, we see no reason to believe the practice would escape
liability merely because it could claim the mantle of "product placement." The
practices attributed to Google by the Complaint, which at this stage we must accept
as true, are significantly different from benign product placement that does not
violate the Act.

        Unlike the practices discussed in 1-800, the practices here attributed to
Google by Rescuecom's complaint are that Google has made use in commerce of
Rescuecom's mark. Needless to say, a defendant must do more than use another's
mark in commerce to violate the Lanham Act. The gist of a Lanham Act violation is
an unauthorized use, which "is likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to
deceive as to the affiliation, ... or as to the origin, sponsorship, or approval of ...
goods [or] services." See 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a). We have no idea whether Rescuecom
can prove that Google's use of Rescuecom's trademark in its AdWords program

          4 For example, instead of having a separate "sponsored links" or paid advertisement section, search

engines could allow advertisers to pay to appear at the top of the "relevance" list based on a user entering a

competitor's trademark--a functionality that would be highly likely to cause consumer confusion.

Alternatively, sellers of products or services could pay to have the operators of search engines automatically

divert users to their website when the users enter a competitor's trademark as a search term. Such conduct is

surely not beyond judicial review merely because it is engineered through the internal workings of a computer

program.

                                                    293
causes likelihood of confusion or mistake. Rescuecom has alleged that it does, in
that would-be purchasers (or explorers) of its services who search for its website on
Google are misleadingly directed to the ads and websites of its competitors in a
manner which leads them to believe mistakenly that these ads or websites are
sponsored by, or affiliated with Rescuecom. This is particularly so, Rescuecom
alleges, when the advertiser's link appears in a horizontal band at the top of the list
of search results in a manner which makes it appear to be the most relevant search
result and not an advertisement. What Rescuecom alleges is that by the manner of
Google's display of sponsored links of competing brands in response to a search for
Rescuecom's brand name (which fails adequately to identify the sponsored link as
an advertisement, rather than a relevant search result), Google creates a likelihood
of consumer confusion as to trademarks. If the searcher sees a different brand name
as the top entry in response to the search for "Rescuecom," the searcher is likely to
believe mistakenly that the different name which appears is affiliated with the brand
name sought in the search and will not suspect, because the fact is not adequately
signaled by Google's presentation, that this is not the most relevant response to the
search. Whether Google's actual practice is in fact benign or confusing is not for us
to judge at this time. We consider at the 12(b)(6) stage only what is alleged in the
Complaint. . . .

                                          APPENDIX
On the Meaning of "Use in Commerce" in Sections 32 and 43 of the Lanham
Act5

        In 1-800 Contacts, Inc. v. WhenU.Com, Inc., 414 F.3d 400 (2d Cir.2005) ( "1-
800"), our court followed the reasoning of two district court opinions from other
circuits, U-Haul Int'l, Inc. v. WhenU.com, Inc., 279 F.Supp.2d 723 (E.D.Va.2003) and
Wells Fargo & Co., v. WhenU.com, Inc., 293 F.Supp.2d 734 (E.D.Mich.2003), which
dismissed suits on virtually identical claims against the same defendant. Those two
district courts ruled that the defendant's conduct was not actionable under §§ 32 &
43(a) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § § 1114 & 1125(a), even assuming that
conduct caused likelihood of trademark confusion, because the defendant had not
made a "use in commerce" of the plaintiff's mark, within the definition of that
phrase set forth in § 45 of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1127. In quoting
definitional language of § 1127 that is crucial to their holdings, however, U-Haul
and Wells Fargo overlooked and omitted portions of the statutory text which make

          5 In this discussion, all iterations of the phrase "use in commerce" whether in the form of a noun (a

"use in commerce"), a verb ("to use in commerce"), or adjective ("used in commerce"), are intended without

distinction as instances of that phrase.

                                                    294
clear that the definition provided in § 1127 was not intended by Congress to apply
in the manner that the decisions assumed.

        Our court's ruling in 1-800 that the Plaintiff had failed to plead a viable
claim under §§ 1114 & 1125(a) was justified by numerous good reasons and was
undoubtedly the correct result. In addition to the questionable ground derived from
the district court opinions, which had overlooked key statutory text, our court's
opinion cited other highly persuasive reasons for dismissing the action--among
them that the plaintiff did not claim a trademark in the term that served as the basis
for the claim of infringement; nor did the defendant's actions cause any likelihood
of confusion, as is crucial for such a claim.

        We proceed to explain how the district courts in U-Haul and Wells Fargo
adopted reasoning which overlooked crucial statutory text that was incompatible
with their ultimate conclusion. Section 43(a), codified at 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a),
imposes liability on "any person who, on or in connection with any goods or
services, uses in commerce any word, term, name, symbol, or device ... which--(A) is
likely to cause confusion ...." (emphasis added). Section 32, codified at 15 U.S.C. §
1114, similarly imposes liability on one who "without the consent of the registrant-
(a) use[s] in commerce any reproduction ... [or] copy ... of a registered mark ... in
connection with which such use is likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or
to deceive" (emphasis added). To determine the meaning of the phrase "uses in
commerce," which appears in both sections, the U-Haul and Wells Fargo courts quite
understandably looked to the definition of the term "use in commerce," set forth
among the Act's definitions in § 45, codified at 15 U.S.C. § 1127. That definition,
insofar as quoted by the courts, stated, with respect to services, that a mark shall be
deemed to be "used in commerce only when it is used or displayed in the sale or
advertising of services and the services are rendered in commerce." Wells Fargo, 293
F.Supp.2d at 757 (internal quotations omitted); U-Haul, 279 F.Supp.2d at 727
(specifying a similar requirement with respect to goods). Adhering to this portion of
the definition, and determining that on the particular facts of the case, the
defendant had not used or displayed a mark in the sale or advertising of services,
those courts concluded that the defendant's conduct was not within the scope of
the Act.

        In quoting the § 1127 definition, however, those district courts overlooked
and omitted two portions of the statutory text, which we believe make clear that the
definition provided in § 1127 is not intended to apply to §§ 1114 & 1125(a). First,
those courts, no doubt reasonably, assumed that the definition of "use in
commerce" set forth in § 1127 necessarily applies to all usages of that term
throughout the Act. This was, however, not quite accurate. Section 1127 does not
state flatly that the defined terms have the assigned meanings when used in the
statute. The definition is more guarded and tentative. It states rather that the terms

                                                    295
listed shall have the given meanings "unless the contrary is plainly apparent from
the context."

        The second part of § 1127 which those courts overlooked was the opening
phrase of the definition of "use in commerce," which makes it "plainly apparent
from the context" that the full definition set forth in § 1127 cannot apply to the
infringement sections. The definition in § 1127 begins by saying, "The term `use in
commerce' means the bona fide use of a mark in the ordinary course of trade, and
not made merely to reserve a right in a mark." 15 U.S.C. § 1127 (emphasis added).
The requirement that a use be a bona fide use in the ordinary course of trade in
order to be considered a "use in commerce" makes clear that the particular
definition was not intended as a limitation on conduct of an accused infringer that
might cause liability. If § 1127's definition is applied to the definition of conduct
giving rise to liability in §§ 1114 and 1125, this would mean that an accused
infringer would escape liability, notwithstanding deliberate deception, precisely
because he acted in bad faith. A bad faith infringer would not have made a use in
commerce, and therefore a necessary element of liability would be lacking. Liability
would fall only on those defendants who acted in good faith. We think it
inconceivable that the statute could have intended to exempt infringers from
liability because they acted in bad faith. Such an interpretation of the statute makes
no sense whatsoever. It must be that Congress intended § 1127's definition of "use
in commerce" to apply to other iterations of the term "use in commerce," (as we
explore below) and not to the specification of conduct by an alleged infringer which
causes imposition of liability.6

        A more detailed examination of the construction of the Lanham Act, and its
historical evolution, demonstrates how this unlikely circumstance came to be. The
Act employs the term "use in commerce" in two very different contexts. The first
context sets the standards and circumstances under which the owner of a mark can
qualify to register the mark and to receive the benefits and protection provided by the
Act. For example, 15 U.S.C. § 1051 provides that "[t]he owner of a trademark used
in commerce may request registration of its trademark on the principal register,"
thereby receiving the benefits of enhanced protection (emphasis added).7 This part

          6 The Wells Fargo decision, which followed and cited U-Haul, unlike U-Haul, did quote the part of §

1127 which requires a "bona fide use of a mark in the ordinary course of trade," 293 F.Supp.2d at 758, but

failed to note the incompatibility of that requirement with a section defining prohibited actionable conduct.

          7 In addition to § 1051, a non-exhaustive list of other sections that employ the term "use in

commerce" in the same general way, in defining what is necessary to secure the benefits of the Act, include §

1065 (incontestability of a mark); § 1058 (renewal of a mark), § 1091 (eligibility for the supplemental

                                                    296
of the statute describes the conduct which the statute seeks to encourage, reward,
and protect. The second context in which the term "use in commerce" appears is at
the opposite pole. As exemplified in §§ 1114 & 1125(a), the term "use in
commerce," as quoted above, also appears as part of the Act's definition of
reprehensible conduct, i.e., the conduct which the Act identifies as infringing of the
rights of the trademark owner, and for which it imposes liability.

        When one considers the entire definition of "use in commerce" set forth in
§ 1127, it becomes plainly apparent that this definition was intended to apply to the
Act's use of that term in defining favored conduct, which qualifies to receive the
protection of the Act. The definition makes perfect sense in this context. In order to
qualify to register one's mark and receive the enhanced protections that flow from
registration (giving the world notice of one's exclusive rights in the mark), the owner
must have made "bona fide use of the mark in the ordinary course of trade, and not
merely to reserve a right in the mark." Id. § 1127. The bona fide "use" envisioned is,
with respect to "goods, when [the mark] is placed in any manner on the goods or
their containers or the displays associated therewith or on the tags or labels affixed
thereto ..., and the goods are sold or transported in commerce; and on services
when [the mark] is used or displayed in the sale or advertising of services ...
rendered in commerce." Id. This definition sensibly insures that one who in good
faith places his mark on goods or services in commerce qualifies for the Act's
protection. In contrast, it would make no sense whatsoever for Congress to have
insisted, in relation to § 1114 for example, that one who "without the consent of
the registrant ... use[d] ... [a] counterfeit ... of a registered mark in connection with
the sale ... of ... goods [thereby] caus[ing] confusion" will be liable to the registrant
only if his use of the counterfeit was a "bona fide use of [the] mark in the ordinary
course of trade." Id. §§ 1114 & 1127. Such a statute would perversely penalize only
the fools while protecting the knaves, which was surely not what Congress intended.

        The question then arises how it came to pass that the sections of the statute
identifying conduct giving rise to liability included the phrase "use in commerce" as
an essential element of liability. This answer results in part from a rearrangement of
this complex statute, which resulted in joining together words which, as originally
written, were separated from one another. The first incidence of employment of the
phrase "use in commerce" in § 1114 occurred in 1962 as the result of a mere
"rearrangement" of sections, not intended to have substantive significance, which
brought together the jurisdiction-invoking phrase, "in commerce" with the verb
"use." Prior to the 1962 rearrangement, the term "use in commerce" appeared as an

register); § 1112 (registration of a mark in plurality of classes); and § 1062 (republication of marks registered

under acts prior to the Lanham Act).

                                                    297
essential element of a trademark owner's qualification for registration and for the
benefits of the Act, but did not appear as an essential element of a defendant's
conduct necessary for liability. The Act frequently employs the term "in commerce"
for the distinct purpose of invoking Congress's Commerce Clause jurisdiction and
staying within its limits.8 The statute also frequently employs the word "use," either
as a noun or verb, because that word so naturally and aptly describes what one does
with a trademark. Not surprisingly, in the extensive elaborate course of drafting,
revision, and rearrangement which the Act has undergone from time to time, as
explained below, the words "use" and "in commerce" came into proximity with each
other in circumstances where there was no intent to invoke the specialized
restrictive meaning given by § 1127. In 1988, when Congress enacted the present
form of § 1127's definition, which was designed to deny registration to an owner
who made merely token use of his mark, the accompanying Congressional report
made clear that the definition was understood as applying only to the requirements
of qualification for registration and other benefits of the Act, and not to conduct
causing liability. We briefly trace the history of this evolution below, to show that
the restrictive definition of "use in commerce" set forth in § 1127 never was
intended as a restriction on the types of conduct that could result in liability.
History of the Phrase "Use in Commerce" in the Lanham Act

        In 1879 in The Trade-Mark Cases, 100 U.S. 82 (1879), the Supreme Court
struck down the existing trademark statutes passed in the 1870s because the
Copyright Clause of the Constitution was not a proper basis of Congressional
authority to regulate trademarks. While ruling that the Copyright Clause did not
give Congress authority to protect trademarks, the Court specified that if Congress
wished to invoke the Commerce Clause to justify its assertion of the power to
regulate trademarks, it needed to invoke that authority "on the face of the law." Id.
at 96. Two years later, Congress enacted a statute to "authorize the registration of
trade-marks and protect the same," Act of March 3, 1881, 21 Stat. 502, which
explicitly and repeatedly invoked Congress's Commerce Clause power on "the face
of the law," using language virtually identical to the constitutional grant of power.9

          8 Section 1127 defines "commerce" to mean "all commerce which may lawfully be regulated by

Congress."

          9 For example, in specifying how a trademark owner would qualify for the benefits of federal

registration of the trademark, the statute stated, "[t]hat owners of trade-marks used in commerce with foreign

nations, or with the Indian tribes, ... may obtain registration of [ ] trademarks." Id. at 502 (emphasis added);

see also Act of February 20, 1905, 33 Stat. 724, 724 ("[T]he owner of a trademark used in commerce with

foreign nations, or among the several States, or with Indian Tribes ... may obtain [trademark] registration.").

And in specifying the conduct that would incur liability for infringement, the Act similarly prescribed that an

                                                    298
        A major revision to federal trademark law came in 1946 with the passage of
the Lanham Act. Congressman Fritz Lanham, Chairman of the Subcommittee on
Trade-Marks of the House Committee on Patents, had first introduced his bill, HR
9041, in 1938. At the time, in order to qualify to register a trademark and receive
the resulting protections, a trademark owner needed to "affix" his mark to goods in
interstate commerce. See Act of February 20, 1905, 33 Stat. 724, 724 (stating that
one of the requirements for registration is that the trademark owner must file an
application that states the "mode in which [the trademark] is applied and affixed to
goods"); see also Western Stove Co. v. Geo. D. Roper Corp., 82 F.Supp. 206, 216
(S.D.Cal.1949) (stating that to obtain a common law trademark or a trademark
under the Act of 1905, "it is clear that the trade-mark had to be affixed substantially
either to the product, or the container thereof"). The 1939 version of Lanham's bill
thus defined "affixation," stating that a "trademark shall be deemed to be affixed to
an article when it is placed in any manner in or upon either the article or its
container or display or upon tags or labels or is otherwise used in the advertisement
or sale thereof." H.R. 4744, 76th Cong. § 46 (1st Sess.1939). The version presented
in Congress two years later in 1941, H.R. 5461, instead of defining "affixation,"
introduced the less complicated, more accommodating definition of "use in
commerce" as the conduct by which an owner would qualify to register a mark. The
bill included in § 45 (which eventually became § 1127) a definition of "use[ ] in
commerce," which was similar to the definition of affixation in the prior H.R. 4744
in 1939, but more expansive, including both goods and services.

        This definition provided,

        For purposes of this Act a mark shall be deemed to be used in commerce (a)
        on goods when it is placed in any manner on the goods or their containers
        or the displays associated therewith or on the tags or labels affixed thereto
        and the goods are sold or transported in commerce and (b) on services when
        used or displayed in the sale of advertising of services in commerce.

H.R. 5461, 77th Cong. § 45 (1st Sess.1941). This text of § 45 of the 1941 bill was
eventually enacted in the 1946 version in substantially the same form, and in later
codification became the definition set forth in § 1127. It is important to note that

aggrieved party could "enjoin the wrongful use of such trade-mark used in foreign commerce or commerce

with Indian tribes." Act of March 3, 1881, 21 Stat. 502, 504; see also Act of February 20, 1905, Stat. 724,

728 ("Any person who shall, without consent of the owner thereof, reproduce, counterfeit, copy, or colorably

imitate any such trade-mark ... and shall use or shall have used, such reproduction, counterfeit, copy, or

colorable imitation in commerce among the several States, or with a foreign nation, or with the Indian tribes,

shall be liable".).

                                                    299
in the 1941 bill, in which first appeared the defined term, "used in commerce," that
term served as a requirement for registration, but the term nowhere appeared in the
language defining conduct that would constitute infringement under § 32. Section
32, which defined infringement, made reference to "commerce" but did not employ
the defined term "used in commerce."

        In the form in which the Act was eventually passed in 1946, the term "used
in commerce" continued to be a prerequisite to registration, but remained generally
absent, with one small exception, from the statutory language defining
infringement. Section 32, eventually codified as § 1114, at the time contained no
instance of the term. Section 43(a), eventually codified as § 1125(a), provided
liability for infringing conduct by "[a]ny person who shall ... cause or procure the
[trademark] to be transported or used in commerce or deliver the [trademark] to any
carrier to be transported or used." See Lanham Act, 60 Stat. 427, 441 (1946)
(emphasis added). Thus, the Act allowed the imposition of liability on any infringer
under § 32 without regard to whether he "used in commerce" the mark, and under
§ 43(a) on any infringer who "cause[d] or procure[d]" the transportation of a mark
in commerce, or who "deliver[ed a mark] to any carrier to be transported," as well as
to one who "cause[d] or procure[d]" the mark or delivered it to a carrier to be "used
in commerce." Regardless of whether the "use in commerce" language in § 43(a)
was intended to carry the definition in § 45, the Lanham Act as passed in 1946, on
any reading, did not restrict liability for infringement to those who "used in
commerce," as defined in § 45's restrictive terms. Such a "use in commerce" was
simply one of several ways to satisfy one of several elements of a cause of action
under § 43(a). By contrast, to justify imposition of liability on an infringer, the Act
required, as an element of the cause of action, that the infringer "cause the
[infringing] goods or services to enter into commerce"--a jurisdictional predicate for
Congress's power to legislate in this area. See id. Thus, on the question whether the
definition set forth in § 45 (§ 1127) should be understood as applying to, and thus
restricting, conduct causing liability, one of the leading commentators on trademark
law notes,

        The Lanham Act § 45 narrowing definition of what constitutes "use in
        commerce" is just a relaxed remnant of trademark law's once-hyper-technical
        "affixation" requirement. This statutory anachronism certainly was never
        intended to limit the scope of "uses" that would constitute infringement.

updated 2008).
The Amendment of § 1114 in 1962

                                                    300
        A confusing change in statutory diction occurred in 1962 when Congress
amended § 1114. The purpose of the amendment was to broaden liability for
infringement. Previously, the statutory requirement of confusion, mistake, or
deception applied only with respect to "purchasers as to the source of origin of such
goods or services." See 1 McCarthy § 5:6 (4th ed.1994 & updated 2008). Congress
eliminated this requirement to expand the scope of deceptive, or misleading
conduct that could constitute infringement. Id. (noting that this amendment "has
been viewed as expanding the range of actions that can constitute infringement of a
trademark by not limiting it to confusion of purchasers and not limiting it to
confusion as to the source of goods"). At the same time as making this broadening
substantive change, the 1962 amendment made structural changes to the order of
the language in § 1114. See H.R. Rep. No. 1108, 87th Cong. at 8 (1961). Previously,
§ 1114 had listed a series of actions which, when taken by "any person ... in
commerce " would cause liability. Among the liability-causing actions listed was,
under clause (a), a person's "use, without the consent of the registrant, [of] any
reproduction ...." Lanham Act, 60 Stat. 427, 437 § 32 (1946) (emphasis added).
Thus, in the pre-1962 version, the terms "use" and "in commerce" occurred in
separate clauses. One of the changes, which is not described in the House or Senate
Reports as having any substantive significance, was a rearrangement of the order of
words so that "use" and "in commerce" came to appear side by side in the amended
version, rather than in separate clauses. In its amended form, it read "[a]ny person
who shall, without the consent of the registrant (a) use in commerce any reproduction
... shall be liable in a civil action." 76 Stat. 769, 773 (1962) (emphasis added). As the
result of the rearrangement, the consolidated phrase "use in commerce" appeared
for the first time in § 1114. The House and Senate reports describe these
amendments as intended simply to "rearrang[e] the language." See H.R.Rep. No.
1108, 87th Cong. at 8 (1961); S.Rep. No. 1685, 86th Cong. 1685 at 8 (1960). The
only change to § 1114 specifically discussed in the Report was the deletion of the
phrase "purchasers as to the source of such goods or services" for the stated purpose
of broadening liability. Id. It would be unreasonable to construe mere
"rearrange[ment]" of language in § 1114 as having intended to convert the broad
liability-imposing term, "use" into a restrictive, defined term, which had previously
applied only to a trademark owner's qualification for registration of the mark--
especially when Congress made no mention beyond describing the change as a
rearrangement. See Whitman v. Am. Trucking Assoc., 531 U.S. 457, 468 (2001)
(Congress does not "hide elephants in mouseholes.").10

          10 In 1962, Congress also amended six paragraphs of § 1127's definitions of terms other than "use

in commerce," but left the "use in commerce" definition intact. See Lanham Act, 75 Stat. 769, 774 (1962).

                                                    301
The 1988 Amendment to § 1127
        If there was any doubt prior to 1988 on the question whether the narrowing

definition of "use in commerce" set forth in § 1127, was intended to apply to the
utilization of that phrase in the sections providing for the liability of infringers, the
doubt was put to rest by the Trademark Law Revision Act of 1988,11 which inserted
into § 1127 the requirement that a "use in commerce" be a "bona fide use of a
mark in the ordinary course of trade and not merely made to reserve a right in a
mark." This was part of a change intended to bring the federal trademark
registration system into harmony with the registration system of other nations, see
Pub.L. No. 100-667, 102 Stat. 3935 (Nov. 16, 1988), by providing the possibility of
reserving a trademark for intended future use. Previously, one could not establish
exclusive rights to a mark, or eligibility to register one's claim to the mark, except by
using the mark in commerce. One who had a bona fide intent to use a mark in the
future on a product not yet released into commerce could not be assured that,
during product development preceding distribution of the product under the mark,
another user might not establish a priority in the same mark. In at least one case in
this Circuit, an attempt to reserve priority in a mark by making token use during
the product development period had been found ineffective. Procter & Gamble Co. v.
Johnson & Johnson Inc., 485 F.Supp. 1185 (S.D.N.Y.1979), aff'd 636 F.2d 1203 (2d
Cir.1980). The 1988 amendment provided relief by allowing applicants to file an
intent to use application, by which they could reserve their priority in a mark for a
limited period without making use of it in commerce. Pub.L. No. 100-667, § 103.

        While these amendments provided relief in the form of effective reservation
of a mark for a time on the basis of a filing of intent to use, registration of a mark
under § 1051 continued to be limited to those who have in fact "used [the mark] in
commerce." And the definition of "use in commerce" set forth in § 1127 was
amended to require that the use be a "bona fide use ... in the ordinary course of
trade and not made merely to reserve a right in the mark." 15 U.S.C. § 1127. Those
wishing to reserve a right in the mark were provided for by the new intent-to-use
provisions. Actual registration, however, was reserved to mark owners making bona
fide use in commerce. As noted above, this definition of "use in commerce" makes
eminent good sense as a prerequisite for a mark owner to register the mark and

Despite broadening infringement liability in § 1114, Congress did not redefine "use in commerce" as

applying only to registration and protection, and not to infringement.

          11 The Trademark Law Revision Act of 1988 was enacted on November 16, 1988 and went into

effect November 16, 1989. Some courts and commentators refer to this Act as the 1988 amendment while

others refer to it as the 1989 amendment.

                                                    302
claim the benefits the Act provides to the owners of marks. It makes no conceivable
sense as a limitation shielding bad-faith abusers of the marks of others from liability
for causing trademark confusion.

        The Senate Report for the 1988 amendment confirms that the definition in
§ 1127 was meant to apply only to registering a mark rather than infringing one.
The Senate Report explained that the "revised [use in commerce] definition is
intended to apply to all aspects of the trademark registration process," and that
"[c]learly, however, use of any type will continue to be considered in an
infringement action." See S. Rep. 100-515 100th Cong. at 45 (1988) (emphasis
added). This, of course, is consistent with the Lanham Act's intent to make
actionable the deceptive and misleading use of marks in commerce--an intent which
has not changed since the Lanham Act was first enacted. See Lanham Act, 60 Stat.
427, § 45 (1946); 15 U.S.C. § 1127. According to the Senate Report, a purpose in
amending this section was to add "a reference to make clear that the section applies
only to acts or practices which occur in [or] affect commerce." See S. Rep. 100-515
100th Cong. at 41 (1988). The amendment left only one reference to commerce in
§ 1125(a), which was the "uses in commerce" language. This term was thus
employed in the 1988 revision to make clear that liability would be imposed for acts
that occur in or affect commerce, i.e. those within Congress's Commerce Clause
power. Thus, the term "uses in commerce" in the current § 1125(a) is intended to
refer to a use that falls within Congress's commerce power, and not to the restrictive
definition of "use in commerce," set forth in § 45 to define standards of
qualification for an owner to register a mark and receive the benefits and protection
of the Act.

        It therefore appears that the history of the development of the Lanham Act
confirms what is also indicated by a common-sense understanding of the provisions.
The definition of the term "use in commerce" provided by § 1127, was intended to
continue to apply, as it did when the definition was conceived in the 1941 bill, to
the sections governing qualification for registration and for the benefits of the Act.
In that version, the term "use in commerce" did not appear in § 32, which
established the elements of liability for infringing upon a federally registered mark.
The eventual appearance of that phrase in that section did not represent an
intention that the phrase carry the restrictive definition which defined an owner's
entitlement to registration. The appearance rather resulted from happenstance
pairing of the verb "use" with the term "in commerce," whose purpose is to claim
the jurisdictional authority of the Commerce Clause. Section 1127, as noted, does
not prescribe that its definitions necessarily apply throughout the Act. They apply
"unless the contrary is plainly apparent from the context."
The Interpretation of § 1127's Definition of "Use in Commerce" with Respect to Alleged
Infringers

                                                    303
        In light of the preceding discussion, how should courts today interpret the
definition of "use in commerce" set forth in 15 U.S.C. § 1127, with respect to acts
of infringement prescribed by §§ 1114 and 1125(a)? The foregoing review of the
evolution of the Act seems to us to make clear that Congress did not intend that
this definition apply to the sections of the Lanham Act which define infringing
conduct. The definition was rather intended to apply to the sections which used the
phrase in prescribing eligibility for registration and for the Act's protections.
However, Congress does not enact intentions. It enacts statutes. And the process of
enacting legislation is of such complexity that understandably the words of statutes
do not always conform perfectly to the motivating intentions. This can create for
courts difficult problems of interpretation. Because pertinent amendments were
passed in 1962 and in 1988, and because the 1988 amendment did not change the
pre-existing parts of the definition in § 1127, but merely added a sentence, it seems
useful to approach the question of the current meaning in two steps. First, what did
this definition mean between 1962 and 1988--prior to the 1988 amendment? Then,
how was the meaning changed by the 1988 amendment?

        Between 1962 and 1988, notwithstanding the likelihood shown by the
legislative history that Congress intended the definition to apply only to registration
and qualification for benefits and not to infringement, a court addressing the issue
nonetheless would probably have concluded that the section applied to alleged
infringement, as well. Section 1127 states that its definitions apply "unless the
contrary is plainly apparent from the context." One who considered the question at
the time might well have wondered why Congress would have provided this
restrictive definition for acts of trademark infringement with the consequence that
deceptive and confusing uses of another's mark with respect to goods would escape
liability if the conduct did not include the placement of the mark on goods or their
containers, displays, or sale documents, and with respect to services if the conduct
did not include the use or display of the mark in the sale or advertising of the
services. It is easy to imagine perniciously confusing conduct involving another's
mark which does not involve placement of the mark in the manner specified in the
definition. Nonetheless, in spite of those doubts, one could not have said it was
"plainly apparent from the context" that those restrictions did not apply to sections
defining infringement. In all probability, therefore, a court construing the provision
between 1962 and 1988 would have concluded that in order to be actionable under
§§ 1114 or 1125(a) the allegedly infringing conduct needed to include placement of
the mark in the manner specified in the definition of "use in commerce" in § 1127.

        The next question is how the meaning of the § 1127 definition was changed
by the 1988 amendment, which, as noted, left the preexisting language about
placement of the mark unchanged, but added a prior sentence requiring that a "use
in commerce" be "a bona fide use in the ordinary course of trade, and not made

                                                    304
merely to reserve a right in a mark." While it is "plainly apparent from the context"
that the new first sentence cannot reasonably apply to statutory sections defining
infringing conduct, the question remains whether the addition of this new sentence
changed the meaning of the second sentence of the definition without changing its
words.

        We see at least two possible answers to the question, neither of which is
entirely satisfactory. One interpretation would be that, by adding the new first
sentence, Congress changed the meaning of the second sentence of the definition to
conform to the new first sentence, without altering the words. The language of the
definition, which, prior to the addition of the new first sentence, would have been
construed to apply both to sections defining infringement, and to sections
specifying eligibility for registration, would change its meaning, despite the absence
of any change in its words, so that the entire definition now no longer applied to
the sections defining infringement. Change of meaning without change of words is
obviously problematic.

        The alternative solution would be to interpret the two sentences of the
statutory definition as of different scope. The second sentence of the definition,
which survived the 1988 amendment unchanged, would retain its prior meaning
and continue to apply as before the amendment to sections defining infringement,
as well as to sections relating to a mark owner's eligibility for registration and for
enjoyment of the protections of the Act. The new first sentence, which plainly was
not intended to apply to infringements, would apply only to sections in the latter
category--those relating to an owner's eligibility to register its mark and enjoy the
Act's protection. Under this interpretation, liability for infringement under §§ 1114
and 1125(a) would continue, as before 1988, to require a showing of the infringer's
placement of another's mark in the manner specified in the second sentence of the
§ 1127 definition. It would not require a showing that the alleged infringer made
"bona fide use of the mark in the ordinary course of trade, and not merely to
reserve a right in the mark." On the other hand, eligibility of mark owners for
registration and for the protections of the Act would depend on their showing
compliance with the requirements of both sentences of the definition.

        We recognize that neither of the two available solutions is altogether
satisfactory. Each has advantages and disadvantages. At least for this Circuit,
especially given our prior 1-800 precedent, which applied the second sentence of the
definition to infringement, the latter solution, according a different scope of
application to the two sentences of the definition, seems to be preferable.12

          12 We express no view which of the alternative available solutions would seem preferable if our

Circuit had not previously applied the second sentence to sections of the Act defining infringement.

                                                    305
        The judges of the 1-800 panel have read this Appendix and have authorized
us to state that they agree with it. At the same time we note that the discussion in
this Appendix does not affect the result of this case. We assumed in the body of the
opinion, in accordance with the holding of 1-800, that the requirements of the
second sentence of the definition of "use in commerce" in § 1127 apply to
infringing conduct and found that such use in commerce was adequately pleaded.
The discussion in this Appendix is therefore dictum and not a binding opinion of
the court. It would be helpful for Congress to study and clear up this ambiguity.

                                               Note

        Rescuecom was seen as foreclosing a strong form of a use requirement and was
expected to be a widely followed precedent. But see, e.g., Sensient Technologies
Corp. v. SensoryEffects Flavor Co., 613 F.3d 754 (8th Cir. 2010) (use of mark in
promotional materials not a use in commerce for purposes of infringement). For
debate about the merits of a "trademark use" requirement, compare, e.g., Margreth
Barrett, Internet Trademark Suits and the Demise of "Trademark Use", 39 U.C. DAVIS L.

                        Radiance Foundation, Inc. v. N.A.A.C.P.
                                 786 F.3d 316 (4th Cir. 2015)

WILKINSON, Circuit Judge:
        The Radiance Foundation published an article online entitled "NAACP:

National Association for the Abortion of Colored People" that criticized the
NAACP's stance on abortion. In response to a cease-and-desist letter from the
NAACP, Radiance sought a declaratory judgment that it had not infringed any
NAACP trademarks. The NAACP then filed counterclaims alleging trademark
infringement and dilution.

        The Lanham Act protects against consumer confusion about the source or
sponsorship of goods or services. Persons may not misappropriate trademarks to the
detriment of consumers or of the marks themselves. However, the Act's reach is not
unlimited. To find Lanham Act violations under these facts risks a different form of
infringement--that of Radiance's expressive right to comment on social issues under
the First Amendment. Courts have taken care to avoid Lanham Act interpretations
that gratuitously court grave constitutional concerns, and we shall do so here. We
hold that Radiance is not liable for trademark infringement or dilution of

                                                    306
defendant's marks by tarnishment. We vacate the injunction against Radiance
entered by the district court and remand with instructions that defendant's
counterclaims likewise be dismissed.

                                                 I.
        The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, better
known by its acronym "NAACP," is this country's "oldest and largest civil rights
organization," Radiance Found., Inc. v. NAACP, 25 F.Supp.3d 865, 872
(E.D.Va.2014), and one that holds a place of honor in our history. It champions
"political, educational, social, and economic equality of all citizens" while working
to eliminate racial and other forms of prejudice within the United States. Since its
formation, it has pursued these objectives not only through litigation but also
through community outreach, informational services, and educational activities on
issues of significance to the African American community. The NAACP owns
several trademarks, among them "NAACP" (federally registered) and "National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People."
        The Radiance Foundation, established by Ryan Bomberger, is also a non-
profit organization focused on educating and influencing the public about issues
impacting the African American community. Radiance addresses social issues from
a Christian perspective. It uses as its platform two websites,
TheRadianceFoundation.org and TooManyAborted.com, where it posts articles on
topics such as race relations, diversity, fatherlessness, and the impact of abortion on
the black community. Radiance also runs a billboard campaign for
TooManyAborted.com; individuals may sponsor these billboards, licensing the
artwork from Radiance. In addition to its billboard campaign, Radiance funds its
endeavors through donations from visitors to its websites, which are facilitated by
"Donate" buttons on the webpages that link to a PayPal site.
        In January 2013, Bomberger authored an article criticizing the NAACP's
annual Image Awards, entitled "NAACP: National Association for the Abortion of
Colored People." The piece lambasted the NAACP for sponsoring an awards event
to recognize Hollywood figures and products that Radiance alleged defied Christian
values and perpetuated racist stereotypes. The article then criticized other of the
NAACP's public stances and actions. It particularly targeted the NAACP's ties to
Planned Parenthood and its position on abortion. Though the NAACP has often
claimed to be neutral on abortion, Radiance maintains that the NAACP's actions
actually demonstrate support for the practice.
        The article appeared on three websites: the two owned by Radiance--
TheRadianceFoundation.com and TooManyAborted.com--and a third-party site
called LifeNews.com. Though the text of the article was identical across the sites,
the headlines and presentation varied slightly. On TheRadianceFoundation.com,
directly below the headline was an image of a TooManyAborted billboard with the

                                                    307
headline "NAACP: National Association for the Abortion of Colored People"
repeated next to it. The TooManyAborted.com site posted the headline "The
National Association for the Abortion of Colored People" with a graphic below of a
red box with the words "CIVIL WRONG" followed by the modified NAACP name.
Adjacent to the article on both pages was an orange button with "CLICK HERE
TO GIVE ONE-TIME GIFT TO THE RADIANCE FOUNDATION" printed
around the word "DONATE." Finally on LifeNews.com, the third-party site, the
NAACP's Scales of Justice appeared as a graphic underneath the headline....

        [After a bench trial, the district court found, among other things, that
Radiance "had used the marks "in connection with" goods and services and that its
use of the "NAACP" and "National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People" marks, or a colorable imitation, created a likelihood of confusion among
consumers."]

                                                 II.
                                                 A.
        .... The Lanham Act's provisions prohibiting trademark infringement, 15
U.S.C. §§ 1114(1) and 1125(a), exist to protect consumers from confusion in the
marketplace. Trademarks designate the source or affiliation of goods and services in
order to provide consumers with information about those goods and services,
allowing mark holders to build and benefit from the reputation of their brands.
Trademark infringement laws limit the ability of others to use trademarks or their
colorable imitations in commerce, so that consumers may rely on the marks to make
purchasing decisions.
        Trademark protection, however, comes at a potential cost to free expression.
Much like advertising regulations that prohibit using false or misleading
information, trademark infringement laws restrict speech in order to promote the
government's interest in protecting consumers from confusing misappropriations of
product identifications. However, Congress "did not intend for trademark laws to
impinge the First Amendment rights of critics and commentators." Lamparello v.
Falwell, 420 F.3d 309, 313 (4th Cir.2005). The Lanham Act and First Amendment
may be in tension at times, but they are not in conflict so long as the Act hews
faithfully to the purposes for which it was enacted. The risk of impinging on
protected speech is much greater when trademarks serve not to identify goods but
rather to obstruct the conveyance of ideas, criticism, comparison, and social
commentary. The canon of constitutional avoidance in this area is thus not a device
of judicial evasion but an effort to reconcile the commercial values protected by the
Lanham Act and the democratic value of expressive freedom.
        It is for this reason that an actionable trademark claim does not simply
require that the alleged infringer used in commerce the mark that the trademark
holder possesses. It also requires that the infringer's use be "in connection with"

                                                    308
goods or services in a manner that is "likely to cause confusion" among consumers
as to the goods' or services' source or sponsorship. 15 U.S.C. §§ 1114(1)(a) &
1125(a)(1). Use of a mark that does not satisfy these two criteria is not trademark
infringement.

                                                 B.
        The first element of trademark infringement at issue is thus whether
Radiance's use of the NAACP's marks was "in connection with the sale, offering for
sale, distribution, or advertising of any goods or services." 15 U.S.C. § 1114(1)(a);
see also id. § 1125(a)(1) (requiring mark be used "in connection with any goods or
services"). The NAACP urges us to give this requirement a "broad construction,"
but that construction would expose to liability a wide array of noncommercial
expressive and charitable activities. Such an interpretation would push the Lanham
Act close against a First Amendment wall, which is incompatible with the statute's
purpose and stretches the text beyond its breaking point. We decline to reach so far.
        At least five of our sister circuits have interpreted this element as protecting
from liability all noncommercial uses of marks. Farah v. Esquire Magazine, 736 F.3d
528, 541 (D.C.Cir.2013); Utah Lighthouse Ministry v. Found. for Apologetic Info. &
Research, 527 F.3d 1045, 1052-54 (10th Cir.2008); Bosley Med. Inst., Inc. v. Kremer,
403 F.3d 672, 676-77 (9th Cir.2005); Taubman Co. v. Webfeats, 319 F.3d 770, 774
(6th Cir.2003); Porous Media Corp. v. Pall Corp., 173 F.3d 1109, 1120 (8th Cir.1999).
But see United We Stand, 128 F.3d at 89-90. We have not taken a position on
whether "in connection with" goods or services indicates a commercial use.
        At the very least, reading the "in connection with" element to take in broad
swaths of noncommercial speech would be an "overextension" of the Lanham Act's
reach that would "intrude on First Amendment values." Rogers, 875 F.2d at 998; see
also Taubman, 319 F.3d at 774 (stating that the "Lanham Act is constitutional
because it only regulates commercial speech"). It is true that neither of the Lanham
Act's infringement provisions explicitly mentions commerciality. Still, this provision
must mean something more than that the mark is being used in commerce in the
constitutional sense, because the infringement provisions in § 1114(1)(a) and §
1125(a)(1) include a separate Commerce Clause hook.
        Although this case does not require us to hold that the commercial speech
doctrine is in all respects synonymous with the "in connection with" element, we
think that doctrine provides much the best guidance in applying the Act. The "in
connection with" element in fact reads very much like a description of different
types of commercial actions: "in connection with the sale, offering for sale, distribution,
or advertising of any goods or services." 15 U.S.C. § 1114(1)(a) (emphasis added).
         Use of a protected mark as part of "speech that does no more than propose
a commercial transaction" thus plainly falls within the Lanham Act's reach. Courts
also look to the factors outlined in Bolger v. Youngs Drug Products Corp., 463 U.S. 60,

                                                    309
66-67 (1983): whether the speech is an advertisement; whether the speech
references a particular good or service; and whether the speaker (the alleged
infringer) has a demonstrated economic motivation for his speech. These are not
exclusive factors, and the presence or absence of any of them does not necessitate a
particular result.

        In the context of trademark infringement, the Act's purpose, as noted, is to
protect consumers from misleading uses of marks by competitors. Thus if in the
context of a sale, distribution, or advertisement, a mark is used as a source
identifier, we can confidently state that the use is "in connection with" the activity.
Even the Second Circuit, which rejected noncommerciality as an invariable defense
to Lanham Act liability, conceded that a "crucial" factor is that the infringer "us[ed]
the Mark not as a commentary on its owner, but instead as a source identifier."
United We Stand, 128 F.3d at 92. The danger of allowing the "in connection with"
element to suck in speech on political and social issues through some strained or
tangential association with a commercial or transactional activity should thus be
evident. Courts have uniformly understood that imposing liability under the
Lanham Act for such speech is rife with the First Amendment problems.

        Finally, in order to determine whether the use is "in connection with" goods
or services, we must consider what qualifies as a good or service. The Lanham Act
does not directly define either term, but we can deduce their meaning from other
defined terms and common usage. A "good" is best understood as a valuable
product, physical or otherwise, that the consumer may herself employ. See 15 U.S.C.
§ 1127 (noting that a mark may be used in commerce in relation to a good when
placed on a good, its container, its tag, or its associated documents); Black's Law
Dictionary 809 (10th ed.2014) (defining "goods" as "[t]hings that have value,
whether tangible or not"). A service is a more amorphous concept, "denot[ing] an
intangible commodity in the form of human effort, such as labor, skill, or advice."
Black's Law Dictionary 1576. Because Congress intended the Lanham Act to
protect consumers from confusion in the marketplace, it is probable that the Act is
meant to cover a wide range of products, whether "goods" or "services." See Yates v.
United States, --- U.S. ----, 135 S.Ct. 1074 (2015) ("Ordinarily, a word's usage
accords with its dictionary definition. In law as in life, however, the same words,
placed in different contexts, sometimes mean different things.").

        It is clear, therefore, that despite the need to reconcile the reach of the
Lanham Act with First Amendment values, "goods or services" remains a broad and
potentially fuzzy concept. That is yet another reason why the "in connection with"
language must denote a real nexus with goods or services if the Act is not to fatally
collide with First Amendment principles....

                                                III.

                                                    310
        In applying the above principles, we think the district court made several
errors. Those mistakes extended the Lanham Act beyond the purposes it was
intended to serve.

                                                 A.
        In finding that Radiance's use of the NAACP's marks was "in connection
with" goods or services, the district court erred in several respects. To begin, the
court held that because the Radiance article appeared in a Google search for the
term "NAACP," it diverted "Internet users to Radiance's article as opposed to the
NAACP's websites," which thereby created a connection to the NAACP's goods
and services. Radiance Found., Inc. v. NAACP, 25 F.Supp.3d 865, 884 (E.D.Va.2014).
But typically the use of the mark has to be in connection with the infringer's goods
or services, not the trademark holder's. See Utah Lighthouse Ministry v. Found. for
Apologetic Info. & Research, 527 F.3d 1045, 1053-54 (10th Cir.2008) (stating that
"the defendant in a trademark infringement ... case must use the mark in
connection with the goods or services of a competing producer, not merely to make
a comment on the trademark owner's goods or services").
        If the general rule was that the use of the mark merely had to be in
connection with the trademark holder's goods or services, then even the most
offhand mention of a trademark holder's mark could potentially satisfy the "in
connection with" requirement. That interpretation would expand the requirement
to the point that it would equal or surpass the scope of the Lanham Act's "in
commerce" jurisdictional element. This would not only make the jurisdictional
element superfluous, but would hamper the ability of the "in connection with"
requirement to hold Lanham Act infractions within First Amendment limits.
        In People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals v. Doughney, we stated that an
infringer "need only have prevented users from obtaining or using [the trademark
holder's] goods or services, or need only have connected the [infringing] website to
other's goods or services" in order to satisfy the "in connection with" requirement.
263 F.3d 359, 365 (4th Cir.2001). But that rule applies specifically where the
infringer has used the trademark holder's mark in a domain name. Neither of
Radiance's websites used an NAACP mark in its domain name. Rather, Radiance
used the NAACP's marks only in the title and body of an article criticizing the
NAACP. Nothing in PETA indicates that the use of a mark in the course of
disseminating such an idea is on that account sufficient to establish the requisite
relationship to goods or services. PETA simply does not govern the application of
the "in connection with" element in this case.
        The district court proceeded to find that Radiance's use of the NAACP's
marks was also in connection with Radiance's goods or services. But the court's
analysis failed to demonstrate a sufficient nexus between the specific use of the
marks and the sale, offer for sale, distribution, or advertisement of any of the goods

                                                    311
or services that the court invoked. The court first found that there was a sufficient
nexus "with Radiance's own information services" because Radiance "provided
information" on its website. That ruling, however, neuters the First Amendment.
The provision of mere "information services" without any commercial or
transactional component is speech--nothing more.

        In the alternative, the court held that Radiance's use of the NAACP's marks
was in connection with goods or services, because the use was "part of social
commentary or criticism for which they solicit donations and sponsorship." The
NAACP echoes the district court, arguing that the transactional nature of the
billboard campaign and Radiance's fundraising efforts place Radiance's use of the
marks "comfortably within" the reach of the "in connection with" element.

        We need not address this point with absolute pronouncements. Suffice it to
say that the specific use of the marks at issue here was too attenuated from the
donation solicitation and the billboard campaign to support Lanham Act liability.
Although present on the article page, the Donate button was off to the side and did
not itself use the NAACP's marks in any way. The billboard campaign was displayed
on a different page altogether. A visitor likely would not perceive the use of the
NAACP's marks in the article as being in connection with those transactional
components of the website. It is important not to lose perspective. The article was
just one piece of each Radiance website's content, which was comprised of articles,
videos, and multimedia advocacy materials. That the protected marks appear
somewhere in the content of a website that includes transactional components is
not alone enough to satisfy the "in connection with" element. To say it was would
come too close to an absolute rule that any social issues commentary with any
transactional component in the neighborhood enhanced the commentator's risk of
Lanham Act liability.

        The Supreme Court has warned "that charitable appeals for funds ... involve
a variety of speech interests ... that are within the protection of the First
Amendment." Vill. of Schaumburg v. Citizens for a Better Env't, 444 U.S. 620, 632
(1980). Such solicitation, the Court stated, is not a "variety of purely commercial
speech." Courts are thus well-advised to tread cautiously when a trademark holder
invokes the Lanham Act against an alleged non-profit infringer whose use of the
trademark holder's marks may be only tenuously related to requests for money.
Again, this is not to say that in all instances a solicitation by a non-profit is immune
from Lanham Act liability. A solicitation may satisfy the "in connection with"
element if the trademark holder demonstrates a sufficient nexus between the
unauthorized use of the protected mark and clear transactional activity. Such a
nexus may be present, for example, where the protected mark seems to denote the
recipient of the donation. However, where, as here, the solicitations are not closely

                                                    312
related to the specific uses of the protected marks, we are compelled to conclude
that the district court erred in ruling that the "in connection element" was met....

                                               Note

        Noncommercial use in other circuits. Alliance for Good Gov't v. Coalition for Better
Gov't, 998 F.3d 661 (5th Cir. 2021), involved the alleged infringement of a political
organization's name by another political organization. The plaintiff prevailed and
was awarded fees. On appeal, the defendant argued that the fee award would violate
the First Amendment. The Fifth Circuit rejected the argument, relying on a mix of
waiver and law-of-the-case considerations. In dissent, Judge Dennis argued that law
of the case should not apply to prior rulings that were clearly in error. In arguing
this was such a case, he summarized the case law on a commercial use requirement
as follows:

        Significantly, both [§ 32 and § 43(a)] require that actionable infringement be
        "in connection with" goods or services in a manner likely to cause confusion
        to consumers. Compare 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a) (use of mark "in connection
        with any goods or services"), with id. § 1114(1) (use of mark "in connection
        with the sale, offering for sale, distribution, or advertising of any goods or
        services"). "This is commonly described as the commercial use requirement."
        Utah Lighthouse Ministry, 527 F.3d at 1052.

        In light of this requirement, the clear majority of circuits to have considered
        whether the Act applies to any noncommercial speech have determined that
        it does not. See Bosley Med. Inst., Inc., 403 F.3d at 676-77 (construing §
        32(1)); Taubman Co., 319 F.3d at 774 (same); Farah, 736 F.3d at 541; Utah
        Lighthouse Ministry, 527 F.3d at 1052-54; Porous Media Corp., 173 F.3d at
        1120; cf. S.F. Arts & Athletics, Inc., 483 U.S. at 566 (Brennan, J., dissenting);
        Radiance Found., Inc., 786 F.3d at 322.

Id. at 675 (Dennis, J., dissenting). Judge Dennis described the outlier precedent as
follows:

        In United We Stand, Inc. v. United We Stand, America New York, Inc., the
        Second Circuit held that that noncommercial political activities may be
        "services" within the meaning of the Lanham Act but also stated that a
        "crucial" factor in permitting such a conclusion is that the infringer "us[e]
        the Mark not as a commentary on its owner, but instead as a source
        identifier." 128 F.3d 86, 89-92 (2d Cir. 1997). Not only is the Second Circuit
        the sole outlier court in an otherwise uniform line of federal appellate

                                                    313
        authority holding that the Lanham Act does not apply to noncommercial
        speech, but the Second Circuit is also incorrect that purely political speech is
        a "service" under the Lanham Act. "[S]uch a service is not being rendered in
        commerce[;] it is being rendered as part of the political process." Tax Cap
        Comm. v. Save Our Everglades, Inc., 933 F. Supp. 1077, 1081 (S.D. Fla.
        1996).
Id. at 675 (Dennis, J., dissenting).
        How far would an exclusion of "noncommercial" speech go? Consider the
following from the Sixth Circuit. "We take this opportunity to clarify that [our
precedent] limiting the Lanham Act's coverage, while implicated where a defendant
uses the mark purely for protected expression, like satire, critique, or commentary,
does not prohibit application of the Lanham Act to a defendant who uses the
trademark to identify the source of his or her competing goods or services."
Libertarian Nat'l Comm., Inc. v. Saliba, 116 F.4th 530, 535 (6th Cir. 2024).
Libertarian National Committee, in turn, is influenced by the Supreme Court's
opinion in Jack Daniel's Props., Inc. v. VIP Prods. LLC, 599 U.S. 140 (2023), which is
discussed extensively in the later chapter on expressive uses and the First
Amendment.

14. Likelihood of Confusion

        Once again, recall the language of the Lanham Act's causes of action:

                   Section 32 of the Lanham Act (15 U.S.C. § 1114):

        (1) Any person who shall, without the consent of the registrant--
        (a) use in commerce any reproduction, counterfeit, copy, or colorable
imitation of a registered mark in connection with the sale, offering for sale,
distribution, or advertising of any goods or services on or in connection with which
such use is likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive; or
        (b) reproduce, counterfeit, copy, or colorably imitate a registered mark and
apply such reproduction, counterfeit, copy, or colorable imitation to labels, signs,
prints, packages, wrappers, receptacles or advertisements intended to be used in
commerce upon or in connection with the sale, offering for sale, distribution, or
advertising of goods or services on or in connection with which such use is likely to
cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive,
        shall be liable in a civil action by the registrant for the remedies hereinafter
provided. . . .

                Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act (15 U.S.C. § 1125(a)):

        (1) Any person who, on or in connection with any goods or services, or any
container for goods, uses in commerce any word, term, name, symbol, or device, or
any combination thereof, or any false designation of origin, false or misleading
description of fact, or false or misleading representation of fact, which--

        (A) is likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive as to the
affiliation, connection, or association of such person with another person, or as to
the origin, sponsorship, or approval of his or her goods, services, or commercial
activities by another person . . . . shall be liable in a civil action by any person who
believes that he or she is or is likely to be damaged by such act.

        Infringement cases concerning both registered and unregistered marks are
evaluated under the same standard, whether the conduct is "likely to cause
confusion" How then does one determine that? Today, every judicial circuit uses a
multifactor likelihood of confusion test. An example of its application follows.

                                                    315
            Virgin Enterprises Ltd. v. Nawab, 335 F.3d 141 (2d Cir. 2003)

LEVAL, Circuit Judge.
        Plaintiff Virgin Enterprises Limited ("VEL" or "plaintiff") appeals from the

denial of its motion for a preliminary injunction. This suit, brought under § 32 of
the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1114(1), alleges that defendants infringed plaintiff's
rights in the registered mark VIRGIN by operating retail stores selling wireless
telephones and related accessories and services under the trade name VIRGIN
WIRELESS. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York
(Sifton, J.) denied plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction, based upon its
finding that plaintiff's registration did not cover the retail sale of wireless telephones
and related products, and that plaintiff failed to show a likelihood of consumer
confusion.

        We find that the plaintiff is likely to succeed on the merits and was entitled
to a preliminary injunction. We therefore reverse and remand with instructions to
enter a preliminary injunction.

                                     BACKGROUND
        Plaintiff VEL, a corporation with its principal place of business in London,
owns U.S. Registration No. 1,851,817 ("the 817 Registration"), filed on May 5,
1991, and registered on August 30, 1994, for the VIRGIN mark as applied to "retail
store services in the fields of ... computers and electronic apparatus " (emphasis added).
Plaintiff filed an affidavit of continuing use, pursuant to 15 U.S.C. § 1058(a), on
April 27, 2000, which averred that plaintiff had used the mark in connection with
retail store services selling computers and electronic apparatus. Plaintiff also owns
U.S. Registration No. 1,852,776 ("the 776 Registration"), filed on May 9, 1991, and
registered on September 6, 1994, for a stylized version of the VIRGIN mark for use
in connection with "retail store services in the fields of ... computers and electronic
apparatus," and U.S. Registration No. 1,863,353 ("the 353 Registration"), filed on
May 19, 1992, and registered on November 15, 1994, for the VIRGIN
MEGASTORE mark. It is undisputed that these three registrations have become
incontestable pursuant to 15 U.S.C. § 1065.
        VEL, either directly or through corporate affiliates, operates various
businesses worldwide under the trade name VIRGIN, including an airline, large-
scale record stores called Virgin Megastores, and an internet information service.
Plaintiff or its affiliates also market a variety of goods branded with the VIRGIN
name, including music recordings, computer games, books, and luggage. Three of
plaintiff's megastores are located in the New York area. According to an affidavit
submitted to the district court in support of plaintiff's application for preliminary
injunction, Virgin Megastores sell a variety of electronic apparatus, including video

                                                    316
game systems, portable CD players, disposable cameras, and DVD players. These
stores advertise in a variety of media, including radio.

        Defendants Simon Blitz and Daniel Gazal are the sole shareholders of
defendants Cel-Net Communications, Inc. ("Cel-Net"); The Cellular Network
Communications, Inc., doing business as CNCG ("CNCG"); and SD
Telecommunications, Inc. ("SD Telecom"). Blitz and Gazal formed Cel-Net in 1993
to sell retail wireless telephones and services in the New York area. Later, they
formed CNCG to sell wireless phones and services on the wholesale level. CNCG
now sells wireless phones and services to more than 400 independent wireless
retailers. In 1998, Cel-Net received permission from New York State regulators to
resell telephone services within the state.

        Around 1999, Andrew Kastein, a vice-president of CNCG, began to develop
a Cel-Net brand of wireless telecommunications products. In early 1999, Cel-Net
entered into negotiations with the Sprint PCS network to provide
telecommunications services for resale by Cel-Net. In August 1999, Cel-Net retained
the law firm Pennie & Edmonds to determine the availability of possible service
marks for Cel-Net. Pennie & Edmonds associate Elizabeth Langston researched for
Kastein a list of possible service marks; among the marks Cel-Net asked to have
researched was VIRGIN. Defendants claim that Langston told Cel-Net officer
Simon Corney that VIRGIN was available for use in the telecommunications field.
Plaintiff disputed this, offering an affidavit from Langston that she informed
defendants that she would not search the VIRGIN mark because her firm
represented plaintiff.2

        According to defendants, in December 1999, Cel-Net retained Corporate
Solutions, LLC and its principals Nathan Erlich and Tahir Nawab as joint venture
partners to help raise capital to launch Cel-Net's wireless telephone service. On
December 2, 1999, Erlich and Nawab filed four intent-to-use applications with the
U.S. Patent and Trademark Office ("PTO") to register the marks VIRGIN
WIRELESS, VIRGIN MOBILE, VIRGIN COMMUNICATIONS, and VIRGIN
NET in the field of telecommunications services, class 38. On December 24, 1999,
Corporate Solutions incorporated defendant Virgin Wireless, Inc. ("VWI") and
licensed to VWI the right to use the marks VIRGIN WIRELESS and VIRGIN
MOBILE. Meanwhile, one of plaintiff's affiliates had begun to offer wireless
telecommunication services bearing the VIRGIN mark in the United Kingdom. A

          2 Because of Pennie & Edmonds's involvement in searching marks for defendants, and because of

the factual dispute about whether plaintiff's counsel searched the VIRGIN mark for defendants, defendants

sought in the district court to have Pennie & Edmonds disqualified from representing plaintiff. The district

court denied this motion on March 13, 2002.

                                                    317
press release dated November 19, 1999, found on plaintiff's website, stated that its
Virgin Mobile wireless services were operable in the United States.

        On June 23, 2000, defendant Blitz signed a lease under the name Virgin
Wireless for a kiosk location in South Shore Mall in Long Island from which to re-
sell AT & T wireless services, telephones, and accessories under the retail name
Virgin Wireless. Defendants Cel-Net and VWI later expanded their
telecommunications re-sale operations to include two retail stores and four
additional retail kiosks in malls in the New York area and in Pennsylvania. All of
these stores have been run by VWI under the trade name VIRGIN WIRELESS.
VWI also has leases and bank accounts in its name, and has shown evidence of
actual retail transactions and newspaper advertisements.

        In August 2000, plaintiff licensed Virgin Mobile USA, LLC, to use the
VIRGIN mark for wireless telecommunications services in the United States. On
August 10, 2000, plaintiff filed an intent-to-use application with the PTO for use of
the VIRGIN mark in the United States on telecommunications services and mobile
telephones. On October 11, 2001, the PTO suspended this mark's registration in
international class 9, which covers wireless telephones, and class 38, which covers
telecommunications services, because the VIRGIN mark was already reserved by a
prior filing, presumably defendants'. On August 16, 2001, plaintiff filed another
intent-to-use application for the mark VIRGIN MOBILE to brand
telecommunications services. The PTO issued a non-final action letter for both of
plaintiff's pending new registrations on October 31, 2001, which stated that
defendant Corporation Solutions' pending applications for similar marks in the
same class could give rise to "a likelihood of confusion." The PTO suspended action
on plaintiff's application pending the processing of Corporation Solutions'
applications.

        In October 2001, plaintiff issued a press release announcing that it was
offering wireless telecommunications services and mobile telephones in the United
States.

        Plaintiff became aware of Corporation Solutions' application for registration
of the VIRGIN WIRELESS and VIRGIN MOBILE marks by May 2000. In October
2001 and December 2001, defendant VWI filed suits against plaintiff in the federal
district courts in Arizona and Delaware, alleging that plaintiff was using VWI's
mark. Plaintiff maintains (and the district court found) that it learned in January
2002 that VWI and Cel-Net were operating kiosks under the VIRGIN WIRELESS
name and two days later filed the present suit seeking to enjoin defendants from
selling mobile phones in VIRGIN-branded retail stores.

        On May 2, 2002, the district court considered plaintiff's application for a
preliminary injunction. It found that no essential facts were in dispute, and
therefore no evidentiary hearing was required. It was uncontested (and the district

                                                    318
court accordingly found) that plaintiff sold "electronic apparatus" in its stores,
including "various video game systems, portable cassette tape, compact disc, mp3,
and mini disc players, portable radios, and disposable cameras," but not including
telephones or telephone service, and that the only products the defendants sold in
their stores were wireless telephones, telephone accessories, and wireless telephone
services.

        Noting that a party seeking a preliminary injunction must show the
probability of irreparable harm in the absence of relief, and either (1) likelihood of
success on the merits or (2) serious questions going to the merits and a balance of
hardships tipping decidedly in its favor, the court found that plaintiff had failed to
satisfy either standard. Arguing against plaintiff's likelihood of success, the court
noted that plaintiff's registrations did not claim use of the VIRGIN mark "in
telecommunications services or in the associated retail sale of wireless telephones
and accessories." While plaintiff's 817 and 776 Registrations covered the retail sale
of "computers and electronic apparatus," they did not extend to
telecommunications services and wireless phones.

        The court noted that the defendants were the first to use the VIRGIN mark
in telecommunications, and the first to attempt to register VIRGIN for
telecommunications and retail telephone sales. The court also observed that the
dissimilarity in appearance of plaintiff's and defendants' logos and the differences
between plaintiff's huge Virgin Megastores and defendants' small retail outlets in
malls diminished likelihood of consumer confusion. Finally, because the defendants
had expended substantial resources in pursuing their trademark applications and in
establishing their retail presence, the court found that plaintiff could not
demonstrate that the balance of hardships tipped in its favor.

        The court denied the application for preliminary injunction. The crux of the
court's decision lay in the facts that plaintiff's prior use and registration of the
VIRGIN mark in connection with the sale of consumer electronic equipment did
not include the sale of telephones or telephone services, and that defendants were
the first to register and use VIRGIN for telephones and wireless telephone service.
This appeal followed.

                                       DISCUSSION
                                                 I.

        As the court below correctly noted, in order to obtain a preliminary
injunction, a party must demonstrate probability of irreparable harm in the absence
of injunctive relief, and either a likelihood that it will succeed on the merits of its
claim, or a serious question going to the merits and a balance of hardships tipping
decidedly in its favor. We review the court's denial of a preliminary injunction for
abuse of discretion.

                                                    319
        In an action for trademark infringement, where a mark merits protection, a
showing that a significant number of consumers are likely to be confused about the
source of the goods identified by the allegedly infringing mark is generally sufficient
to demonstrate both irreparable harm and a likelihood of success on the merits.
Thus, our inquiry must be whether the district court correctly determined that the
plaintiff was not entitled to protection from use of its mark by others in the sale of
wireless telephones and related services, and that there was no likelihood that, in
the absence of a preliminary injunction, a significant number of consumers would
be confused about the sponsorship of defendants' retail stores. For the reasons
discussed below, we find that the mark is entitled to protection, and there is a
significant likelihood of confusion. We reverse and remand.

                                                 II.
        A claim of trademark infringement, whether brought under 15 U.S.C. §
1114(1) (for infringement of a registered mark) or 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a) (for
infringement of rights in a mark acquired by use), is analyzed under the familiar
two-prong test described in Gruner + Jahr USA Publ'g v. Meredith Corp., 991 F.2d
1072 (2d Cir.1993). The test looks first to whether the plaintiff's mark is entitled to
protection, and second to whether defendant's use of the mark is likely to cause
consumers confusion as to the origin or sponsorship of the defendant's goods.
Examining the question as the test dictates, we have no doubt that plaintiff was
entitled to a preliminary injunction.
        We believe the district court accorded plaintiff too narrow a scope of
protection for its famous, arbitrary, and distinctive mark. There could be no dispute
that plaintiff prevailed as to the first prong of the test-prior use and ownership. For
years, plaintiff had used the VIRGIN mark on huge, famous stores selling, in
addition to music recordings, a variety of consumer electronic equipment. At the
time the defendants began using VIRGIN, plaintiff owned rights in the mark. The
focus of inquiry thus turns to the second prong of the test-whether defendants' use
of VIRGIN as a mark for stores selling wireless telephone services and phones was
likely to cause confusion. There can be little doubt that such confusion was likely.
        The landmark case of Polaroid Corp. v. Polarad Electronics Corp., 287 F.2d 492
(2d Cir.1961) (Friendly, J.), outlined a series of nonexclusive factors likely to be
pertinent in addressing the issue of likelihood of confusion, which are routinely
followed in such cases.
        Six of the Polaroid factors relate directly to the likelihood of consumer
confusion. These are the strength of the plaintiff's mark; the similarity of
defendants' mark to plaintiff's; the proximity of the products sold under
defendants' mark to those sold under plaintiff's; where the products are different,
the likelihood that plaintiff will bridge the gap by selling the products being sold by
defendants; the existence of actual confusion among consumers; and the

                                                    320
sophistication of consumers. Of these six, all but the last (which was found by the
district court to be neutral) strongly favor the plaintiff. The remaining two Polaroid
factors, defendants' good or bad faith and the quality of defendants' products, are
more pertinent to issues other than likelihood of confusion, such as harm to
plaintiff's reputation and choice of remedy. We conclude that the Polaroid factors
powerfully support plaintiff's position.

        Strength of the mark. The strength of a trademark encompasses two different
concepts, both of which relate significantly to likelihood of consumer confusion.
The first and most important is inherent strength, also called "inherent
distinctiveness." This inquiry distinguishes between, on the one hand, inherently
distinctive marks--marks that are arbitrary or fanciful in relation to the products (or
services) on which they are used--and, on the other hand, marks that are generic,
descriptive or suggestive as to those goods. The former are the strong marks.
Abercrombie & Fitch Co. v. Hunting World, Inc., 537 F.2d 4, 9 (2d Cir.1976). The
second sense of the concept of strength of a mark is "acquired distinctiveness," i.e.,
fame, or the extent to which prominent use of the mark in commerce has resulted
in a high degree of consumer recognition.

        Considering first inherent distinctiveness, the law accords broad, muscular
protection to marks that are arbitrary or fanciful in relation to the products on
which they are used, and lesser protection, or no protection at all, to marks
consisting of words that identify or describe the goods or their attributes. The
reasons for the distinction arise from two aspects of market efficiency. The
paramount objective of the trademark law is to avoid confusion in the marketplace.
The purpose for which the trademark law accords merchants the exclusive right to
the use of a name or symbol in their area or commerce is identification, so that the
merchants can establish goodwill for their goods based on past satisfactory
performance, and the consuming public can rely on a mark as a guarantee that the
goods or services so marked come from the merchant who has been found to be
satisfactory in the past. At the same time, efficiency and the public interest require
that every merchant trading in a class of goods be permitted to refer to the goods by
their name, and to make claims about their quality. Thus, a merchant who sells
pencils under the trademark Pencil or Clear Mark, for example, and seeks to exclude
other sellers of pencils from using those words in their trade, is seeking an
advantage the trademark law does not intend to offer. To grant such exclusivity
would deprive the consuming public of the useful market information it receives
where every seller of pencils is free to call them pencils. The trademark right does
not protect the exclusive right to an advertising message--only the exclusive right to
an identifier, to protect against confusion in the marketplace. Thus, as a matter of
policy, the trademark law accords broader protection to marks that serve exclusively

                                                    321
as identifiers and lesser protection where a grant of exclusiveness would tend to
diminish the access of others to the full range of discourse relating to their goods.

        The second aspect of efficiency that justifies according broader protection to
marks that are inherently distinctive relates directly to the likelihood of confusion.
If a mark is arbitrary or fanciful, and makes no reference to the nature of the goods
it designates, consumers who see the mark on different objects offered in the
marketplace will be likely to assume, because of the arbitrariness of the choice of
mark, that they all come from the same source. For example, if consumers become
familiar with a toothpaste sold under an unusual, arbitrary brand name, such as
ZzaaqQ, and later see that same inherently distinctive brand name appearing on a
different product, they are likely to assume, notwithstanding the product difference,
that the second product comes from the same producer as the first. The more
unusual, arbitrary, and fanciful a trade name, the more unlikely it is that two
independent entities would have chosen it. In contrast, every seller of foods has an
interest in calling its product "delicious." Consumers who see the word delicious
used on two or more different food products are less likely to draw the inference
that they must all come from the same producer. Cf. Streetwise Maps, 159 F.3d at
744 (noting that several map producers use "street" in product names; thus
plaintiff's mark using "street" was not particularly distinctive); W. Publ'g, 910 F.2d at
61 (noting numerous registrations of marks using word "golden"). In short, the
more distinctive the mark, the greater the likelihood that the public, seeing it used a
second time, will assume that the second use comes from the same source as the
first. The goal of avoiding consumer confusion thus dictates that the inherently
distinctive, arbitrary, or fanciful marks, i.e., strong marks, receive broader protection
than weak marks, those that are descriptive or suggestive of the products on which
they are used.

        The second sense of trademark strength, fame, or "acquired distinctiveness,"
also bears on consumer confusion. If a mark has been long, prominently and
notoriously used in commerce, there is a high likelihood that consumers will
recognize it from its prior use. Widespread consumer recognition of a mark
previously used in commerce increases the likelihood that consumers will assume it
identifies the previously familiar user, and therefore increases the likelihood of
consumer confusion if the new user is in fact not related to the first. A mark's fame
also gives unscrupulous traders an incentive to seek to create consumer confusion
by associating themselves in consumers' minds with a famous mark. The added
likelihood of consumer confusion resulting from a second user's use of a famous
mark gives reason for according such a famous mark a broader scope of protection,
at least when it is also inherently distinctive. See McGregor, 599 F.2d at 1132 (noting
that secondary meaning may further enlarge the scope of protection accorded to
inherently distinctive marks).

                                                    322
        Plaintiff's VIRGIN mark undoubtedly scored high on both concepts of
strength. In relation to the sale of consumer electronic equipment, the VIRGIN
mark is inherently distinctive, in that it is arbitrary and fanciful; the word "virgin"
has no intrinsic relationship whatsoever to selling such equipment. Because there is
no intrinsic reason for a merchant to use the word "virgin" in the sale of consumer
electronic equipment, a consumer seeing VIRGIN used in two different stores
selling such equipment will likely assume that the stores are related.

        Plaintiff's VIRGIN mark was also famous. The mark had been employed
with world-wide recognition as the mark of an airline and as the mark for
megastores selling music recordings and consumer electronic equipment. The fame
of the mark increased the likelihood that consumers seeing defendants' shops
selling telephones under the mark VIRGIN would assume incorrectly that
defendants' shops were a part of plaintiff's organization.

        There can be no doubt that plaintiff's VIRGIN mark, as used on consumer
electronic equipment, is a strong mark, as the district court found. It is entitled as
such to a broad scope of protection, precisely because the use of the mark by others
in connection with stores selling reasonably closely related merchandise would
inevitably have a high likelihood of causing consumer confusion.

        Similarity of marks. When the secondary user's mark is not identical but
merely similar to the plaintiff's mark, it is important to assess the degree of
similarity between them in assessing the likelihood that consumers will be confused.
Plaintiff's and defendants' marks were not merely similar; they were identical to the
extent that both consisted of the same word, "virgin."

        The district court believed this factor did not favor plaintiff because it found
some differences in appearance. Defendants' logo used a difference typeface and
different colors from plaintiff's. While those are indeed differences, they are quite
minor in relation to the fact that the name being used as a trademark was the same
in each case.

        Advertisement and consumer experience of a mark do not necessarily
transmit all of the mark's features. Plaintiff, for example, advertised its Virgin
Megastores on the radio. A consumer who heard those advertisements and then saw
the defendants' installation using the name VIRGIN would have no way of
knowing that the two trademarks looked different. A consumer who had visited one
of plaintiff's Virgin Megastores and remembered the name would not necessarily
remember the typeface and color of plaintiff's mark. The reputation of a mark also
spreads by word of mouth among consumers. One consumer who hears from others
about their experience with Virgin stores and then encounters defendants' Virgin
store will have no way knowing of the differences in typeface.

        In view of the fact that defendants used the same name as plaintiff, we
conclude the defendants' mark was sufficiently similar to plaintiff's to increase the

                                                    323
likelihood of confusion. This factor favored the plaintiff as a matter of law. We
conclude that the district court erred in concluding otherwise on the basis of
comparatively trivial and often irrelevant differences.

        Proximity of the products and likelihood of bridging the gap. The next factor is the
proximity of the products being sold by plaintiff and defendant under identical (or
similar) marks. This factor has an obvious bearing on the likelihood of confusion.
When the two users of a mark are operating in completely different areas of
commerce, consumers are less likely to assume that their similarly branded products
come from the same source. In contrast, the closer the secondary user's goods are to
those the consumer has seen marketed under the prior user's brand, the more likely
that the consumer will mistakenly assume a common source.

        While plaintiff had not sold telephones or telephone service prior to
defendant's registration evincing intent to sell those items, plaintiff had sold quite
similar items of consumer electronic equipment. These included computer video
game systems, portable cassette-tape players, compact disc players, MP3 players,
mini-disc players, and disposable cameras. Like telephones, many of these are small
consumer electronic gadgets making use of computerized audio communication.
They are sold in the same channels of commerce. Consumers would have a high
expectation of finding telephones, portable CD players, and computerized video
game systems in the same stores. We think the proximity in commerce of
telephones to CD players substantially advanced the risk that consumer confusion
would occur when both were sold by different merchants under the same trade
name, VIRGIN.

        Our classic Polaroid test further protects a trademark owner by examining the
likelihood that, even if the plaintiff's products were not so close to the defendants'
when the defendant began to market them, there was already a likelihood that
plaintiff would in the reasonably near future begin selling those products. VEL's
claim of proximity was further strengthened in this regard because, as the district
court expressly found, "plans had been formulated [for VEL] to enter [the market
for telecommunications products and services] shortly in the future." VEL had
already begun marketing telephone service in England which would operate in the
United States, and, as the district court found, had made plans to sell telephones
and wireless telephone service under the VIRGIN name from its retail stores.

        The district court, nonetheless, found in favor of the defendants with respect
to the proximity of products and services. We would ordinarily give considerable
deference to a factual finding on this issue. Here, however, we cannot do so because
it appears the district court applied the wrong test. The court did not assess the
proximity of defendants' VIRGIN-branded retail stores selling telephone products to
plaintiff's VIRGIN-branded retail stores selling other consumer electronic products.
It simply concluded that, because defendants were selling exclusively telephone

                                                    324
products and services, and plaintiff's electronic products did not include telephones
or related services, the defendants must prevail as to the proximity factor.

        This represents a considerable misunderstanding of the Polaroid test. The
famous list of factors of likely pertinence in assessing likelihood of confusion in
Polaroid was specially designed for a case like this one, in which the secondary user is
not in direct competition with the prior user, but is selling a somewhat different
product or service. In Polaroid, the plaintiff sold optical and camera equipment,
while the defendant sold electronic apparatus. The test the court discussed was
expressly addressed to the problem "how far a valid trademark shall be protected
with respect to goods other than those to which its owner has applied it." 287 F.2d at 495
(emphasis added); see also Arrow Fastener, 59 F.3d at 396 (noting that products need
not actually compete with each other). The very fact that the test includes the
"proximity" between the defendant's products and the plaintiff's and the likelihood
that the plaintiff will "bridge the gap" makes clear that the trademark owner does
not lose, as the district court concluded, merely because it has not previously sold
the precise good or service sold by the secondary user.

        In our view, had the district court employed the proper test of proximity, it
could not have failed to find a high degree of proximity as between plaintiff VEL's
prior sales of consumer electronic audio equipment and defendants' subsequent
sales of telephones and telephone services, which proximity would certainly
contribute to likelihood of consumer confusion. And plaintiff was all the more
entitled to a finding in its favor in respect of these matters by virtue of the fact,
which the district court did find, that at the time defendants began using the
VIRGIN mark in the retail sale of telephones and telephone services, plaintiff
already had plans to bridge the gap by expanding its sales of consumer electronic
equipment to include sales of those very goods and services in the near future.
Consumer confusion was more than likely; it was virtually inevitable.

        Actual confusion. It is self-evident that the existence of actual consumer
confusion indicates a likelihood of consumer confusion. Nabisco, 191 F.3d at 228.
We have therefore deemed evidence of actual confusion "particularly relevant" to
the inquiry. Streetwise Maps, 159 F.3d at 745.

        Plaintiff submitted to the district court an affidavit of a former employee of
defendant Cel-Net, who worked at a mall kiosk branded as Virgin Wireless, which
stated that individuals used to ask him if the kiosk was affiliated with plaintiff's
VIRGIN stores. The district court correctly concluded that this evidence weighed in
plaintiff's favor.

        Sophistication of consumers. The degree of sophistication of consumers can
have an important bearing on likelihood of confusion. Where the purchasers of a
products are highly trained professionals, they know the market and are less likely
than untrained consumers to be misled or confused by the similarity of different

                                                    325
marks. The district court recognized that "[r]etail customers, such as the ones
catered to by both the defendants and [plaintiff], are not expected to exercise the
same degree of care as professional buyers, who are expected to have greater powers
of discrimination." On the other hand, it observed that purchasers of cellular
telephones and the service plans were likely to give greater care than self-service
customers in a supermarket. Noting that neither side had submitted evidence on
the sophistication of consumers, the court made no finding favoring either side. We
agree that the sophistication factor is neutral in this case.

        Bad faith and the quality of the defendants' services or products. Two factors
remain of the conventional Polaroid test: the existence of bad faith on the part of the
secondary user and the quality of the secondary user's products or services. Neither
factor is of high relevance to the issue of likelihood of confusion. A finding that a
party acted in bad faith can affect the court's choice of remedy or can tip the
balance where questions are close. It does not bear directly on whether consumers
are likely to be confused. The district court noted some evidence of bad faith on the
defendants' part, but because the evidence on the issue was scant and equivocal, the
court concluded that such a finding "at this stage [would be] speculative." The court
therefore found that this factor favored neither party.

        The issue of the quality of the secondary user's product goes more to the
harm that confusion can cause the plaintiff's mark and reputation than to the
likelihood of confusion. See Arrow Fastener, 59 F.3d at 398 (noting that first user's
reputation may be harmed if secondary user's goods are of poor quality). In any
event, the district court found this factor to be "neutral" with respect to likelihood
of confusion.

         * * * * * *
        In summary we conclude that of the six Polaroid factors that pertain directly
to the likelihood of consumer confusion, all but one favor the plaintiff, and that
one--sophistication of consumers--is neutral. The plaintiff is strongly favored by the
strength of its mark, both inherent and acquired; the similarity of the marks; the
proximity of the products and services; the likelihood that plaintiff would bridge the
gap; and the existence of actual confusion. None of the factors favors the defendant.
The remaining factors were found to be neutral. Although we do not suggest that
likelihood of confusion may be properly determined simply by the number of
factors in one party's favor, the overall assessment in this case in our view admits
only of a finding in plaintiff's favor that defendants' sale of telephones and
telephone-related services under the VIRGIN mark was likely to cause substantial
consumer confusion. . . .

                                              Notes

        "Likelihood of confusion." Though a simple phrase, "likelihood of confusion"
leaves much to the judicial imagination. A "likelihood" may be more than a
"possibility," Brennan's, Inc. v. Brennan's Restaurant, L.L.C., 360 F.3d 125 (2d Cir.
2004) ("To succeed on an infringement claim, plaintiff must show that it is
probable, not just possible, that consumers will be confused."), but how much
more?

        Does it mean that any given consumer is more likely than not to be
confused? Somewhat likely? Possibly? Does it mean that someone, somewhere, is
going to be confused? And what kind of consumer are we worried about? A
potential consumer of the product whom we assume to be rational? Ok, but how
much attention is our hypothetical consumer expected to pay? Is that a policy
question? If so, should courts be answering it? What is the right response to
congressional silence?

        These questions all coexist with a second set of difficult questions that
concern the kind of confusion at issue. For now, however, let us stick with the
traditional unfair competition concern about confusion as to source that is measured
at the point of sale (i.e., the moment the consumer makes the decision to purchase).

        Multifactor tests. Multiple factors might bear on the question whether a
likelihood of confusion exists. Eventually, as Virgin reflects, the factors used by
courts were made explicit. Today, every court of appeals employs roughly similar
multifactor tests. See 4 MCCARTHY §§ 24:30-:43 (listing factors used by various
circuits). The classic example is Polaroid Corp. v. Polarad Electronics Corp., 287 F.2d
492, 495 (2d Cir. 1961). In that case the court considered (1) strength of plaintiff's
mark, (2) degree of similarity between marks, (3) competitive proximity of litigants'
products, (4) any actual confusion, (5) likelihood that plaintiff will "bridge the gap"
separating the two markets, (6) whether defendant acted in good faith in adopting
its mark, (7) quality of defendant's product, and (8) purchaser sophistication. Id.
The Restatement lists similar factors. RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF UNFAIR
COMPETITION §§ 21-23 (1995). Note that the "bridge the gap" factor concerns
competitors who are not in the same market. Courts now use the multifactor test
even when the parties are in the same market.

        Do you think that use of the factors gets us closer to the ultimate question or
would we be better off dispensing with them? In thinking about your answer,
consider not only the need for effective fact finding, but also for the need of
appellate courts to provide effective review of the lower courts.

                                                    327
        Applications. Not all factors are created equal. Think about how you make
decisions. For example, how do you decide which elective course to take? There are
any number of considerations--let's call them "factors"--to consider (e.g., professor
quality, how the professor grades, the amount of reading, the cost of the textbook,
interest in the subject matter, relevance to career plans, etc.). Chances are some
factors loom larger for you than others. And perhaps your analysis of one factor
might spill over into another. For example, if you decide that you like a particular
professor's lecture style, you might be more likely to decide that the course's subject
matter interests you than you might have otherwise.

        Similar dynamics apply to judges applying the multifactor tests in trademark
law. Barton Beebe studied the way courts apply the multifactor test and found that
judges applying the factors use shortcuts. They focus on a few particularly important
factors, employing "`fast and frugal' heuristics to short-circuit the multifactor
analysis. A few factors prove to be decisive; the rest are at best redundant and at
worst irrelevant." Barton Beebe, An Empirical Study of the Multifactor Tests for
Trademark Infringement, 94 CAL. L. REV. 1581, 1601 (2006). Beebe found that the
"core" factors are similarity, defendant's intent, the strength of the plaintiff's mark,
and evidence of actual confusion. Id. at 1623-42.

        Actual confusion and surveys. As Virgin notes, evidence of actual confusion is
typically treated as highly probative of likelihood of confusion. The inverse is usually
not true, given that it may be hard to find confused customers. Indeed, consumers
may not even know they are confused. That said, the longer the defendant operates
without evidence of actual confusion, the more likely a court will weigh that absence
in the defendant's favor. Versa Products Co., Inc. v. Bifold Co. (Mfg.) Ltd., 50 F.3d
189, 205 (3d Cir. 1995) ("If a defendant's product has been sold for an appreciable
period of time without evidence of actual confusion, one can infer that continued
marketing will not lead to consumer confusion in the future. The longer the
challenged product has been in use, the stronger this inference will be.").

        Though important, evidence of actual confusion is not necessarily
dispositive. A court might overlook such examples as being de minimis or the
product of unreasonable behavior on the part of the beholder (recalling that the
standard is that of a reasonable consumer exercising ordinary care). Context matters
in assessing how representative examples of confusion actually are. A seemingly
large number of confused consumers may actually be de minimis when compared to
the number exposed to the allegedly infringing trademark use. See, e.g., Lerner &
Rowe PC v. Brown Engstrand & Shely LLC, 119 F.4th 711, 720-21 (9th Cir. 2024)
("Because we have both the numerator--the 236 calls representing actual
confusion--and the denominator--the 109,322 consumers who saw the
advertisements--we can discern with a high degree of precision the proportion of all

                                                    328
consumers who were actually confused. . . . No reasonable jury would conclude that
this percentage is anything but de minimis and fails to support a finding of
likelihood of confusion.").

        Parties commonly use surveys to supply evidence of how relevant consumers
perceive the trademarks at issue. Courts often base liability decisions in part on
surveys that show relatively low confusion percentages. See generally RESTATEMENT
(THIRD) OF UNFAIR COMPETITION § 20 cmt. g (1995) ("Courts have given weight to
survey results showing confusion among 25 percent or more of those surveyed even
when the survey was partially flawed. Similarly, surveys without obvious defects
indicating confusion of seven percent to 15 percent of the sample have been held
adequate . . . .").

        Questions about "actual" confusion also raise an underexplored issue about
depth of confusion. How sure must one be when presented with purportedly
confusing stimuli? For an interesting discussion, as well as research results that
challenge trademark law's usual failure to ask this question, see Barton Beebe, Roy
Germano, Christopher Jon Sprigman & Joel H. Steckel, Consumer Uncertainty in
Trademark Law: An Experimental Investigation, 72 Emory L.J. 489 (2023).

        Good faith/bad faith. Notwithstanding its treatment in Virgin, assessments of
the defendant's intent often loom large in infringement litigation. Beebe's data
"suggest that a finding of bad faith intent creates, if not in doctrine, then at least in
practice, a nearly un-rebuttable presumption of a likelihood of confusion." 94 Cal.
L. Rev. at 1628. But why is that relevant to whether a consumer is likely to be
confused?

        More importantly, what is bad faith? Intent to confuse, sure. But does it also
reach mere knowledge of a plaintiff's mark? Compare M Welles & Assocs., Inc. v.
Edwell, Inc., 69 F.4th 723, 733 (10th Cir. 2023), with id. at 737-38 (Tymkovich, J.,
dissenting).

        What about copying some, but not all, elements of a trade dress?

        Is the good faith factor just a way for courts to evaluate the equities of a
defendant's use? To prevent free riding? Something else? Pay attention to the variety
of ways courts use the concept in the cases to come.

                                                    329
        The stories we tell. Consider Judge Leval's explanation for why strong marks
receive more protection than weak ones. Can you think of a different story that
would rationalize giving strong marks less protection than weak ones?

        Speaking of mark strength, how should courts treat suggestive marks? On the
one hand they are inherently distinctive, but they are often useful as marketing
devices. Competitors may therefore naturally use the terms without an intent to
cause confusion. For an interesting discussion of the issue, see RiseandShine Corp.
v. PepsiCo, Inc., 41 F.4th 112, 122 (2d Cir. 2022) (Leval, J.) ("The trademark law
does not favor giving one marketer an exclusive right to prevent others from using
. . . valuable marketing terms in their own marketing campaigns. When a mark so
clearly evokes the claimed virtues of the product it references, that mark, although
perhaps muscular as a marketing tool, is weak under the trademark law."). The
discussion in RiseandShine raises another deep question. How should appellate
courts review lower court decisions in this area? Id. at 121 ("While this Court has
said, at times, that the classification of a mark is a factual matter, we have also stated
that there is an undeniable legal element in the determination of how much
strength a given mark commands." (citations omitted)).

        Manipulating factors? Some of the factors are vulnerable to outcome-oriented
manipulation. Take the consumer care/sophistication factor. Suppose you were
litigating a case in which the trademark in question is for a brand of bubble gum,
and the product is mainly used by children. Can you tell a consumer-sophistication
story to benefit the plaintiff? Very good. Now do one for the defendant. See, e.g., 4
MCCARTHY § 23:92 ("[W]hen the court wants to find no infringement, it says that
the average buyer is cautious and careful and would never be confused. But if the
judge thinks there is infringement, . . . the average buyer is gullible and . . . easily
confused by the similar marks.").

        Balancing the factors. Once the individual factors are analyzed, how are they
weighed against each other? The case law rejects (fortunately) the approach of simply
summing the factors together. The point is to consider all the relevant factors, not
to add them up. That said, pay attention to how the courts conduct their balancing
in the cases that follow. Does it sometimes look like adding the factors up? How do
you think the factors should be applied in arriving at a final decision of whether
there is a likelihood of confusion?

        Is the ultimate balancing a question of fact or law? The majority of circuits
say a question of fact, reviewable under a clearly erroneous standard. Note, however,
that this approach does not preclude a reviewing court from finding a legal error in
the application of any given factor. The Second, Sixth, and Federal Circuits treat

                                                    330
the ultimate question of likelihood of confusion as a question of law, reviewable de
novo. See generally 4 MCCARTHY § 23:73.

        Summary dispositions. Suppose a judge looks at two marks and thinks, "there's
no way anyone could be confused." Is that enough for summary judgment for the
defendant? Or must one still go through a full-blown trial to consider the impact of
the various factors. Appellate judges frequently disagree on the question of whether
summary disposition is acceptable, and you will see several such cases in the
readings to come. For now, consider the following marks for children's clothing:

The district court dismissed Bliss's infringement claims. On appeal, the Sixth
Circuit marched through the factors and concluded that, as pled, most of them
favored Bliss (including similarity!). Bliss Collection, LLC v. Latham Companies,
LLC, 82 F.4th 499, 512, 515 (6th Cir. 2023). The opinion came over a dissent,
which argued that the marks "share[d] no common elements" and that the
pleadings did not rise to the level of plausibility demanded by Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556
U.S. 662 (2009). Given that, "[t]o send this case to discovery comes close to saying
that every trademark infringement pleading survives." Bliss Collection, 82 F.4th. at
517 (Larsen, J., dissenting on this point).

        We will see this issue recur with variable results.

                        Hornady Mfg. Co., Inc. v. Doubletap, Inc.
                                746 F.3d 995 (10th Cir. 2014)

KELLY, Circuit Judge.
         Plaintiff-Appellant Hornady Manufacturing Company, Inc., appeals from a

district court order granting summary judgment to Defendant-Appellee
DoubleTap, Inc., on Hornady's trademark infringement claims. Our jurisdiction
arises under 28 U.S.C. § 1291, and we affirm.

                                            Background
        Hornady was founded in 1949 by Joyce Hornady. Since that time, Hornady
has manufactured and sold firearm ammunition and related products. It sells its
products through brick-and-mortar retailers, its websites, and direct-to-consumer
sales, including direct sales to law enforcement agencies.
        Since 1997, Hornady has sold various products under the name "TAP,"
short for "Tactical Application Police." These products include the sub-brands TAP,
TAP FPD, TAP URBAN, TAP PRECISION, TAP CQ, TAP BARRIER, BTHP
TAP, and GMX TAP. In 1999, Hornady acquired trademark registration for the
nonstylized word mark, "TAP ." Hornady holds nonstylized word mark registrations

                                                    332
    for other TAP sub-brands. In 2004, the TAP mark became statutorily incontestable
    under 15 U.S.C. § 1065. Photographs in the record indicate that the packaging for
    Hornady's products conspicuously features the TAP mark, both as a stand-alone
    mark and as incorporated within a shield resembling a police officer's badge.

        DoubleTap was founded in 2002 by Michael McNett. DoubleTap has been
described as a "niche" ammunition manufacturer. It specializes in hand-loaded rounds and
produces calibers rarely offered by other ammunition manufacturers. Mr. McNett
registered the domain name www.doubletapammo.com in 2003 and began selling
DoubleTap products online thereafter. Photographs in the record indicate that, as of 2006,
packaging for DoubleTap's products displayed its mark as two separate words--"Double
Tap"--within a blue oval and flanked to the left by two bullet holes. Sometime after 2010,
the mark morphed into a single word--"DOUBLETAP"--presented in a blue oval and
crowned with the identifier, "McNett's."

            In January 2010, Hornady sent DoubleTap a cease-and-desist letter,
    demanding that DoubleTap discontinue using the word "Tap" on its products,
    remove "Tap" from its website, and destroy any materials it created bearing "Tap."
    Efforts to resolve the dispute failed, and this litigation ensued. Hornady's complaint
    alleged trademark infringement under Sections 32 and 43(a) of the Lanham Act,
    common law trademark infringement, deceptive trade practices under Utah law,
    and unjust enrichment. Both parties moved for summary judgment, arguing that
    they were entitled to judgment as a matter of law on whether DoubleTap infringed

                                                        333
on Hornady's TAP mark. The district court denied Hornady's motion and granted
DoubleTap's. Hornady appealed.

                                            Discussion
        . . . . Summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings and record
demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact and that the moving
party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The nonmoving party is entitled to
reasonable inferences from the record; but if the nonmovant bears the burden of
persuasion, summary judgment may be granted if the movant points out a lack of
evidence to support the claim and the nonmovant cannot identify specific facts to
the contrary.
        Whether proceeding under § 32 or § 43(a) of the Lanham Act, "the central
inquiry is the same: whether the junior user's mark is likely to cause confusion with
the senior user's mark." Water Pik, 726 F.3d at 1143. Likelihood of confusion is a
question of fact, but one amenable to summary judgment in appropriate
circumstances. We examine six nonexhaustive factors to evaluate whether there is a
likelihood of confusion: (1) the degree of similarity between the competing marks;
(2) the intent of the alleged infringer in adopting the contested mark; (3) evidence
of actual confusion; (4) the similarity of the parties' products and the manner in
which the parties market them; (5) the degree of care that consumers are likely to
exercise in purchasing the parties' products; and (6) the strength of the contesting
mark.
        No one of the six factors is dispositive, and "a genuine dispute of material
fact will not exist if all relevant factors, properly analyzed and considered together,
... indicate consumers are not likely to be confused." Heartsprings, Inc. v. Heartspring,
Inc., 143 F.3d 550, 558 (10th Cir.1998). The factors are interrelated, and the
"importance of any particular factor in a specific case can depend on a variety of
circumstances, including the force of another factor." Water Pik, 726 F.3d at
1143. . . .
        Hornady argues that summary judgment was inappropriate because
likelihood of confusion was a genuine issue of fact. It further argues that the district
court impermissibly "weighed evidence" in its analysis of certain factors. . . .
A. Similarity of the Marks
         The similarity of the marks is the "first and most important factor." King of
the Mountain Sports, Inc. v. Chrysler Corp., 185 F.3d 1084, 1091 (10th Cir.1999).
Similarity is gauged on three levels: "sight, sound, and meaning." Id. at 1090.
Similarities in the marks get "more weight than the differences." Id. In comparing
marks, "we do not independently examine each syllable of the marks but consider
the mark as a whole as they are encountered by consumers in the marketplace."
Water Pik, 726 F.3d at 1155 (internal quotation marks omitted). We therefore
compare the full marks, not just their components.

                                                    334
        Hornady argues for a different approach to similarity. It first argues that the
district court erred by not elevating the marks' one similarity--the word "tap"--above
all differences. Hornady next argues that the district court erred by considering
differences created by the parties' packaging. The district court did not err in either
regard.

        First, the court is not free to give dispositive weight to any one component of
the marks, such as a shared syllable. Marks must be considered as a whole. In
Universal Money Centers, Inc. v. AT & T Co., we compared the parties' marks in their
entirety, including disclaimed words within the mark. 22 F.3d 1527, 1531 (10th
Cir.1994). In Water Pik, this court compared the full words " `SinuCleanse' and
`SinuSense,' not just the components `Cleanse' and `Sense.'" In this case, the fact
that both marks contain the syllable "tap" does not control the similarity inquiry.

        Second, in its comparison of the marks, the court is "not free to focus solely
on name similarity." Heartsprings, 143 F.3d at 555. The court must consider the
effect of marketplace presentation, including "lettering styles, logos and coloring
schemes." Universal Money Centers, 22 F.3d at 1531. This includes the effect
packaging has on consumers' ability to recognize a particular mark. In Water Pik, we
rejected as unrealistic a survey comparison that "did not present the marks as they
would appear to a consumer because both marks were shown in a typewritten
format, divorced from packaging." 726 F.3d at 1145. This was despite the fact that
the mark at issue was a nonstylized word mark.2

        Hornady additionally argues that, because its various TAP sub-brands form a
"family of marks," it is entitled to an inference that a consumer would presume
DoubleTap to be one of its TAP marks. The only tie holding this supposed family
together, however, is the word "tap." To hold that DoubleTap is ipso facto a
perceived member of this family would violate our command that marks be
considered as a whole as they are encountered by consumers in the marketplace, not
on one factor such as name alone. The TAP sub-brands do play one important role:
they are each ways in which consumers encounter the TAP mark in the
marketplace. As such, they must be compared to DoubleTap for similarities (and
differences) in sight, sound, and meaning.

          2 Hornady argues that its TAP mark qualifies as a "standard character mark," thus entitling it to a

similarity analysis devoid of "font style, size, or color" considerations. In Water Pik, however, we considered

the infringement of the "nonstylized word mark SINUCLEANSE" among others. Although the mark was a

standard character mark ... we rejected a comparison that presented the mark "differently from the way that it

actually appears on packaging," A standard character registration does not override the requirement that

likelihood of confusion be measured by the perceptions of consumers in the marketplace, including the effect

of packaging.

                                                    335
         With these principles in mind, we compare the sight, sound, and meaning
of TAP and DoubleTap. Comparing TAP and DoubleTap in visual appearance,
they have but one similarity: both carry the word "tap." The placement and use of
that word differs between the marks. Hornady uses "TAP" as an identifying prefix in
most of its marks, e.g., TAP URBAN, TAP PRECISION, TAP CQ, and TAP
BARRIER. It does not use it at the end of a compound word as DoubleTap does. In
the two instances where Hornady uses "TAP" as a suffix rather than a prefix--BTHP
TAP and GMX TAP--acronyms proceed the mark, not a readily understandable
adjective such as "double." The marks themselves thus appear starkly different.
Moreover, as the district court recognized, the packaging on which the parties
display their marks differs greatly in color scheme and layout. Finally, most of
Hornady's TAP products and its website carry the distinctive "Hornady®" house
mark, further diminishing the degree of visual similarity between the marks.

        As for the sound factor, the monosyllabic "tap" does not sound like the
polysyllabic "double tap."

        As to meaning, the marks are not similar. Hornady does not dispute that
TAP is an acronym for "Tactical Application Police"; it often displays its mark in
close proximity to that description. For consumers who view "TAP" in isolation
(and who are unfamiliar with the acronym's meaning), "tap" means "to strike
lightly." Webster's 9th New Coll. Dictionary 1206 (1991). In contrast, the term
"double tap" has a specialized meaning: in gunmanship, a "double tap is a
technique of firing two shots in quick succession into a single target." Steve Martini,
Double Tap 317 (2005).

        Overall, there are more than enough differences between the two marks to
weigh this factor in DoubleTap's favor.

        Hornady argues that it was impermissible for the district court to refer to the
marks' dissimilarity when evaluating the remaining factors. Our precedent is to the
contrary. "The importance of any particular factor in a specific case can depend on a
variety of circumstances, including the force of another factor. For example, if two
marks are not at all similar, the degree of consumer care is unlikely to make a
difference." Water Pik, 726 F.3d at 1143. The district court did not err by referring
to the marks' dissimilarity when analyzing the remaining factors.
B. DoubleTap's Intent

        "Evidence that the alleged infringer chose a mark with the intent to copy,
rather than randomly or by accident, typically supports an inference of likelihood of
confusion." Utah Lighthouse Ministry, 527 F.3d at 1055. The district court held that
the intent factor favored DoubleTap, based on a lack of similarity in the marks and
Hornady's failure to produce direct evidence of DoubleTap's intent to copy.
Hornady argues that it did produce evidence creating a factual issue regarding
intent, namely, circumstantial evidence creating an inference of DoubleTap's intent

                                                    336
to copy. On summary judgment, however, a nonmovant is entitled to only those
inferences that are "reasonable." Water Pik, 726 F.3d at 1143. In this case, the
district court correctly held that Hornady's inferences were not reasonable.

        First, Hornady argues that an intent to copy can be inferred from the fact
that, at the time of its founding, DoubleTap was aware of "Hornady and its
products." This inference fails: "When we have said that evidence of intent to copy
may justify an inference of likelihood of confusion, we have been referring to
copying a particular mark, not copying a competitor's product." Water Pik, 726 F.3d
at 1157. Whether DoubleTap's founder was aware of Hornady and its products is
irrelevant to whether DoubleTap adopted its mark intending to copy the TAP mark:
"The intent to compete by imitating the successful features of another's product is
vastly different from the intent to deceive purchasers as to the source of the
product." Id. at 1158 (quoting Streetwise Maps, Inc. v. VanDam, Inc., 159 F.3d 739,
745 (2d Cir.1998)).

        Second, Hornady argues that an intent to copy can be inferred from the fact
that, after Hornady sent DoubleTap a cease-and-desist letter in January 2010,
DoubleTap accelerated its marketing efforts apparently to capitalize on the alleged
confusion. This inference also fails. Under the intent factor, the alleged infringer's
intent is measured at the time it "chose" or "adopted" its mark. In analyzing intent,
we look to evidence of "the process of choosing" a mark, not evidence of events
subsequent to its adoption. Evidence of DoubleTap's mindset in 2010, when it
became aware of Hornady's claim of infringement, is irrelevant to its mindset in
2002, when it adopted the "DoubleTap" mark. Because, as we mentioned,
DoubleTap adopted a mark dissimilar to Hornady's, and because no evidence
demonstrates DoubleTap's intent to copy Hornady's mark in 2002, this factor
weighs in DoubleTap's favor.
C. Actual Confusion

        Evidence of actual confusion in the marketplace is often considered the best
evidence of a likelihood of confusion. Hornady points to two kinds of actual
confusion evidence in this case: direct evidence in the form of telephone calls, a
letter, and a post on Hornady's Facebook page; and survey evidence gathered by
Luth Research. We first address the direct evidence and then turn to the survey.

        1. Direct Evidence of Actual Confusion
        Hornady cites three pieces of evidence it claims exhibit actual consumer
confusion regarding the source of DoubleTap's product: (1) a "half a dozen or so"
phone calls between 2009 and 2010 from customers who believed DoubleTap was
one of Hornady's TAP products; (2) a March 2012 letter from a sheriff's office
thanking Hornady for sending DoubleTap ammunition; and (3) a March 2013
comment on Hornady's Facebook page demonstrating a customer's confusion
whether Hornady manufactured DoubleTap. The district court dismissed this

                                                    337
evidence as "de minimis," and Hornady argues that such a determination was
inappropriate on summary judgment.

        "We have consistently recognized, however, that isolated, anecdotal instances
of actual confusion may be de minimis and may be disregarded in the confusion
analysis." Water Pik, 726 F.3d at 1150. "[E]vidence of some actual confusion does
not dictate a finding of likelihood of confusion." Universal Money Centers, 22 F.3d at
1535. In Universal Money Centers, we disregarded as de minimis three affidavits
alleging confusion, including two by the plaintiff's employees that they had received
a number of accounts of customer confusion. In King of the Mountain, we held that
evidence of seven episodes of actual confusion was de minimis. Finally, in Water Pik,
we held that four instances of consumer confusion, including a declaration by a
customer that she was confused when deciding between the parties' products,
constituted de minimis evidence. Even assuming that the three instances cited by
Hornady constitute some evidence of actual confusion, we agree with the district
court's assessment that a handful of instances over the ten years in which
DoubleTap was in the market constitute de minimis evidence of a likelihood of
confusion. Moreover, this "de minimis evidence of actual confusion is especially
undermined in this case by the sheer lack of similarity between the marks." Universal
Money Centers, 22 F.3d at 1535-36.

        2. Survey Evidence
        "Evidence of actual confusion is often introduced through the use of surveys,
although their evidentiary value depends on the methodology and questions asked."
Water Pik, 726 F.3d at 1144. The district court gave the Luth Survey--commissioned
by DoubleTap--little weight, concluding that it improperly compared the parties'
marks "side-by-side." Both parties agree that the district court erred in determining
that the survey was of the "side-by-side" variety. We also agree; the Luth Survey
presented the parties' products one at a time, thus properly measuring confusion
when the allegedly infringing mark is "singly presented, rather than when presented
side by side with the protected trademark." Sally Beauty, 304 F.3d at 972. However,
other methodological flaws support the district court's conclusion that the Luth
Survey was entitled to little weight.
        In Water Pik, we agreed that the survey at issue was "devoid of any probative
value and therefore irrelevant" because of methodological flaws. 726 F.3d at 1145.
Among the survey's flaws was the fact that "the survey questions [were] improperly
leading." Id. at 1147. We described the survey as follows:
        Respondents were shown only three products and were asked whether two or
        more of the products were made by the same company; whether two or more
        of the products' makers had a business affiliation; and whether one or more
        of the makers had received permission or approval from one of the others.
        They could answer yes, no, or not sure.

                                                    338
        The Luth Survey followed an identical strategy:
        After viewing [three] packages, respondents were asked to answer whether
        they thought that the [DoubleTap] and the Hornady and control[, Federal
        Premium,] packages were: (1) of the same company or owned by the first
        company shown; (2) affiliated with the first company shown, (3) had
        permission from the first company shown to use this name on their website,
        or (4) had no affiliation or connection to the first website shown, or that they
        were unsure.

        By suggesting the possibility that DoubleTap might be connected with
another brand, and limiting the candidates to Hornady and Federal Premium, the
Luth Survey risked sowing confusion between DoubleTap and TAP when none
would have arisen otherwise. This prevented the survey from eliciting responses as
they might occur spontaneously in the marketplace. Because of this and other
methodological flaws, the Luth Survey is entitled to little weight on the issue of
actual confusion.10

        Presented with no significantly probative evidence of actual confusion, the
district court properly weighed this factor in DoubleTap's favor.
D. Similarity in Products and Marketing

        Viewing the evidence in Hornady's favor, there is sufficient evidence to
establish that the parties produce similar products and market them in similar ways.
The district court correctly weighed this factor in Hornady's favor.
E. Consumer Care

        If consumers are likely to exercise a high degree of care in purchasing a
certain product, the likelihood of confusion is reduced. The district court credited
DoubleTap with this factor because consumers are not likely to purchase self-
defense ammunition carelessly. Hornady argues that it was entitled to a contrary
inference, i.e., that consumers purchase the products at issue with little care because
they are "relatively inexpensive." What is "relatively inexpensive" is hardly clear,
particularly without considerations of the quantity or frequency of consumers'
purchases. Nor do any of our cases take this price-determinative approach. Instead,
we focus "on the consumer's degree of care exercised at the time of purchase" and
ask whether the item is one commonly "purchased on impulse." Sally Beauty, 304
F.3d at 975. Even if the products in this case are "relatively inexpensive" at $13 to

          10 Hornady's expert concluded that, "[w]hile it is impossible to even come close to correcting for the

full extent of" the survey's methodological flaws, the results could nonetheless be manipulated in a way that

reliably demonstrated a likelihood of confusion. We do not believe that the survey's myriad flaws can be so

readily overlooked, especially considering that Hornady's expert did not take into account the leading nature

of the survey's questions.

                                                    339
$100 a box,12 Hornady has not presented any evidence that consumers commonly
succumb to impulses and purchase ammunition carelessly. Indeed, the district court
had before it an expert opinion that "the purchase of ammunition would constitute
a high involvement purchase decision, that is, one in which the consumer gives
careful consideration to both the products and brand names being offered." The
district court correctly weighed this factor in DoubleTap's favor.
F. Strength of the TAP Mark

         Likelihood of confusion depends partly on the senior mark's strength, i.e.,
its capacity to indicate the source of the goods with which it is used. Water Pik, 726
F.3d at 1151. Strength has two components: conceptual strength, or the mark's
place on the spectrum of distinctiveness; and commercial strength, or its level of
recognition in the marketplace. See King of the Mountain, 185 F.3d at 1093. The
district court concluded that Hornady's TAP mark was both conceptually and
commercially strong, and thus weighed the strength factor in Hornady's favor.

        1. Conceptual Strength
        . . . . The district court held that Hornady's mark was suggestive because the
definition of "tap" (to strike someone or something with a quick, light blow) and
the TAP acronym (Tactical Application Police) suggest the features of TAP
products. Although it calls that holding "defensible," DoubleTap argues that TAP is
merely descriptive.
        The determination whether a mark is descriptive or suggestive is difficult,
and we have endorsed a helpful test for distinguishing between the two categories:
suggestive terms "require the buyer to use thought, imagination, or perception to
connect the mark with the goods," whereas descriptive terms "directly convey to the
buyer the ingredients, qualities, or characteristics of the product." Water Pik, 726
F.3d at 1152-53 (internal quotation marks omitted). Granting all reasonable
inferences in Hornady's favor, we agree that "TAP" is suggestive of the features of
Hornady's products. "TAP" does not directly convey the characteristics of the
product, bullets, in a way that marks such as "After Tan post-tanning lotion" or "5
Minute glue" do. See George & Co. v. Imagination Entm't Ltd., 575 F.3d 383, 394 (4th
Cir.2009). Even when the acronym is defined, "TAP" requires the consumer to use
imagination to appreciate the nature of Hornady's product: police agencies are
frequent purchasers of ammunition; police are likely to seek out certain qualities in
the ammunition they purchase; a product targeted at police is likely to have these
qualities. TAP is thus suggestive and conceptually strong.
        2. Commercial Strength

          12 Hornady's products retail between $13 and $34, and DoubleTap's products retail between $30

and $100.

                                                    340
        Commercial strength is "the marketplace recognition value of the mark."
King of the Mountain, 185 F.3d at 1093. It is analogous to secondary meaning.13 We
have identified several factors as helpful in evaluating secondary meaning, including
direct evidence of recognition by consumers and circumstantial evidence regarding:
(1) the length and manner of the mark's use, (2) the nature and extent of advertising
and promotion of the mark, and (3) the efforts made to promote a conscious
connection, in the public's mind, between the mark and a particular product. The
district court concluded that Hornady's advertising efforts established the
commercial strength of its mark; DoubleTap challenges that conclusion.

        Viewing the evidence in Hornady's favor, we agree that TAP is commercially
strong. First, the TAP mark has been on the market nearly 17 years. Second, there
was evidence that Hornady spent hundreds of thousands of dollars advertising its
TAP products in numerous magazines, on two television channels, at several trade
shows, and on its two websites. These factors demonstrated that Hornady fostered a
conscious connection in the public's mind between the TAP mark and its products.

        Because TAP is conceptually and commercially strong, the district court
correctly weighed this factor in Hornady's favor.
G. Conclusion

        Reviewing the record de novo, we hold that two factors--strength of the
mark, and similarity of products and marketing--favor Hornady. The remaining
four factors favor DoubleTap. The tilt of the scales does not determine the issue.
However, the key inquiry, the similarity of the marks, strongly favors DoubleTap.
When this is combined with the high degree of care that consumers exercise when
purchasing ammunition, and the lack of evidence that DoubleTap intended to
deceive those consumers by copying Hornady's mark, it suggests that consumers are
unlikely to be confused. Hornady has not introduced meaningful evidence of actual
confusion to dispute this. Thus, Hornady has failed to raise a genuine factual issue
regarding the likelihood of confusion, and the district court properly awarded
summary judgment to DoubleTap.

        ****

        To what extent may similar trade dress produce a finding of likelihood of
confusion notwithstanding the existence of a contrasting label? The case below
provides one view. Before reading it, ask yourself if you think there is a likelihood of
consumer confusion. The competing spirits at issue look like this:

          13 Although secondary meaning is presumed, the fact that Hornady's mark is statutorily

incontestible does not resolve the commercial strength inquiry.

BOYCE F. MARTIN, JR., Circuit Judge.
        Justice Hugo Black once wrote, "I was brought up to believe that Scotch

whisky would need a tax preference to survive in competition with Kentucky
bourbon." Dep't of Revenue v. James B. Beam Distilling Co., 377 U.S. 341, 348-49
(1964) (Black, J., dissenting). While there may be some truth to Justice Black's
statement that paints Kentucky bourbon as such an economic force that its
competitors need government protection or preference to compete with it, it does
not mean a Kentucky bourbon distiller may not also avail itself of our laws to
protect its assets. This brings us to the question before us today: whether the
bourbon producer Maker's Mark Distillery, Inc.'s registered trademark consisting of
its signature trade dress element--a red dripping wax seal--is due protection, in the
form of an injunction, from a similar trade dress element on Casa Cuervo, S.A. de
C.V.'s Reserva de la Familia tequila bottles. We hold that it is. The judgments of
the district court in this trademark infringement case are AFFIRMED.

                                                 I.
        All bourbon is whiskey, but not all whiskey is bourbon.1 Whiskey, like other
distilled spirits, begins as a fermentable mash, composed of water and grains or
other fermentable ingredients. The mash is heated and then cooled, yeast is
introduced to ferment the sugars in the mash, and the yeast turns the sugars into
alcohol and carbon dioxide. This now-alcoholic liquid is then distilled to
concentrate the alcohol. GARY REGAN & MARDEE HAIDIN REGAN, THE BOURBON

COMPANION 32-33 (1998). The composition of the mash, and the aging, treating,
and flavoring of the distilled alcohol, determine the flavor, color, and character of
the distilled spirit. In the case of bourbon, the corn-based mash and aging in
charred new oak barrels impart a distinct mellow flavor and caramel color. Distillers
compete intensely on flavor, but also through branding and marketing; the history
of bourbon, in particular, illustrates why strong branding and differentiation is
important in the distilled spirits market.

        The legend of the birth of bourbon is not without controversy: "As many
counties of Kentucky claim the first production of Bourbon as Greek cities quarrel
over the birthplace of Homer." H.F. WILLKIE, BEVERAGE SPIRITS IN AMERICA--A
BRIEF HISTORY 19 (3d ed.1949). The generally accepted and oft-repeated story is
that "the first Bourbon whiskey ... made from a mash containing at least fifty
percent corn, is usually credited to a Baptist minister, The Reverend Elijah Craig, in
1789, at Georgetown, [Kentucky]," just prior to Kentucky's joining the Union as a
state in 1792. Id. But it is more likely that Kentucky whiskey was first distilled at
Fort Harrod, the first permanent European settlement in what is now Kentucky, in
1774. CHARLES K. COWDERY, BOURBON, STRAIGHT: THE UNCUT AND
UNFILTERED STORY OF AMERICAN WHISKEY 3-4 (2004); accord WILLKIE, supra, at
19. Kentucky's settlers distilled whiskey using methods similar to those "used in
Scotland and Ireland for hundreds of years," WILLKIE, supra, at 20, except that
Kentucky whiskey was made mostly from corn, a crop unknown to Europeans
before Columbus ventured to America. COWDERY, BOURBON, STRAIGHT, supra, at
2. Though "most [American] colonial whiskey was made from rye," id. at 3, corn was
easy to grow in Kentucky soil, and surplus corn was often used to make whiskey. Id.
at 4.

        The name "bourbon" itself is easier to trace: one of the original nine
counties of Kentucky was Bourbon County, WILLKIE, supra, at 20, named in honor
of the French royal family. Charles K. Cowdery, How Bourbon Whiskey Really Got Its
Famous Name, BOURBON COUNTRY READER, July 1996. "[Kentucky] whiskey was
shipped from Limestone, a riverside port in Bourbon County," down the Ohio river
to the Mississippi, bound for New Orleans. REGAN & REGAN, supra, at 14. Whiskey
shipped from the port in Bourbon County came to be known as "Old Bourbon,"
and later, simply "Bourbon," to distinguish it from Pennsylvania Rye or other
whiskeys. Cowdery, How Bourbon Whiskey Really Got Its Famous Name, supra. The
name "bourbon" at that time meant whiskey made from mostly corn in Kentucky or
points west. But it was likely not until "sometime between 1823 and ... 1845" that
Dr. James Crow "perfect[ed] the sour-mash method of whiskey-making"--the
dominant process in use today that, when coupled with aging in charred new oak
barrels, produces modern bourbon's familiar caramel color and distinctive taste.
REGAN & REGAN, supra, at 15.

                                                    343
        While in the early years "[w]hiskey was whiskey, as everybody knew," some
bourbon distillers began to brand their bourbons to capitalize on the differences
between "[g]ood Kentucky Bourbon" and all the rest. WILLKIE, supra, at 22. Dr.
Crow, a Kentuckian by way of Scotland, "insist[ed] upon strict sanitation in his
manufacture," and branded his bourbon with his name; other Kentucky families
followed suit in an effort to differentiate their products. Id. Crow's branding tactics
seem to have worked, as his bourbon accumulated prominent fans. For example,
bourbon drinker Ulysses S. Grant preferred Old Crow over other bourbons . . . .

        Success attracts imitators, and in the late nineteenth century "rectifiers"
began to crowd the market, selling "a product that they would call `Kentucky
Bourbon' using neutral spirits, flavoring agents and artificial coloring with only
some aged whiskey in the product." Mike Veach, The Taft Decision, THE FILSON,
Winter 2009, at 4. A hotly contested legal and lobbying war between the rectifiers
and traditional "straight whiskey" distillers erupted, culminating in President
William Taft's official interpretation, in 1909, of the 1906 Pure Food and Drug
Act; Taft's interpretation settled the question of what spirits could be labeled as
"whiskey." Id. The rectifiers lost and were required to label their product "imitation
whiskey." See id.; see also H. Parker Willis, What Whiskey Is, MCCLURE'S MAGAZINE,
1909-10, at 687-903. The ruling only increased distillers' incentives to differentiate
themselves and their products. "Before the Taft ruling, few brands were nationally
known.... But, under the new regulations, labels had to tell both the process and
materials of manufacture. Whiskey ... now began to appear under distinctive labels,
competing with other brands on its own merits." WILLKIE, supra, at 26. After
Prohibition was repealed, the distilled spirits industry consolidated and
matured . . . .

        In recognition of bourbon's unique place in American culture and
commerce, and in the spirit of the Taft decision, Congress in 1964 designated
bourbon as a "distinctive product[ ] of the United States," 27 C.F.R. § 5.22(l)(1),
and prescribed restrictions on which distilled spirits may bear the label "bourbon."
Federal regulations require that bourbon whiskey to, among other things, be aged in
charred new oak barrels, contain certain proportions of mash ingredients, and be
barreled and bottled at certain proofs. § 5.22(b). Importantly, whiskey made for
consumption within the United States cannot be called bourbon unless it is made
in the United States. § 5.22(l)(1). While bourbon is strongly associated with
Kentucky, and while "[ninety-five] percent of the world's supply of bourbon comes
from Kentucky," Jessie Halladay, Kentucky's Libation Vacations, COURIER-J., Feb. 26,
2012, at D1, some notable bourbons are made in other states.

        Maker's Mark occupies a central place in the modern story of bourbon. The
Samuels family, founder of the Maker's Mark distillery in Loretto, Kentucky, has
produced whiskey in Kentucky nearly continuously from the eighteenth century

                                                    344
through today. REGAN & REGAN, supra, at 161-62. Indeed, Robert Samuels (along
with Jacob Beam, Basil Hayden, and Daniel Weller, all of whose surnames are
familiar to bourbon connoisseurs) was one of Kentucky's early settlers. COWDERY,
BOURBON, STRAIGHT, supra, at 4. Bill Samuels, Sr. formulated the recipe for
Maker's Mark bourbon in 1953. His wife, Margie, conceived of the red dripping
wax seal and used the family deep fryer to perfect the process of applying it. The
company has bottled bourbon for commercial sale under the Maker's Mark name,
and has used a red dripping wax seal on its Maker's Mark bourbon bottles, since
1958. Maker's Mark, and craft bourbon generally, garnered national attention when
the Wall Street Journal published a front-page article about the bourbon, the red
dripping wax seal, and the family behind it. David P. Garino, Maker's Mark Goes
Against the Grain to Make its Mark, WALL ST. J., Aug. 1, 1980, at 1. In 1985, Maker's
Mark registered a trademark for the dripping-wax-seal element of its trade dress,
which it described as a "wax-like coating covering the cap of the bottle and trickling
down the neck of the bottle in a freeform irregular pattern." The trademark is silent
as to color, but Maker's Mark conceded in submissions before the district court that
it sought only to enforce it as applied to the red dripping wax seal.

        Jose Cuervo produced a premium tequila, "Reserva de la Familia," beginning
in 1995. The tequila bottle had a wax seal that was straight-edged and did not
initially feature drips. By 2001, Cuervo had begun selling this tequila in the United
States in bottles with a red dripping wax seal reminiscent of the Maker's Mark red
dripping wax seal. In 2003, Maker's Mark instituted this suit against Casa Cuervo
S.A. de C.V., Jose Cuervo International, Inc., Tequila Cuervo La Rojeña S.A. de
C.V., and Diageo North America, Inc. claiming state and federal trademark
infringement and federal trademark dilution; sometime thereafter, Cuervo
discontinued use of the red dripping wax seal and reverted to a red straight-edged
wax seal. In its suit, Maker's Mark sought damages, injunctions against dilution and
infringement, and costs. Cuervo counterclaimed for cancellation of the Maker's
Mark trademark.

        After a six-day bench trial, the district court found that Maker's Mark's red
dripping wax seal is a valid trademark and that Cuervo had infringed that
trademark. Based on those findings, the district court enjoined Cuervo permanently
"from using red dripping wax on the cap of a bottle in the sale, offering for sale,
distribution or advertising of Cuervo tequila products at any locality within the
United States." The district court found that Cuervo had not diluted the mark and
denied Maker's Mark's claim for damages; the district court also denied Cuervo's
counterclaim for cancellation of the mark. In a separate opinion, the district court
awarded Maker's Mark some of its costs.

        Cuervo appeals the district court's determination that the red dripping wax
seal is not aesthetically functional, some of the district court's factual findings, its

                                                    345
balancing of those findings in determining Cuervo had infringed, and its award of
some of Maker's Mark's costs. Cuervo does not appeal the scope of the injunction.

                                                 II.
                                A. Aesthetic Functionality
        [The court upheld the district court's conclusion that the wax seal is not
functional.]
                            B. Factual Findings under Frisch
        We have recognized four kinds of trademark infringement: palming off,
confusion of sponsorship (also known as "association"), reverse confusion of
sponsorship, and dilution. As the district court correctly noted, Maker's Mark
focuses on "confusion of sponsorship." Maker's Mark does not appeal the district
court's adverse ruling on its dilution claim. Confusion of sponsorship "occurs where
the goods do not directly compete. In this situation, the goods are unrelated enough
that no inference arises that they originated from the same source, but the similarity
of the trademarks erroneously suggests a connection between the sources." In any
case, a court considering a claim for trademark infringement must determine the
likelihood of consumer confusion. The factors the court should consider are: "1.
strength of the plaintiff's mark; 2. relatedness of the goods; 3. similarity of the
marks; 4. evidence of actual confusion; 5. marketing channels used; 6. likely degree
of purchaser care; 7. defendant's intent in selecting the mark; [and] 8. likelihood of
expansion of the product lines." Frisch's Rests., Inc. v. Elby's Big Boy, Inc., 670 F.2d
642, 648 (6th Cir.1982) (quoting Toho Co., Ltd. v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 645 F.2d
788, 790 (9th Cir.1981)).
        We review the district court's factual findings under Frisch for clear error. We
assess each factor with respect to the relevant consumer market; potential buyers of
the "junior" product (here, Cuervo's Reserva de la Familia) are the relevant
consumers. Cuervo appeals the district court's findings on only three of the eight
Frisch factors . . . .
        1. Strength
        To evaluate the strength factor under the Frisch analysis, this Court "focuses
on the distinctiveness of a mark and its recognition among the public." Therma-
Scan, Inc. v. Thermoscan, Inc., 295 F.3d 623, 631 (6th Cir.2002). One leading
commentator usefully characterizes this evaluation as encompassing two separate
components: (1) "conceptual strength," or "placement of the mark on the spectrum
of marks," which encapsulates the question of inherent distinctiveness; and (2)
"commercial strength" or "the marketplace recognition value of the mark." 2 J.
THOMAS MCCARTHY, MCCARTHY ON TRADEMARKS AND UNFAIR COMPETITION §
11.83 (4th ed.). In other words, "[a] mark is strong if it is highly distinctive, i.e., if
the public readily accepts it as the hallmark of a particular source; it can become so
because it is unique, because it has been the subject of wide and intensive

                                                    346
advertisement, or because of a combination of both." Homeowners Grp. v. Home
Mktg. Specialists, Inc., 931 F.2d 1100, 1107 (6th Cir.1991) (internal quotation marks
omitted).

        Because the strength of a trademark for purposes of the likelihood-of-
confusion analysis depends on the interplay between conceptual and commercial
strength, the existence of inherent distinctiveness is not the end of the inquiry. See
Therma-Scan, Inc., 295 F.3d at 631-32 (noting that a mark can be inherently
distinctive but not especially strong if it fails to attain broad public recognition);
Homeowners Grp., Inc., 931 F.2d at 1107 ("The District Court's finding that HMS
was an arbitrary and inherently distinctive mark is only a first step in determining
the strength of a mark in the marketplace."); see also MCCARTHY, supra § 11:83
("[T]he true relative strength of a mark can only fully be determined by weighing
[both] aspects of strength."). Thus, although inherent distinctiveness may provide
powerful support for the strength of a mark, the full extent of that support
nonetheless depends on the scope of commercial recognition.

        Here, the district court appropriately evaluated both components of the
strength factor. From the physical characteristics of the mark, the district court
specifically found the red dripping wax seal to be inherently distinctive based on its
uniqueness and its potential to "draw in the customer" in an unusual manner. This
finding of conceptual strength is bolstered by the mark's status as "incontestable,"
which entitles it to a presumption of strength, though the relative import of that
presumption within the overall strength analysis still requires an analysis of
"whether the mark is distinctive and well-known in the general population."
Therma-Scan, Inc., 295 F.3d at 632. As to commercial recognition, the district court
found the seal "acquired secondary meaning through fifty years of use, extensive
advertising and consumer recognition."3 The district court also found that Maker's
Mark's advertising was intensive, citing the extent of its advertising budget that
"focuses almost entirely on branding the red dripping wax," as well as the significant
public attention that the wax seal has received through the media. In further
support of these findings, the district court also cited studies showing significant
amounts of consumer dialogue about the brand, as well as a high level of
recognition among both whiskey drinkers and distilled-spirits drinkers more
generally.

        Cuervo argues that the district court erred in its evaluation of the strength of
the mark by (1) disregarding third-party use of red dripping wax seals; (2) failing to

          3 In light of the district court's finding that the mark is inherently distinctive, it did not need to

consider secondary meaning. The district court's findings on secondary meaning, however, are nonetheless

relevant to the broader questions of commercial recognition and overall strength.

                                                    347
give proper weight to the lack of a survey regarding recognition of the red dripping
wax seal; (3) relying in its analysis on Maker's Mark's advertisements without
apparent evidence of their dates or circulation; and (4) relying on evidence of the
strength of the mark in the overbroad group of distilled spirits drinkers instead of
prospective Reserva purchasers.

        We recognize that "extensive third-party uses of a trademark [may]
substantially weaken the strength of a mark." Homeowners Grp., 931 F.2d at 1108.
Contrary to Cuervo's argument, the district court did consider evidence of third-
party use of similar seals on distilled spirits, but rejected that evidence as limited
and unconvincing because it concerned seals used on all distilled spirits; the court
found that the relevant use of the seals is limited to the "relevant market," and not
among all distilled spirits. We agree with the district court's finding and reasoning.

        Next, while "survey evidence is the most direct and persuasive evidence" of
whether a mark has acquired secondary meaning, "consumer surveys ... are not a
prerequisite to establishing secondary meaning." Herman Miller, Inc., 270 F.3d at
312, 315 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Nor is such evidence
indispensable to the broader question of commercial recognition. In light of the
abundance of other evidence demonstrating market recognition, such as Maker's
Mark's extensive marketing efforts focusing on the red dripping wax seal and its
widespread publicity, it was not clear error for the district court to overlook the lack
of survey evidence because that evidence was not determinative of the strength of
the mark.

        As to the district court's consideration of advertising evidence, the district
court discussed the nature of the advertising and found that advertising efforts by
Maker's Mark usually focus directly on the red dripping wax seal. As the record and
the district court's opinion show, the district court had before it, and considered, an
abundance of Maker's Mark advertisements that specifically feature the red dripping
wax seal. Moreover, these advertisements were recent, relevant, and strong enough
to convince Business Week, in 2002, to declare the dripping wax seal "one of the
most recognizable branding symbols in the world," and CBS Sunday Morning, in
2008, to refer to the process by which the seal is applied as the "famous dip in red
sealing wax." These findings support the district court's ultimate conclusion
regarding the breadth of market recognition of Maker's Mark's trademarked red
dripping wax seal.

        Finally, as to the district court's discussion of evidence of the mark's strength
within the broader group of distilled spirits drinkers, the district court considered,
but did not rest its holding on, this evidence. Instead, the district court based its
holding primarily on the seal's "unique design and [Maker's Mark's] singular
marketing efforts." We therefore find no error here.

                                                    348
        In sum, none of Cuervo's arguments undermines the district court's finding
"that the Maker's Mark red dripping wax seal is an extremely strong mark due to its
unique design and the company's singular marketing efforts." We therefore
conclude that the district court did not clearly err in its evaluation of the strength of
the red dripping wax seal.

        2. Similarity
        In assessing similarity, "courts must determine whether a given mark would
confuse the public when viewed alone, in order to account for the possibility that
sufficiently similar marks may confuse consumers who do not have both marks
before them but who may have a general, vague, or even hazy, impression or
recollection of the other party's mark." Daddy's Junky Music Stores, Inc. v. Big Daddy's
Family Music Cntr., 109 F.3d 275, 283 (6th Cir.1997) (internal quotation marks
omitted). The district court found this factor "narrowly favor [s] Maker's Mark," and
found that, though "[v]ery few consumers ... would buy one product believing it was
the other," the seals were facially similar. The district court examined the two seals
and found that "nothing on the products other than the red dripping wax ... would
suggest an association between the two."
        Cuervo focuses its argument on the relevance of the house marks--product
labels identifying the name of the manufacturer--on the bottles. We have held that
the presence of a house mark can decrease the likelihood of confusion. Therma-
Scan, Inc., 295 F.3d at 634 ("[T]he presence of [a house mark on a product] does not
eliminate the similarity between the trademarks. Instead, this labeling diminishes
the likelihood of confusion created by the comparable marks and reduces the
importance of this factor."); AutoZone, Inc. v. Tandy Corp., 373 F.3d 786, 797 (6th
Cir.2004) ("The co-appearance of a junior mark and a house mark is not dispositive
of dissimilarity, but it is persuasive."). The district court concluded that this
consideration is not "as important in an association case, when the two products are
related enough that one might associate with or sponsor the other and still use their
own house mark."
        In AutoZone, we found that the proximity of the Radio Shack house mark to
the "POWERZONE" mark would alleviate any confusion between POWERZONE
and AUTOZONE marks. AutoZone does not, however, stand for the proposition
that the presence of a house mark always has significant weight in the similarity
analysis; it merely states that presence of a house mark is a factor to be considered in
the evaluation of similarity and, depending on the facts of the case, may be
significant to the overall likelihood of confusion. AutoZone, Inc., 373 F.3d at 796-
97. Furthermore, the district court's analysis in this case highlights two factors that
diminish the significance of the house marks in the present context. First, testimony
in the record indicates that many consumers are unaware of the affiliations between
brands of distilled spirits, and that some companies produce multiple types of

                                                    349
distilled spirits, which supports the district court's assessment here. Second, the
presence of a house mark, as the district court correctly noted, is more significant in
a palming off case than in an association case--as the district court reasoned, in an
association case "when the two products are related enough ... one might associate
with or sponsor the other and still use their own house mark." Accordingly, the
district court did not clearly err in its factual findings under this factor, and we
adopt its findings.

        3. Actual Confusion
        The district court stated that "neither party produced meaningful evidence
related to actual confusion" and concluded that the lack of evidence was "neutral."
The district court reasoned that, though evidence of actual confusion might have
been obtainable if it existed, Cuervo sold Reserva for a limited time and in limited
quantities, and so the district court did not place weight on the fact that Maker's
Mark did not furnish "meaningful" evidence of actual confusion. Despite Cuervo's
arguments to the contrary, this finding falls squarely within this Circuit's case law.
Though "[e]vidence of actual confusion is undoubtedly the best evidence of
likelihood of confusion ... a lack of such evidence is rarely significant." Daddy's, 109
F.3d at 284 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Here, the Reserva
product was sold for a short time and in limited quantities; under these
circumstances, it is reasonable that no meaningful evidence of actual confusion was
available. The district court did not clearly err in finding the lack of actual
confusion evidence non-determinative, and we adopt its findings.

                             C. Balancing the Frisch Factors
        We "review de novo the legal question of whether [the district court's Frisch
factual findings] constitute a likelihood of confusion." Tumblebus Inc., 399 F.3d at
764. Because we find above that the district court did not reversibly err in its factual
findings on the three disputed factors--strength, similarity, and actual confusion--
and because the parties do not dispute the district court's factual findings under the
remaining five factors, we adopt all of the district court's factual findings and
balance them de novo.
        1. Strength. The district court found the evidence of the strength of the
mark heavily favored Maker's Mark. We have held that the strength of the mark
supplies the weight it should be accorded in balancing. In general, "[t]he stronger
the mark, all else equal, the greater the likelihood of confusion." AutoZone, 373 F.3d
at 794 (alteration in original) (quoting Homeowners Grp., Inc., 931 F.2d at 1107).
Because the district court found the mark at issue here to be "extremely strong," the
strength factor is weighed very heavily.
        2. Relatedness of the goods. The district court found the goods were
somewhat related because they were part of the same broad category of high-end
distilled spirits, but not fully related because the Cuervo product was priced at $100

                                                    350
per bottle, while Maker's Mark sold for $24 per bottle. Where the goods are
"somewhat related but not competitive, the likelihood of confusion will turn on
other factors." Daddy's, 109 F.3d at 282. Here, the district court found that the
products are somewhat related. We accord this factor little weight because the
products are competitive only within a very broad category and are only somewhat
related; it is thus more appropriate to concentrate the weight of our balancing
analysis on other factors.

        3. Similarity. The district court found the similarity factor "narrowly
favors Maker's [Mark]." "The similarity of the senior and junior marks is `a factor of
considerable weight.'" AutoZone, 373 F.3d at 795.

        4. Actual confusion. As discussed above, "a lack of such evidence is
rarely significant, and the factor of actual confusion is weighted heavily only where
there is evidence of past confusion, or perhaps, when the particular circumstances
indicate such evidence should have been available." Daddy's, 109 F.3d at 284. The
district court found that this factor was neutral. As we noted, the Reserva product
was sold for a short time and in limited quantities; under these circumstances, we
give the lack of evidence of actual confusion little weight.

        5. Marketing channels used by the parties. The court found the
channels "similar in some ways and dissimilar in others. Perhaps this factor
marginally favors Maker's Mark." The weight of this factor will not add much to a
finding of infringement because of the equivocal nature of the district court's
factual findings. We accord this factor very little weight.

        6. Likely degree of purchaser care. The district court found this factor
"clearly favors" Cuervo because of the degree of care potential tequila customers
would exercise in purchasing a $100 bottle of Reserva; knowledgeable bourbon
customers would also exercise similar care and, further, know that Maker's Mark
sells only one kind of liquor. This factor, though strongly in favor of Cuervo, is not
dispositive. "[C]onfusingly similar marks may lead a purchaser who is extremely
careful and knowledgeable ... to assume nonetheless that the seller is affiliated with
or identical to the other party." For these reasons, we give this factor substantial
weight.

        7. Intent. The district court found Cuervo did not intend to infringe,
but we give no weight to this finding because "[i]ntent is an issue whose resolution
may benefit only the cause of the senior user, not of an alleged infringer." Leelanau,
502 F.3d at 520 (internal quotation marks omitted).

        8. Likelihood of expansion of product lines. The district court found
this factor was neutral where neither party put forth evidence of significant
expansion plans. Because a "strong possibility that either party will expand his
business to compete with the other ... will weigh in favor of finding that the present
use is infringing," Daddy's, 109 F.3d at 287 (internal quotation marks omitted), a

                                                    351
finding of little evidence of expansion plans is accorded little to no weight, but does
not weigh against Maker's Mark, who, by this test, would benefit by any significant
evidentiary showing under this factor, no matter which of the parties intended to
expand. For these reasons, we give this factor no weight.

        The balance of the factors compels a finding of infringement. Excluding the
neutral factors, the majority of the factors--strength, relatedness of the goods,
similarity, and marketing channels--favor Maker's Mark. The district court found
that Maker's Mark's trademark is "extremely strong," and we have adopted that
finding. Further, we have said that the "most important Frisch factors" are similarity
and strength of the mark, Gray v. Meijer, Inc., 295 F.3d 641, 646 (6th Cir.2002);
both of these factors favor Maker's Mark. The "likely degree of purchaser care"
factor "clearly" favors Cuervo. Though this factor is given substantial weight, this
factor alone cannot override the "extreme" strength of the mark that, when coupled
with similarity (which itself is given "considerable weight"), and combined with the
two other factors weighing in favor of Maker's Mark, together favor a finding of
infringement. Buttressing this determination is that, in its briefing, Cuervo
complains of errors in the district court's factual determinations, but does not argue
that, even given the factual findings made by the district court, a de novo balancing
under Frisch should come out in Cuervo's favor. While Cuervo disputes the factual
findings themselves and the related outcome of the balancing, it does not argue that
the weight given the factors should have been different.

        We conclude that there is a likelihood of confusion between the products
and that Cuervo has infringed. . . .

                                              Notes

        The effect of labels. As Maker's Mark demonstrates, a distinguishing label does
not automatically excuse similar trade dress. Why do you think the contrasting label
was not enough here? A distinct label will often suffice. For examples of cases in
both directions, see 4 MCCARTHY § 23:53.

        What kind of confusion? Taking the court's opinion at face value, what is the
harm to Maker's Mark of the defendant's conduct? Will it result in lost sales?
Diminished reputation? Something else? The court treats the plaintiff's claim as
alleging sponsorship confusion, something rather broader than source confusion.
What is the difference? How does a claim of this sort further the goals of trademark
law? Or does it?

        If trademark law should entertain such claims, how should it do so? Is the
multifactor likelihood-of-confusion test a useful tool for this purpose? Note, for
example, the court's treatment of the consumer sophistication factor.

16. Broadened theories of confusion

Trademark infringement in non-identical markets

        What is the harm of consumer confusion to the mark holder? Perhaps a lost
sale, but what if the mark holder does not sell goods in the same market as the
defendant? For example, if I brand a loaf of bread COCA-COLA and someone buys
it thinking that COCA-COLA is the sponsor, there is no lost sale to the trademark
holder. Should it still be permitted to sue?

        Today, trademark law's answer is clearly yes. This once was a controversial
point. Many old cases refused to permit trademark/unfair competition claims when
the mark users were not in the same market. In Borden Ice Cream Co v. Borden's
Condensed Milk Co., 201 F. 510 (7th Cir. 1912), for example, the court refused to
enjoin the "Borden's Ice Cream Company" notwithstanding the prior fame of the
Borden's Condensed Milk Company and the Borden name for milk and milk
products. The court acknowledged that "[t]he trade-name `Borden,' or the word
`Borden,' constitutes one of the principal assets of the appellee, and is widely known
and identified with the good will and public favor enjoyed by it throughout the
United States." Nonetheless, "the old company ... never has manufactured what is
known as commercial ice cream. The new company ... was incorporated for the sole
purpose of manufacturing and putting on the market such an article." The
difference in markets was enough to protect the defendant from action. To be sure,
not all early twentieth cases took so strict a view of market proximity, and gradually
courts came around to the view that plaintiffs may suffer a harm even if they do not
serve the same market as the defendant. In Yale Electric Corp. v. Robertson, 26 F.2d
972, 974 (2d Cir. 1928), Learned Hand explained:

        [I]t has of recent years been recognized that a merchant may have a sufficient
        economic interest in the use of his mark outside the field of his own
        exploitation to justify interposition by a court. His mark is his authentic seal;
        by it he vouches for the goods which bear it; it carries his name for good or
        ill. If another uses it, he borrows the owner's reputation, whose quality no
        longer lies within his own control. This is an injury, even though the
        borrower does not tarnish it, or divert any sales by its use; for a reputation,
        like a face, is the symbol of its possessor and creator, and another can use it
        only as a mask. And so it has come to be recognized that, unless the
        borrower's use is so foreign to the owner's as to insure against any
        identification of the two, it is unlawful.

                                                    353
        Today, it is clear that the senior and junior user of a mark need not be in the
same market for trademark infringement to occur (though, as we have seen, market
proximity is a factor in determining whether confusion is likely). This is partially an
evolution in the case law, but it also reflects the Lanham Act's text. 15 U.S.C. §
1125(a) (providing liability for likelihood of confusion as to sponsorship or approval
of a mark). Sometimes courts slip on this point, but they are corrected. Team Tires
Plus, Ltd. v. Tires Plus, Inc., 394 F.3d 831, 833-34 (10th Cir. 2005) (explaining that
view of trademark as only policing use on directly competing goods "is no longer
good law. Although this notion survived into the early 1900s, it has long since been
superseded" and that the "district court was wrong to treat this factor as dispositive
simply because the defendant did not use the mark on competing goods").

        Although the case law is now settled, it is worth thinking about why market
proximity is no longer required. What exactly is the harm to the consumer of
buying COCA-COLA bread under the mistaken belief that the source is the same as
the source of the soda? What is the harm to the soda maker? What assumptions
about the world must be true for these harms to exist? For scholarship questioning
some of the assumptions courts are making, see Mark A. Lemley & Mark P.
McKenna, Owning Markets, 109 MICH. L. REV. 137 (2010).

Confusion beyond the point of sale

                Au-Tomotive Gold, Inc. v. Volkswagen of America, Inc.
                                457 F.3d 1062 (9th Cir. 2006)

McKEOWN, Circuit Judge.
        [The facts were set forth in our earlier reading on aesthetic functionality.

Having concluded that a functionality argument was unavailable to defendants, the
court went on to consider whether there was likely consumer confusion.]

        Although we conclude that Volkswagen and Audi's registered trademarks are
not "functional," and thus are protectable, it remains to be determined whether
Auto Gold is infringing those marks . . . .

        It is undisputed that Volkswagen and Audi own the registered trademarks at
issue, and that Auto Gold uses those trademarks in commerce, without their
consent, and in connection with the sale of goods. Thus, as with many infringement
claims, the central issue is whether Auto Gold's use of the marks is "likely to cause
confusion" within the meaning of the Lanham Act.

        Before us on appeal are the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment on
the issue of trademark infringement, and in particular, the district court's
determination that Volkswagen and Audi had not offered any evidence showing a
likelihood of confusion. We review de novo the district court's decision on
summary judgment. Because the likelihood of confusion is often a fact-intensive

                                                    354
inquiry, courts are generally reluctant to decide this issue at the summary judgment
stage. However, in cases where the evidence is clear and tilts heavily in favor of a
likelihood of confusion, we have not hesitated to affirm summary judgment on this
point. As part of our de novo review, we conclude as a matter of law that likelihood
of confusion is clear cut here and that Volkswagen and Audi have made out a prima
facie case of infringement. We do not direct judgment on this issue, however,
because the district court reserved judgment on Auto Gold's defense of "first sale."
The case must be remanded for consideration of Auto Gold's defenses.

        A "[l]ikelihood of confusion `exists when customers viewing [a] mark would
probably assume that the product or service it represents is associated with the source
of a different product or service identified by a similar mark.' " Fuddruckers, Inc. v.
Doc's B.R. Others, Inc., 826 F.2d 837, 845 (9th Cir.1987) (quoting Lindy Pen Co. v. Bic
Pen Corp., 725 F.2d 1240, 1243 (9th Cir.1984)). The Ninth Circuit employs an
eight-factor test (the "Sleekcraft " factors) to determine the likelihood of confusion:
(1) strength of the mark(s); (2) relatedness of the goods; (3) similarity of the marks;
(4) evidence of actual confusion; (5) marketing channels; (6) degree of consumer
care; (7) defendant's intent; (8) likelihood of expansion. Surfvivor Media, Inc. v.
Survivor Productions, 406 F.3d 625, 631 (9th Cir.2005); see also AMF Inc. v. Sleekcraft
Boats, 599 F.2d 341, 348-49 (9th Cir.1979). These elements are not applied
mechanically; courts may examine some or all of the factors, depending on their
relevance and importance. See Surfvivor, 406 F.3d at 631; Thane Int'l, 305 F.3d at
901 ("The list of factors is not a score-card--whether a party wins a majority of the
factors is not the point. Nor should the factors be rigidly weighed; we do not count
beans.") (internal punctuation and citations omitted).

        This case presents an easy analysis in terms of likelihood of confusion. The
Volkswagen and Audi marks, which are registered and have been in use for more
than fifty years, are strong, distinctive marks, the first factor in the Sleekcraft analysis.
Auto Gold's products, which incorporate exact copies of those marks, compete with
accessories sold by Volkswagen and Audi through their licensed marketers, and are
related10 to Volkswagen and Audi's primary goods--cars. Although Volkswagen and
Audi license their marks to third parties, and Auto Gold sells its products to the
wholesale market, the ultimate consumers are the same. In fact, according to Auto
Gold, it is a very specific sub-group of consumers that wants either Auto Gold's or
Volkswagen and Audi's accessories--Audi or Volkswagen car owners who want
accessories to match their cars. Thus, in addition to being related products bearing
identical marks, the products at issue are destined for the same buyers.

          10 "Related goods are `products which would be reasonably thought by the buying public to come

from the same source if sold under the same mark.' " Sleekcraft, 599 F.2d at 348 n. 10 (quoting Standard

Brands, Inc. v. Smidler, 151 F.2d 34, 37 (2d Cir.1945)).

                                                    355
        We turn next to the degree of consumer care. Confusion is less likely where
buyers exercise care and precision in their purchases, such as for expensive or
sophisticated items. In evaluating this factor, we consider "the typical buyer
exercising ordinary caution." Sleekcraft, 599 F.2d at 353. The class of products Auto
Gold sells are relatively inexpensive and unsophisticated, and do not require a great
deal of precision or care to fulfill their purpose. This factor favors Volkswagen and
Audi.

        Evaluation of Auto Gold's intent in using the mark is the seventh factor.
"When the alleged infringer knowingly adopts a mark similar to another's,
reviewing courts presume that the defendant can accomplish his purpose: that is,
that the public will be deceived." Id. at 354. Auto Gold knowingly and intentionally
appropriated the exact trademarks of Volkswagen and Audi. Auto Gold argues,
however, that it does not "intend" to deceive the public as to the source of the
goods, but merely sought to fill a market demand for auto accessories bearing the
marks. This argument is simply a recasting of aesthetic functionality. Even if we
credit Auto Gold's proffered lack of intent, the direct counterfeiting undermines
this argument. This factor tips against Auto Gold.

        Finally, we examine the factor that is hotly contested by the parties--evidence
of actual confusion. Despite the debate, there is no material issue of fact. The
district court correctly noted that Volkswagen and Audi offered no evidence of
actual confusion. The question, then, is what is the legal significance of this
uncontested fact?

        As we noted in Brookfield Communications, Inc. v. West Coast Entertainment
Corp., "[t]he failure to prove instances of actual confusion is not dispositive against a
trademark plaintiff, because actual confusion is hard to prove; difficulties in
gathering evidence of actual confusion make its absence generally unnoteworthy."
174 F.3d 1036, 1050 (9th Cir.1999). In this case, which involves a national market
and a low degree of consumer care, nothing suggests that the lack of evidence of
confusion should be particularly noteworthy. Compare Cohn v. Petsmart, Inc., 281
F.3d 837, 842-43 (9th Cir.2002) (ascribing some significance to the lack of evidence
of confusion where "the parties used the same trademark in the same city for six
years," and the product at issue, veterinary services, was one for which consumers
are "particularly attentive.").

        Auto Gold suggests that the disclaimers on its packaging dispel any potential
for confusion. Courts have been justifiably skeptical of such devices--particularly
when exact copying is involved. See, e.g., Pebble Beach, 155 F.3d at 543 (upholding
lower court determination that disclaimers were "inadequate where present and ...
absent from the majority of advertisements and promotional materials"), superseded
on other grounds as recognized in Eppendorf-Netheler-Hinz, 289 F.3d at 356; Int'l Kennel
Club of Chicago, Inc. v. Mighty Star, Inc., 846 F.2d 1079, 1093 (7th Cir.1988)

                                                    356
("[W]here the infringement in issue is a verbatim copying ... plaintiff's reputation
and goodwill should not be rendered forever dependent on the effectiveness of
fineprint disclaimers often ignored by consumers.").

        Even if disclaimers may in some cases limit the potential for confusion, here
they do not. Auto Gold's disclaimers were neither consistent nor comprehensive.
We note, preliminarily, that the effectiveness of these disclaimers is undercut by
their sometimes contradictory messages. For example, some labels placed on the
cardboard inner lining of the license plate covers state that the product "may or may
not" be dealer approved. Visible through the clear cellophane outer wrapping, these
disclaimers are sometimes next to disclaimers stating "[t]his product is not endorsed,
manufactured, or licensed by the vehicle manufacturer." There are also messages on
Auto Gold's website that identify their products generally as "Factory authorized
licensed products."

        More importantly, "[t]he law in the Ninth Circuit is clear that `post-purchase
confusion,' i.e., confusion on the part of someone other than the purchaser who, for
example, simply sees the item after it has been purchased, can establish the required
likelihood of confusion under the Lanham Act." Karl Storz Endoscopy-Am., Inc. v.
Surgical Techs., Inc., 285 F.3d 848, 854 (9th Cir.2002); Levi Strauss & Co. v. Blue Bell,
Inc., 632 F.2d 817, 822 (9th Cir.1980) (affirming a finding of infringement against a
jeans maker, and noting that "point of sale materials [such as disclaimers] are
removed by the purchaser and have no confusion-obviating effect when the pants
are worn").11 Shorn of their disclaimer-covered packaging, Auto Gold's products
display no indication visible to the general public that the items are not associated
with Audi or Volkswagen. The disclaimers do nothing to dispel post-purchase
confusion.

        In sum, Volkswagen and Audi do not present evidence of actual confusion.
Neither, however, does Auto Gold present evidence that the disclaimers have any
effect. At best, the confusion factor is in equipoise.

        In the final analysis, we must consider the Sleekcraft factors as a whole to
determine whether a likelihood of confusion results from Auto Gold's use of the
marks. Although we do not bean count, it is significant that six of the eight
Sleekcraft factors support a likelihood of confusion; the remaining two are either

          11 This definition of confusion reflects the 1962 amendments to § 1114 that broadened the
definition of actionable confusion to include non-purchasers (such as those seeing an item of clothing on the
street), through deletion of language that limited such confusion to "purchasers as to the source or origin of

such goods or services." Pub.L. 87-772 (1962).

                                                    357
neutral or irrelevant.12 Most importantly, the strength of Volkswagen and Audi's
marks, Auto Gold's intentional and exact copying of the marks, and the direct
competition for a specific and limited consumer group, all weigh heavily in favor of
a likelihood of confusion. Our Sleekcraft analysis benefits from a record developed
through lengthy discovery, and the key facts are undisputed. Volkswagen and Audi
have established a prima facie "exclusive right to use the ... mark in commerce." 15
U.S.C. § 1115(b). Accordingly, we reverse the district court's denial of summary
judgment in favor of Volkswagen and Audi on the issue of infringement and
remand for consideration of the "first sale" defense and any other related claims or
defenses.

                   Hermes Intern. v. Lederer de Paris Fifth Ave., Inc.
                                 219 F.3d 104 (2d Cir. 2000)

TELESCA, Senior United States District Judge:
        . . .
        Appellant Hermès is a manufacturer and retailer of high-quality handbags

and other fashion accessories. According to Hermès, its products incorporate a
number of distinctive design characteristics that constitute its "famous mark and
trade dress." Hermès, 50 F.Supp.2d at 215. Detailed descriptions of these items are
found in the district court's opinion.

        Appellees Lederer and Artbag sell replicas of various Hermès products such
as the "Kelly Bag," a handcrafted purse with an average selling price of over $5,000,
with some models selling for over $30,000. Some of the knockoff bags sold by
Lederer sell for as much as $27,000.00.

        According to the record, Hermès knew that Lederer and Artbag had been
selling copies of Kelly bags since at least 1979 and 1989 respectively. Hermès
claimed, however, that it did not become fully aware of the scope of the appellees'
alleged infringement until 1996, when it began investigating Lederer and Artbag's
sales of knockoff Hermès products. According to Hermès, its investigation revealed
that Lederer and Artbag were selling entire lines of knockoff Hermès products. In
1998, upon completion of its investigation, Hermès brought suit against the
appellees pursuant to Section 32 of the Lanham Act of 1946, 15 U.S.C. § 1114;
Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a); Section 43(c) of the Lanham
Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1125(c); New York General Business Law § 360-1; and New York

          12 The final factor, "[a] likelihood of expansion in product lines," warrants no discussion as it is

"relatively unimportant where two companies already compete to a significant extent." Brookfield Commc'ns,

174 F.3d at 1060. The record reflects that Volkswagen and Audi compete through their licensees with Auto

Gold with respect to the products at issue in this suit.

                                                    358
common law seeking monetary and injunctive relief for the alleged violation of its
trademarks and trade dress.

        . . . . The district court found . . . that Hermès had unreasonably delayed
bringing an infringement suit against Lederer and Artbag, and thus was barred by
the doctrine of laches from obtaining monetary or injunctive relief against those
companies. The district court determined that the delay of between 9 and 19 years
in bringing suit against Lederer and Artbag was unreasonable and prejudiced the
appellees. Accordingly, the district court granted appellees' motions for summary
judgment with respect to Hermès' claims for monetary damages and injunctive
relief. . . .

        In evaluating whether laches should bar Hermès request for injunctive relief,
the district court began by noting that "the balance of the equities must be weighed,
including an analysis of defendants' intent and the public interest." The court then
determined that because appellees Lederer and Artbag did not use the name
"Hermès" on their products and because they openly acknowledged to customers
that their products were Hermès copies, the appellees had not deceptively attempted
to "pass off" or "palm off" their products as genuine Hermès. However, the court
also found that by explicitly informing their customers that the style and
workmanship of the knock-offs were such that no third party observer would be able
to tell they were not genuine Hermès bags, the appellees had "attempt[ed] to
encourage consumer confusion in the post-sale context." The court went on to
consider the public interest and concluded that, although the behavior of appellees
Artbag and Lederer might have increased their companies' sales at the expense of
Hermès, it did not harm the public in the post-sale context and therefore did not
compel rejection of the laches defense.

        In so holding, the district court misapplied the law governing the doctrine of
laches. It is well established that "laches is not a defense against injunctive relief
when the defendant intended the infringement." Harlequin Enters. Ltd. v. Gulf & W.
Corp., 644 F.2d 946, 950 (2d Cir.1981). This good-faith component of the laches
doctrine is part of the fundamental principle that "he who comes into equity must
come with clean hands." Precision Instrument Mfg. Co. v. Automotive Maintenance
Mach. Co., 324 U.S. 806, 814 (1945). Thus, the appellees' intentional infringement
is a dispositive, threshold inquiry that bars further consideration of the laches
defense, not a mere factor to be weighed in balancing the equities, as the district
court did in this case.

        Viewing the record in a light most favorable to Hermès, it is clear that
appellees Lederer and Artbag intentionally copied Hermès' designs and sought to
sell knockoffs of Hermès originals. Appellees thus intentionally traded off the
Hermès name and protected products and should not have been entitled to invoke
the doctrine of laches as a defense against Hermès' claims for injunctive relief.

                                                    359
        The district court's ruling that Hermès' claims should be barred by the
doctrine of laches was based, in part, on the erroneous conclusion that the
appellees' conduct did not create confusion among consumers or harm the public.
Trademark laws exist to protect the public from confusion. The creation of
confusion in the post-sale context can be harmful in that if there are too many
knockoffs in the market, sales of the originals may decline because the public is
fearful that what they are purchasing may not be an original. Furthermore, the
public may be deceived in the resale market if it requires expertise to distinguish
between an original and a knockoff. Finally, the purchaser of an original is harmed
by the widespread existence of knockoffs because the high value of originals, which
derives in part from their scarcity, is lessened.

        The Eleventh Circuit concisely summarized the theory behind protecting the
public interest in trademark cases:

         It ... is important to recognize that the enforcement of trademark laws
         benefits consumers even in cases where there is no possibility that
         consumers will be defrauded. For, to the extent that trademarks provide a
         means for the public to distinguish between manufacturers, they also
         provide incentives for manufacturers to provide quality goods. Traffickers of
         these counterfeit goods, however, attract some customers who would
         otherwise purchase the authentic goods. Trademark holders' returns to
         their investments in quality are thereby reduced. This reduction in profits
         may cause trademark holders to decrease their investments in quality below
         what they would spend were there no counterfeit goods. This in turn harms
         those consumers who wish to purchase higher quality goods.

United States v. Torkington, 812 F.2d 1347, 1353 n. 6 (11th Cir.1987) (citation
omitted).

        Here, the district court erred in finding that no confusion resulted from
appellees' conduct. Although the district court found no evidence of point-of-sale
confusion, it failed to properly consider the issue of post-sale confusion. We have
previously held that post-sale confusion can occur when a manufacturer of knockoff
goods offers consumers a cheap knockoff copy of the original manufacturer's more
expensive product, thus allowing a buyer to acquire the prestige of owning what
appears to be the more expensive product. Mastercrafters Clock & Radio Co. v.
Vacheron & Constantin-Le Coultre Watches, Inc., 221 F.2d 464, 466 (2d Cir.1955). See
also Insty*Bit, Inc. v. Poly-Tech Indus., Inc., 95 F.3d 663, 672 (8th Cir.1996); Payless
Shoesource, Inc. v. Reebok Int'l Ltd., 998 F.2d 985, 989 (Fed.Cir.1993); Polo Fashions,
Inc. v. Craftex, Inc., 816 F.2d 145, 148 (4th Cir.1987). In Mastercrafters, we held that
the practice of selling a knockoff wall clock at a cheaper price than the original

                                                    360
created an actionable harm despite the fact that customers knew they were buying
the knockoff because:

         At least some customers would buy [the copier's] cheaper clock for the
         purpose of acquiring the prestige gained by displaying what many visitors at
         the customers' homes would regard as a prestigious article. [The copier's]
         wrong thus consisted of the fact that such a visitor would be likely to
         assume that the clock was an Atmos clock.... [T]he likelihood of such
         confusion suffices to render [the copier's] conduct actionable.

        That is precisely what has occurred in this case. The district court, however,
dismissed the importance of post-sale confusion by stating that:

         [w]hile defendants' exploitation of the possibility of post-sale confusion may
         increase their sales at the expense of Hermès, I am not convinced that
         defendants' activity harms the public in the post-sale context. While Hermès'
         potential high-end customers may be confused in the post-sale context,
         these highly sophisticated purchasers will not be confused at the point of
         sale.

50 F.Supp.2d at 226 (emphasis in original).
        Such a practice does harm the public, however, by creating post-sale

confusion, not just among high-end consumers, but among the general public,
which may believe that the knockoff is actually the genuine article. In fact, high-end
consumers may be less confused than the general public in the post-sale context
because many of them will be aware of the existence of copies. In either case, a loss
occurs when a sophisticated buyer purchases a knockoff and passes it off to the
public as the genuine article, thereby confusing the viewing public and achieving the
status of owning the genuine article at a knockoff price. Accordingly, we find that
the district court erred in finding no harm to the public in the continued sale of
knockoff goods by appellees. . . .

O'SCANNLAIN, Circuit Judge:
        [The case involves litigation over the trademark "MovieBuff." The litigants

are a provider of information about the entertainment industry (Brookfield) and a
chain of video stores (West Coast). Brookfield used "MovieBuff" as a mark for a
searchable database of entertainment-related information. West Coast employed the
mark in multiple ways. One of them was a word in the hidden text--or metatags--of
its website, which would allow West Coast's site to be returned as a response to a
search-engine inquiry for the word "moviebuff" (if the search engine in question

Brookfield owned the mark, the court turned to the various infringement claims,
including to the claim based on metatag use.]

        So far we have considered only West Coast's use of the domain name
"moviebuff.com." Because Brookfield requested that we also preliminarily enjoin
West Coast from using marks confusingly similar to "MovieBuff" in metatags and
buried code, we must also decide whether West Coast can, consistently with the
trademark and unfair competition laws, use "MovieBuff" or "moviebuff.com" in its
HTML code.23

        At first glance, our resolution of the infringement issues in the domain name
context would appear to dictate a similar conclusion of likelihood of confusion with
respect to West Coast's use of "moviebuff.com" in its metatags. Indeed, all eight
likelihood of confusion factors outlined in Part V-A--with the possible exception of
purchaser care, which we discuss below--apply here as they did in our analysis of
domain names; we are, after all, dealing with the same marks, the same products
and services, the same consumers, etc. Disposing of the issue so readily, however,
would ignore the fact that the likelihood of confusion in the domain name context
resulted largely from the associational confusion between West Coast's domain
name "moviebuff.com" and Brookfield's trademark "MovieBuff." The question in
the metatags context is quite different. Here, we must determine whether West
Coast can use "MovieBuff" or "moviebuff.com" in the metatags of its web site at
"westcoastvideo.com" or at any other domain address other than "moviebuff.com"
(which we have determined that West Coast may not use).

        Although entering "MovieBuff" into a search engine is likely to bring up a
list including "westcoastvideo.com" if West Coast has included that term in its
metatags, the resulting confusion is not as great as where West Coast uses the
"moviebuff.com" domain name. First, when the user inputs "MovieBuff" into an
Internet search engine, the list produced by the search engine is likely to include
both West Coast's and Brookfield's web sites. Thus, in scanning such list, the Web
user will often be able to find the particular web site he is seeking. Moreover, even if
the Web user chooses the web site belonging to West Coast, he will see that the
domain name of the web site he selected is "westcoastvideo.com." Since there is no
confusion resulting from the domain address, and since West Coast's initial web

          23 [M]etatags are HTML code not visible to Web users but used by search engines in determining

which sites correspond to the keywords entered by a Web user. Although Brookfield never explained what it

meant by "buried code," the leading trademark treatise explains that "buried code" is another term for the

HTML code that is used by search engines but that is not visible to users. See 3 McCarthy, supra, at § 25:69

n. 1. We will use the term metatags as encompassing HTML code generally.

                                                    362
page prominently displays its own name, it is difficult to say that a consumer is likely
to be confused about whose site he has reached or to think that Brookfield
somehow sponsors West Coast's web site.

        Nevertheless, West Coast's use of "moviebuff.com" in metatags will still
result in what is known as initial interest confusion. Web surfers looking for
Brookfield's "MovieBuff" products who are taken by a search engine to
"westcoastvideo.com" will find a database similar enough to "MovieBuff" such that
a sizeable number of consumers who were originally looking for Brookfield's
product will simply decide to utilize West Coast's offerings instead. Although there
is no source confusion in the sense that consumers know they are patronizing West
Coast rather than Brookfield, there is nevertheless initial interest confusion in the
sense that, by using "moviebuff.com" or "MovieBuff" to divert people looking for
"MovieBuff" to its web site, West Coast improperly benefits from the goodwill that
Brookfield developed in its mark. Recently in Dr. Seuss, we explicitly recognized that
the use of another's trademark in a manner calculated "to capture initial consumer
attention, even though no actual sale is finally completed as a result of the
confusion, may be still an infringement." Dr. Seuss, 109 F.3d at 1405 (citing Mobil
Oil Corp. v. Pegasus Petroleum Corp., 818 F.2d 254, 257-58 (2d Cir.1987)).24

        The Dr. Seuss court, in recognizing that the diversion of consumers' initial
interest is a form of confusion against which the Lanham Act protects, relied upon
Mobil Oil. In that case, Mobil Oil Corporation ("Mobil") asserted a federal
trademark infringement claim against Pegasus Petroleum, alleging that Pegasus
Petroleum's use of "Pegasus" was likely to cause confusion with Mobil's trademark,
a flying horse symbol in the form of the Greek mythological Pegasus. Mobil
established that "potential purchasers would be misled into an initial interest in
Pegasus Petroleum" because they thought that Pegasus Petroleum was associated
with Mobil. But these potential customers would generally learn that Pegasus
Petroleum was unrelated to Mobil well before any actual sale was consummated.
Nevertheless, the Second Circuit held that "[s]uch initial confusion works a
sufficient trademark injury."

        Mobil Oil relied upon its earlier opinion in Grotrian, Helfferich, Schulz, Th.
Steinweg Nachf. v. Steinway & Sons, 523 F.2d 1331, 1341-42 (2d Cir.1975). Analyzing

          24 The Dr. Seuss court discussed initial interest confusion within its purchaser care analysis. As a

district court within our circuit recognized in a recent case involving a claim of trademark infringement via

metatags usage, "[t]his case ... is not a standard trademark case and does not lend itself to the systematic

application of the eight factors." Playboy Enters. v. Welles, 7 F.Supp.2d 1098 (S.D.Cal.1998). Because we

agree that the traditional eight-factor test is not well-suited for analyzing the metatags issue, we do not attempt

to fit our discussion into one of the Sleekcraft factors.

                                                    363
the plaintiff's claim that the defendant, through its use of the "Grotrian-Steinweg"
mark, attracted people really interested in plaintiff's "Steinway" pianos, the Second
Circuit explained:

         We decline to hold, however, that actual or potential confusion at the time
         of purchase necessarily must be demonstrated to establish trademark
         infringement under the circumstances of this case.

         The issue here is not the possibility that a purchaser would buy a Grotrian-
         Steinweg thinking it was actually a Steinway or that Grotrian had some
         connection with Steinway and Sons. The harm to Steinway, rather, is the
         likelihood that a consumer, hearing the "Grotrian-Steinweg" name and
         thinking it had some connection with "Steinway," would consider it on that
         basis. The "Grotrian-Steinweg" name therefore would attract potential
         customers based on the reputation built up by Steinway in this country for
         many years.

Grotrian, 523 F.2d at 1342.
        Both Dr. Seuss and the Second Circuit hold that initial interest confusion is

actionable under the Lanham Act, which holdings are bolstered by the decisions of
many other courts which have similarly recognized that the federal trademark and
unfair competition laws do protect against this form of consumer confusion. . . .

        Using another's trademark in one's metatags is much like posting a sign with
another's trademark in front of one's store. Suppose West Coast's competitor (let's
call it "Blockbuster") puts up a billboard on a highway reading--"West Coast Video:
2 miles ahead at Exit 7"--where West Coast is really located at Exit 8 but
Blockbuster is located at Exit 7. Customers looking for West Coast's store will pull
off at Exit 7 and drive around looking for it. Unable to locate West Coast, but
seeing the Blockbuster store right by the highway entrance, they may simply rent
there. Even consumers who prefer West Coast may find it not worth the trouble to
continue searching for West Coast since there is a Blockbuster right there.
Customers are not confused in the narrow sense: they are fully aware that they are
purchasing from Blockbuster and they have no reason to believe that Blockbuster is
related to, or in any way sponsored by, West Coast. Nevertheless, the fact that there
is only initial consumer confusion does not alter the fact that Blockbuster would be
misappropriating West Coast's acquired goodwill. See Blockbuster, 869 F.Supp. at
513 (finding trademark infringement where the defendant, a video rental store,
attracted customers' initial interest by using a sign confusingly to its competitor's
even though confusion would end long before the point of sale or rental).

        The few courts to consider whether the use of another's trademark in one's
metatags constitutes trademark infringement have ruled in the affirmative. . . .

                                                    364
        Consistently with Dr. Seuss, the Second Circuit, and the cases which have
addressed trademark infringement through metatags use, we conclude that the
Lanham Act bars West Coast from including in its metatags any term confusingly
similar with Brookfield's mark. West Coast argues that our holding conflicts with
Holiday Inns, in which the Sixth Circuit held that there was no trademark
infringement where an alleged infringer merely took advantage of a situation in
which confusion was likely to exist and did not affirmatively act to create consumer
confusion. See Holiday Inns, 86 F.3d at 622 (holding that the use of "1-800-405-
4329"--which is equivalent to "1-800-H[zero]LIDAY"-did not infringe Holiday Inn's
trademark, "1-800-HOLIDAY"). Unlike the defendant in Holiday Inns, however,
West Coast was not a passive figure; instead, it acted affirmatively in placing
Brookfield's trademark in the metatags of its web site, thereby creating the initial
interest confusion. Accordingly, our conclusion comports with Holiday Inns.

        Contrary to West Coast's contentions, we are not in any way restricting West
Coast's right to use terms in a manner which would constitute fair use under the
Lanham Act. It is well established that the Lanham Act does not prevent one from
using a competitor's mark truthfully to identify the competitor's goods, see, e.g.,
Smith v. Chanel, Inc., 402 F.2d 562, 563 (9th Cir.1968) (stating that a copyist may
use the originator's mark to identify the product that it has copied), or in
comparative advertisements. This fair use doctrine applies in cyberspace as it does in
the real world.

        In [Playboy Ents. v.] Welles[, 7 F. Supp. 2d (S.D. Cal. 1998)], the case most on
point, Playboy sought to enjoin former Playmate of the Year Terri Welles ("Welles")
from using "Playmate" or "Playboy" on her web site featuring photographs of
herself. Welles's web site advertised the fact that she was a former Playmate of the
Year, but minimized the use of Playboy's marks; it also contained numerous
disclaimers stating that her site was neither endorsed by nor affiliated with Playboy.
The district court found that Welles was using "Playboy" and "Playmate" not as
trademarks, but rather as descriptive terms fairly and accurately describing her web
page, and that her use of "Playboy" and "Playmate" in her web site's metatags was a
permissible, good faith attempt to index the content of her web site. It accordingly
concluded that her use was permissible under the trademark laws.

        We agree that West Coast can legitimately use an appropriate descriptive
term in its metatags. But "MovieBuff" is not such a descriptive term. Even though it
differs from "Movie Buff" by only a single space, that difference is pivotal. The term
"Movie Buff" is a descriptive term, which is routinely used in the English language
to describe a movie devotee. "MovieBuff" is not. The term "MovieBuff" is not in the
dictionary. See Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary 762 (10th ed.1998); American
Heritage College Dictionary 893 (3d ed.1997); Webster's New World College Dictionary
889 (3d ed.1997); Webster's Third New Int'l Dictionary 1480 (unabridged 1993). Nor

                                                    365
has that term been used in any published federal or state court opinion. In light of
the fact that it is not a word in the English language, when the term "MovieBuff" is
employed, it is used to refer to Brookfield's products and services, rather than to
mean "motion picture enthusiast." The proper term for the "motion picture
enthusiast" is "Movie Buff," which West Coast certainly can use. It cannot, however,
omit the space.

        Moreover, West Coast is not absolutely barred from using the term
"MovieBuff." As we explained above, that term can be legitimately used to describe
Brookfield's product. For example, its web page might well include an
advertisement banner such as "Why pay for MovieBuff when you can get the same
thing here for FREE?" which clearly employs "MovieBuff" to refer to Brookfield's
products. West Coast, however, presently uses Brookfield's trademark not to
reference Brookfield's products, but instead to describe its own product (in the case
of the domain name) and to attract people to its web site in the case of the metatags.
That is not fair use . . . .

Initial Interest (or Pre-sale) Confusion

        Basis for enjoining initial interest confusion. What view of trademark law is the
Brookfield court taking? Is it protecting consumers or seller goodwill? Can you think
of areas in which the panel's approach puts the two at cross purposes? Can you
think of areas in which the purported initial confusion would have helped
consumers? For example, if a search on "moviebuff" returned the websites of
competing database providers with clearly labeled websites, while still giving
Brookfield's a prominent rank, would consumer search costs have been raised or
lowered?

        By the same token, should the nature of the initial confusion matter? Is there
a difference between the billboard metaphor employed by the Brookfield panel and
the purported initial confusion of the case? Cf. Bihari v. Gross, 119 F. Supp. 2d
309, 320 n.15 (S.D.N.Y. 2000) ("The harm caused by a misleading billboard on the
highway is difficult to correct. In contrast, on the information superhighway, . . .
[w]ith one click of the mouse and a few seconds delay, a viewer can return to the
search engine's results and resume searching for the original website.").

        Critics of initial interest confusion cases on the internet argue that they
target activities whose brick-and-mortar analogues are not challenged. See, e.g.,
Playboy Enters., Inc. v. Netscape Commc'ns Corp., 354 F.3d 1020, 1035 (9th Cir.
2004) (Berzon, J., concurring) ("[S]uppose a customer walks into a bookstore and
asks for Playboy magazine and is then directed to the adult magazine section, where
he or she sees Penthouse or Hustler up front on the rack while Playboy is buried in
back. One would not say that Penthouse or Hustler had violated Playboy's

                                                    366
trademark. This conclusion holds true even if Hustler paid the store owner to put
its magazines in front of Playboy's."). Most offline pre-sale confusion cases focus on
settings in which consumer search costs are more likely to be meaningfully raised,
but there are examples of the expanded view of the Internet cases making its way to
the "real" world. See, e.g., Shell Trademark Management v. Canadian American Oil
Co., 2002 WL 32104586 (N.D. Cal. May 21, 2002). To be sure, however, other
cases are more circumspect about an expansive doctrine. See, e.g., Gibson Guitar
Corp. v. Paul Reed Smith Guitars, LP, 423 F.3d 539 (6th Cir. 2005).

        As cases like Multi Time Machine, printed at the end of this reading, reflect,
the Ninth Circuit has curtailed the doctrine since Brookfield. See, e.g., Network
Automation, Inc. v. Advanced Systems Concepts, Inc., 638 F.3d 1137, 1149 (9th
Cir. 2011) ("[B]ecause the sine qua non of trademark infringement is consumer
confusion, when we examine initial interest confusion, the owner of the mark must
demonstrate likely confusion, not mere diversion."). Other courts are also less likely
to apply broad initial interest confusion theories online, while being at peace with
keyword advertising (which, unlike the use of metatags, is a practice that actually
matters). See, e.g., 1-800 Contacts, Inc. v. JAND, Inc., 119 F.4th 234, 239 (2d Cir.
2024) ("We now join the consensus view and decide that the mere act of purchasing
a competitor's trademarks in the context of keyword search advertising does not
constitute trademark infringement."). That said, Brookfield's notion that a
defendant's use of a plaintiff mark in a metatag is probative of likelihood of
confusion lingers. See Adidas America, Inc. v. Skechers USA, Inc., 890 F.3d 747,
756 (9th Cir. 2018) ("Finally, the evidence supports an inference that Skechers
intended to confuse consumers; it not only created a nearly identical shoe to the
Stan Smith, but then used metadata tags to direct consumers who searched for
"adidas stan smith" to the Onix web page."). Likewise, initial interest confusion
theory still has its adherents. See, e.g., Select Comfort Corp. v. Baxter, 996 F.3d 925
(8th Cir. 2021).

        Meaning of the statutory change? Some cases considering broadened theories of
confusion point to a statutory change in the cause of action for infringement of
registered marks. Section 32 originally applied to use of a "reproduction,
counterfeit, copy, or colorable imitation of any registered mark" where such use is
likely to "cause confusion or mistake or to deceive purchasers as to the source of origin
of such goods or services." Lanham Act § 32, 60 Stat. at 437 (current version at 15
U.S.C. § 1114 (2006)) (emphases added). Congress dropped the purchaser
limitation and origin language in a 1962 amendment. Act of Oct. 9, 1962, Pub. L.
No. 87-772, sec. 17, § 32, 76 Stat. 769, 773 (current version at 15 U.S.C. § 1114
(2006)). Some take the change to clarify that the confusion of potential purchasers
also mattered, but others view the deletion as opening the door to claims based on

                                                    367
the confusion of non-potential purchasers. Compare Checkpoint Sys., Inc. v. Check
Point Software Techs., Inc., 269 F.3d 270, 295 (3d Cir. 2001) ("[W]e agree with the
view that Congress's amendment of the Lanham Act in 1962 expanded trademark
protection to include instances in which a mark creates initial interest confusion."),
with Elec. Design & Sales, Inc. v. Elec. Data Sys. Corp., 954 F.2d 713, 716 (Fed.
Cir. 1992) ("We do not construe this deletion to suggest, much less compel, that
purchaser confusion is no longer the primary focus of the inquiry.").

Post-Sale Confusion

        Rationales. Ferrari S.P.A. v. Roberts, 944 F.2d 1235 (6th Cir. 1991), involved
the seller of fiberglass kits that replicated the exterior features of cars made by
Ferrari. These kits would be connected to another car to make it look like a Ferrari.
Purchasers knew what they were getting, but the court found actionable confusion
nonetheless, reasoning that "Congress intended to protect the reputation of the
manufacturer as well as to protect purchasers, the Act's protection is not limited to
confusion at the point of sale." Id. at 1245. The court further quoted the district
court's analysis of the harm facing the plaintiff:

         Ferrari has gained a well-earned reputation for making uniquely designed
         automobiles of quality and rarity. The DAYTONA SPYDER design is well-
         known among the relevant public and exclusively and positively associated
         with Ferrari. If the country is populated with hundreds, if not thousands, of
         replicas of rare, distinct, and unique vintage cars, obviously they are no
         longer unique. Even if a person seeing one of these replicas driving down
         the road is not confused, Ferrari's exclusive association with this design has
         been diluted and eroded. If the replica Daytona looks cheap or in disrepair,
         Ferrari's reputation for rarity and quality could be damaged.

Id. Note that we have two posited harms. One is the prospect that those confused
after the point of sale will think worse of the trademark holder because they will
have seen a shoddy product. How likely is this harm? Should a court be required to
make findings that consumers will make this leap (and that the junior user's
product is, in fact, shoddy)?

        The second is the prospect that the greater availability of cars that look like
Ferraris will reduce the prestige and cachet of owning a Ferrari. Is this a legitimate
concern for trademark law? One tradeoff is the costs of monopoly (in that Ferrari
will now have less competition) against the company's incremental incentive to
produce an attractive car. Cf. United States v. Torkington, 812 F.2d 1347, 1353 n.6
(11th Cir. 1987) ("Traffickers of these counterfeit goods . . . attract some customers

                                                    368
who would otherwise purchase the authentic goods. Trademark holders' returns to
their investments in quality are thereby reduced.").

        The other is between two classes of consumers. One undercurrent of the
post-sale confusion cases is a belief that purchasers of knock-off goods are doing
something wrong. But should trademark law be engaging in social regulation?
Condemning poseurs is well and good, but does that mean we should reward snobs?
Can you think of any other theories in support of the doctrine? Hermes alludes to
some of them.

Problem

        Our client, Hygiene Technologies ("HT"), makes paper towels for bathroom
dispensers. The trend in the bathroom dispenser market is increasing use of so-
called "touchless" dispensers. Many of these dispensers are branded with the name
of the maker across the front. HT does not make dispensers, but manufactures
toweling that is compatible with various makes of dispensers. HT's general counsel
invites you to a planning meeting for its next toweling marketing campaign. At the
meeting, one executive stands up and asks, "How is this different than supplying
generic soda to a soda fountain branded as COKE? Aren't we contributing to
trademark infringement?" Your response? Should we suspend production? Under
what theory or theories would we or our purchasers (the owners of the restrooms)
be engaging in trademark infringement?

Merchandising

        Boston Professional Hockey Association. The merchandising right, so to speak, is
often traced to Boston Professional Hockey Ass'n, Inc. v. Dallas Cap & Emblem Mfg., 510
F.2d 1004 (5th Cir. 1975). The suit was against the maker of embroidered emblems
of the trademarks of various sports teams. The court acknowledged two central
conceptual problems with the trademark claim: trademark law is not designed to
protect creative works; consumers do not treat sports logos as source identifiers on
the clothing sporting them. Nonetheless . . . .

         The difficulty with this case stems from the fact that a reproduction of the
         trademark itself is being sold, unattached to any other goods or services.
         The statutory and case law of trademarks is oriented toward the use of such
         marks to sell something other than the mark itself. The district court
         thought that to give plaintiffs protection in this case would be tantamount
         to the creation of a copyright monopoly for designs that were not
         copyrighted. The copyright laws are based on an entirely different concept
         than the trademark laws, and contemplate that the copyrighted material,

                                                    369
like patented ideas, will eventually pass into the public domain. The
trademark laws are based on the needed protection of the public and
business interests and there is no reason why trademarks should ever pass
into the public domain by the mere passage of time.

Although our decision here may slightly tilt the trademark laws from the
purpose of protecting the public to the protection of the business interests
of plaintiffs, we think that the two become so intermeshed when viewed
against the backdrop of the common law of unfair competition that both
the public and plaintiffs are better served by granting the relief sought by
plaintiffs.

Underlying our decision are three persuasive points. First, the major
commercial value of the emblems is derived from the efforts of plaintiffs.
Second, defendant sought and ostensibly would have asserted, if obtained,
an exclusive right to make and sell the emblems. Third, the sale of a
reproduction of the trademark itself on an emblem is an accepted use of
such team symbols in connection with the type of activity in which the
business of professional sports is engaged. We need not deal here with the
concept of whether every artistic reproduction of the symbol would infringe
upon plaintiffs' rights. We restrict ourselves to the emblems sold principally
through sporting goods stores for informal use by the public in connection
with sports activities and to show public allegiance to or identification with
the teams themselves. . . .

The fifth element of a cause of action for mark infringement under 15
U.S.C.A. § 1114 is that the infringing use is likely to cause confusion, or to
cause mistake or to deceive. The district court decided that there was no
likelihood of confusion because the usual purchaser, a sports fan in his
local sporting goods store, would not be likely to think that defendant's
emblems were manufactured by or had some connection with plaintiffs.
This court has held that the findings of a district court as to likelihood of
confusion are factual and not to be overturned unless clearly erroneous. In
this case, however, the district court overlooked the fact that the act was
amended to eliminate the source of origin as being the only focal point of
confusion. The confusion question here is conceptually difficult. It can be
said that the public buyer knew that the emblems portrayed the teams'
symbols. Thus, it can be argued, the buyer is not confused or deceived. This
argument misplaces the purpose of the confusion requirement. The
confusion or deceit requirement is met by the fact that the defendant
duplicated the protected trademarks and sold them to the public knowing
that the public would identify them as being the teams' trademarks. The

                                           370
         certain knowledge of the buyer that the source and origin of the trademark
         symbols were in plaintiffs satisfies the requirement of the act. The argument
         that confusion must be as to the source of the manufacture of the emblem
         itself is unpersuasive, where the trademark, originated by the team, is the
         triggering mechanism for the sale of the emblem. . . .

         In the case sub judice, defendant did not merely copy a product of the
         Toronto team. Defendant reproduced Toronto's common law mark on
         embroidered emblems with the intent that the public recognize and
         purchase the emblems as the symbol of the Toronto team. In the language
         of § 1125, defendant used a symbol, Toronto's mark, which tended falsely
         to represent goods, the embroidered emblems, in commerce. Where the
         consuming public had the certain knowledge that the source and origin of
         the trademark symbol was in the Toronto team, the reproduction of that
         symbol by defendant constituted a violation of § 1125.

        Skepticism? It is worth noting that there is authority taking issue with the
broad conception of confusion taken by Boston Hockey. See, e.g., Savannah College of
Art and Design, Inc. v. Sportswear, Inc., 872 F.3d 1256, 1264-65 (11th Cir. 2017).
But suppose the trademark claim is restricted to questions of mere affiliation or
approval. Does that change much with respect to the practical scope of the
trademark holder's rights?

        Role of registration? Merchandising may be attempted for marks that were
originally registered for a different class of goods or services. Does that matter? See
Savannah College, 872 F.3d at 1264 ("Boston Hockey, though in our view lacking
critical analysis, implicitly but necessarily supports the proposition that the holder
of a federally-registered service mark need not register that mark for goods--or
provide evidence of prior use of that mark on goods--in order to establish the
unrestricted validity and scope of the service mark, or to protect against another's
allegedly infringing use of that mark on goods."); see also id. at 1265-66 (discussing
issue and noting contrary authorities).

        Policies of the merchandising right. Suppose you purchase a licensed baseball
cap. What interests are promoted by giving the trademark owner control of
merchandising uses of the mark? Are they legitimate? To the extent they are, can
they be satisfied in ways short of foreclosing competition in merchandising markets?

        A broad merchandising right has effects in arenas outside fan and
memorabilia markets. Consider movies like Any Given Sunday, an Oliver Stone film
about professional football. Because the NFL refused to license its marks, Stone had
to concoct a fictional league, complete with made-up team names and uniforms.

                                                    371

        Statutory basis. We have discussed difficulties in giving a quantitative
interpretation of the likelihood-of-confusion standard. Equally difficult are
qualitative questions concerning the subject of the confusion. Note that section
43(a) targets confusion about the markholder's approval. From a dictionary
perspective, approval could mean a sponsorship relationship, or it could mean mere
permission. If the latter, infringement becomes significantly easier to prove.

        Materiality. Responding to some of the problems raised by the merchandising
right and the Lanham Act's approval language, a number of trademark scholars
have argued for the incorporation of a materiality standard to trademark law. Likely
confusion should not be actionable unless it is confusion that could actually affect a
consumer's decision to purchase the mark holders product or service. One such
argument follows:1

         One promising area of doctrinal development lies in giving a more overtly
         qualitative interpretation to the likelihood of confusion requirement.
         Courts could require that any alleged confusion be material before it is
         actionable. That is, to establish a likelihood of confusion, a trademark
         plaintiff must also prove that the confusion is relevant to the consuming
         public in making purchasing decisions.

         Such a move would not be entirely novel. Materiality considerations apply
         to several provisions of the Lanham Act.2 Most notably, judges have long
         imposed a similar materiality requirement for false advertising claims under
         both the current and pre-1988 versions of section 43(a).

         Even without an explicit requirement, materiality considerations are
         difficult to avoid in practice. Someone somewhere is always going to be
         confused about something. That fact of life plus the malleability of the
         likelihood of confusion standard means that a wide range of activity could
         trigger trademark liability. Courts must make judgment calls, such as

          1 Adapted from Michael Grynberg, Things Are Worse Than We Think: Trademark Defenses in a
"Formalist" Age, 24 Berkeley Tech. L.J. 897 (2009) (some footnotes omitted and footnote numbers altered).

          2 [e.g., materiality considerations in applying the section 2 bars to registering deceptive and
geographically deceptively misdescriptive marks]

                                                    372
         determining when confusion is de minimis and non-actionable. Similarly, it
         is standard practice to assess likely confusion with the target audience in
         mind. We don't worry about the views of soda drinkers when determining
         whether a trademark for jet engines infringes. We worry about whether
         "reasonably prudent purchasers exercising ordinary care" would be
         confused in part because theirs is the confusion that has a marketplace
         impact.

         Expanding these precursors into an explicit materiality requirement does
         not suffer from a legitimacy objection. The Lanham Act does not define
         "likelihood of confusion." Just as courts have always had to make
         quantitative assessments about what level of potential confusion amounts to
         "likelihood," they cannot avoid qualitative interpretations of "confusion."3
         What degree of mistaken awareness suffices for confusion? Is it conscious
         confusion? Subconscious? Must it be confusion that the consumer would
         confront while shopping, or can it be hypothesized and demonstrated
         through laboratory testing or with surveys?

         The Lanham Act likewise does not define "origin, sponsorship, or
         approval," so courts must interpret those terms and their interaction with
         the confusion requirement.4 While confusion as to origin or sponsorship
         has obvious relevance to consumers, the importance of approval is less clear
         depending on the precise meaning given to the term. "Confusion" as to
         "approval" could mean a mistaken belief that permission was required
         before a logo could be used on a piece of clothing apparel. Or it could be
         more restrictive, and refer to those cases in which the markholder has
         placed her reputation behind the product. In choosing between the two,
         courts should remember that the benefits of policing consumer confusion
         often comes at a cost to non-confused consumers. Weighing these costs and
         benefits may favor the more modest reading of "approval," which is
         permitted by the statutory text.

         Finally, leaving aside the potential public policy benefits of reading a

          3 For example, in recognizing claims resting on initial interest or post-sale confusion, courts have
justified themselves by explaining why such confusion might have a market impact. Brookfield Commc'ns,
Inc. v. W. Coast Entm't Corp., 174 F.3d 1036, 1064 (9th Cir. 1999) (initial interest confusion); Ferrari

confusion).

                                                    373
         materiality requirement into the Lanham Act's open text,5 the statute's text
         and context support such recognition. Textualist canons of construction
         support reading "approval" as something narrower than mere
         "permission."6 At a broader level, trademark law's traditional consumer-
         protection focus militates in favor of reading the Act to actually protect
         consumers.7 At the broadest level, the Supreme Court's interpretation of
         Article III suggests a materiality requirement. Applying the Lanham Act to
         activities that do not affect consumer purchases (and, by implication, sales
         by the trademark holder) raises a potential Article III standing issue.8
         Without material confusion the trademark plaintiff's claim of an injury in
         fact looks dubious. Notwithstanding the poor track record of free speech
         challenges to trademark law, one could make a similar claim with respect to
         the First Amendment. If one finds confusion in situations far removed
         from traditional conceptions of consumer harm, one may ask if trademark
         liability is compatible with even the decreased First Amendment scrutiny

          5 If a goal of trademark law is to "protect the public so it may be confident that, in purchasing a
product . . . , it will get the product which it asks for and wants to get," S. REP. NO. 79-1333, at 3 (1946), as
reprinted in 1946 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1274, 1274-5, then a materiality requirement preserves that goal while
creating breathing space for activities that may cause marginal confusion, but benefit a different subset of the
consuming public.

          6 One could take an ejusdem generis approach and argue that the term "approval" is a general one and
should be interpreted consistently with the more specific terms "origin" and "sponsorship." The same basic
claim may be made under the noscitur a sociis canon.

          7 Even if the consumer protection goal shares time with seller protection. S. REP. NO. 79-1333, at 3,
as reprinted in 1946 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1274, 1274-5.

          8 The Court's familiar standing inquiry provides:

          [I]n order to have Article III standing, a plaintiff must adequately establish: (1) an injury in
          fact ( i.e., a "concrete and particularized" invasion of a "legally protected interest"); (2)
          causation (i.e., a " `fairly . . . trace[able]' " connection between the alleged injury in fact and
          the alleged conduct of the defendant); and (3) redressability ( i.e., it is " 'likely' " and not
          "merely `speculative' " that the plaintiff's injury will be remedied by the relief plaintiff seeks
          in bringing suit).

Reverse Confusion

        We have encountered a variation of reverse confusion before in Dastar,
which involved a "reverse passing off" claim. In the classic "passing off" case, one
represents one's product as that of another (e.g., putting an APPLE label--or
something like it--on homemade electronics and selling the product as an APPLE
computer). "Reverse passing off" arises when one takes the product of another and
attempts to sell it under one's own mark (e.g., buying an APPLE iPad and reselling
it under the infringer's label). In a reverse confusion case, the plaintiff is claiming
that consumers are likely to think that the defendant is the source of the plaintiff's
product. So the model reverse confusion case involves a market in which the senior
user is a small player, and the larger junior user threatens to usurp the senior user's
control of their mark. See, e.g., A & H Sportswear, Inc. v. Victoria's Secret Stores,
Inc., 237 F.3d 198 (3d Cir. 2000) (suit by maker of MIRACLESUIT alleging that
defendant's MIRACLE BRA swimwear would cause reverse confusion such that
MIRACLESUIT would be seen as defendant's product). This would create the risk
that consumers might see the senior user as attempting to pass off its goods or
services as those of the defendant.

                                 2 F.4th 1150 (9th Cir. 2021)

M. SMITH, Circuit Judge:
        Ironhawk Technologies, Inc. (Ironhawk) sued Dropbox, Inc. (Dropbox) for

trademark infringement and unfair competition. The district court granted
summary judgment, concluding that Ironhawk could not prevail because a
reasonable trier of fact could not find a likelihood of consumer confusion.
Ironhawk appeals based on a theory of reverse confusion. Because genuine issues of
material fact remain as to a likelihood of reverse confusion, we reverse, vacate the
judgment, and remand for trial. . . .

        Ironhawk developed computer software that uses compression and
replication to transfer data efficiently in "bandwidth-challenged environments."
Since 2004, Ironhawk has marketed this software under the name "SmartSync."
Ironhawk obtained a trademark registration for SmartSync in 2007, which makes it
the senior mark holder and user in this case.

        Dropbox produces cloud storage software that millions of individuals and
businesses use worldwide. "Smart Sync" is a feature of Dropbox's software suite that
allows a user to see and access files in his or her Dropbox cloud account from a
desktop computer without taking up the computer's hard drive space. Smart Sync is
a feature of certain paid subscription plans, not a stand-alone Dropbox product.
Dropbox launched Smart Sync in 2017, while it was aware of Ironhawk's senior
SmartSync mark. . . . [Ironhawk brought Lanham Act and state law claims against
Dropbox. The district court gave summary judgment to Dropbox.]

        On appeal, Ironhawk relies exclusively on a reverse confusion theory of
infringement.

        We have explained that reverse confusion occurs when a person who knows
only of the well-known junior user comes into contact with the lesser-known senior
user, and because of the similarity of the marks, mistakenly thinks that the senior
user is the same as or is affiliated with the junior user. This can occur when "the
junior user's advertising and promotion so swamps the senior user's reputation in
the market that customers are likely to be confused into thinking that the senior
user's goods are those of the junior user[.]" 4 McCarthy on Trademarks and Unfair
Competition § 23:10 (5th ed. 2020) (citations and footnotes omitted).

        Affiliation with a popular well-known brand may seem beneficial, but reverse
confusion carries consequences. Reverse confusion can foreclose the senior user
from expanding into related fields and could place the senior company's goodwill in
the hands of the junior user. As the Sixth Circuit explained, the result of reverse
confusion "is that the senior user loses the value of the trademark--its product
identity, corporate identity, control over its goodwill and reputation, and ability to
move into new markets." Ameritech, Inc. v. Am. Info. Techs. Corp., 811 F.2d 960, 964
(6th Cir. 1987). . . .

        Before addressing the Sleekcraft factors, we must define the relevant
consumer market . . . .

        Dropbox argues that the relevant consuming public is limited to the United
States Navy because that is Ironhawk's only active customer. . . . Dropbox contends
that the United States Navy, and therefore the relevant consumer, could never be
confused as to the source or affiliation of SmartSync because the Navy exercises
significant care when purchasing products through its military procurement process.

        Ironhawk responds that the relevant consumer class includes potential
business partners and customers in the broader commercial, non-military
marketplace. . . . For example, Ironhawk proposed implementing SmartSync into
products offered by two leading cloud storage companies that are two of Dropbox's
biggest competitors. Ironhawk contends these discussions were unsuccessful and any
future negotiations are foreclosed because neither Dropbox Smart Sync competitor

                                                    376
would risk the customer confusion resulting from announcing their products were
"powered by SmartSync." . . .

        Based on this competing evidence, a genuine dispute of material fact remains
as to the relevant consuming public. . . . [A] reasonable jury could find that
Ironhawk's potential consumers include commercial customers. . . .

        We now turn to the Sleekcraft factors, each of which presents a highly factual
inquiry. . . .

        We first address the strength of the two marks. Because the question in
reverse confusion cases is "whether consumers doing business with the senior user
might mistakenly believe that they are dealing with the junior user" we evaluate the
conceptual strength of Ironhawk's mark and compare it to the commercial strength
of Dropbox's mark. . . .

        While Dropbox does not challenge the validity of the mark, it contends that
SmartSync is descriptive, which it contends would lessen or eliminate any
confusion. The district court agreed, concluding that SmartSync is descriptive
because it "appears to describe at least some of the characteristics of Ironhawk's
product, namely synchronization and `intelligent' transport, compression, and
synchronization."

        On summary judgment, however, the question is whether a reasonable jury
could find that Ironhawk's SmartSync mark is at least suggestive. Importantly, the
line between descriptive and suggestive marks is elusive . . . .

        While we agree with the district court that Ironhawk's mark could be
considered descriptive, given the presumption of distinctiveness established by
SmartSync's federal registration, and the elusive nature of the inquiry, a reasonable
jury could conclude the mark is suggestive. The jury, therefore, should determine
whether SmartSync is descriptive or suggestive. . . .

        Whether descriptive or suggestive, the important question in a reverse
confusion case is "whether the junior mark is so [commercially] strong as to overtake
the senior mark." Walter v. Mattel, Inc., 210 F.3d 1108, 1111 n.2 (9th Cir. 2000).
Accordingly, we assess the commercial strength of Dropbox's Smart Sync mark and
ask whether it is able to swamp the reputation of Ironhawk's SmartSync with a
much larger advertising campaign.

        The district court concluded that the commercial strength of Dropbox's
mark was of "little import" because "Ironhawk's SmartSync mark is conceptually
weak." In so concluding, the district court explained that "where a mark is
conceptually weak, it is less likely that consumers will associate it with any source,
even a commercially strong junior user." The district court erred for two reasons.

        First, whether Dropbox rebutted the presumption of distinctiveness
established by SmartSync's federal registration is for the jury to decide. Second,
given the evidence Ironhawk presented of Smart Sync's commercial strength, it is

                                                    377
for the jury to decide "whether [Dropbox's] junior mark is so [commercially] strong
as to overtake [Ironhawk's] senior mark." Walter, 210 F.3d at 1111 n.2. As we noted
in Cohn, "in a reverse confusion claim, a plaintiff with a commercially weak mark is
more likely to prevail than a plaintiff with a stronger mark, and this is particularly
true when the plaintiff's weaker mark is pitted against a defendant with a far
stronger mark." Cohn v. Petsmart, Inc., 281 F.3d 837, 841 (9th Cir. 2002) (per
curiam) (quoting A & H Sportswear, Inc. v. Victoria's Secret Stores, Inc., 237 F.3d 198,
231 (3d Cir. 2000)).

         Ironhawk offers the following evidence of Smart Sync's commercial
strength: (1) Dropbox spends $7,000 per month on Google keyword advertising
related to "Smart Sync"; (2) Dropbox made significant marketing expenditures that
prominently promoted the launch of Smart Sync alongside other features of
Dropbox's software suite; (3) Dropbox made significant online advertising
expenditures for Smart Sync in 2018; (4) Google searches for "smartsync" or "smart
sync" yield results that prominently feature Dropbox's software; and (5) Dropbox is
a widely recognized brand with millions of users. Given the extensive efforts to
associate Smart Sync with Dropbox, Ironhawk contends that if Dropbox's Smart
Sync makes a major misstep and stains its reputation with the public, Ironhawk's
SmartSync could suffer with it.

        Based on the evidence presented, a reasonable jury could find that
Dropbox's Smart Sync is commercially strong, and when considered against the
conceptual strength of Ironhawk's SmartSync mark, is able to swamp Ironhawk's
reputation with a much larger advertising campaign.

        [The majority then found that a jury could conclude that the goods were
related. The court then turned to mark similarity.]

        The district court acknowledged that SmartSync and Smart Sync are virtually
identical in sight, sound, and meaning, but, relying on Cohn, 281 F.3d 837,
concluded that this factor weighed against the likelihood of confusion because
"each party consistently includes its business name or house mark alongside its
version of the disputed mark."

        While the district court correctly concluded that a company's consistent use
of a house mark can reduce the likelihood of confusion, in a reverse confusion case
the junior user's use of a house mark can also aggravate confusion by reinforcing the
association between the mark and the junior user.

        We addressed how a house mark can aggravate confusion in Americana
Trading Inc. v. Russ Berrie & Co., 966 F.2d 1284 (9th Cir. 1992). In that case, a
manufacturer sold stuffed teddy bears using its "Wedding Bears" trademark. A
competitor later started selling a line of teddy bears that included a permanent tag
with "Wedding Bear" on one side and its house mark on the other. We found that
the competitor's use of its house mark did not negate the similarity of the marks

                                                    378
because use of the house mark "may serve to create reverse confusion that [the
competitor], and not [plaintiff], is the source of [plaintiff]'s `Wedding Bears.' "

        Not only can using a house mark aggravate reverse confusion, the district
court also erred by relying on Cohn. In Cohn, the senior user was a veterinary clinic,
Critter Clinic, that used the tagline "Where Pets Are Family" in its advertising. The
junior user was the local Petsmart pet store, which offered in-store veterinary
services and displayed the same "Where Pets Are Family" tagline in its advertising.
We concluded that the marks were dissimilar when viewed in context because the
parties always used their house marks (Critter Clinic and Petsmart) alongside the
taglines and because the house marks, rather than the taglines, were the dominant
aspects of the overall marks.

        Cohn's reasoning does not apply here because SmartSync is not a tagline or
slogan, it is the product name, which Ironhawk contends is also its dominant
commercial identity. For example, Ironhawk presents deposition testimony from an
IBM employee who explained some people in the military are familiar with
SmartSync but not with Ironhawk. In addition, Ironhawk's CEO declared that,
"oftentimes when I go into a customer's briefing room, only SmartSync will be up
on the board," not Ironhawk. Ironhawk also presents evidence that the parties do
not always use their house marks alongside the Smart Sync and SmartSync marks,
which contradicts the district court's finding. And, when Dropbox does use its
house mark, that can aggravate reverse confusion.

        Based on this evidence, a reasonable jury could find that the marks are
similar and that Dropbox's use of its house mark aggravates the likelihood of reverse
confusion. . . .

        Ironhawk relies on testimony from two witnesses as evidence of actual
confusion. The first, Ironhawk's CEO, declares that "unknown third parties from
the Navy at trade shows have expressed concern about `double purchasing'
SmartSync", and "at a recent trade show, during discussions with ... a big data
analytics company, [he] was asked whether Ironhawk was affiliated with Dropbox."
He further states that, "in a 2018 meeting with [a leading cloud storage company],
Ironhawk was asked about the relationship between its SmartSync[ ] and Dropbox['s
Smart Sync]."

        Ironhawk's other witness, an IBM employee who sells Ironhawk products,
testified in his deposition that consumers to whom he pitched SmartSync believed
they already owned it, when they actually owned similarly named products from
Dropbox or Salesforce.

        Dropbox responds that Ironhawk's CEO's declaration is insufficient to show
actual confusion because it does not "identify any specific individuals who were
confused; rather he made uncorroborated statements that various unnamed third
parties or individuals had mixed up, or were concerned that others would mix up,

                                                    379
Ironhawk and Dropbox." The district court agreed by not crediting Ironhawk's
evidence and finding no evidence of actual confusion.

        However, while a "district court can disregard a self-serving declaration that
states only conclusions and not facts that would be admissible evidence,"
Ironhawk's CEO's declaration is not devoid of specific facts. See Nigro v. Sears,
Roebuck & Co., 784 F.3d 495, 497-98 (9th Cir. 2015). The lack of certain specific
details goes to the weight of the testimony, not its admissibility. And "the weight is
to be assessed by the trier of fact at trial, not to be the basis to disregard the
evidence at the summary judgment stage."

        Dropbox also challenges additional evidence submitted by the IBM employee
because it "consists of fabricated emails, ghostwritten by Ironhawk's CEO." In
response to this allegation, Ironhawk submits deposition testimony from the IBM
employee who testified that his email, although drafted by Ironhawk's CEO, reflects
his own views. What weight to afford that testimony and the accompanying emails
is also a question for a jury.

        Ultimately, Ironhawk offered evidence of actual confusion among actual or
potential customers. While we have some doubt that the jury will find this factor to
be in Ironhawk's favor, it is evidence a reasonable jury could rely on to support a
finding of actual confusion or when assessing a likelihood of confusion under the
totality of the circumstances. . . .

        [The majority agreed that the parties used differing marketing channels, but
while "this factor seems to weigh against a finding of a likelihood of confusion, the
trier of fact should determine what weight to afford it when considering the totality
of the circumstances."]

        Under the sixth Sleekcraft factor, we assess the sophistication of the
customers and ask "whether a `reasonably prudent consumer' would take the time
to distinguish between the two product lines." Surfvivor, 406 F.3d at 634. "When
the buyer has expertise in the field," or "the goods are expensive, the buyer can be
expected to exercise greater care in his purchases." Sleekcraft, 599 F.2d at 353.

        [The district court read this factor in defendant's favor, noting the
sophistication of its client the U.S. Navy.]

        . . . . As we concluded above, a reasonable jury could find that Ironhawk's
relevant customer base extends beyond the United States Navy. However, the
dissent argues that we end our analysis prematurely and err "by failing to consider
the type of commercial customers Ironhawk is targeting and the kind of sales it is
proposing." In this regard, the dissent contends that Ironhawk only targets "large,
sophisticated buyers" and "the sophistication of potential commercial customers,
the expense of the product, and the manner in which Ironhawk markets its
product--wholly eliminate any realistic possibility of consumer confusion in this
case."

                                                    380
        But as we noted above, Ironhawk offered evidence of actual confusion
among these same sophisticated potential commercial customers. Viewing this
evidence in the light most favorable to Ironhawk, together with the genuine
disputes presented on the remaining factors, demonstrates that a rational trier of
fact could find that confusion is probable. . . .

        We next assess Dropbox's intent to infringe. This factor "favors the plaintiff
`where the alleged infringer adopted his mark with knowledge, actual or
constructive, that it was another's trademark.' " JL Beverage, 828 F.3d at 1111-12
(quoting Brookfield Commc'ns, Inc. v. W. Coast Ent. Corp., 174 F.3d 1036, 1059 (9th
Cir. 1999)). In the reverse confusion context, we "ask whether there is some
evidence that the junior user, when it knew of the senior user, was at fault for not
adequately respecting the rights of the senior user." 4 McCarthy on Trademarks and
Unfair Competition § 23:10 (5th ed. 2020). Intent can be shown through evidence
that the junior user deliberately intended to push the senior out of the market by
flooding the market with advertising to create reverse confusion, or "by evidence
that, for example, the [junior] knew of the mark, should have known of the mark,
intended to copy the [senior], failed to conduct a reasonably adequate trademark
search, or otherwise culpably disregarded the risk of reverse confusion." Marketquest

Inc. v. JPMorgan Chase & Co., 432 F.3d 463, 473 (3d Cir. 2005)).

        While Dropbox argues it was not aware of Ironhawk when it chose the name
Smart Sync in 2015, there is no dispute that Dropbox knew of Ironhawk's
SmartSync mark before it launched Smart Sync to the public. Therefore, based on
the evidence presented, a reasonable jury could find that Dropbox "culpably
disregarded the risk of reverse confusion."

        [The majority then concluded that the likelihood of expansion factor was
neutral.]

        Each of the Sleekcraft factors presents a highly factual inquiry that considers
competing evidence. So too does balancing these factors to determine, under the
totality of the circumstances, whether a likelihood of confusion exists. Based on this
highly factual inquiry, we conclude that genuine issues of material fact remain.

        In so holding, we do not conclude that the trier of fact will find the Sleekcraft
factors in Ironhawk's favor, or that a likelihood of confusion exists under the
totality of the circumstances. That is not our inquiry on summary judgment.
Instead, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to Ironhawk, draw all
reasonable inferences in Ironhawk's favor, and ask whether Dropbox carried its
burden to establish that no genuine disputes of material fact exist as to the
likelihood of confusion between Smart Sync and SmartSync. We conclude that
Dropbox has not met that high burden. Accordingly, because a reasonable trier of

                                                    381
fact could find a likelihood of confusion, we reverse the grant of summary
judgment, vacate the judgment, and remand for trial.

        TASHIMA, Circuit Judge, dissenting:
        While I agree with the general trademark principles articulated by the
majority, which should guide our decision of this case, I part ways with the majority
when it comes to the application of those principles to the record facts of this case. I
am not persuaded that a reasonable jury could find a likelihood of consumer
confusion. I, therefore, respectfully dissent.
        This is a reverse confusion trademark infringement case. In such a case, we
apply the familiar eight-factor Sleekcraft matrix. But, as our case law cautions, the
Sleekcraft factors "must be applied in a flexible fashion," not as "a rote checklist,"
because "[a] determination may rest on only those factors that are most pertinent to
the particular case before the court." Rearden LLC v. Rearden Com. Inc., 683 F.3d
1190, 1209 (9th Cir. 2012). The majority, unfortunately, has taken the rote-
checklist approach.
        To begin, I agree with the majority that we must first ask whose confusion
matters. . . . Viewing this evidence in the light most favorable to Ironhawk, as we
must on summary judgment, a reasonable jury could find that Ironhawk's relevant
consumer class is not limited to the United States military. As the majority points
out, "it is well established that confusion on the part of potential consumers may be
relevant."
        There is, however, no evidence that the relevant consumer class includes
ordinary consumers. In a declaration, Ironhawk CEO David Gomes tells us that
Ironhawk has pursued commercial opportunities with two leading cloud storage
companies, a national pharmacy chain, a leading energy technology company, and a
leading data analytics company. These are all large, sophisticated buyers. . . .
        All of these factors--the sophistication of potential commercial customers,
the expense of the product, and the manner in which Ironhawk markets its
product--wholly eliminate any realistic possibility of consumer confusion in this
case. . . .
        . . . . [T]o repeat [the Sleekcraft] factors "must be applied in a flexible fashion,"
not as "a rote checklist." Rearden, 683 F.3d at 1209. And, if we follow Rearden's
admonition, we discover that, here, that determination rests on a single Sleekcraft
factor: The type of goods and the degree of care likely to be exercised by the
purchaser. In this case, this factor is highly probative, and none of the other factors,
even when viewed in the light most favorable to Ironhawk, supports a finding of
consumer confusion. Significantly, Ironhawk "must show sufficient evidence to
permit a rational trier of fact to find that confusion is `probable,' not merely `possible.' "

                                                    382
M2 Software, Inc., 421 F.3d at 1085 (emphasis added) (quoting Murray v. CNBC, 86
F.3d 858, 861 (9th Cir. 1996)). Ironhawk has not made this showing. . . .

        As I stated at the beginning of this dissent, I agree with the majority's focus
on the need to define the relevant consumer class and its conclusion that such a
class includes not only Ironhawk's existing military customers, but also potential
commercial customers to whom Ironhawk says it markets its SmartSync software.
The majority errs, however, by ending its analysis there, and by failing to consider
the type of commercial customers Ironhawk is targeting and the kind of sales it is
proposing. These customers are large, sophisticated commercial enterprises. They
are purchasing a highly technical and expensive product. And any sale would be
subject to a prolonged sales effort and careful customer decision making. . . .

                                     Notes and Questions

        Trademark quality. If Dropbox had used IRONHAWK, this would be an easy
case, wouldn't it? But Dropbox had no reason to use that term, so it's no surprise
that it didn't. By contrast, as a cloud services provider, doesn't Dropbox have a
competitive reason to use the term "SmartSync", or something like it, to efficiently
and accurately describe its service? Do Dropbox users think of the term as
identifying and distinguishing a cloud service? Or as a description of an aspect of
the DROPBOX service? In other words, might we say that this case as much about
trademark distinctiveness and functionality as it is about reverse confusion?

        Litigation incentives. Was Ironhawk hurt by Dropbox's use of the disputed
term? Might Dropbox's conduct have presented it with a potential litigation
opportunity? How can the doctrine of reverse confusion avoid the problem of
opportunistic litigation?

        Wait . . . what? The majority indicates that Dropbox's use of its strong house
mark potentially exacerbates the potential for reverse confusion. Does that mean it
shouldn't have used it? Wouldn't Ironhawk's confusion claim be stronger had
Dropbox taken that course (albeit not as a reverse confusion claim)?

        Arguments vs. causes of action. Although courts may treat the factors differently
when the claim is reverse confusion, the Ninth Circuit has held that reverse
confusion is not a distinct theory from forward confusion. Marketquest Group, Inc.
v. BIC Corp., 862 F.3d 927, 932 (9th Cir. 2017) ("[R]everse confusion is not a
separate claim that must be specifically pleaded, but instead is a theory of likely
confusion that may be alleged by itself or in addition to forward confusion.").

                                                    383
Trademark Counterfeiting

        Section 45 defines a "counterfeit" as "a spurious mark which is identical
with, or substantially indistinguishable from, a registered mark." This is a
moderately stricter standard than that which prevails for trademark infringement in
general, leading some cases to presume the latter where the former is present. See,
e.g., Gucci America, Inc. v. Duty Free Apparel, Ltd., 286 F. Supp. 2d 284, 287
(S.D.N.Y. 2003). But see Arcona, Inc. v. Farmacy Beauty, LLC, 976 F.3d 1074, 1076
(9th Cir. 2020) ("We hold that the plain language of the statute requires a
likelihood of confusion for a counterfeit claim.").

        Enhanced remedies are available against counterfeit marks, 15 U.S.C. §
1116(d), as is the prospect of criminal prosecution. 18 U.S.C. § 2320.

Expansive Confusion Theories Reexamined

        Much of the criticism surrounding cases like Brookfield concerned judicial
assumptions about consumer expectations and behavior when online. As the
internet became a more ubiquitous part of life, would those assumptions change?

                     Multi Time Machine, Inc. v. Amazon.com, Inc.
                                 804 F.3d 930 (9th Cir. 2015)

SILVERMAN, Circuit Judge:
        In the present appeal, we must decide whether the following scenario

constitutes trademark infringement: A customer goes online to Amazon.com
looking for a certain military-style wristwatch--specifically the "MTM Special Ops"--
marketed and manufactured by Plaintiff Multi Time Machine, Inc. The customer
types "mtm special ops" in the search box and presses "enter." Because Amazon
does not sell the MTM Special Ops watch, what the search produces is a list, with
photographs, of several other brands of military style watches that Amazon does
carry, specifically identified by their brand names--Luminox, Chase-Durer,
TAWATEC, and Modus.

        MTM brought suit alleging that Amazon's response to a search for the MTM
Special Ops watch on its website is trademark infringement in violation of the
Lanham Act. MTM contends that Amazon's search results page creates a likelihood
of confusion, even though there is no evidence of any actual confusion and even

                                                    384
though the other brands are clearly identified by name. The district court granted
summary judgment in favor of Amazon, and MTM now appeals.

         We affirm. "The core element of trademark infringement" is whether the
defendant's conduct "is likely to confuse customers about the source of the
products." E. & J. Gallo Winery v. Gallo Cattle Co., 967 F.2d 1280, 1290 (9th
Cir.1992). Because Amazon's search results page clearly labels the name and
manufacturer of each product offered for sale and even includes photographs of the
items, no reasonably prudent consumer accustomed to shopping online would likely
be confused as to the source of the products. Thus, summary judgment of MTM's
trademark claims was proper. . . .

        MTM manufactures and markets watches under various brand names
including MTM, MTM Special Ops, and MTM Military Ops. MTM holds the
federally registered trademark "MTM Special Ops" for timepieces. MTM sells its
watches directly to its customers and through various retailers. To cultivate and
maintain an image as a high-end, exclusive brand, MTM does not sell its watches
through Amazon.com. Further, MTM does not authorize its distributors, whose
agreements require them to seek MTM's permission to sell MTM's products
anywhere but their own retail sites, to sell MTM watches on Amazon.com.
Therefore, MTM watches have never been available for sale on Amazon.com.

        Amazon is an online retailer that purports to offer "Earth's Biggest Selection
of products." Amazon has designed its website to enable millions of unique
products to be sold by both Amazon and third party sellers across dozens of product
categories.

        Consumers who wish to shop for products on Amazon's website can utilize
Amazon's search function. The search function enables consumers to navigate
Amazon.com's large marketplace by providing consumers with relevant results in
response to the consumer's query. In order to provide search results in which the
consumer is most likely to be interested, Amazon's search function does not simply
match the words in the user's query to words in a document, such as a product
description in Amazon.com's catalog. Rather, Amazon's search function--like
general purpose web search engines such as Google or Bing--employs a variety of
techniques, including some that rely on user behavior, to produce relevant results.
By going beyond exactly matching a user's query to text describing a product,
Amazon's search function can provide consumers with relevant results that would
otherwise be overlooked.

        Consumers who go onto Amazon.com and search for the term "mtm special
ops" are directed to a search results page. On the search results page, the search
query used--here, "mtm special ops"--is displayed twice: in the search query box and
directly below the search query box in what is termed a "breadcrumb." The
breadcrumb displays the original query, "mtm special ops," in quotation marks to

                                                    385
provide a trail for the consumer to follow back to the original search. Directly below
the breadcrumb, is a "Related Searches" field, which provides the consumer with
alternative search queries in case the consumer is dissatisfied with the results of the
original search. Here, the Related Search that is suggested to the consumer is: "mtm
special ops watch." Directly below the "Related Searches" field is a gray bar
containing the text "Showing 10 Results." Then, directly below the gray bar is
Amazon's product listings. The gray bar separates the product listings from the
breadcrumb and the "Related Searches" field. The particular search results page at
issue is displayed below:

        MTM watches are not listed on the page for the simple reason that neither
Amazon nor MTM sells MTM watches on Amazon.

                                                    386
        MTM filed a complaint against Amazon, alleging that Amazon's search
results page infringes MTM's trademarks in violation of the Lanham Act. . . .

        Here, the district court was correct in ruling that there is no likelihood of
confusion. Amazon is responding to a customer's inquiry about a brand it does not
carry by doing no more than stating clearly (and showing pictures of) what brands it
does carry. To whatever extent the Sleekcraft factors apply in a case such as this--a
merchant responding to a request for a particular brand it does not sell by offering
other brands clearly identified as such--the undisputed evidence shows that
confusion on the part of the inquiring buyer is not at all likely. Not only are the
other brands clearly labeled and accompanied by photographs, there is no evidence
of actual confusion by anyone.

         To analyze likelihood of confusion, we utilize the eight-factor test set forth in
Sleekcraft. However, "[w]e have long cautioned that applying the Sleekcraft test is not
like counting beans." One Indus., 578 F.3d at 1162; see also Network Automation, Inc.
v. Advanced Sys. Concepts, 638 F.3d 1137, 1145 (9th Cir.2011) ("The Sleekcraft factors
are intended as an adaptable proxy for consumer confusion, not a rote checklist.").
"Some factors are much more important than others, and the relative importance of
each individual factor will be case-specific." Brookfield Commc'ns v. West Coast Entm't
Corp., 174 F.3d 1036, 1054 (9th Cir.1999). Moreover, the Sleekcraft factors are not
exhaustive and other variables may come into play depending on the particular facts
presented. Network Automation, 638 F.3d at 1145-46. This is particularly true in the
Internet context. See Brookfield, 174 F.3d at 1054 ("We must be acutely aware of
excessive rigidity when applying the law in the Internet context; emerging
technologies require a flexible approach."). Indeed, in evaluating claims of
trademark infringement in cases involving Internet search engines, we have found
particularly important an additional factor that is outside of the eight-factor
Sleekcraft test: "the labeling and appearance of the advertisements and the
surrounding context on the screen displaying the results page." Network Automation,
638 F.3d at 1154.

         In the present case, the eight-factor Sleekcraft test is not particularly apt. This
is not surprising as the Sleekcraft test was developed for a different problem--i.e., for
analyzing whether two competing brands' marks are sufficiently similar to cause
consumer confusion. Although the present case involves brands that compete with
MTM, such as Luminox, Chase-Durer, TAWATEC, and Modus, MTM does not
contend that the marks for these competing brands are similar to its trademarks.
Rather, MTM argues that the design of Amazon's search results page creates a
likelihood of initial interest confusion because when a customer searches for MTM
Special Ops watches on Amazon.com, the search results page displays the search
term used--here, "mtm special ops"--followed by a display of numerous watches

                                                    387
manufactured by MTM's competitors and offered for sale by Amazon, without
explicitly informing the customer that Amazon does not carry MTM watches.

        Thus, the present case focuses on a different type of confusion than was at
issue in Sleekcraft. Here, the confusion is not caused by the design of the
competitor's mark, but by the design of the web page that is displaying the
competing mark and offering the competing products for sale. Sleekcraft aside, the
ultimate test for determining likelihood of confusion is whether a "reasonably
prudent consumer" in the marketplace is likely to be confused as to the origin of
the goods. Dreamwerks, 142 F.3d at 1129. Our case can be resolved simply by a
evaluation of the web page at issue and the relevant consumer. Indeed, we have
previously noted that "[i]n the keyword advertising context [i.e., where a user
performs a search on the internet, and based on the keywords contained in the
search, the resulting web page displays certain advertisements containing products
or services for sale,] the `likelihood of confusion will ultimately turn on what the
consumer saw on the screen and reasonably believed, given the context.' " Network
Automation, 638 F.3d at 1153. In other words, the case will turn on the answers to
the following two questions: (1) Who is the relevant reasonable consumer?; and (2)
What would he reasonably believe based on what he saw on the screen?

         Turning to the first question, we have explained that "[t]he nature of the
goods and the type of consumer is highly relevant to determining the likelihood of
confusion in the keyword advertising context." Network Automation, 638 F.3d at
1152. "In evaluating this factor, we consider `the typical buyer exercising ordinary
caution.' " Au-Tomotive Gold, Inc. v. Volkswagen of Am., Inc., 457 F.3d 1062, 1076
(9th Cir.2006) (quoting Sleekcraft, 599 F.2d at 353). "Confusion is less likely where
buyers exercise care and precision in their purchases, such as for expensive or
sophisticated items." Id. Moreover, "the default degree of consumer care is
becoming more heightened as the novelty of the Internet evaporates and online
commerce becomes commonplace." Network Automation, 638 F.3d at 1152.

        The goods in the present case are expensive. It is undisputed that the watches
at issue sell for several hundred dollars. Therefore, the relevant consumer in the
present case "is a reasonably prudent consumer accustomed to shopping online."
Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc. v. Tabari, 610 F.3d 1171, 1176 (9th Cir.2010).

        Turning to the second question, as MTM itself asserts, the labeling and
appearance of the products for sale on Amazon's web page is the most important
factor in this case. This is because we have previously noted that clear labeling can
eliminate the likelihood of initial interest confusion in cases involving Internet
search terms. See, e.g., Playboy Enters., 354 F.3d at 1030 n. 44 (explaining that clear
labeling "might eliminate the likelihood of initial interest confusion that exists in
this case"); Network Automation, 638 F.3d at 1154 (same). Indeed, MTM itself argues:
"The common thread of [the Ninth Circuit's decisions in Brookfield, Playboy, and

                                                    388
Network Automation ] is that liability under the Lanham Act can only be avoided as a
matter of law where there is clear labeling to avoid the possibility of confusion--
including initial interest confusion--resulting from the use of another's trademark."
Thus, MTM agrees that summary judgment of its trademark claims is appropriate if
there is clear labeling that avoids likely confusion.

        Here, the products at issue are clearly labeled by Amazon to avoid any
likelihood of initial interest confusion by a reasonably prudent consumer
accustomed to online shopping. When a shopper goes to Amazon's website and
searches for a product using MTM's trademark "mtm special ops," the resulting
page displays several products, all of which are clearly labeled with the product's
name and manufacturer in large, bright, bold letters and includes a photograph of
the item. In fact, the manufacturer's name is listed twice. For example, the first
result is "Luminox Men's 8401 Black Ops Watch by Luminox." The second result
is "Chase-Durer Men's 246.4BB7-XL-BR Special Forces 1000XL Black Ionic-
Plated Underwater Demolition Team Watch by Chase-Durer." Because Amazon
clearly labels each of the products for sale by brand name and model number
accompanied by a photograph of the item, it is unreasonable to suppose that the
reasonably prudent consumer accustomed to shopping online would be confused
about the source of the goods.

        MTM argues that initial interest confusion might occur because Amazon lists
the search term used--here the trademarked phrase "mtm special ops"--three times
at the top of the search page. MTM argues that because Amazon lists the search
term "mtm special ops" at the top of the page, a consumer might conclude that the
products displayed are types of MTM watches. But, merely looking at Amazon's
search results page shows that such consumer confusion is highly unlikely. None of
these watches is labeled with the word "MTM" or the phrase "Special Ops," let
alone the specific phrase "MTM Special Ops." Further, some of the products listed
are not even watches. The sixth result is a book entitled "Survive!: The Disaster,
Crisis and Emergency Handbook by Jerry Ahem." The tenth result is a book
entitled "The Moses Expedition: A Novel by Juan Gómez-Jurado." No reasonably
prudent consumer, accustomed to shopping online or not, would assume that a
book entitled "The Moses Expedition" is a type of MTM watch or is in any way
affiliated with MTM watches. Likewise, no reasonably prudent consumer
accustomed to shopping online would view Amazon's search results page and
conclude that the products offered are MTM watches. It is possible that someone,
somewhere might be confused by the search results page. But, "[u]nreasonable,
imprudent and inexperienced web-shoppers are not relevant." Tabari, 610 F.3d at
1176; see also Network Automation, 638 F.3d at 1153 ("[W]e expect consumers
searching for expensive products online to be even more sophisticated."). To

                                                    389
establish likelihood of confusion, MTM must show that confusion is likely, not just
possible. See Murray, 86 F.3d at 861.

        MTM argues that in order to eliminate the likelihood of confusion, Amazon
must change its search results page so that it explains to customers that it does not
offer MTM watches for sale before suggesting alternative watches to the customer.
We disagree. The search results page makes clear to anyone who can read English
that Amazon carries only the brands that are clearly and explicitly listed on the web
page. The search results page is unambiguous--not unlike when someone walks into
a diner, asks for a Coke, and is told "No Coke. Pepsi." See Multi Time Mach., Inc. v.
Amazon.com, Inc., 792 F.3d 1070, 1080-81 (9th Cir.2015) (Silverman, J., dissenting).

        In light of the clear labeling Amazon uses on its search results page, no
reasonable trier of fact could conclude that Amazon's search results page would
likely confuse a reasonably prudent consumer accustomed to shopping online as to
the source of the goods being offered. Cf. Playboy, 354 F.3d at 1030 n. 44 (Clear
labeling "might eliminate the likelihood of initial interest confusion that exists in
this case."); Network Automation, 638 F.3d at 1154 (same). As Judge Berzon put it, "I
do not think it is reasonable to find initial interest confusion when a consumer is
never confused as to source or affiliation, but instead knows, or should know, from
the outset that a product or web link is not related to that of the trademark holder
because the list produced by the search engine so informs him." Playboy, 354 F.3d at
1034-35 (9th Cir.2004) (Berzon, J., concurring).

        MTM attempts to argue that summary judgment of its claims is
inappropriate because there are numerous factual disputes related to Amazon's
search results page. But, to the extent there are factual disputes between the parties,
none is material to the analysis. MTM cannot dispute the fact that the watches at
issue sell for hundreds of dollars. Therefore, as a matter of law, the relevant
consumer would be a reasonably prudent consumer accustomed to shopping online.
See Tabari, 610 F.3d at 1176; Network Automation, 638 F.3d at 1152-53. Further,
MTM cannot dispute the contents of the web page at issue. A review of Amazon's
web page shows that each product listed for sale is clearly labeled with the product's
name and manufacturer and a photograph, and no product is labeled with MTM's
mark. Thus, the undisputed facts show that it is highly unlikely that a reasonably
prudent consumer accustomed to shopping online would be confused as to the
source of the goods offered for sale on Amazon's web page.

         The likelihood of confusion is often a question of fact, but not always. In a
case such as this, where a court can conclude that the consumer confusion alleged
by the trademark holder is highly unlikely by simply reviewing the product
listing/advertisement at issue, summary judgment is appropriate. Cf. M2 Software,
421 F.3d at 1085 (explaining that summary judgment of a trademark claim is
appropriate where the plaintiff has failed to present "sufficient evidence to permit a

                                                    390
rational trier of fact to find that confusion is `probable,' not merely `possible' ").
Indeed, in the similar context of evaluating claims of consumer deception when
dealing with false advertising claims, we have at least twice concluded--after a review
of the label or advertisement at issue--that there was no likelihood of consumer
deception as a matter of law because no reasonable consumer could have been
deceived by the label/advertisement at issue in the manner alleged by the plaintiff.
See, e.g., Davis v. HSBC Bank, 691 F.3d 1152, 1162 (9th Cir.2012); Freeman v. Time,
Inc., 68 F.3d 285, 289-90 (9th Cir.1995).

        Further, we are able to conclude that summary judgment is appropriate in
the present case without delving into any factors other than: (1) the type of goods
and the degree of care likely to be exercised by the purchaser; and (2) the labeling
and appearance of the products for sale and the surrounding context on the screen
displaying the results page. However, if we were to evaluate each of the remaining
Sleekcraft factors, those factors would not change our conclusion, here, because those
factors are either neutral or unimportant.

        "Actual confusion"--We have held that "[a] showing of actual confusion
among significant numbers of consumers provides strong support for the likelihood
of confusion." Playboy, 354 F.3d at 1026 (noting that a strong showing by the
plaintiff in regard to this factor alone can reverse a grant of summary judgment).
However, here, there is no evidence of actual confusion. The only "evidence" MTM
presented to the district court of actual confusion is the deposition testimony of
MTM's president stating that someone named Eric told him, in reference to
Amazon's web page, "it's confusing." Hearsay problems aside, this testimony is too
speculative to show actual confusion because there is no evidence showing that Eric
was a potential consumer. Indeed, at oral argument, MTM conceded that it does
not have evidence of actual consumer confusion. Therefore, this factor does not
weigh in MTM's favor.

        "Defendant's Intent"--We have also held that "[a] defendant's intent to
confuse constitutes probative evidence of likely confusion: Courts assume that the
defendant's intentions were carried out successfully." Playboy, 354 F.3d at 1028
(footnote omitted). MTM argues that the design of Amazon's search results page is
evidence of its intent to cause confusion. The design, however, indisputably
produces results that are clearly labeled as to the type of product and brand.
Amazon has designed its results page to alleviate any possible confusion about the
source of the products by clearly labeling each of its products with the product's
name and manufacturer. Therefore, this factor also does not weigh in MTM's favor.

        "Strength of the Mark"--MTM argues that it has presented sufficient
evidence below from which a jury could properly conclude that its trademark is
both conceptually strong and commercially strong. However, we find that this factor
is unimportant under the circumstances of this case. Even assuming MTM's mark is

                                                    391
one of the strongest in the world--on the same level as Apple, Coke, Disney, or
McDonald's--there is still no likelihood of confusion because Amazon clearly labels
the source of the products it offers for sale.

        Further, as we previously found in Network Automation, the remaining
Sleekcraft factors are unimportant in a case, such as this, involving Internet search
terms where the competing products are clearly labeled and the relevant consumer
would exercise a high degree of care. See Network Automation, 638 F.3d at 1150-53
(finding "proximity of goods," "similarity of marks," "marketing channels," and
"likelihood of expansion" to be unimportant in a trademark case involving Internet
search terms where the advertisements are clearly labeled and the relevant
consumers would exercise a high degree of care). . . .

BEA, Circuit Judge, dissenting:
        Today the panel holds that when it comes to internet commerce, judges, not

jurors, decide what labeling may confuse shoppers. In so doing, the court departs
from our own trademark precedent and from our summary judgment
jurisprudence. Because I believe that an Amazon shopper seeking an MTM watch
might well initially think that the watches Amazon offers for sale when he searches
"MTM Special Ops" are affiliated with MTM, I must dissent.

        If her brother mentioned MTM Special Ops watches, a frequent internet
shopper might try to purchase one for him through her usual internet retail sites,
perhaps Overstock.com, Buy.com, and Amazon.com.1 At Overstock's site, if she
typed "MTM special ops," the site would respond "Sorry, your search: `mtm special
ops' returned no results." Similarly, at Buy.com, she would be informed "0 results
found. Sorry. Your search for mtm special ops did not return an exact match.
Please try your search again."

        Things are a little different over at "Earth's most customer-centric company,"
as Amazon styles itself. There, if she were to enter "MTM Special Ops" as her search
request on the Amazon website, Amazon would respond with its page showing (1)
MTM Special Ops in the search field (2) "MTM Specials Ops" again--in quotation
marks--immediately below the search field and (3) yet again in the phrase "Related
Searches: MTM special ops watch," (emphasis in original) all before stating "Showing
10 Results." What the website's response will not state is the truth recognized by its
competitors: that Amazon does not carry MTM products any more than do
Overstock.com or Buy.com. Rather, below the search field, and below the second
and third mentions of "MTM Special Ops" noted above, the site will display
aesthetically similar, multi-function watches manufactured by MTM's competitors.
The shopper will see that Luminox and Chase-Durer watches are offered for sale,
in response to her MTM query.

        MTM asserts the shopper might be confused into thinking a relationship
exists between Luminox and MTM; she may think that MTM was acquired by

                                                    392
Luminox, or that MTM manufactures component parts of Luminox watches, for
instance. As a result of this initial confusion, MTM asserts, she might look into
buying a Luminox watch, rather than junk the quest altogether and seek to buy an
MTM watch elsewhere. MTM asserts that Amazon's use of MTM's trademarked
name is likely to confuse buyers, who may ultimately buy a competitor's goods.

        MTM may be mistaken. But whether MTM is mistaken is a question that
requires a factual determination, one this court does not have authority to make.

        By usurping the jury function, the majority today makes new trademark law.
When we allow a jury to determine whether there is a likelihood of confusion, as I
would, we do not make trademark law, because we announce no new principle by
which to adjudicate trademark disputes. Today's brief majority opinion
accomplishes a great deal: the majority announces a new rule of law, resolves
whether "clear labeling" favors Amazon using its own judgment, and, sub silentio,
overrules this court's "initial interest confusion" doctrine. . . .

        A jury could infer that the labeling of the search results, and Amazon's
failure to notify customers that it does not have results that match MTM's mark,
give rise to initial interest confusion. If so, a jury could find that Amazon customers
searching for MTM products are subject to more than mere diversion, since MTM is
not required to show that customers are likely to be confused at the point of
sale. . . .

        Through its cursory review of the Sleekcraft factors and conclusory statements
about clear labeling, the majority purports to apply this circuit's trademark law, and
ignores the doctrine of initial interest confusion. In so doing, the majority today
writes new trademark law and blurs the line between innovation and infringement.

        More troubling, the majority ignores the role of the jury. Summary judgment
law is an aid to judicial economy, but it can be so only to the extent that it comports
with the Seventh Amendment. Were we to reverse and remand, MTM might well
lose. The likelihood of that outcome is irrelevant to the question whether there is a
genuine issue of fact. I respectfully dissent.

17. Secondary Liability

                                Tiffany (NJ) Inc. v. eBay Inc.
                                  600 F.3d 93 (2d Cir. 2010)

SACK, Circuit Judge:
        eBay, Inc. ("eBay"), through its eponymous online marketplace, has

revolutionized the online sale of goods, especially used goods. It has facilitated the
buying and selling by hundreds of millions of people and entities, to their benefit
and eBay's profit. But that marketplace is sometimes employed by users as a means
to perpetrate fraud by selling counterfeit goods.

        Plaintiffs Tiffany (NJ) Inc. and Tiffany and Company (together, "Tiffany")
have created and cultivated a brand of jewelry bespeaking high-end quality and style.
Based on Tiffany's concern that some use eBay's website to sell counterfeit Tiffany
merchandise, Tiffany has instituted this action against eBay, asserting various causes
of action . . . . For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the district court's
judgment with respect to Tiffany's claims of trademark infringement . . . but
remand for further proceedings with respect to Tiffany's false advertising claim.

                                       BACKGROUND
        . . . . Except where noted otherwise, we conclude that the district court's
findings of fact are not clearly erroneous. We therefore rely upon those non-
erroneous findings in setting forth the facts of, and considering, this dispute.
eBay
        eBay is the proprietor of www. ebay. com, an Internet-based marketplace that
allows those who register with it to purchase goods from and sell goods to one
another. It "connect[s] buyers and sellers and [ ] enable[s] transactions, which are
carried out directly between eBay members." Tiffany, 576 F.Supp.2d at 475. In its
auction and listing services, it "provides the venue for the sale [of goods] and
support for the transaction[s], [but] it does not itself sell the items" listed for sale on
the site, nor does it ever take physical possession of them. Thus, "eBay generally
does not know whether or when an item is delivered to the buyer."
        eBay has been enormously successful. More than six million new listings are
posted on its site daily. At any given time it contains some 100 million listings.
        eBay generates revenue by charging sellers to use its listing services. For any
listing, it charges an "insertion fee" based on the auction's starting price for the
goods being sold and ranges from $0.20 to $4.80. For any completed sale, it charges
a "final value fee" that ranges from 5.25% to 10% of the final sale price of the item.
Sellers have the option of purchasing, at additional cost, features "to differentiate
their listings, such as a border or bold-faced type."

                                                    394
        eBay also generates revenue through a company named PayPal, which it
owns and which allows users to process their purchases. PayPal deducts, as a fee for
each transaction that it processes, 1.9% to 2.9% of the transaction amount, plus
$0.30. This gives eBay an added incentive to increase both the volume and the price
of the goods sold on its website.
Tiffany

        Tiffany is a world-famous purveyor of, among other things, branded jewelry.
Since 2000, all new Tiffany jewelry sold in the United States has been available
exclusively through Tiffany's retail stores, catalogs, and website, and through its
Corporate Sales Department. It does not use liquidators, sell overstock
merchandise, or put its goods on sale at discounted prices. It does not-nor can it, for
that matter-control the "legitimate secondary market in authentic Tiffany silvery
jewelry," i.e., the market for second-hand Tiffany wares. The record developed at
trial "offere[d] little basis from which to discern the actual availability of authentic
Tiffany silver jewelry in the secondary market."

        Sometime before 2004, Tiffany became aware that counterfeit Tiffany
merchandise was being sold on eBay's site. Prior to and during the course of this
litigation, Tiffany conducted two surveys known as "Buying Programs," one in 2004
and another in 2005, in an attempt to assess the extent of this practice. Under those
programs, Tiffany bought various items on eBay and then inspected and evaluated
them to determine how many were counterfeit. Tiffany found that 73.1% of the
purported Tiffany goods purchased in the 2004 Buying Program and 75.5% of
those purchased in the 2005 Buying Program were counterfeit. The district court
concluded, however, that the Buying Programs were "methodologically flawed and
of questionable value," and "provide[d] limited evidence as to the total percentage
of counterfeit goods available on eBay at any given time," The court nonetheless
decided that during the period in which the Buying Programs were in effect, a
"significant portion of the `Tiffany' sterling silver jewelry listed on the eBay website
... was counterfeit," and that eBay knew "that some portion of the Tiffany goods
sold on its website might be counterfeit." The court found, however, that "a
substantial number of authentic Tiffany goods are [also] sold on eBay."

        Reducing or eliminating the sale of all second-hand Tiffany goods, including
genuine Tiffany pieces, through eBay's website would benefit Tiffany in at least one
sense: It would diminish the competition in the market for genuine Tiffany
merchandise. The immediate effect would be loss of revenue to eBay, even though
there might be a countervailing gain by eBay resulting from increased consumer
confidence about the bona fides of other goods sold through its website.
Anti-Counterfeiting Measures

        Because eBay facilitates many sales of Tiffany goods, genuine and otherwise,
and obtains revenue on every transaction, it generates substantial revenues from the

                                                    395
sale of purported Tiffany goods, some of which are counterfeit. "eBay's Jewelry &
Watches category manager estimated that, between April 2000 and June 2004, eBay
earned $4.1 million in revenue from completed listings with `Tiffany' in the listing
title in the Jewelry & Watches category." Although eBay was generating revenue
from all sales of goods on its site, including counterfeit goods, the district court
found eBay to have "an interest in eliminating counterfeit Tiffany merchandise
from eBay ... to preserve the reputation of its website as a safe place to do business."
The buyer of fake Tiffany goods might, if and when the forgery was detected, fault
eBay. Indeed, the district court found that "buyers ... complain[ed] to eBay" about
the sale of counterfeit Tiffany goods. "[D]uring the last six weeks of 2004, 125
consumers complained to eBay about purchasing `Tiffany' items through the eBay
website that they believed to be counterfeit."

        Because eBay "never saw or inspected the merchandise in the listings," its
ability to determine whether a particular listing was for counterfeit goods was
limited. Even had it been able to inspect the goods, moreover, in many instances it
likely would not have had the expertise to determine whether they were counterfeit.

        Notwithstanding these limitations, eBay spent "as much as $20 million each
year on tools to promote trust and safety on its website." For example, eBay and
PayPal set up "buyer protection programs," under which, in certain circumstances,
the buyer would be reimbursed for the cost of items purchased on eBay that were
discovered not to be genuine. eBay also established a "Trust and Safety"
department, with some 4,000 employees "devoted to trust and safety" issues,
including over 200 who "focus exclusively on combating infringement" and 70 who
"work exclusively with law enforcement."

        By May 2002, eBay had implemented a "fraud engine," "which is principally
dedicated to ferreting out illegal listings, including counterfeit listings." eBay had
theretofore employed manual searches for keywords in listings in an effort to
"identify blatant instances of potentially infringing ... activity." "The fraud engine
uses rules and complex models that automatically search for activity that violates
eBay policies." In addition to identifying items actually advertised as counterfeit, the
engine also incorporates various filters designed to screen out less-obvious instances
of counterfeiting using "data elements designed to evaluate listings based on, for
example, the seller's Internet protocol address, any issues associated with the seller's
account on eBay, and the feedback the seller has received from other eBay users." In
addition to general filters, the fraud engine incorporates "Tiffany-specific filters,"
including "approximately 90 different keywords" designed to help distinguish
between genuine and counterfeit Tiffany goods. During the period in dispute, eBay
also "periodically conducted [manual] reviews of listings in an effort to remove those
that might be selling counterfeit goods, including Tiffany goods."

                                                    396
        For nearly a decade, including the period at issue, eBay has also maintained
and administered the "Verified Rights Owner (`VeRO') Program"--a " `notice-and-
takedown' system" allowing owners of intellectual property rights, including Tiffany,
to "report to eBay any listing offering potentially infringing items, so that eBay
could remove such reported listings." Any such rights-holder with a "good-faith
belief that [a particular listed] item infringed on a copyright or a trademark" could
report the item to eBay, using a "Notice Of Claimed Infringement form or NOCI
form." During the period under consideration, eBay's practice was to remove
reported listings within twenty-four hours of receiving a NOCI, but eBay in fact
deleted seventy to eighty percent of them within twelve hours of notification.

        On receipt of a NOCI, if the auction or sale had not ended, eBay would, in
addition to removing the listing, cancel the bids and inform the seller of the reason
for the cancellation. If bidding had ended, eBay would retroactively cancel the
transaction. In the event of a cancelled auction, eBay would refund the fees it had
been paid in connection with the auction.

        In some circumstances, eBay would reimburse the buyer for the cost of a
purchased item, provided the buyer presented evidence that the purchased item was
counterfeit.4 During the relevant time period, the district court found, eBay "never
refused to remove a reported Tiffany listing, acted in good faith in responding to
Tiffany's NOCIs, and always provided Tiffany with the seller's contact
information."

        In addition, eBay has allowed rights owners such as Tiffany to create an
"About Me" webpage on eBay's website "to inform eBay users about their products,
intellectual property rights, and legal positions." eBay does not exercise control over
the content of those pages in a manner material to the issues before us.

        Tiffany, not eBay, maintains the Tiffany "About Me" page. With the
headline "BUYER BEWARE," the page begins: "Most of the purported TIFFANY
& CO. silver jewelry and packaging available on eBay is counterfeit." It also says,
inter alia:

        The only way you can be certain that you are purchasing a genuine TIFFANY
        & CO. product is to purchase it from a Tiffany & Co. retail store, via our
        website (www. tiffany. com) or through a Tiffany & Co. catalogue. Tiffany &
        Co. stores do not authenticate merchandise. A good jeweler or appraiser may
        be able to do this for you.

          4 We note, however, that, Tiffany's "About Me" page on the eBay website states that Tiffany does

not authenticate merchandise. Pl.'s Ex. 290.

          Thus, it may be difficult for a purchaser to proffer evidence to eBay supporting a suspicion that the

"Tiffany" merchandise he or she bought is counterfeit.

                                                    397
        In 2003 or early 2004, eBay began to use "special warning messages when a
seller attempted to list a Tiffany item." These messages "instructed the seller to
make sure that the item was authentic Tiffany merchandise and informed the seller
that eBay `does not tolerate the listing of replica, counterfeit, or otherwise
unauthorized items' and that violation of this policy `could result in suspension of
[the seller's] account.' " The messages also provided a link to Tiffany's "About Me"
page with its "buyer beware" disclaimer. If the seller "continued to list an item
despite the warning, the listing was flagged for review."

        In addition to cancelling particular suspicious transactions, eBay has also
suspended from its website " `hundreds of thousands of sellers every year,' tens of
thousands of whom were suspected [of] having engaged in infringing conduct." eBay
primarily employed a " `three strikes rule' " for suspensions, but would suspend
sellers after the first violation if it was clear that "the seller `listed a number of
infringing items,' and `[selling counterfeit merchandise] appears to be the only thing
they've come to eBay to do.' " But if "a seller listed a potentially infringing item but
appeared overall to be a legitimate seller, the `infringing items [were] taken down,
and the seller [would] be sent a warning on the first offense and given the
educational information, [and] told that ... if they do this again, they will be
suspended from eBay.' "5

        By late 2006, eBay had implemented additional anti-fraud measures: delaying
the ability of buyers to view listings of certain brand names, including Tiffany's, for
6 to 12 hours so as to give rights-holders such as Tiffany more time to review those
listings; developing the ability to assess the number of items listed in a given listing;
and restricting one-day and three-day auctions and cross-border trading for some
brand-name items.

        The district court concluded that "eBay consistently took steps to improve its
technology and develop anti-fraud measures as such measures became
technologically feasible and reasonably available."
eBay's Advertising

        At the same time that eBay was attempting to reduce the sale of counterfeit
items on its website, it actively sought to promote sales of premium and branded

          5 According to the district court, "eBay took appropriate steps to warn and then to suspend sellers

when eBay learned of potential trademark infringement under that seller's account." The district court

concluded that it was understandable that eBay did not have a "hard-and-fast, one-strike rule" of suspending

sellers because a NOCI "did not constitute a definitive finding that the listed item was counterfeit" and

because "suspension was a very serious matter, particularly to those sellers who relied on eBay for their

livelihoods." The district court ultimately found eBay's policy to be "appropriate and effective in preventing

sellers from returning to eBay and re-listing potentially counterfeit merchandise."

                                                    398
jewelry, including Tiffany merchandise, on its site. Among other things, eBay
"advised its sellers to take advantage of the demand for Tiffany merchandise as part
of a broader effort to grow the Jewelry & Watches category." And prior to 2003,
eBay advertised the availability of Tiffany merchandise on its site. eBay's
advertisements trumpeted "Mother's Day Gifts!," a "Fall FASHION BRAND
BLOWOUT," "Jewelry Best Sellers," "GREAT BRANDS, GREAT PRICES," or
"Top Valentine's Deals," among other promotions. It encouraged the viewer to
"GET THE FINER THINGS." These advertisements provided the reader with
hyperlinks, at least one of each of which was related to Tiffany merchandise-
"Tiffany," "Tiffany & Co. under $150," "Tiffany & Co," "Tiffany Rings," or
"Tiffany & Co. under $50."

        eBay also purchased sponsored-link advertisements on various search engines
to promote the availability of Tiffany items on its website. Tiffany, 576 F.Supp.2d at
480. In one such case, in the form of a printout of the results list from a search on
Yahoo! for "tiffany," the second sponsored link read "Tiffany on eBay. Find tiffany
items at low prices. With over 5 million items for sale every day, you'll find all kinds
of unique [unreadable] Marketplace. www. ebay. com." Pl.'s Ex. 1065 (bold face type
in original). Tiffany complained to eBay of the practice in 2003, and eBay told
Tiffany that it had ceased buying sponsored links. The district court found,
however, that eBay continued to do so indirectly through a third party.
Procedural History

        By amended complaint dated July 15, 2004, Tiffany initiated this action. It
alleged, inter alia, that eBay's conduct--i.e., facilitating and advertising the sale of
"Tiffany" goods that turned out to be counterfeit--constituted direct and
contributory trademark infringement, trademark dilution, and false advertising. On
July 14, 2008, following a bench trial, the district court, in a thorough and
thoughtful opinion, set forth its findings of fact and conclusions of law, deciding in
favor of eBay on all claims.

        Tiffany appeals from the district court's judgment for eBay.
                                         DISCUSSION

        We review the district court's findings of fact for clear error and its
conclusions of law de novo. Giordano v. Thomson, 564 F.3d 163, 168 (2d Cir.2009).

        I. Direct Trademark Infringement [the court affirmed the conclusion
that eBay did not engage in direct trademark infringement]

        II. Contributory Trademark Infringement
        The more difficult issue, and the one that the parties have properly focused
our attention on, is whether eBay is liable for contributory trademark
infringement--i.e., for culpably facilitating the infringing conduct of the
counterfeiting vendors. Acknowledging the paucity of case law to guide us, we

                                                    399
conclude that the district court correctly granted judgment on this issue in favor of
eBay.
A. Principles

        Contributory trademark infringement is a judicially created doctrine that
derives from the common law of torts. The Supreme Court most recently dealt with
the subject in Inwood Laboratories, Inc. v. Ives Laboratories, Inc., 456 U.S. 844 (1982).
There, the plaintiff, Ives, asserted that several drug manufacturers had induced
pharmacists to mislabel a drug the defendants produced to pass it off as Ives'.
According to the Court, "if a manufacturer or distributor intentionally induces
another to infringe a trademark, or if it continues to supply its product to one
whom it knows or has reason to know is engaging in trademark infringement, the
manufacturer or distributor is contributorially responsible for any harm done as a
result of the deceit." The Court ultimately decided to remand the case to the Court
of Appeals after concluding it had improperly rejected factual findings of the district
court favoring the defendant manufacturers.

        Inwood's test for contributory trademark infringement applies on its face to
manufacturers and distributors of goods. Courts have, however, extended the test to
providers of services.

        The Seventh Circuit applied Inwood to a lawsuit against the owner of a swap
meet, or "flea market," whose vendors were alleged to have sold infringing Hard
Rock Café T-shirts. See Hard Rock Café, 955 F.2d at 1148-49. The court "treated
trademark infringement as a species of tort," and analogized the swap meet owner to
a landlord or licensor, on whom the common law "imposes the same duty ... [as
Inwood ] impose[s] on manufacturers and distributors," id. at 1149.

        Speaking more generally, the Ninth Circuit concluded that Inwood's test for
contributory trademark infringement applies to a service provider if he or she
exercises sufficient control over the infringing conduct. Lockheed Martin Corp. v.
Network Solutions, Inc., 194 F.3d 980, 984 (9th Cir.1999) . . . .

        The limited case law leaves the law of contributory trademark infringement
ill-defined. Although we are not the first court to consider the application of Inwood
to the Internet . . . we are apparently the first to consider its application to an online
marketplace.9

          9 European courts have done so. A Belgian court declined to hold eBay liable for counterfeit

cosmetic products sold through its website. See Lancôme v. eBay, Brussels Commercial Court (Aug. 12, 2008),

Docket No. A/07/06032. French courts, by contrast, have concluded that eBay violated applicable trademark

laws. See, e.g., S.A. Louis Vuitton Malletier v. eBay, Inc., Tribunal de Commerce de Paris, Premiere Chambre B.

(Paris Commercial Court), Case No. 200677799 (June 30, 2008); Hermes v. eBay, Troyes High Court (June 4,

2008), Docket No. 06/0264; see also Max Colchester, "EBay to Pay Damages To Unit of LVMH," The Wall

Street Journal, Feb. 12, 2010, http:// online. wsj. com/ article_ email/ SB 1000142405 274870433700

                                                    400
B. Discussion
        1. Does Inwood Apply?
        In the district court, the parties disputed whether eBay was subject to the

Inwood test. eBay argued that it was not because it supplies a service while Inwood
governs only manufacturers and distributors of products. The district court rejected
that distinction. It adopted instead the reasoning of the Ninth Circuit in Lockheed to
conclude that Inwood applies to a service provider who exercises sufficient control
over the means of the infringing conduct. Looking "to the extent of the control
exercised by eBay over its sellers' means of infringement," the district court
concluded that Inwood applied in light of the "significant control" eBay retained
over the transactions and listings facilitated by and conducted through its website.

        On appeal, eBay no longer maintains that it is not subject to Inwood.10 We
therefore assume without deciding that Inwood's test for contributory trademark
infringement governs.

        2. Is eBay Liable Under Inwood?
         The question that remains, then, is whether eBay is liable under the Inwood
test on the basis of the services it provided to those who used its website to sell
counterfeit Tiffany products. As noted, when applying Inwood to service providers,
there are two ways in which a defendant may become contributorially liable for the
infringing conduct of another: first, if the service provider "intentionally induces
another to infringe a trademark," and second, if the service provider "continues to
supply its [service] to one whom it knows or has reason to know is engaging in
trademark infringement." Inwood, 456 U.S. at 854. Tiffany does not argue that eBay
induced the sale of counterfeit Tiffany goods on its website--the circumstances
addressed by the first part of the Inwood test. It argues instead, under the second
part of the Inwood test, that eBay continued to supply its services to the sellers of
counterfeit Tiffany goods while knowing or having reason to know that such sellers
were infringing Tiffany's mark.

Products, 1 No. 2 Landslide 22 (2008) (surveying decisions by European courts in trademark infringement

cases brought against eBay).

          10 Amici do so claim. See Electronic Frontier Foundation et al. Amici Br. 6 (arguing that Inwood
should "not govern where, as here, the alleged contributory infringer has no direct means to establish

whether there is any act of direct infringement in the first place"). We decline to consider this argument. . . .

                                                    401
        The district court rejected this argument. First, it concluded that to the
extent the NOCIs that Tiffany submitted gave eBay reason to know that particular
listings were for counterfeit goods, eBay did not continue to carry those listings
once it learned that they were specious. The court found that eBay's practice was
promptly to remove the challenged listing from its website, warn sellers and buyers,
cancel fees it earned from that listing, and direct buyers not to consummate the sale
of the disputed item. The court therefore declined to hold eBay contributorially
liable for the infringing conduct of those sellers. On appeal, Tiffany does not appear
to challenge this conclusion. In any event, we agree with the district court that no
liability arises with respect to those terminated listings.

         Tiffany disagrees vigorously, however, with the district court's further
determination that eBay lacked sufficient knowledge of trademark infringement by
sellers behind other, non-terminated listings to provide a basis for Inwood liability.
Tiffany argued in the district court that eBay knew, or at least had reason to know,
that counterfeit Tiffany goods were being sold ubiquitously on its website. As
evidence, it pointed to, inter alia, the demand letters it sent to eBay in 2003 and
2004, the results of its Buying Programs that it shared with eBay, the thousands of
NOCIs it filed with eBay alleging its good faith belief that certain listings were
counterfeit, and the various complaints eBay received from buyers claiming that
they had purchased one or more counterfeit Tiffany items through eBay's website.
Tiffany argued that taken together, this evidence established eBay's knowledge of
the widespread sale of counterfeit Tiffany products on its website. Tiffany urged that
eBay be held contributorially liable on the basis that despite that knowledge, it
continued to make its services available to infringing sellers.

        The district court rejected this argument. It acknowledged that "[t]he
evidence produced at trial demonstrated that eBay had generalized notice that some
portion of the Tiffany goods sold on its website might be counterfeit." (emphasis in
original). The court characterized the issue before it as "whether eBay's generalized
knowledge of trademark infringement on its website was sufficient to meet the
`knowledge or reason to know' prong of the Inwood test." (emphasis in original).
eBay had argued that "such generalized knowledge is insufficient, and that the law
demands more specific knowledge of individual instances of infringement and
infringing sellers before imposing a burden upon eBay to remedy the problem."

        The district court concluded that "while eBay clearly possessed general
knowledge as to counterfeiting on its website, such generalized knowledge is
insufficient under the Inwood test to impose upon eBay an affirmative duty to
remedy the problem." The court reasoned that Inwood's language explicitly imposes
contributory liability on a defendant who "continues to supply its product [--in
eBay's case, its service--] to one whom it knows or has reason to know is engaging in
trademark infringement." (emphasis in original). The court also noted that plaintiffs

                                                    402
"bear a high burden in establishing `knowledge' of contributory infringement," and
that courts have

        been reluctant to extend contributory trademark liability to defendants
        where there is some uncertainty as to the extent or the nature of the
        infringement. In Inwood, Justice White emphasized in his concurring opinion
        that a defendant is not "require[d] ... to refuse to sell to dealers who merely
        might pass off its goods."

(quoting Inwood, 456 U.S. at 861) (White, J., concurring) (emphasis and alteration
in original).

        Accordingly, the district court concluded that for Tiffany to establish eBay's
contributory liability, Tiffany would have to show that eBay "knew or had reason to
know of specific instances of actual infringement" beyond those that it addressed
upon learning of them. Tiffany failed to make such a showing.

        On appeal, Tiffany argues that the distinction drawn by the district court
between eBay's general knowledge of the sale of counterfeit Tiffany goods through
its website, and its specific knowledge as to which particular sellers were making
such sales, is a "false" one not required by the law. Tiffany posits that the only
relevant question is "whether all of the knowledge, when taken together, puts [eBay]
on notice that there is a substantial problem of trademark infringement. If so and if
it fails to act, [eBay] is liable for contributory trademark infringement."

        We agree with the district court. For contributory trademark infringement
liability to lie, a service provider must have more than a general knowledge or
reason to know that its service is being used to sell counterfeit goods. Some
contemporary knowledge of which particular listings are infringing or will infringe
in the future is necessary.

        We are not persuaded by Tiffany's proposed interpretation of Inwood. Tiffany
understands the "lesson of Inwood " to be that an action for contributory trademark
infringement lies where "the evidence [of infringing activity]--direct or
circumstantial, taken as a whole--... provide[s] a basis for finding that the defendant
knew or should have known that its product or service was being used to further
illegal counterfeiting activity." We think that Tiffany reads Inwood too broadly.
Although the Inwood Court articulated a "knows or has reason to know" prong in
setting out its contributory liability test, the Court explicitly declined to apply that
prong to the facts then before it. See Inwood, 456 U.S. at 852 n. 12 ("The District
Court also found that the petitioners did not continue to provide drugs to retailers
whom they knew or should have known were engaging in trademark infringement.
The Court of Appeals did not discuss that finding, and we do not address it.")
(internal citation omitted). The Court applied only the inducement prong of the
test.

                                                    403
        We therefore do not think that Inwood establishes the contours of the
"knows or has reason to know" prong. Insofar as it speaks to the issue, though, the
particular phrasing that the Court used--that a defendant will be liable if it
"continues to supply its product to one whom it knows or has reason to know is
engaging in trademark infringement," id. at 854 (emphasis added)--supports the
district court's interpretation of Inwood, not Tiffany's.

        We find helpful the Supreme Court's discussion of Inwood in a subsequent
copyright case, Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 464 U.S. 417
(1984). There, defendant Sony manufactured and sold home video tape recorders.
Plaintiffs Universal Studios and Walt Disney Productions held copyrights on
various television programs that individual television-viewers had taped using the
defendant's recorders. The plaintiffs contended that this use of the recorders
constituted copyright infringement for which the defendants should be held
contributorily liable. In ruling for the defendants, the Court discussed Inwood and
the differences between contributory liability in trademark versus copyright law.

        If Inwood's narrow standard for contributory trademark infringement governed
        here, [the plaintiffs'] claim of contributory infringement would merit little
        discussion. Sony certainly does not `intentionally induce[ ]' its customers to
        make infringing uses of [the plaintiffs'] copyrights, nor does it supply its
        products to identified individuals known by it to be engaging in continuing
        infringement of [the plaintiffs'] copyrights.

Id. at 439 n. 19 (quoting Inwood, 456 U.S. at 855; emphases added).
        Thus, the Court suggested, had the Inwood standard applied in Sony, the fact

that Sony might have known that some portion of the purchasers of its product
used it to violate the copyrights of others would not have provided a sufficient basis
for contributory liability. Inwood's "narrow standard" would have required
knowledge by Sony of "identified individuals" engaging in infringing conduct.
Tiffany's reading of Inwood is therefore contrary to the interpretation of that case set
forth in Sony.

        Although the Supreme Court's observations in Sony, a copyright case, about
the "knows or has reason to know" prong of the contributory trademark
infringement test set forth in Inwood were dicta, they constitute the only discussion
of that prong by the Supreme Court of which we are aware. We think them to be
persuasive authority here.12

          12 In discussing Inwood's "knows or has reason to know" prong of the contributory infringement test,

Sony refers to a defendant's knowledge, but not to its constructive knowledge, of a third party's infringing

conduct. Sony, 464 U.S. at 439 n. 19. We do not take the omission as altering the test Inwood articulates.

                                                    404
        Applying Sony's interpretation of Inwood, we agree with the district court that
"Tiffany's general allegations of counterfeiting failed to provide eBay with the
knowledge required under Inwood." Tiffany's demand letters and Buying Programs
did not identify particular sellers who Tiffany thought were then offering or would
offer counterfeit goods.13 And although the NOCIs and buyer complaints gave eBay
reason to know that certain sellers had been selling counterfeits, those sellers'
listings were removed and repeat offenders were suspended from the eBay site. Thus
Tiffany failed to demonstrate that eBay was supplying its service to individuals who
it knew or had reason to know were selling counterfeit Tiffany goods.

        Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court insofar as it holds
that eBay is not contributorially liable for trademark infringement.

        3. Willful Blindness.
        Tiffany and its amici express their concern that if eBay is not held liable
except when specific counterfeit listings are brought to its attention, eBay will have
no incentive to root out such listings from its website. They argue that this will
effectively require Tiffany and similarly situated retailers to police eBay's website--
and many others like it--"24 hours a day, and 365 days a year." Council of Fashion
Designers of America, Inc. Amicus Br. 5. They urge that this is a burden that most
mark holders cannot afford to bear.
        First, and most obviously, we are interpreting the law and applying it to the
facts of this case. We could not, even if we thought it wise, revise the existing law in
order to better serve one party's interests at the expense of the other's.
        But we are also disposed to think, and the record suggests, that private
market forces give eBay and those operating similar businesses a strong incentive to
minimize the counterfeit goods sold on their websites. eBay received many
complaints from users claiming to have been duped into buying counterfeit Tiffany
products sold on eBay. The risk of alienating these users gives eBay a reason to
identify and remove counterfeit listings.14 Indeed, it has spent millions of dollars in
that effort.
        Moreover, we agree with the district court that if eBay had reason to suspect
that counterfeit Tiffany goods were being sold through its website, and intentionally

          13 The demand letters did say that eBay should presume that sellers offering five or more Tiffany

goods were selling counterfeits, but we agree with the district court that this presumption was factually

unfounded.

          14 At the same time, we appreciate the argument that insofar as eBay receives revenue from

undetected counterfeit listings and sales through the fees it charges, it has an incentive to permit such listings

and sales to continue.

                                                    405
shielded itself from discovering the offending listings or the identity of the sellers
behind them, eBay might very well have been charged with knowledge of those sales
sufficient to satisfy Inwood's "knows or has reason to know" prong. A service
provider is not, we think, permitted willful blindness. When it has reason to suspect
that users of its service are infringing a protected mark, it may not shield itself from
learning of the particular infringing transactions by looking the other way. See, e.g.,
Hard Rock Café, 955 F.2d at 1149 ("To be willfully blind, a person must suspect
wrongdoing and deliberately fail to investigate."); Fonovisa, 76 F.3d at 265 (applying
Hard Rock Café's reasoning to conclude that "a swap meet can not disregard its
vendors' blatant trademark infringements with impunity").15 In the words of the
Seventh Circuit, "willful blindness is equivalent to actual knowledge for purposes of
the Lanham Act." Hard Rock Café, 955 F.2d at 1149.16

        eBay appears to concede that it knew as a general matter that counterfeit
Tiffany products were listed and sold through its website. Without more, however,
this knowledge is insufficient to trigger liability under Inwood. The district court
found, after careful consideration, that eBay was not willfully blind to the
counterfeit sales. That finding is not clearly erroneous.17 eBay did not ignore the
information it was given about counterfeit sales on its website.

          15 To be clear, a service provider is not contributorially liable under Inwood merely for failing to
anticipate that others would use its service to infringe a protected mark. Inwood, 456 U.S. at 854 n. 13
(stating that for contributory liability to lie, a defendant must do more than "reasonably anticipate" a third
party's infringing conduct (internal quotation marks omitted)). But contributory liability may arise where a
defendant is (as was eBay here) made aware that there was infringement on its site but (unlike eBay here)
ignored that fact.

          16 The principle that willful blindness is tantamount to knowledge is hardly novel. See, e.g. Harte-
Hanks Commc'ns, Inc. v. Connaughton, 491 U.S. 657, 659, 692, (1989) (concluding in public-official libel case
that "purposeful avoidance of the truth" is equivalent to "knowledge that [a statement] was false or [was
made] with reckless disregard of whether it was false" (internal quotation marks omitted)) . . . .

          17 Tiffany's reliance on the "flea market" cases, Hard Rock Café and Fonovisa, is unavailing. eBay's
efforts to combat counterfeiting far exceeded the efforts made by the defendants in those cases. See Hard Rock
Café, 955 F.2d at 1146 (defendant did not investigate any of the seizures of counterfeit products at its swap
meet, even though it knew they had occurred); Fonovisa, 76 F.3d at 265 (concluding that plaintiff stated a
claim for contributory trademark infringement based on allegation that swap meet "disregard[ed] its vendors'
blatant trademark infringements with impunity"). Moreover, neither case concluded that the defendant was
willfully blind. The court in Hard Rock Café remanded so that the district court could apply the correct
definition of "willful blindness," 955 F.2d at 1149, and the court in Fonovisa merely sustained the plaintiff's
complaint against a motion to dismiss, 76 F.3d at 260-61, 265.

                                                    406
                                              Notes

        Beware juries. For a differing outcome than Tiffany, see Louis Vuitton
Malletier, S.A. v. Akanoc Solutions, Inc., 2010 WL 5598337 (N.D. Cal. 2010)
(upholding contributory infringement jury verdict and damages of $10,500,000 per
defendant where "[d]efendants had numerous tools at their disposal for monitoring
their servers and terminating abusive users. For example, Defendants had the ability
to suspend a particular user, disable IP addresses used by a particular website or, if
necessary, unplug a server that contained the data for a particular website."). To be
sure, in Akanoc there was some evidence of the web host's ignoring notices about
infringing matter.

        Statutory sources of contributory trademark liability. The Lanham Act does not
expressly provide a cause of action for contributory and vicarious infringers. Nor,
for that matter, does the Copyright Act. The Supreme Court has nonetheless found
such liability to exist as an application of traditional common law principles of
agency liability (which were not modified in Congress's codification copyright law).
See, e.g., Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd., 545 U.S. 913, 930 (2005)
("Although `[t]he Copyright Act does not expressly render anyone liable for
infringement committed by another,' these doctrines of secondary liability emerged
from common law principles and are well established in the law." (citations omitted)
(quoting Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 464 U.S. 417, 434
(1984)).

        Similar principles are at work in trademark. The leading Supreme Court
case, Inwood Laboratories, Inc. v. Ives Laboratories, Inc., 456 U.S. 844 (1982),
established secondary liability under the Lanham Act by citing pre-Lanham Act
precedents and observing simply that "Although Warner and other cases were
decided before § 32 was enacted, the purpose of the Lanham Act was to codify and
unify the common law of unfair competition and trademark protection. S.Rep.No.
1333, 79th Cong., 2d Sess. (1946). There is no suggestion that Congress intended
to depart from Warner and other contemporary precedents." Id. at 861 n.2

        The Inwood standard. In Inwood the Court concluded that "if a manufacturer
or distributor intentionally induces another to infringe a trademark, or if it
continues to supply its product to one whom it knows or has reason to know is
engaging in trademark infringement, the manufacturer or distributor is
contributorially responsible for any harm done as a result of the deceit." Inwood, 456
U.S. at 854.

                                                    407
        As noted by eBay, the Supreme Court has suggested in dicta that the Inwood
test is hard to meet. Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 464 U.S.
417, 439 n.19 (1984) ("Given the fundamental differences between copyright law
and trademark law, in this copyright case we do not look to the standard for
contributory infringement set forth in Inwood Laboratories v. Ives Laboratories . . . . If
Inwood's narrow standard for contributory trademark infringement governed here,
respondents' claim of contributory infringement would merit little discussion.").

        Lanham Act carveouts. Although the Lanham Act does not explicitly authorize
third party liability, the latter parts of section 32 provide a number of safe harbors
for certain potential third-party infringement situations:

        (2) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the remedies given
        to the owner of a right infringed under this chapter or to a person bringing
        an action under section 1125 (a) or (d) of this title shall be limited as follows:

                (A) Where an infringer or violator is engaged solely in the business of
                printing the mark or violating matter for others and establishes that
                he or she was an innocent infringer or innocent violator, the owner of
                the right infringed or person bringing the action under section 1125
                (a) of this title shall be entitled as against such infringer or violator
                only to an injunction against future printing.

                (B) Where the infringement or violation complained of is contained
                in or is part of paid advertising matter in a newspaper, magazine, or
                other similar periodical or in an electronic communication as defined
                in section 2510 (12) of title 18, the remedies of the owner of the right
                infringed or person bringing the action under section 1125 (a) of this
                title as against the publisher or distributor of such newspaper,
                magazine, or other similar periodical or electronic communication
                shall be limited to an injunction against the presentation of such
                advertising matter in future issues of such newspapers, magazines, or
                other similar periodicals or in future transmissions of such electronic
                communications. The limitations of this subparagraph shall apply
                only to innocent infringers and innocent violators.

                (C) Injunctive relief shall not be available to the owner of the right
                infringed or person bringing the action under section 1125 (a) of this
                title with respect to an issue of a newspaper, magazine, or other
                similar periodical or an electronic communication containing
                infringing matter or violating matter where restraining the
                dissemination of such infringing matter or violating matter in any

                                                    408
                particular issue of such periodical or in an electronic communication
                would delay the delivery of such issue or transmission of such
                electronic communication after the regular time for such delivery or
                transmission, and such delay would be due to the method by which
                publication and distribution of such periodical or transmission of
                such electronic communication is customarily conducted in
                accordance with sound business practice, and not due to any method
                or device adopted to evade this section or to prevent or delay the
                issuance of an injunction or restraining order with respect to such
                infringing matter or violating matter.

        Flea markets. To online markets like eBay, compare flea markets or swap
meets. Some courts have found liability for operators of such markets. Here, willful
blindness does the work of a knowledge requirement. See Hard Rock Cafe Licensing
Corp. v. Concession Services, Inc., 955 F.2d 1143 (7th Cir. 1992); Fonovisa, Inc. v.
Cherry Auction, Inc., 76 F.3d 259 (9th Cir. 1996).

        Can these cases be reconciled with Tiffany? On that question, consider
Omega SA v. 375 Canal, LLC, 984 F.3d 244 (2d Cir. 2021). There, the Second
Circuit upheld liability based on willful blindness for a landlord who hosted
vendors of counterfeit watches on its property. The defendant objected that it, like
eBay, lacked knowledge of specific infringing vendors. The court disagreed.

        But where a defendant knows or should know of infringement, whether that
        defendant may be liable for contributory infringement turns on what the
        defendant does next. If it undertakes bona fide efforts to root out
        infringement, such as eBay did in Tiffany, that will support a verdict finding
        no liability, even if the defendant was not fully successful in stopping
        infringement. But if the defendant decides to take no or little action, it will
        support a verdict finding liability.

Id. at 255. Does Omega expand the scope of Tiffany? Or are the online and offline
contexts just treated differently?

        Vicarious liability. Courts have also imported common law principles of
vicarious liability to trademark. American Tel. & Tel. Co. v. Winback & Conserve
Program, 42 F.3d 1421, 1434 (3d Cir. 1994) ("Thus, we hold that the district court
properly held that agency principles apply to the instant dispute."). But absent an
official agency relationship, what is needed for vicarious liability? The general view
of the courts has been to take a somewhat restrictive view (at least in comparison to
the analogous standard in copyright law). See, e.g., Hard Rock Cafe Licensing Corp.
v. Concession Services, Inc., 955 F.2d 1143, 1150 (7th Cir. 1992) ("We have
recognized that a joint tortfeasor may bear vicarious liability for trademark

                                                    409
infringement by another ... . This theory of liability requires a finding that the
defendant and the infringer have an apparent or actual partnership, have authority
to bind one another in transactions with third parties or exercise joint ownership or
control over the infringing product.").

        Copyright convergence? Congress has addressed some of the issues raised by
Tiffany in the copyright context. 17 U.S.C. § 512 establishes a "notice and
takedown" regime that provides a safe harbor for online service providers against
liability for copyright infringement based on materials posted by users.

        Section 512(c)(1) exempts liability for hosting information provided by a user
if the host:

        (A)(i) does not have actual knowledge that the material or an activity using
        the material on the system or network is infringing;

        (ii) in the absence of such actual knowledge, is not aware of facts or
        circumstances from which infringing activity is apparent; or

        (iii) upon obtaining such knowledge or awareness, acts expeditiously to
        remove, or disable access to, the material;

        (B) does not receive a financial benefit directly attributable to the infringing
        activity, in a case in which the service provider has the right and ability to
        control such activity; and

        (C) upon notification of claimed infringement as described in paragraph (3),
        responds expeditiously to remove, or disable access to, the material that is
        claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity.

        Under the notice-and-takedown system, service providers designate an agent
for the receipt of notices of infringing content. Once such a properly drafted notice
is received, the provider must take down the complained of materials (with
provision of notice to the provider of the objectionable content, giving him/her a
chance to assert its legality).

        Does Tiffany adopt a § 512 of sorts for trademark law? How similar are the
copyright and trademark secondary liability regimes in the Second Circuit?

        Credit card issuers. Trademark plaintiffs have also sued credit card companies
involved in processing on-line orders. The record of such efforts has been mixed,
but courts generally balk at allowing claims against processors if they do no more
than provide basic transaction services. Perfect 10, Inc. v. Visa Intern. Service Ass'n,
494 F.3d 788 (9th Cir. 2007). A contributory infringement claim against providers
of payment services that specialized in "high-risk" transactions survived a motion to

                                                    410
dismiss in Gucci America, Inc. v. Frontline Processing Corp., 721 F. Supp. 2d 228
(S.D.N.Y. 2010).

        Direct or secondary infringement? As seen in eBay, plaintiffs may describe an
intermediary as engaging in both direct and secondary infringement. In the case
below, the plaintiff had more luck with the former claim.

                         Ohio State University v. Redbubble, Inc.
                                 989 F.3d 435 (6th Cir. 2021)

NALBANDIAN, Circuit Judge.
        Online shopping has transformed American life. Gone is the heyday of

shopping malls and in-person retail. Instead, Americans increasingly choose to make
purchases online. Although digital marketplaces may not require the same type of
upkeep and maintenance as brick-and-mortar businesses, someone still manages
them. This case concerns the responsibilities of companies that operate
marketplaces facilitating online transactions between consumers and vendors.

        The prime example of the modern digital marketplace is Amazon.com, Inc.
Amazon operates a website where, among other things, third-party vendors sell their
goods to consumers. Because Amazon's marketplace operates as a neutral
intermediary between consumers and third-party vendors, courts have typically not
found it liable for trademark-infringing goods sold through its platform. This case
turns on whether Redbubble, Inc., an Australia-based online retailer, enjoys similar
immunity from trademark-infringement claims arising from products displayed on
and sold through its digital marketplace. The Ohio State University (OSU) argues
that Redbubble's marketplace model differs from those used by Amazon, eBay, and
other passive e-commerce facilitators. So OSU alleges that Redbubble violated the
Lanham Act and Ohio's right-of-publicity statute because it acted less like a hands-
off intermediary and more like a company that creates knock-off goods. Because
Redbubble's marketplace involves creating Redbubble products and garments that
would not have existed but for Redbubble's enterprise, we find that the district
court erred by entering summary judgment for Redbubble under an overly narrow
reading of the Lanham Act. . . .

        Redbubble operates an online marketplace with a global reach. This
marketplace is large--around 600,000 artists use the website, and over $100 million
in sales has flowed through Redbubble's platform. Products for sale on Redbubble's
website include apparel, wall art, and other accessories emblazoned with an image
selected by a consumer. Independent artists, not employed by Redbubble, upload
images onto Redbubble's interface. Consumers then scroll through those uploaded
images and place an order for a customized item.

                                                    411
        Once a consumer places a purchase on its website, Redbubble automatically
contacts the artist and arranges the manufacturing and shipping of the product with
independent third parties. So Redbubble never takes title to any product shown on
its website. And Redbubble does not design, manufacture, or handle these products.
But the shipped packages bear its logo, and Redbubble handles customer service
duties such as returns.

        Aside from managing the website, Redbubble plays a larger role in overseeing
and executing sales made on its marketplace. For example, Redbubble helps market
products listed on its website. And it markets those goods as Redbubble products to
consumers; for instance, it provides instructions on how to care for "Redbubble
garments." When customers receive goods from Redbubble's marketplace, they
often arrive in Redbubble packaging and contain Redbubble tags. And if there are
excess goods, Redbubble has the right to dispose of those items.

        In short, independent artists can have goods displaying their artwork and
images advertised, manufactured, and sold by using Redbubble's platform. OSU
argues that Redbubble is responsible for trademark-infringing products sold on
Redbubble's marketplace. Neither party disputes that some of Redbubble's artists
uploaded trademark-infringing images, that these images appeared on Redbubble's
website, or that consumers paid Redbubble to receive products bearing images
trademarked by OSU. Instead, they dispute whether Redbubble is liable for
trademark infringement because of its role in managing the marketplace.

        OSU's licensing program has generated over $100 million in the last seven
years. To protect its trademarks, OSU carries out a "strict oversight of licensed
products." While conducting this oversight in 2017, OSU discovered products on
Redbubble's marketplace that displayed OSU's trademarked images without
approval. So OSU sent Redbubble a cease-and-desist letter.

        In response, Redbubble asked OSU to "specifically identify each infringing
design." Redbubble's user agreement states that trademark holders, and not
Redbubble, bear the burden of monitoring and redressing trademark violations.
Redbubble also told OSU that it needed more information about which designs
violated OSU's trademarks. So OSU sent Redbubble a letter containing photos of
nine offending items. But Redbubble told OSU that pictures weren't enough to
identify the offending products, asking for URLs or other identifying information.
After this, communication halted between the parties. In the end, Redbubble did
not remove the offending products from its website.

        After the communication breakdown, OSU sued Redbubble in December
2017. It brought claims alleging trademark infringement, counterfeiting, and unfair
competition under the Lanham Act, as well as Ohio's right-of-publicity law. The
parties cross-moved for summary judgment, and the district court entered summary
judgment for Redbubble. According to the district court, Redbubble did not "use"

                                                    412
OSU's trademarked images in operating its business model under the Lanham Act
because it only acted as a "transactional intermediary" between buyers, sellers,
manufacturers, and shippers. . . .

        The Lanham Act creates a cause of action against any person who, without
the consent of the trademark owner, either:

        (a) [U]se[s] in commerce any reproduction, counterfeit, copy, or colorable
        imitation of a registered mark in connection with the sale, offering for sale,
        distribution, or advertising of any goods or services on or in connection with
        which such use is likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to
        deceive; or

        (b) "reproduce[s], counterfeit[s], cop[ies], or colorably imitate[s] a registered
        mark and appl[ies] such reproduction, counterfeit, copy, or colorable
        imitation to labels, signs, prints, packages, wrappers, receptacles or
        advertisements intended to be used in commerce upon or in connection
        with the sale, offering for sale, distribution, or advertising of goods or
        services on or in connection with which such use is likely to cause confusion,
        or to cause mistake, or to deceive.

15 U.S.C. § 1114(1). And OSU asserts that Redbubble directly infringed OSU's
trademarks under the Act because Redbubble's role in operating its online
marketplace meets the statutory definition of using a trademark in commerce
without owner approval.

        Parties may also be vicariously liable under the Lanham Act even if they do
not directly "use" the trademark to sell or advertise a product. "This Circuit allows
plaintiffs to hold defendants vicariously liable for trademark infringement under the
Lanham Act when the defendant and the infringer have an actual or apparent
partnership, have authority to bind one another in transactions, or exercise joint
ownership or control over the infringing product." Grubbs v. Sheakley Grp., Inc., 807
F.3d 785, 793 (6th Cir. 2015). So OSU also claims that Redbubble meets the
Grubbs test for vicarious liability because the vendors operating on its site act as
Redbubble's agents. . . . [The court concluded that OSU failed to preserve its
vicarious liability claims; OSU did not bring a contributory infringement claim.]

        . . . . [The Lanham Act] recognizes a civil cause of action for trademark
infringement against parties who "use in commerce any reproduction, counterfeit,
copy, or colorable imitation of a registered mark in connection with the sale,
offering for sale, distribution, or advertising of any goods or services." 15 U.S.C. §§
1114(a), 1125(a). And OSU argues that Redbubble--"the quintessential infringer
and counterfeiter"--violated the Act when it "used" OSU's trademarks by
"marketing and selling trademark-infringing products" on the Redbubble platform.

                                                    413
        In support of that argument, OSU contends that the Lanham Act applies to
a wide array of parties and commercial activities and the district court erred by
improperly narrowing the Lanham Act's scope. It points to the statutory phrase "in
connection with" as evidence of "a broad interpretation" for actions covered by the
Lanham Act. . . . But the district court applied a narrower interpretation of the Act.
It found Redbubble's participation in the creation, manufacturing, and sale of the
offending goods too indirect for Lanham Act liability because Redbubble acted
more like Amazon or an auction house than a company that designs, manufactures,
and sells its own goods. For instance, it ruled that Redbubble was not liable for
trademark-infringing images on its website despite the Lanham Act prohibiting
trademarks being "placed in any manner on the goods ... or the displays associated
therewith" because "independent" artists uploaded the images.

        Unlike OSU, Redbubble urges us to follow a narrow interpretation of the
Lanham Act. It believes the Act creates liability only for manufacturers, sellers, and
those "who apply infringing marks to sales displays or other related advertising
materials." In short, Redbubble contends that direct liability for trademark
infringement "requires that the plaintiff prove that the accused infringer placed the
infringing mark on goods" or affirmatively used the mark, e.g., by selling a
trademark-infringing good directly to a consumer. Because Redbubble facilitates
sales, like Amazon, without creating or handling products, Redbubble concludes it
"cannot directly infringe" OSU's trademarks.

        It's true that online marketplaces, like eBay and Amazon, that facilitate sales
for independent vendors generally escape Lanham Act liability. See, e.g., Tiffany (NJ)
Inc. v. eBay Inc., 600 F.3d 93, 103, 109 (2d. Cir. 2010) (finding eBay could not be
liable for direct infringement for use of a trademark where the use did not imply
affiliation or endorsement; also finding eBay could not be liable for contributory
infringement for the sale of counterfeit goods by vendors on its website).
Conversely, parties who design and print trademark-infringing goods typically
violate the Lanham Act. See H-D U.S.A., LLC v. SunFrog, LLC, 311 F. Supp. 3d 1000,
1030 (E.D. Wisc. 2018) (ruling that defendant violated the Lanham Act because it
printed trademark-offending goods). So the parties dispute where courts draw the
line for online-vendor liability.

        This Circuit has already found "no reason to restrict [Lanham Act] liability
to those who actually create, manufacture[,] or package the infringing items."
Lorillard Tobacco Co. v. Amouri's Grand Foods, Inc., 453 F.3d 377, 381 (6th Cir. 2006).
In Lorillard, the court imposed liability where the defendant acted as a brick-and-
mortar store that directly sold trademark-infringing items to consumers, despite the
fact that the defendant didn't design or manufacture the offending product. It
simply ran a marketplace where consumers could find and procure the counterfeit
cigarettes. Admittedly, Lorillard emphasizes the defendant's "role as a retailer" when

                                                    414
imposing liability. But that decision still suggests broad liability for parties involved
in selling trademark-infringing goods.

        Although the district court here correctly presented this question as a
spectrum, with eBay and Amazon's marketplaces on one end and brick-and-mortar
vendors on the other, it ultimately applied Lanham Act liability too narrowly. The
question remains as to when, exactly, a party avoids liability by acting as a passive
facilitator.

        Neither party disputes that an entity that is either (i) the creator or
manufacturer of the offending goods, or (ii) a direct seller of the offending goods
(e.g., a brick-and-mortar store or company website) is liable under the Lanham Act.
They disagree, however, as to when a party indirectly involved in the
creation/manufacture of a good and/or the sale of a good avoids liability by acting
as a passive facilitator. In other words, what level of involvement and control must a
defendant exercise over the creation, manufacture, or sale of offending goods to be
considered akin to a "seller" or "manufacturer" to whom Lanham Act liability
applies? Aside from the eBay/Amazon model, some trademark-infringing activity
does not create liability. For instance, a company that auctions trademark-offending
website domain names does not "use" those trademarks as the Lanham Act
prohibits. Bird v. Parsons, 289 F.3d 865, 877-79 (6th Cir. 2002). That's because
domain-name providers only sell "an address" used on the internet for
identification purposes, and not products bearing a trademark. So on the opposite
end of the spectrum from direct sellers and manufacturers, this Circuit places
parties like Amazon and domain-name providers outside the Lanham Act's ambit.

        Returning to the statutory text, OSU argues that the language sweeps
broadly. First, it compares the Lanham Act's "use in commerce" language to the
"use" of a firearm in Smith v. United States, 508 U.S. 223 (1993). There, the Supreme
Court determined that the definition of use "sweeps broadly." So OSU urges us to
follow this natural meaning of "use." And it contends that Redbubble necessarily
uses OSU's trademarks when it places them on Redbubble's stock images and
creates Redbubble products. In other words, if Redbubble didn't use the trademark,
then how could its website display or satisfy an order for a hat or shirt bearing OSU
trademarks that doesn't exist elsewhere? The key distinction between Redbubble
and Amazon's "use" of trademarks would be that Redbubble directs others to make
or display infringing Redbubble products with Redbubble tags and instructions for
caring for Redbubble garments. Because Amazon's marketplace doesn't operate by
offering or producing Amazon products, under OSU's theory, Amazon doesn't use
the trademark in a creative or generative process. And that's where it wants us to
draw the line for liability because companies that print the offending trademark
onto a product are generally liable under the Lanham Act.

                                                    415
        Redbubble makes its own textual argument. It contends that only
"affirmative `use' " creates direct Lanham Act liability--the "in connection with"
language only operates to permit indirect or vicarious liability. Yet Redbubble
doesn't explain why the statutory text cabins itself to vicarious liability only. And if
the statutory text creates those claims, then it is strange that courts have found
vicarious Lanham Act liability based on the statute's common law tort backdrop
rather than the text itself. See, e.g., Rosetta Stone Ltd. v. Google, Inc., 676 F.3d 144,
165 (4th Cir. 2012) (describing vicarious Lanham Act liability as "essentially the
same as in the tort context" without relying on the statutory text). This undermines
Redbubble's position that the Lanham Act's language or context narrows the word
"use."

        Looking at this Circuit's Lanham Act precedent, it seems that one key
distinction between a direct seller who "uses" a trademark under the Act and a mere
facilitator of sales who does not is the degree to which the party represents itself,
rather than a third-party vendor, as the seller, or somehow identifies the goods as its
own. A retailer who sells products directly to a customer at a brick-and-mortar store
is indisputably a seller to whom the Lanham Act applies. An online marketplace
like eBay that clearly indicates to consumers that they are purchasing goods from
third-party sellers is not. See Multi Time Mach., 804 F.3d at 938-41 (finding Amazon
not liable for the trademark infringement committed by parties using its platform
because "Amazon clearly labels the source of the products it offers for sale" and is
not a seller). Here, although the record is sparse, it appears that products ordered
on Redbubble's website do not yet exist, come into being only when ordered
through Redbubble, and are delivered in Redbubble packaging with Redbubble
tags. Under those facts, the district court erred in affirmatively placing Redbubble
on the passive end of the liability spectrum.

        Although Redbubble utilizes a third-party to manufacture goods sold on its
site, the degree of control and involvement exercised by Redbubble over the
manufacturing, quality control, and delivery of goods to consumers is relevant to an
assessment of whether the offending goods can fairly be tied to Redbubble for the
purpose of liability. The record below lacks sufficient development of the facts to
affirmatively decide this issue.

        All said, it appears that Redbubble brings trademark-offending products into
being by working with third-party sellers to create new Redbubble products, not to
sell the artists' products. So it's more than just a passive facilitator. And Redbubble
classifies its goods as "Redbubble products" and makes clothes identifiable as
"Redbubble garments." That differs from Amazon's marketplace and makes more
"use" of the trademark than non-liable facilitators in cases from other circuits.
Given that the district court strayed from this understanding of the Lanham Act, we

                                                    416
find that it wrongly entered summary judgment for Redbubble on the direct
Lanham Act liability claim.

        . . . . To obtain summary judgment, OSU would need to show that
Redbubble asserted no disputed, material facts showing that its business model
abides by the Lanham Act. . . .

        It's true that Redbubble facilitates the creation of goods bearing OSU's
marks that would not have existed but for Redbubble. And that's why we disagree
with the district court's ruling that Redbubble could not be liable because of its
similarity to Amazon, eBay, and other passive online marketplaces. But even though
we hold the district court erred by applying an overly narrow reading of the Lanham
Act and giving too cursory of a treatment to OSU's state-law claims, we are not
certain that OSU, based on the record established below, can establish that no issue
of material fact exists over Redbubble's liability under a more expansive
understanding of the Lanham Act.

        Although the record shows that Redbubble sells "Redbubble products" and
"Redbubble garments" on its marketplace, unlike Amazon and other companies
that are not directly liable under the Lanham Act, it's unclear what those labels
mean. To start, Redbubble's User Agreement states that Redbubble never takes title
to those products. And third-party vendors upload the designs for products sold on
Redbubble's marketplace. Given the murkiness about Redbubble's relationship to
the trademark-infringing products, we conclude the record below does not permit
an informed ruling about whether Redbubble "used" OSU's marks under the
Lanham Act. The factual gaps on this issue include: "facts regarding the precise
nature of Redbubble's contractual relationships with third-party manufacturers and
shippers"; "the precise degree to which Redbubble is involved in" selecting and
imprinting trademark-infringing designs upon its products; "details as to
Redbubble's involvement in the process for returning goods"; "detail[s] on how
Redbubble characterizes its own services"; and facts about "defenses to liability[,]
such as possible fair use defenses or defenses that confusion is not likely." (Int'l
Trademark Ass'n Amicus Br. at 17-23.) So even though the district court applied
the Lanham Act too narrowly, additional factfinding on remand would aid a
decision about whether Redbubble is liable under the standard explained above. . . .

                                     Notes and Questions

        Policy questions. What should the liability standard be for Internet
intermediaries like Google or eBay? Would a requirement to verify the legality of
advertising or postings stifle useful services? On the other hand, should we expect
trademark holders like Tiffany to play what has been called a game of whack-a-mole
by repeated trademark infringers? Are the eBays of the world the low-cost risk

                                                    417
avoiders? Or is that not the right question in this context? Does defendant
involvement of the sort described by Redbubble change things in a meaningful way?
Why or why not?

        The Communications Decency Act. Compare the approach of eBay and
Redbubble to that of the Communications Decency Act, 47 U.S.C. § 230. The CDA
offers online services a rather sweeping carveout from tort liability based on user
conduct. The statute provides that "[n]o provider or user of an interactive computer
service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by
another information content provider." 47 U.S.C. § 230. Notably, however, the
CDA does not apply to intellectual property claims, so it is no defense to a Lanham
Act suit.

        Comparisons to trademark law aside, it is worth noting that the CDA is a
major part of the consumer information ecosystem, for it allows sites to host user
generated content (e.g., user product reviews) without fear of defamation claims.

18. Trademarks and Domain Names

Problems

        1. We represent Alligator Gaming, a videogame and personal electronics
manufacturer. Its website is alligator.com (sidenote, this is a hypothetical; in real life
the site is occupied by a music company). A disgruntled customer purchased an
Alligator Game Console that caught fire. In response, the customer registered the
web domain alligator.net, which it uses to gripe about our client's products. The site
hosts a few ads, and offers sales of t-shirts that read, "Don't get burned by the
Gator!" But it mostly consists of commentary about our client. Alligator.net was
registered with Network Solutions, a domain names registrar in Virginia, but the
customer lives in Chicago. Can we sue under the Anticybersquatting Consumer
Protection Act ("ACPA")? Where?

        2. Alligator used to be affiliated with a gamemaker in the United
Kingdom, known as Alligator UK. Alligator UK (now independent) has been in
decline for some time. It now sells only playing cards and does not make any online
sales. Nonetheless, it has registered a number of "alligator" themed domain names,
including alligatorgames.com, alligatorconsoles.com, alligatorvideogames.com, and
alligatorvideos.com. It asserts that it plans to expand its web presence and enter the
videogaming market. Nonetheless, it is willing to accommodate us if we pay $20,000
for the transfer of the domain names. Do we have an ACPA claim? Would your
analysis change if the challenged marks were based on the word "gator" (e.g.,
gatorgames.com, gatorconsoles.com, etc.)?

        3. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers
("ICANN")1 has expanded the number of available generic top-level domain names
("gTLD"). Common gTLDs are ".com" or ".edu." Now, however, organizations may
apply for gTLDs that may be everyday words (e.g., ".paper") or trademarks (e.g.
".google"). What are the implications for trademark law? For trademark holders?
What can be done to manage them?

          1 ICANN is a U.S.-based non-profit corporation that performs many Internet-management tasks that
used to be conducted by the U.S. Government. ICAAN's self-described mission is "to coordinate, at the
overall level, the global Internet's systems of unique identifiers, and in particular to ensure the stable and
secure operation of the Internet's unique identifier systems. In particular, ICANN . . . Coordinates the
allocation and assignment of the three sets of unique identifiers for the Internet, which are . . . Domain
names (forming a system referred to as `DNS'); Internet protocol (`IP') addresses and autonomous system
(`AS') numbers; and Protocol port and parameter numbers." Explanations of the domain name system, and
ICANN's role supervising it, can be found online. ICANN's description is here:

        if, without regard to the goods or services of the parties, that person--

        (i) has a bad faith intent to profit from that mark, including a personal name
        which is protected as a mark under this section; and

        (ii) registers, traffics in, or uses a domain name that--

        (I) in the case of a mark that is distinctive at the time of registration of the

        of a famous mark that is famous at the time of registration of the domain
        name, is identical or confusingly similar to or dilutive of that mark; or (III) is
        a trademark, word, or name protected by reason of section 706 of title 18,
        United States Code, or section 220506 of title 36, United States Code.

        (B)(i) In determining whether a person has a bad faith intent described
        under subparagraph (A), a court may consider factors such as, but not
        limited to--

        (I) the trademark or other intellectual property rights of the person, if any, in
        the domain name; (II) the extent to which the domain name consists of the
        legal name of the person or a name that is otherwise commonly used to
        identify that person; (III) the person's prior use, if any, of the domain name
        in connection with the bona fide offering of any goods or services; (IV) the

        under the domain name; (V) the person's intent to divert consumers from
        the mark owner's online location to a site accessible under the domain name
        that could harm the goodwill represented by the mark, either for commercial
        gain or with the intent to tarnish or disparage the mark, by creating a
        likelihood of confusion as to the source, sponsorship, affiliation, or
        endorsement of the site; (VI) the person's offer to transfer, sell, or otherwise
        assign the domain name to the mark owner or any third party for financial
        gain without having used, or having an intent to use, the domain name in
        the bona fide offering of any goods or services, or the person's prior conduct
        indicating a pattern of such conduct; (VII) the person's provision of material

                                                    420
and misleading false contact information when applying for the registration
of the domain name, the person's intentional failure to maintain accurate
contact information, or the person's prior conduct indicating a pattern of
such conduct; (VIII) the person's registration or acquisition of multiple
domain names which the person knows are identical or confusingly similar
to marks of others that are distinctive at the time of registration of such
domain names, or dilutive of famous marks of others that are famous at the
time of registration of such domain names, without regard to the goods or
services of the parties; and (IX) the extent to which the mark incorporated in
the person's domain name registration is or is not distinctive and famous
within the meaning of subsection (c)(1) of section 43 [subsec. (c)(1) of this
section].

(ii) Bad faith intent described under subparagraph (A) shall not be found in
any case in which the court determines that the person believed and had
reasonable grounds to believe that the use of the domain name was a fair use
or otherwise lawful.

(C) In any civil action involving the registration, trafficking, or use of a
domain name under this paragraph, a court may order the forfeiture or
cancellation of the domain name or the transfer of the domain name to the
owner of the mark.

(D)A person shall be liable for using a domain name under subparagraph (A)
only if that person is the domain name registrant or that registrant's
authorized licensee.

(E)As used in this paragraph, the term "traffics in" refers to transactions that
include, but are not limited to, sales, purchases, loans, pledges, licenses,
exchanges of currency, and any other transfer for consideration or receipt in
exchange for consideration.

(2)(A)The owner of a mark may file an in rem civil action against a domain
name in the judicial district in which the domain name registrar, domain
name registry, or other domain name authority that registered or assigned
the domain name is located if--

(i)the domain name violates any right of the owner of a mark registered in
the Patent and Trademark Office, or protected under subsection (a) or (c);
and

(ii)the court finds that the owner--

        (ii)documents sufficient to establish control and authority regarding the
        disposition of the registration and use of the domain name are deposited
        with the court.

        (D)(i)The remedies in an in rem action under this paragraph shall be limited

CALABRESI, Circuit Judge:
        . . . .
        Sportsman's is a mail order catalog company that is quite well-known among

pilots and aviation enthusiasts for selling products tailored to their needs. In recent
years, Sportsman's has expanded its catalog business well beyond the aviation
market into that for tools and home accessories. The company annually distributes
approximately 18 million catalogs nationwide, and has yearly revenues of about $50
million. Aviation sales account for about 60% of Sportsman's revenue, while non-
aviation sales comprise the remaining 40%.

        In the 1960s, Sportsman's began using the logo "sporty" to identify its
catalogs and products. In 1985, Sportsman's registered the trademark sporty's with
the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Since then, Sportsman's has
complied with all statutory requirements to preserve its interest in the sporty's mark.

                                                    422
Sporty's appears on the cover of all Sportsman's catalogs; Sportsman's international
toll free number is 1-800-4sportys; and one of Sportsman's domestic toll free phone
numbers is 1-800-Sportys. Sportsman's spends about $10 million per year advertising
its sporty's logo.

        Omega is a mail order catalog company that sells mainly scientific process
measurement and control instruments. In late 1994 or early 1995, the owners of
Omega, Arthur and Betty Hollander, decided to enter the aviation catalog business
and, for that purpose, formed a wholly-owned subsidiary called Pilot's Depot, LLC
("Pilot's Depot"). Shortly thereafter, Omega registered the domain name
sportys.com with NSI. Arthur Hollander was a pilot who received Sportsman's
catalogs and thus was aware of the sporty's trademark.

        In January 1996, nine months after registering sportys.com, Omega formed
another wholly-owned subsidiary called Sporty's Farm and sold it the rights to
sportys.com for $16,200. Sporty's Farm grows and sells Christmas trees, and soon
began advertising its Christmas trees on a sportys.com web page. When asked how
the name Sporty's Farm was selected for Omega's Christmas tree subsidiary, Ralph
S. Michael, the CEO of Omega and manager of Sporty's Farm, explained, as
summarized by the district court, that

        in his own mind and among his family, he always thought of and referred to
        the Pennsylvania land where Sporty's Farm now operates as Spotty's farm. The
        origin of the name ... derived from a childhood memory he had of his
        uncle's farm in upstate New York. As a youngster, Michael owned a dog
        named Spotty. Because the dog strayed, his uncle took him to his upstate
        farm. Michael thereafter referred to the farm as Spotty's farm. The name
        Sporty's Farm was ... a subsequent derivation.

There is, however, no evidence in the record that Hollander was considering
starting a Christmas tree business when he registered sportys.com or that Hollander
was ever acquainted with Michael's dog Spotty.

        In March 1996, Sportsman's discovered that Omega had registered
sportys.com as a domain name. Thereafter, and before Sportsman's could take any
action, Sporty's Farm brought this declaratory action seeking the right to continue
its use of sportys.com. Sportsman's counterclaimed . . . . Both sides sought
injunctive relief to force the other to relinquish its claims to sportys.com. While this
litigation was ongoing, Sportsman's used "sportys-catalogs.com" as its primary
domain name. . . .
C. "Identical and Confusingly Similar"

                                                    423
        The next question [under ACPA] is whether domain name sportys.com is
"identical or confusingly similar to" the sporty's mark.11 15 U.S.C. §
1125(d)(1)(A)(ii)(I). . . . [A]postrophes cannot be used in domain names. As a result,
the secondary domain name in this case (sportys) is indistinguishable from the
Sportsman's trademark (sporty's). Cf. Brookfield Communications, Inc. v. West Coast
Entertainment Corp., 174 F.3d 1036, 1055 (9th Cir.1999) (observing that the
differences between the mark "MovieBuff" and the domain name "moviebuff.com"
are "inconsequential in light of the fact that Web addresses are not caps-sensitive
and that the `.com' top-level domain signifies the site's commercial nature"). We
therefore conclude that, although the domain name sportys.com is not precisely
identical to the sporty's mark, it is certainly "confusingly similar" to the protected
mark under § 1125(d)(1)(A)(ii)(I). Cf. Wella Corp. v. Wella Graphics, Inc. 874 F.Supp.
54, 56 (E.D.N.Y.1994) (finding the new mark "Wello" confusingly similar to the
trademark "Wella").
D. "Bad Faith Intent to Profit"

        We next turn to the issue of whether Sporty's Farm acted with a "bad faith
intent to profit" from the mark sporty's when it registered the domain name
sportys.com. 15 U.S.C. § 1125(d)(1)(A)(i). The statute lists nine factors to assist
courts in determining when a defendant has acted with a bad faith intent to profit
from the use of a mark. But we are not limited to considering just the listed factors
when making our determination of whether the statutory criterion has been met.
The factors are, instead, expressly described as indicia that "may" be considered
along with other facts. Id. § 1125(d)(1)(B)(i).

        We hold that there is more than enough evidence in the record below of
"bad faith intent to profit" on the part of Sporty's Farm (as that term is defined in
the statute), so that "no reasonable factfinder could return a verdict against"
Sportsman's. Norville v. Staten Island Univ. Hosp., 196 F.3d 89, 95 (2d Cir.1999).
First, it is clear that neither Sporty's Farm nor Omega had any intellectual property
rights in sportys.com at the time Omega registered the domain name. See id. §
1125(d)(1)(B)(i)(I). Sporty's Farm was not formed until nine months after the
domain name was registered, and it did not begin operations or obtain the domain
name from Omega until after this lawsuit was filed. Second, the domain name does
not consist of the legal name of the party that registered it, Omega. See id. §
1125(d)(1)(B)(i)(II). Moreover, although the domain name does include part of the
name of Sporty's Farm, that entity did not exist at the time the domain name was
registered.

          11 We note that "confusingly similar" is a different standard from the "likelihood of confusion"

standard for trademark infringement adopted by this court in Polaroid Corp. v. Polarad Electronics Corp., 287

F.2d 492 (2d Cir.1961). See Wella Corp. v. Wella Graphics, Inc., 37 F.3d 46, 48 (2d Cir.1994).

                                                    424
        The third factor, the prior use of the domain name in connection with the
bona fide offering of any goods or services, also cuts against Sporty's Farm since it
did not use the site until after this litigation began, undermining its claim that the
offering of Christmas trees on the site was in good faith. See id. §
1125(d)(1)(B)(i)(III). Further weighing in favor of a conclusion that Sporty's Farm
had the requisite statutory bad faith intent, as a matter of law, are the following: (1)
Sporty's Farm does not claim that its use of the domain name was "noncommercial"
or a "fair use of the mark," see id. § 1125(d)(1)(B)(i)(IV), (2) Omega sold the mark to
Sporty's Farm under suspicious circumstances, see Sporty's Farm v. Sportsman's Market,
No. 96CV0756 (D.Conn. Mar. 13, 1998), reprinted in Joint Appendix at A277
(describing the circumstances of the transfer of sportys.com); 15 U.S.C. §
1125(d)(1)(B)(i)(VI), and, (3) as we discussed above, the sporty's mark is undoubtedly
distinctive, see id. § 1125(d)(1)(B)(i)(IX).

        The most important grounds for our holding that Sporty's Farm acted with a
bad faith intent, however, are the unique circumstances of this case, which do not
fit neatly into the specific factors enumerated by Congress but may nevertheless be
considered under the statute. We know from the record and from the district
court's findings that Omega planned to enter into direct competition with
Sportsman's in the pilot and aviation consumer market. As recipients of
Sportsman's catalogs, Omega's owners, the Hollanders, were fully aware that sporty's
was a very strong mark for consumers of those products. It cannot be doubted, as
the court found below, that Omega registered sportys.com for the primary purpose
of keeping Sportsman's from using that domain name. Several months later, and
after this lawsuit was filed, Omega created another company in an unrelated
business that received the name Sporty's Farm so that it could (1) use the
sportys.com domain name in some commercial fashion, (2) keep the name away
from Sportsman's, and (3) protect itself in the event that Sportsman's brought an
infringement claim alleging that a "likelihood of confusion" had been created by
Omega's version of cybersquatting. Finally, the explanation given for Sporty's
Farm's desire to use the domain name, based on the existence of the dog Spotty, is
more amusing than credible. Given these facts and the district court's grant of an
equitable injunction under the FTDA, there is ample and overwhelming evidence
that, as a matter of law, Sporty's Farm's acted with a "bad faith intent to profit"
from the domain name sportys.com as those terms are used in the ACPA. . . .13

          13 We expressly note that "bad faith intent to profit" are terms of art in the ACPA and hence should

not necessarily be equated with "bad faith" in other contexts.

                                     Lamparello v. Falwell
                                 420 F.3d 309 (4th Cir. 2005)

DIANA GRIBBON MOTZ, Circuit Judge.
        Christopher Lamparello appeals the district court's order enjoining him

from maintaining a gripe website critical of Reverend Jerry Falwell. For the reasons
stated below, we reverse.

                                                 I.
        Reverend Falwell is "a nationally known minister who has been active as a
commentator on politics and public affairs." Hustler Magazine v. Falwell, 485 U.S.
46, 47, (1988). He holds the common law trademarks "Jerry Falwell" and "Falwell,"
and the registered trademark "Listen America with Jerry Falwell." Jerry Falwell
Ministries can be found online at "www.falwell.com," a website which receives
9,000 hits (or visits) per day.
        Lamparello registered the domain name "www.fallwell.com" on February 11,
1999, after hearing Reverend Falwell give an interview "in which he expressed
opinions about gay people and homosexuality that [Lamparello] considered ...
offensive." Lamparello created a website at that domain name to respond to what he
believed were "untruths about gay people." Lamparello's website included headlines
such as "Bible verses that Dr. Falwell chooses to ignore" and "Jerry Falwell has been
bearing false witness (Exodus 20:16) against his gay and lesbian neighbors for a long
time." The site also contained in-depth criticism of Reverend Falwell's views. For
example, the website stated:

        Dr. Falwell says that he is on the side of truth. He says that he will preach
        that homosexuality is a sin until the day he dies. But we believe that if the
        reverend were to take another thoughtful look at the scriptures, he would
        discover that they have been twisted around to support an anti-gay political
        agenda ... at the expense of the gospel.

        Although the interior pages of Lamparello's website did not contain a
disclaimer, the homepage prominently stated, "This website is NOT affiliated with
Jerry Falwell or his ministry"; advised, "If you would like to visit Rev. Falwell's
website, you may click here"; and provided a hyperlink to Reverend Falwell's
website.

        At one point, Lamparello's website included a link to the Amazon.com
webpage for a book that offered interpretations of the Bible that Lamparello
favored, but the parties agree that Lamparello has never sold goods or services on
his website. The parties also agree that "Lamparello's domain name and web site at
www.fallwell.com," which received only 200 hits per day, "had no measurable

                                                    426
impact on the quantity of visits to [Reverend Falwell's] web site at
www.falwell.com."

        Nonetheless, Reverend Falwell sent Lamparello letters in October 2001 and
June 2003 demanding that he cease and desist from using www.fallwell.com or any
variation of Reverend Falwell's name as a domain name. Ultimately, Lamparello
filed this action against Reverend Falwell and his ministries (collectively referred to
hereinafter as "Reverend Falwell"), seeking a declaratory judgment of
noninfringement. Reverend Falwell counter-claimed, alleging trademark
infringement under 15 U.S.C. § 1114 (2000), false designation of origin under 15
U.S.C. § 1125(a), unfair competition under 15 U.S.C. § 1126 and the common law
of Virginia, and cybersquatting under 15 U.S.C. § 1125(d).

        The parties stipulated to all relevant facts and filed cross-motions for
summary judgment. The district court granted summary judgment to Reverend
Falwell, enjoined Lamparello from using Reverend Falwell's mark at
www.fallwell.com, and required Lamparello to transfer the domain name to
Reverend Falwell. Lamparello, 360 F.Supp.2d at 773, 775. However, the court
denied Reverend Falwell's request for statutory damages or attorney fees, reasoning
that the "primary motive" of Lamparello's website was "to put forth opinions on
issues that were contrary to those of [Reverend Falwell]" and "not to take away
monies or to profit.". . . .

                                                 II.
        . . . . Lamparello and his amici argue at length that application of the
Lanham Act must be restricted to "commercial speech" to assure that trademark law
does not become a tool for unconstitutional censorship. The Sixth Circuit has
endorsed this view, see Taubman Co. v. Webfeats, 319 F.3d 770, 774 (6th Cir.2003),
and the Ninth Circuit recently has done so as well, see Bosley Med. Inst., Inc. v.
Kremer, 403 F.3d 672, 674 (9th Cir.2005).
        In its two most significant recent amendments to the Lanham Act, the
Federal Trademark Dilution Act of 1995 ("FTDA") and the Anticybersquatting
Consumer Protection Act of 1999 ("ACPA"), Congress left little doubt that it did
not intend for trademark laws to impinge the First Amendment rights of critics and
commentators. The dilution statute applies to only a "commercial use in commerce
of a mark," 15 U.S.C. § 1125(c)(1), and explicitly states that the "[n]oncommercial
use of a mark" is not actionable. . . . Similarly, Congress directed that in
determining whether an individual has engaged in cybersquatting, the courts may
consider whether the person's use of the mark is a "bona fide noncommercial or fair
use." 15 U.S.C. § 1125(d)(1)(B)(i)(IV). The legislature believed this provision
necessary to "protect[ ] the rights of Internet users and the interests of all Americans
in free speech and protected uses of trademarked names for such things as parody,

                                                    427
comment, criticism, comparative advertising, news reporting, etc." S.Rep. No. 106-
140 (1999), 1999 WL 594571, at *8.

        In contrast, the trademark infringement and false designation of origin
provisions of the Lanham Act (Sections 32 and 43(a), respectively) do not employ
the term "noncommercial." They do state, however, that they pertain only to the use
of a mark "in connection with the sale, offering for sale, distribution, or advertising
of any goods or services," 15 U.S.C. § 1114(1)(a), or "in connection with any goods
or services," id. § 1125(a)(1). But courts have been reluctant to define those terms
narrowly.2 Rather, as the Second Circuit has explained, "[t]he term `services' has
been interpreted broadly" and so "[t]he Lanham Act has ... been applied to
defendants furnishing a wide variety of non-commercial public and civic benefits."
United We Stand Am., Inc. v. United We Stand, Am. N.Y., Inc., 128 F.3d 86, 89-90 (2d
Cir.1997). Similarly, in PETA we noted that a website need not actually sell goods
or services for the use of a mark in that site's domain name to constitute a use " `in
connection with' goods or services." [People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals v.
Doughney, 263 F.3d 359, 365 (4th Cir. 2001)]; see also Taubman Co., 319 F.3d at 775
(concluding that website with two links to websites of for-profit entities violated the
Lanham Act).

        Thus, even if we accepted Lamparello's contention that Sections 32 and
43(a) of the Lanham Act apply only to commercial speech, we would still face the
difficult question of what constitutes such speech under those provisions. In the
case at hand, we need not resolve that question or determine whether Sections 32
and 43(a) apply exclusively to commercial speech because Reverend Falwell's claims
of trademark infringement and false designation fail for a more obvious reason. The
hallmark of such claims is a likelihood of confusion--and there is no likelihood of
confusion here.

                                                 B.
                                                 1.
         "[T]he use of a competitor's mark that does not cause confusion as to source
is permissible." Dorr-Oliver, Inc. v. Fluid-Quip, Inc., 94 F.3d 376, 380 (7th Cir.1996).
Accordingly, Lamparello can only be liable for infringement and false designation if
his use of Reverend Falwell's mark would be likely to cause confusion as to the
source of the website found at www.fallwell.com. This likelihood-of-confusion test
"generally strikes a comfortable balance" between the First Amendment and the
rights of markholders. Mattel, Inc. v. MCA Records, Inc., 296 F.3d 894, 900 (9th
Cir.2002).

          2 Indeed, Lamparello agreed at oral argument that the Lanham Act's prohibitions on infringement

and false designation apply to more than just commercial speech as defined by the Supreme Court. [ed. note:

This case predates Radiance Foundation, Inc. v. NAACP, discussed in an earlier chapter.]

                                                    428
        We have identified seven factors helpful in determining whether a likelihood
of confusion exists as to the source of a work, but "not all these factors are always
relevant or equally emphasized in each case." Pizzeria Uno Corp. v. Temple, 747 F.2d
1522, 1527 (4th Cir.1984) (internal quotation marks, citations, and brackets
omitted). The factors are: "(a) the strength or distinctiveness of the mark; (b) the
similarity of the two marks; (c) the similarity of the goods/services the marks
identify; (d) the similarity of the facilities the two parties use in their businesses; (e)
the similarity of the advertising used by the two parties; (f) the defendant's intent;
(g) actual confusion." Id. (citation omitted).

        Reverend Falwell's mark is distinctive, and the domain name of Lamparello's
website, www.fallwell.com, closely resembles it. But, although Lamparello and
Reverend Falwell employ similar marks online, Lamparello's website looks nothing
like Reverend Falwell's; indeed, Lamparello has made no attempt to imitate
Reverend Falwell's website. Moreover, Reverend Falwell does not even argue that
Lamparello's website constitutes advertising or a facility for business, let alone a
facility or advertising similar to that of Reverend Falwell. Furthermore, Lamparello
clearly created his website intending only to provide a forum to criticize ideas, not to
steal customers.

        Most importantly, Reverend Falwell and Lamparello do not offer similar
goods or services. Rather they offer opposing ideas and commentary. Reverend
Falwell's mark identifies his spiritual and political views; the website at
www.fallwell.com criticizes those very views. After even a quick glance at the content
of the website at www.fallwell.com, no one seeking Reverend Falwell's guidance
would be misled by the domain name-www.fallwell.com-into believing Reverend
Falwell authorized the content of that website. No one would believe that Reverend
Falwell sponsored a site criticizing himself, his positions, and his interpretations of
the Bible. See New Kids on the Block v. News Am. Publ'g, Inc., 971 F.2d 302, 308-09
(9th Cir.1992) (stating that use of a mark to solicit criticism of the markholder
implies the markholder is not the sponsor of the use).3

        Finally, the fact that people contacted Reverend Falwell's ministry to report
that they found the content at www.fallwell.com antithetical to Reverend Falwell's
views does not illustrate, as Reverend Falwell claims, that the website engendered
actual confusion. To the contrary, the anecdotal evidence Reverend Falwell

          3 If Lamparello had neither criticized Reverend Falwell by name nor expressly rejected Reverend

Falwell's teachings, but instead simply had quoted Bible passages and offered interpretations of them subtly

different from those of Reverend Falwell, this would be a different case. For, while a gripe site, or a website

dedicated to criticism of the markholder, will seldom create a likelihood of confusion, a website purporting

to be the official site of the markholder and, for example, articulating positions that could plausibly have

come from the markholder may well create a likelihood of confusion.

                                                    429
submitted shows that those searching for Reverend Falwell's site and arriving
instead at Lamparello's site quickly realized that Reverend Falwell was not the source
of the content therein.

        For all of these reasons, it is clear that the undisputed record evidences no
likelihood of confusion. In fact, Reverend Falwell even conceded at oral argument
that those viewing the content of Lamparello's website probably were unlikely to
confuse Reverend Falwell with the source of that material.

                                                 2.
         Nevertheless, Reverend Falwell argues that he is entitled to prevail under the
"initial interest confusion" doctrine. This relatively new and sporadically applied
doctrine holds that "the Lanham Act forbids a competitor from luring potential
customers away from a producer by initially passing off its goods as those of the
producer's, even if confusion as to the source of the goods is dispelled by the time
any sales are consummated." Dorr-Oliver, 94 F.3d at 382. According to Reverend
Falwell, this doctrine requires us to compare his mark with Lamparello's website
domain name, www.fallwell.com, without considering the content of Lamparello's
website. Reverend Falwell argues that some people who misspell his name may go to
www.fallwell.com assuming it is his site, thus giving Lamparello an unearned
audience--albeit one that quickly disappears when it realizes it has not reached
Reverend Falwell's site. This argument fails for two reasons.
        First, we have never adopted the initial interest confusion theory; rather, we
have followed a very different mode of analysis, requiring courts to determine
whether a likelihood of confusion exists by "examin[ing] the allegedly infringing use
in the context in which it is seen by the ordinary consumer." Anheuser-Busch, Inc. v. L & L
Wings, Inc., 962 F.2d 316, 319 (4th Cir.1992) (emphasis added) (citing cases). . . .
        Moreover, even if we did endorse the initial interest confusion theory, that
theory would not assist Reverend Falwell here because it provides no basis for
liability in circumstances such as these. The few appellate courts that have followed
the Ninth Circuit and imposed liability under this theory for using marks on the
Internet have done so only in cases involving a factor utterly absent here--one
business's use of another's mark for its own financial gain.
        Profiting financially from initial interest confusion is thus a key element for
imposition of liability under this theory.5 When an alleged infringer does not
compete with the markholder for sales, "some initial confusion will not likely
facilitate free riding on the goodwill of another mark, or otherwise harm the user
claiming infringement. Where confusion has little or no meaningful effect in the
marketplace, it is of little or no consequence in our analysis." Checkpoint Sys., 269

          5 Offline uses of marks found to cause actionable initial interest confusion also have involved

financial gain....

                                                    430
F.3d at 296-97. For this reason, even the Ninth Circuit has stated that a firm is not
liable for using another's mark in its domain name if it "could not financially
capitalize on [a] misdirected consumer [looking for the markholder's site] even if it
so desired." Interstellar Starship Servs., Ltd. v. Epix, Inc., 304 F.3d 936, 946 (9th
Cir.2002).

        This critical element--use of another firm's mark to capture the markholder's
customers and profits--simply does not exist when the alleged infringer establishes a
gripe site that criticizes the markholder. See Hannibal Travis, The Battle For
Mindshare: The Emerging Consensus that the First Amendment Protects Corporate Criticism
and Parody on the Internet, 10 Va. J.L. & Tech. 3, 85 (Winter 2005) ("The premise of
the `initial interest' confusion cases is that by using the plaintiff's trademark to
divert its customers, the defendant is engaging in the old `bait and switch.' But
because ... Internet users who find [gripe sites] are not sold anything, the mark may
be the `bait,' but there is simply no `switch.' ") (citations omitted).6 Applying the
initial interest confusion theory to gripe sites like Lamparello's would enable the
markholder to insulate himself from criticism--or at least to minimize access to it.
We have already condemned such uses of the Lanham Act, stating that a
markholder cannot " `shield itself from criticism by forbidding the use of its name
in commentaries critical of its conduct.' " CPC Int'l, 214 F.3d at 462 (quoting L.L.
Bean, Inc. v. Drake Publishers, Inc., 811 F.2d 26, 33 (1st Cir.1987)). "[J]ust because
speech is critical of a corporation and its business practices is not a sufficient reason
to enjoin the speech." Id.

        In sum, even if we were to accept the initial interest confusion theory, that
theory would not apply in the case at hand. Rather, to determine whether a
likelihood of confusion exists as to the source of a gripe site like that at issue in this
case, a court must look not only to the allegedly infringing domain name, but also
to the underlying content of the website. When we do so here, it is clear, as

          6 Although the appellate courts that have adopted the initial interest confusion theory have only

applied it to profit-seeking uses of another's mark, the district courts have not so limited the application of

the theory. Without expressly referring to this theory, two frequently-discussed district court cases have held

that using another's domain name to post content antithetical to the markholder constitutes infringement.

See Planned Parenthood Fed'n of Am., Inc. v. Bucci, No. 97 Civ. 0629, 1997 WL 133313 (S.D.N.Y. March 24,

1997), aff'd, 152 F.3d 920 (2d Cir.1998) (table) (finding use of domain name "www.plannedparenthood.com"

to provide links to passages of anti-abortion book constituted infringement); Jews for Jesus v. Brodsky, 993

F.Supp. 282 (D.N.J.1998), aff'd, 159 F.3d 1351 (3d Cir.1998) (table) (finding use of "www.jewsforjesus.org"

to criticize religious group constituted infringement). We think both cases were wrongly decided to the extent

that in determining whether the domain names were confusing, the courts did not consider whether the

websites' content would dispel any confusion. In expanding the initial interest confusion theory of liability,

these cases cut it off from its moorings to the detriment of the First Amendment.

                                                    431
explained above, that no likelihood of confusion exists. Therefore, the district court
erred in granting Reverend Falwell summary judgment on his infringement, false
designation, and unfair competition claims.

                                                III.
         We evaluate Reverend Falwell's cybersquatting claim separately because the
elements of a cybersquatting violation differ from those of traditional Lanham Act
violations. To prevail on a cybersquatting claim, Reverend Falwell must show that
Lamparello: (1) "had a bad faith intent to profit from using the [www.fallwell.com]
domain name," and (2) the domain name www.fallwell.com "is identical or
confusingly similar to, or dilutive of, the distinctive and famous [Falwell] mark."
         "The paradigmatic harm that the ACPA was enacted to eradicate" is "the
practice of cybersquatters registering several hundred domain names in an effort to
sell them to the legitimate owners of the mark." Lucas Nursery & Landscaping, Inc. v.
Grosse, 359 F.3d 806, 810 (6th Cir.2004). The Act was also intended to stop the
registration of multiple marks with the hope of selling them to the highest bidder,
"distinctive marks to defraud consumers" or "to engage in counterfeiting activities,"
and "well-known marks to prey on consumer confusion by misusing the domain
name to divert customers from the mark owner's site to the cybersquatter's own site,
many of which are pornography sites that derive advertising revenue based on the
number of visits, or `hits,' the site receives." S.Rep. No. 106-140, 1999 WL 594571,
at *5-6. The Act was not intended to prevent "noncommercial uses of a mark, such
as for comment, criticism, parody, news reporting, etc.," and thus they "are beyond
the scope" of the ACPA. Id. at *9.
        To distinguish abusive domain name registrations from legitimate ones, the
ACPA directs courts to consider nine nonexhaustive factors:

        (I) the trademark or other intellectual property rights of the person, if any, in
        the domain name;

        (II) the extent to which the domain name consists of the legal name of the
        person or a name that is otherwise commonly used to identify that person;

        (III) the person's prior use, if any, of the domain name in connection with
        the bona fide offering of any goods or services;

        (IV) the person's bona fide noncommercial or fair use of the mark in a site
        accessible under the domain name;

        (V) the person's intent to divert consumers from the mark owner's online
        location to a site accessible under the domain name that could harm the
        goodwill represented by the mark, either for commercial gain or with the

                                                    432
        intent to tarnish or disparage the mark, by creating a likelihood of confusion
        as to the source, sponsorship, affiliation, or endorsement of the site;

        (VI) the person's offer to transfer, sell, or otherwise assign the domain name
        to the mark owner or any third party for financial gain without having used,
        or having an intent to use, the domain name in the bona fide offering of any
        goods or services, or the person's prior conduct indicating a pattern of such
        conduct;

        (VII) the person's provision of material and misleading false contact
        information when applying for the registration of the domain name, the
        person's intentional failure to maintain accurate contact information, or the
        person's prior conduct indicating a pattern of such conduct;

        (VIII) the person's registration or acquisition of multiple domain names
        which the person knows are identical or confusingly similar to marks of
        others that are distinctive at the time of the registration of such domain
        names, or dilutive of famous marks of others that are famous at the time of
        registration of such domain names, without regard to the goods or services of
        the parties; and

        (IX) the extent to which the mark incorporated in the person's domain name
        registration is or is not distinctive and famous within the meaning of
        subsection (c)(1) of this section.

15 U.S.C. § 1125(d)(1)(B)(i) . . . .
        These factors attempt "to balance the property interests of trademark owners

with the legitimate interests of Internet users and others who seek to make lawful
uses of others' marks, including for purposes such as comparative advertising,
comment, criticism, parody, news reporting, fair use, etc." H.R. Rep. No. 106-412,
1999 WL 970519, at *10 (emphasis added). "The first four [factors] suggest
circumstances that may tend to indicate an absence of bad-faith intent to profit
from the goodwill of a mark, and the others suggest circumstances that may tend to
indicate that such bad-faith intent exists." Id. However, "[t]here is no simple formula
for evaluating and weighing these factors. For example, courts do not simply count
up which party has more factors in its favor after the evidence is in." Harrods Ltd. v.
Sixty Internet Domain Names, 302 F.3d 214, 234 (4th Cir.2002). In fact, because use
of these listed factors is permissive, "[w]e need not ... march through" them all in
every case. Virtual Works, Inc. v. Volkswagen of Am., Inc., 238 F.3d 264, 269 (4th
Cir.2001). "The factors are given to courts as a guide, not as a substitute for careful
thinking about whether the conduct at issue is motivated by a bad faith intent to
profit." Lucas Nursery & Landscaping, 359 F.3d at 811.

                                                    433
        After close examination of the undisputed facts involved in this case, we can
only conclude that Reverend Falwell cannot demonstrate that Lamparello "had a
bad faith intent to profit from using the [www.fallwell.com] domain name." PETA,
263 F.3d at 367. Lamparello clearly employed www.fallwell.com simply to criticize
Reverend Falwell's views. Factor IV of the ACPA, 15 U.S.C. § 1125(d)(1)(B)(i)(IV),
counsels against finding a bad faith intent to profit in such circumstances because
"use of a domain name for purposes of ... comment, [and] criticism," H.R.Rep. No.
106-412, 1999 WL 970519, at *11, constitutes a "bona fide noncommercial or fair
use" under the statute, 15 U.S.C. § 1125(d)(1)(B)(i)(IV).7 That Lamparello provided
a link to an Amazon.com webpage selling a book he favored does not diminish the
communicative function of his website. The use of a domain name to engage in
criticism or commentary "even where done for profit" does not alone evidence a
bad faith intent to profit, H.R.Rep. No. 106-412, 1999 WL 970519, at *11, and
Lamparello did not even stand to gain financially from sales of the book at
Amazon.com. Thus factor IV weighs heavily in favor of finding Lamparello lacked a
bad faith intent to profit from the use of the domain name.

        Equally important, Lamparello has not engaged in the type of conduct
described in the statutory factors as typifying the bad faith intent to profit essential
to a successful cybersquatting claim. First, we have already held, supra Part II.B, that
Lamparello's domain name does not create a likelihood of confusion as to source or
affiliation. Accordingly, Lamparello has not engaged in the type of conduct--
"creating a likelihood of confusion as to the source, sponsorship, affiliation, or
endorsement of the site," 15 U.S.C. § 1125(d)(1)(B)(i)(V) --described as an indicator
of a bad faith intent to profit in factor V of the statute.

        Factors VI and VIII also counsel against finding a bad faith intent to profit
here. Lamparello has made no attempt--or even indicated a willingness--"to transfer,
sell, or otherwise assign the domain name to [Reverend Falwell] or any third party
for financial gain." 15 U.S.C. § 1125(d)(1)(B)(i)(VI). Similarly, Lamparello has not
registered "multiple domain names," 15 U.S.C. § 1125(d)(1)(B)(i)(VIII); rather, the

          7 We note that factor IV does not protect a faux noncommercial site, that is, a noncommercial site

created by the registrant for the sole purpose of avoiding liability under the FTDA, which exempts

noncommercial uses of marks, see 15 U.S.C. § 1125(c)(4)(B), or under the ACPA. As explained by the Senate

Report discussing the ACPA, an individual cannot avoid liability for registering and attempting to sell a

hundred domain names incorporating famous marks by posting noncommercial content at those domain

names. See S.Rep. No. 106-140, 1999 WL 594571, at *14 (citing Panavision Int'l v. Toeppen, 141 F.3d 1316

(9th Cir.1998)). But Lamparello's sole purpose for registering www.fallwell.com was to criticize Reverend

Falwell, and this noncommercial use was not a ruse to avoid liability. Therefore, factor IV indicates that

Lamparello did not have a bad faith intent to profit.

                                                    434
record indicates he has registered only one. Thus, Lamparello's conduct is not of
the suspect variety described in factors VI and VIII of the Act.

        Notably, the case at hand differs markedly from those in which the courts
have found a bad faith intent to profit from domain names used for websites
engaged in political commentary or parody. For example, in PETA we found the
registrant of www.peta.org engaged in cybersquatting because www.peta.org was one
of fifty to sixty domain names Doughney had registered, PETA, 263 F.3d at 362, and
because Doughney had evidenced a clear intent to sell www.peta.org to PETA,
stating that PETA should try to " `settle' with him and `make him an offer.' " Id. at
368. See also Virtual Works, 238 F.3d at 269-70. Similarly, in Coca-Cola Co. v. Purdy,
382 F.3d 774 (8th Cir.2004), the Eighth Circuit found an anti-abortion activist who
had registered domain names incorporating famous marks such as "Washington
Post" liable for cybersquatting because he had registered almost seventy domain
names, had offered to stop using the Washington Post mark if the newspaper
published an opinion piece by him on its editorial page, and posted content that
created a likelihood of confusion as to whether the famous markholders sponsored
the anti-abortion sites and "ha[d] taken positions on hotly contested issues." Id. at
786. In contrast, Lamparello did not register multiple domain names, he did not
offer to transfer them for valuable consideration, and he did not create a likelihood
of confusion.

        Instead, Lamparello, like the plaintiffs in two cases recently decided by the
Fifth and Sixth Circuits, created a gripe site. Both courts expressly refused to find
that gripe sites located at domain names nearly identical to the marks at issue
violated the ACPA. . . .

        Like [the defendants in those cases] Lamparello has not evidenced a bad faith
intent to profit under the ACPA. To the contrary, he has used www.fallwell.com to
engage in the type of "comment[ ][and] criticism" that Congress specifically stated
militates against a finding of bad faith intent to profit. See S. Rep. No. 106-140,
1999 WL 594571, at *14. And he has neither registered multiple domain names
nor attempted to transfer www.fallwell.com for valuable consideration. We agree
with the Fifth and Sixth Circuits that, given these circumstances, the use of a mark
in a domain name for a gripe site criticizing the markholder does not constitute
cybersquatting. . . .

                                              Notes

        Modification of the multifactor test. Some cases have suggested that
infringement online requires an adjusted view of the multifactor test. In GoTo.com,
Inc. v. Walt Disney Co., 202 F.3d 1199, 1205 (9th Cir. 2000), the Ninth Circuit
stated that "[i]n the context of the Web in particular, the three most important

                                                    435
Sleekcraft factors are (1) the similarity of the marks, (2) the relatedness of the goods
or services, and (3) the simultaneous use of the Web as a marketing channel"
(internal quotation mark omitted). Does this make sense? Is it based on a perhaps
outdated view of the sophistication of internet users about the medium? Cf. id. at
1206 ("Our ever-growing dependence on the Web may force us eventually to evolve
into increasingly sophisticated users of the medium, but, for now, we can safely
conclude that the use of remarkably similar trademarks on different web sites
creates a likelihood of confusion amongst Web users.").

        More recently the court retreated somewhat to clarify that the "internet
troika" was not a uniform rule to be applied to any internet case, though it was
perhaps relevant when considering infringement through domain names. Network
Automation, Inc. v. Advanced Systems Concepts, Inc., 638 F.3d 1137, 1148 (9th
Cir. 2011).

        Speaking of domain names, under what circumstances is the use of a mark in
a domain name likely to be confusing? Consider the following:

        The importance ascribed to trademark.com in fact suggests that far less
        confusion will result when a domain making nominative use of a trademark
        includes characters in addition to those making up the mark. Because the
        official Lexus site is almost certain to be found at lexus.com (as, in fact, it is),
        it's far less likely to be found at other sites containing the word Lexus. On
        the other hand, a number of sites make nominative use of trademarks in
        their domains but are not sponsored or endorsed by the trademark holder:
        You can preen about your Mercedes at mercedesforum.com and
        mercedestalk.net, read the latest about your double-skim-no-whip latte at
        starbucksgossip.com and find out what goodies the world's greatest
        electronics store has on sale this week at fryselectronics-ads.com. Consumers
        who use the internet for shopping are generally quite sophisticated about
        such matters and won't be fooled into thinking that the prestigious German
        car manufacturer sells boots at mercedesboots.com, or homes at
        mercedeshomes.com, or that comcastsucks.org is sponsored or endorsed by
        the TV cable company just because the string of letters making up its
        trademark appears in the domain.

Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc. v. Tabari, 610 F.3d 1171, 1178 (9th Cir. 2010).

        Cybersquatting and ACPA. Prior to the passage of the Anticybersquatting
Consumer Protection Act ("ACPA"), trademark holders largely resorted to dilution
and infringement claims to try to force the transfer of domain names that
constituted trademarks. Some of these claims were strained. For example, in
Panavision Int'l L.P. v. Toeppen, 141 F.3d 1316 (9th Cir. 1998), the defendant

                                                    436
registered Panavision.com and used the site to display images of the city of Pana, IL.
Because registration appeared to be an effort to obtain payment from Panavision,
the court used a dilution theory to rule in Panavision's favor, even though the
domain name's usage did not appear to neatly fit either the blurring or tarnishment
categories of dilution. (Dilution is discussed in the next reading.) ACPA was
designed in part to solve some of these problems.

        Congress intended ACPA to target those who "register well-known brand
names as Internet domain names in order to extract payment from the rightful
owners of the marks, . . . register well-known marks to prey on consumer confusion
by misusing the domain name to divert customers from the mark owner's site to the
cybersquatter's own site, and target distinctive marks to defraud consumers,
including to engage in counterfeiting activities.' " Lucas Nursery v. Grosse, 359 F.3d
806, 809 (6th Cir.2004) (quoting S.Rep. No. 106-104 at 5-6). But if a domain name
doesn't cause confusion or dilution, is so-called cybersquatting important enough to
enjoin? Why should trademark holders who failed to register domain names get to
force their transfer? What would be the pros and cons of a first-to-register regime for
domain names that made no special allowances for pre-existing trademark rights?

        Competing standards. Is an ACPA claim easier to prove than one for
trademark infringement? Are there advantages to the ACPA approach? On this
issue, note the overlap between ACPA's standards and those of the Uniform
Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (discussed below).

        What is "confusingly similar"? Litigation under ACPA considers similarity
without relying on the multifactor test of trademark infringement litigation. See, e.g.,
Boigris v. EWC P&T, LLC, 7 F.4th 1079, 1085 (11th Cir. 2021) ("The parties agree
that by employing the phrase `confusingly similar,' Congress intended simply a
comparison of the mark and the allegedly offensive domain name. Plainly, this
inquiry is narrower than the traditional multifactor likelihood of confusion test for
trademark infringement claims." (internal citations and quotations omitted)). Judges
may still disagree on when domain names are in fact similar to the plaintiff's mark.
In Boigris, for example, the panel divided on whether "europawaxcenter," and
"euwaxcenter" were confusingly similar to "europeanwaxcenter." Compare, e.g., id.
("There is no requirement, in statute or case law, that a domain name be similar to
a mark in sight, sound, and meaning in order to be confusingly similar as a matter
of law."), with id. (Newsom, J., dissenting) ("[T]he domain names and the mark
contain enough differences in sight, sound, and meaning that a reasonable juror
could conclude that they aren't confusingly similar.").

                                                    437
        In rem jurisdiction. One aspect of note of the statute is its jurisdictional
provision allowing suit to be filed in rem against the domain names themselves if the
plaintiff "is not able to obtain in personam jurisdiction over a person who would
have been a defendant in a civil action under paragraph (1); or (II) through due
diligence was not able to find a person who would have been a defendant[.]" The
Fourth Circuit has commented that the statute prefers in personam jurisdiction, but
refused to allow a defendant to evade in rem jurisdiction over its domain names by
submitting to in personam jurisdiction in a distant federal court after the litigation
began in the appropriate jurisdiction for the domain names. Porsche Cars North
America, Inc. v. Porsche.Net, 302 F.3d 248 (4th Cir. 2002).

        Statutory damages. The main remedy of ACPA is transfer of the domain
name. That said, damages are available, and the statute allows election of statutory
damages "in the amount of not less than $1,000 and not more than $100,000 per
domain name, as the court considers just." 15 U.S.C. § 1117(d); see also Spectrum
Association Management of Texas, L.L.C. v. Lifetime, 5 F.4th 560 (5th Cir. 2021)
(affirming statutory damages award of $100,000).

The UDRP

        Most adjudicated domain name disputes are handled without the courts via
the Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy, which was instituted by
ICANN.

         FAQs from the World Intellectual Property Association ("WIPO")
             (http://www.wipo.int/amc/en/domains/guide/index.html):

        What is the Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy?
        The Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (the UDRP Policy)
sets out the legal framework for the resolution of disputes between a domain name
registrant and a third party (i.e., a party other than the registrar) over the abusive
registration and use of an Internet domain name in the generic top level domains or
gTLDs (e.g., .biz, .com, .info, .mobi, .name, .net, .org), and those country code top
level domains or ccTLDs that have adopted the UDRP Policy on a voluntary basis.
At its meetings on August 25 and 26, 1999 in Santiago, Chile, the ICANN Board of
Directors adopted the UDRP Policy, based largely on the recommendations
contained in the Report of the WIPO Internet Domain Name Process, as well as
comments submitted by registrars and other interested parties. All ICANN-
accredited registrars that are authorized to register names in the gTLDs and the
ccTLDs that have adopted the Policy have agreed to abide by and implement it for

                                                    438
those domains. Any person or entity wishing to register a domain name in the
gTLDs and ccTLDs in question is required to consent to the terms and conditions
of the UDRP Policy. . . .

        Who can use the UDRP Administrative Procedure?
        Any person or company in the world can file a domain name complaint
concerning a gTLD using the UDRP Administrative Procedure. . . .
        What types of disputes are covered by the UDRP Administrative
Procedure?
        According to Paragraph 4(a) of the UDRP Policy, the UDRP Administrative
Procedure is only available for disputes concerning an alleged abusive registration of
a domain name; that is, which meet the following criteria:
        (i) the domain name registered by the domain name registrant is identical or
confusingly similar to a trademark or service mark in which the complainant (the
person or entity bringing the complaint) has rights; and
        (ii) the domain name registrant has no rights or legitimate interests in respect
of the domain name in question; and
        (iii) the domain name has been registered and is being used in bad faith
        What circumstances are evidence that a domain name has been registered
and is being used in bad faith?
        Paragraph 4(b) of the UDRP Policy sets out the following examples of
circumstances that will be considered by an Administrative Panel to be evidence of
the bad faith registration and use of a domain name:
        (i) Circumstances indicating that the domain name was registered or
acquired primarily for the purpose of selling, renting, or otherwise transferring the
domain name registration to the complainant who is the owner of the trademark or
service mark or to a competitor of that complainant, for valuable consideration in
excess of the domain name registrant's out-of-pocket costs directly related to the
domain name; or
        (ii) The domain name was registered in order to prevent the owner of the
trademark or service mark from reflecting the mark in a corresponding domain
name, provided that the domain name registrant has engaged in a pattern of such
conduct; or
        (iii) The domain name was registered primarily for the purpose of disrupting
the business of a competitor; or
        (iv) By using the domain name, the domain name registrant intentionally
attempted to attract for financial gain, Internet users to the registrant's website or
other on-line location, by creating a likelihood of confusion with the complainant's
mark as to the source, sponsorship, affiliation, or endorsement of the registrant's
website or location or of a product or service on the registrant's website or location.

                                                    439
        The above examples are not exclusive and other circumstances may exist that
demonstrate the registration and use of a domain name in bad faith.

        What are the advantages of the UDRP Administrative Procedure?
        The main advantage of the UDRP Administrative Procedure is that it
typically provides a faster and cheaper way to resolve a dispute regarding the
registration and use of an Internet domain name than going to court. In addition,
the procedures are considerably more informal than litigation and the decision-
makers are experts in such areas as international trademark law, domain name
issues, electronic commerce, the Internet and dispute resolution. It is also
international in scope: it provides a single mechanism for resolving a domain name
dispute regardless of where the registrar or the domain name holder or the
complainant are located.
        If I use the UDRP Administrative Procedure, can I still go to court?
        Yes. Paragraph 4(k) of the UDRP Policy provides that the mandatory
administrative proceeding requirement shall not prevent either the domain name
registrant (Respondent) or the third party (Complainant) from submitting the
dispute to a court of competent jurisdiction for independent resolution. It is
possible for a party to start a lawsuit in court before an administrative proceeding is
commenced. A party can also commence a lawsuit after the administrative
proceeding is concluded if it is not satisfied with the outcome. . . .
        What are the various stages in the UDRP Administrative Procedure?
        The five basic stages in a UDRP Administrative Procedure are:
        (1) The filing of a Complaint with an ICANN-accredited dispute resolution
service provider chosen by the Complainant, such as the WIPO Center;
        (2) The filing of a Response by the person or entity against whom the
Complaint was made;
        (3) The appointment by the chosen dispute resolution service provider of an
Administrative Panel of one or three persons who will decide the dispute;
        (4) The issuance of the Administrative Panel's decision and the notification
of all relevant parties; and
        (5) The implementation of the Administrative Panel's decision by the
registrar(s) concerned should there be a decision that the domain name(s) in
question be cancelled or transferred. . . .
        How long does the UDRP Administrative Procedure take?
        The Administrative Procedure normally should be completed within 60 days
of the date the WIPO Center receives the Complaint.
        How much does the UDRP Administrative Procedure cost?
        For a case filed with the WIPO Center involving between 1 and 5 domain
names that is to be decided by a single Panelist, the fee is USD1500. For a case that
is to be decided by 3 Panelists, the fee is USD4000.

                                                    440
        For a case involving between 6 and 10 domain names that is to be decided by
a single Panelist, the fee is USD2000 and USD5000 for a case that is to be decided
by 3 Panelists.

        It is the parties that decide whether the case is to proceed before 1 or 3
Panelists.

        The Complainant is responsible for paying the total fees. The only time the
Respondent has to share in the fees is when the Respondent chooses to have the
case decided by 3 Panelists and the Complainant had chosen a single Panelist.

        The fees described above do not include any payment that might have to be
made to a lawyer representing a party in the administrative proceeding. . . .

        Are in-person hearings required in the UDRP Administrative Procedure?
        Paragraph 13 of the UDRP Rules makes it clear that there shall be no in-
person hearings (including hearings by teleconference, videoconference, and web
conference), unless the Administrative Panel determines, only as an exceptional
matter, that a hearing is necessary in order for it to make its decision. . . .
        What is an Administrative Panel?
        An Administrative Panel is composed of one or three independent and
impartial persons appointed by the dispute resolution service provider that is
selected to administer the dispute in accordance with the UDRP Policy and Rules.
The Administrative Panel is independent of the dispute resolution service provider,
ICANN, the concerned registrar(s) and the parties. . . .
        How is an Administrative Panel decision implemented?
        An Administrative Panel decision is implemented by the registrar with which
the contested domain name is registered at the time the decision is rendered.
        In accordance with Paragraph 4(k) of the UDRP Policy, the registrar is
required to implement the Panel's decision 10 business days after it receives
notification of the decision from the dispute resolution service provider, except if
the registrar receives proper information from the domain name registrant
(Respondent) in that 10-day period that it is challenging the decision in court (see
below).
        Each registrar establishes its own guidelines concerning the implementation
of the transfer or cancellation of a domain name registration pursuant to an
Administrative Panel's decision.
        Is it possible to challenge an Administrative Panel decision?
        Yes. Paragraph 4(k) of the Policy allows a domain name registrant that loses
in the Administrative Proceeding to challenge the Administrative Panel's decision
by filing a lawsuit in certain courts. As noted above, the concerned registrar(s) will
implement the Panel's decision 10 business days after it receives notification of the
decision from the dispute resolution service provider, unless it receives from the
registrant during that 10-day period official documentation (such as a copy of a

                                                    441
complaint, file-stamped by the clerk of the court) that the registrant has commenced
a lawsuit against the Complainant in a jurisdiction to which the Complainant has
submitted under Paragraph 3(b)(xiii) of the UDRP Rules, i.e., a "Mutual
Jurisdiction" (see below).

        The concerned registrar will then take no further action until it receives:
        (i) Satisfactory evidence of a resolution of the dispute between the parties; or
        (ii) Satisfactory evidence that the domain name registrant's lawsuit has been
dismissed or withdrawn; or
        (iii) A copy of an order from the court in which the lawsuit was filed
dismissing the lawsuit or ordering that the domain name registrant has no right to
continue to use the domain name.

        Precedents under the UDRP. Given the vast number, and non-precedential
quality, of UDRP cases, the UDRP lacks the sort of "case law" available in litigation
in the United States. In an effort to provide some guidance, WIPO has published a
guide drawing on the experience of its panels with respect to some recurring issues:
https://www.wipo.int/amc/en/domains/search/overview3.0/. Some such
questions unhelpfully (but perhaps unsurprisingly) yield varied approaches (e.g.,
panels divide on whether to order transfers of "a domain name consisting of a
trademark and a negative term confusingly similar to the complainant's trademark?
(`sucks cases')"). Remember, however, that these precedents are not binding on U.S.
courts. See, e.g., Barcelona.com, Incorporated v. Excelentisimo Ayuntamiento de
Barcelona, 330 F.3d 617, 626 (4th Cir. 2003) ("[W]e give the decision of the WIPO
panelist no deference in deciding this [Lanham Act] action[.]").

        Many UDRP opinions can be found online. To get a flavor of the frequency
that some trademark holders need to resort to the UDRP, try visiting
https://www.adrforum.com/domain-dispute/search-decisions and typing google in
the complainant field. You'll see that Google wins the vast majority of the time
(often the registrant does not even file a response to the panel), but there are a few
exceptions here and there.

19. Dilution

        We turn now to an alternative theory of trademark liability. Since 1996, the
Lanham Act has allowed the owners of "famous" marks to bring suits targeting
conduct that might "dilute" their marks. Notably, proving dilution does not require
showing that consumers are likely to be confused. But what is dilution?

                 Section 43(c) of the Lanham Act (15 U.S.C. § 1125(c))

        (c) Dilution by blurring; dilution by tarnishment

        (1) Injunctive relief

        Subject to the principles of equity, the owner of a famous mark that is
        distinctive, inherently or through acquired distinctiveness, shall be entitled
        to an injunction against another person who, at any time after the owner's
        mark has become famous, commences use of a mark or trade name in
        commerce that is likely to cause dilution by blurring or dilution by
        tarnishment of the famous mark, regardless of the presence or absence of
        actual or likely confusion, of competition, or of actual economic injury.

        (2) Definitions

                (A) For purposes of paragraph (1), a mark is famous if it is widely
                recognized by the general consuming public of the United States as a
                designation of source of the goods or services of the mark's owner. In
                determining whether a mark possesses the requisite degree of
                recognition, the court may consider all relevant factors, including the
                following:

                         (i) The duration, extent, and geographic reach of advertising
                         and publicity of the mark, whether advertised or publicized by
                         the owner or third parties.

                         (ii) The amount, volume, and geographic extent of sales of
                         goods or services offered under the mark.

                         (iii) The extent of actual recognition of the mark.

                         (iv) Whether the mark was registered under the Act of March
                         3, 1881, or the Act of February 20, 1905, or on the principal
                         register.

                                                    443
        (B) For purposes of paragraph (1), "dilution by blurring" is association
        arising from the similarity between a mark or trade name and a
        famous mark that impairs the distinctiveness of the famous mark. In
        determining whether a mark or trade name is likely to cause dilution
        by blurring, the court may consider all relevant factors, including the
        following:

                (i) The degree of similarity between the mark or trade name
                and the famous mark.

                (ii) The degree of inherent or acquired distinctiveness of the
                famous mark.

                (iii) The extent to which the owner of the famous mark is
                engaging in substantially exclusive use of the mark.

                (iv) The degree of recognition of the famous mark.

                (v) Whether the user of the mark or trade name intended to
                create an association with the famous mark.

                (vi) Any actual association between the mark or trade name
                and the famous mark.

        (C) For purposes of paragraph (1), "dilution by tarnishment" is
        association arising from the similarity between a mark or trade name
        and a famous mark that harms the reputation of the famous mark.

(3) Exclusions

The following shall not be actionable as dilution by blurring or dilution by
tarnishment under this subsection:

        (A) Any fair use, including a nominative or descriptive fair use, or
        facilitation of such fair use, of a famous mark by another person other
        than as a designation of source for the person's own goods or services,
        including use in connection with--

                (i) advertising or promotion that permits consumers to
                compare goods or services; or

                (ii) identifying and parodying, criticizing, or commenting upon
                the famous mark owner or the goods or services of the famous
                mark owner.

        (B) All forms of news reporting and news commentary.

                                           444
        (C) Any noncommercial use of a mark.

(4) Burden of proof

In a civil action for trade dress dilution under this chapter for trade dress not
registered on the principal register, the person who asserts trade dress
protection has the burden of proving that--

        (A) the claimed trade dress, taken as a whole, is not functional and is
        famous; and

        (B) if the claimed trade dress includes any mark or marks registered
        on the principal register, the unregistered matter, taken as a whole, is
        famous separate and apart from any fame of such registered marks.

(5) Additional remedies

In an action brought under this subsection, the owner of the famous mark
shall be entitled to injunctive relief as set forth in section 1116 of this title.
The owner of the famous mark shall also be entitled to the remedies set forth
in sections 1117 (a) and 1118 of this title, subject to the discretion of the
court and the principles of equity if--

        (A) the mark or trade name that is likely to cause dilution by blurring
        or dilution by tarnishment was first used in commerce by the person
        against whom the injunction is sought after October 6, 2006; and

        (B) in a claim arising under this subsection--

                (i) by reason of dilution by blurring, the person against whom
                the injunction is sought willfully intended to trade on the
                recognition of the famous mark; or

                (ii) by reason of dilution by tarnishment, the person against
                whom the injunction is sought willfully intended to harm the
                reputation of the famous mark.

(6) Ownership of valid registration a complete bar to action

The ownership by a person of a valid registration under the Act of March 3,
1881, or the Act of February 20, 1905, or on the principal register under this
chapter shall be a complete bar to an action against that person, with respect
to that mark, that--

        (A) is brought by another person under the common law or a statute
of a State; and

                                           445
                (B)

                         (i) seeks to prevent dilution by blurring or dilution by
                         tarnishment; or

                         (ii) asserts any claim of actual or likely damage or harm to the
                         distinctiveness or reputation of a mark, label, or form of
                         advertisement.

        (7) Savings clause

        Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to impair, modify, or supersede
        the applicability of the patent laws of the United States.

                                              Notes

        Conceptualizing the harm of dilution. Judge Posner gave an oft-quoted
explanation of dilution by blurring and tarnishment in Ty Inc. v. Perryman, 306 F.3d
509, 511 (7th Cir. 2002) (some citations omitted, alterations in original):

        Suppose an upscale restaurant calls itself "Tiffany." There is little danger that
        the consuming public will think it's dealing with a branch of the Tiffany
        jewelry store if it patronizes this restaurant. But when consumers next see the
        name "Tiffany" they may think about both the restaurant and the jewelry
        store, and if so the efficacy of the name as an identifier of the store will be
        diminished. Consumers will have to think harder--incur as it were a higher
        imagination cost--to recognize the name as the name of the store. Cf. Mead
        Data Central, Inc. v. Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc., 875 F.2d 1026, 1031
        (2d Cir.1989) ("The [legislative] history [of New York's antidilution statute]
        disclosed a need for legislation to prevent such `hypothetical anomalies' as
        `Dupont shoes, Buick aspirin tablets, Schlitz varnish, Kodak pianos, Bulova
        gowns' "). So "blurring" is one form of dilution.

        As for tarnishment:

        Now suppose that the "restaurant" that adopts the name "Tiffany" is actually
        a striptease joint. Again, and indeed even more certainly than in the previous
        case, consumers will not think the striptease joint under common ownership
        with the jewelry store. But because of the inveterate tendency of the human
        mind to proceed by association, every time they think of the word "Tiffany"
        their image of the fancy jewelry store will be tarnished by the association of
        the word with the strip joint.

                                                    446
        Dilution as an anti-free riding rule. In Ty, Judge Posner offers a third rationale
for dilution doctrine that is not in the statute, but perhaps reflects the thinking of
some judges:

        [T]here is a possible concern with situations in which, though there is
        neither blurring nor tarnishment, someone is still taking a free ride on the
        investment of the trademark owner in the trademark. Suppose the "Tiffany"
        restaurant in our first hypothetical example is located in Kuala Lumpur and
        though the people who patronize it (it is upscale) have heard of the Tiffany
        jewelry store, none of them is ever going to buy anything there, so that the
        efficacy of the trademark as an identifier will not be impaired. If
        appropriation of Tiffany's aura is nevertheless forbidden by an expansive
        concept of dilution, the benefits of the jewelry store's investment in creating
        a famous name will be, as economists say, "internalized"--that is, Tiffany will
        realize the full benefits of the investment rather than sharing those benefits
        with others--and as a result the amount of investing in creating a prestigious
        name will rise.

        Consider whether any of these theories adequately explain the outcomes of
the following cases.

                          Visa Intern. Service Ass'n v. JSL Corp.
                                610 F.3d 1088 (9th Cir. 2010)

KOZINSKI[*], Chief Judge:
        She sells sea shells by the sea shore. That's swell, but how about Shell

espresso, Tide motor oil, Apple bicycles and Playboy computers? We consider the
application of anti-dilution law to trademarks that are also common English words.

                                               Facts
        Joseph Orr runs eVisa, a "multilingual education and information business
that exists and operates exclusively on the Internet," at www. evisa. com. At least he
did, until the district court enjoined him. Orr traces the name eVisa back to an
English language tutoring service called "Eikaiwa Visa" that he ran while living in
Japan. "Eikaiwa" is Japanese for English conversation, and the "e" in eVisa is short
for Eikaiwa. The use of the word "visa" in both eVisa and Eikaiwa Visa is meant to
suggest "the ability to travel, both linguistically and physically, through the English-
speaking world." Orr founded eVisa shortly before his return to America, where he
started running it out of his apartment in Brooklyn, New York.

          * Judge Alex Kozinski retired from the bench in 2017 after accusations of sexual misconduct by

multiple women.

                                                    447
        Visa International Service Association sued JSL Corporation, through which
Orr operates eVisa, claiming that eVisa is likely to dilute the Visa trademark. The
district court granted summary judgment for Visa, and JSL appeals.

                                             Analysis
        A plaintiff seeking relief under federal anti-dilution law must show that its
mark is famous and distinctive, that defendant began using its mark in commerce
after plaintiff's mark became famous and distinctive, and that defendant's mark is
likely to dilute plaintiff's mark. JSL does not dispute that the Visa mark is famous
and distinctive or that JSL began using the eVisa mark in commerce after Visa
achieved its renown. JSL claims only that the district court erred when it found as a
matter of law that eVisa was likely to dilute the Visa trademark.
        There are two types of dilution, but here we are concerned only with dilution
by blurring, which occurs when a mark previously associated with one product also
becomes associated with a second. See 15 U.S.C. § 1125(c)(2)(B); Mattel, Inc. v. MCA
Records, Inc., 296 F.3d 894, 903-04 (9th Cir.2002). This weakens the mark's ability
to evoke the first product in the minds of consumers. "For example, Tylenol
snowboards, Netscape sex shops and Harry Potter dry cleaners would all weaken the
`commercial magnetism' of these marks and diminish their ability to evoke their
original associations." Mattel, 296 F.3d at 903. Dilution isn't confusion; quite the
contrary. Dilution occurs when consumers form new and different associations with
the plaintiff's mark. "Even if no one suspects that the maker of analgesics has
entered into the snowboard business, the Tylenol mark will now bring to mind two
products, not one." Id.
        Whether a defendant's mark creates a likelihood of dilution is a factual
question generally not appropriate for decision on summary judgment.
Nevertheless, summary judgment may be granted in a dilution case, as in any other,
if no reasonable fact-finder could fail to find a likelihood of dilution. Congress has
enumerated factors courts may use to analyze the likelihood of dilution, including
the similarity between the two marks and the distinctiveness and recognition of the
plaintiff's mark. 15 U.S.C. § 1125(c)(2)(B)(i), (ii), (iv). And, in an appropriate case,
the district court may conclusively determine one or more of these factors before
trial.
        The marks here are effectively identical; the only difference is the prefix "e,"
which is commonly used to refer to the electronic or online version of a brand. That
prefix does no more to distinguish the two marks than would the words "Corp." or
"Inc." tacked onto the end. See Horphag Research Ltd. v. Garcia, 475 F.3d 1029, 1036
(9th Cir.2007) (use of identical mark provides "circumstantial evidence" of
dilution).
        And Visa is a strong trademark. "In general, the more unique or arbitrary a
mark, the more protection a court will afford it." Nutri/System, Inc. v. Con-Stan

                                                    448
Indus., Inc., 809 F.2d 601, 605 (9th Cir.1987). The Visa mark draws on positive
mental associations with travel visas, which make potentially difficult transactions
relatively simple and facilitate new opportunities and experiences. Those are good
attributes for a credit card. But those associations are sufficiently remote that the
word visa wouldn't make people think of credit cards if it weren't for the Visa
brand. "This suggests that any association is the result of goodwill and deserves
broad protection from potential infringers." Dreamwerks Prod. Grp., Inc. v. SKG
Studio, 142 F.3d 1127, 1130 n.7 (9th Cir.1998). Visa also introduced
uncontroverted evidence that Visa is the world's top brand in financial services and
is used for online purchases almost as often as all other credit cards combined. This
was enough to support the district court's summary judgment.

        JSL vigorously contests the validity of market surveys and expert testimony
introduced by Visa to show that eVisa dilutes the Visa mark, and it claims that
evidence should have been excluded under Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharm., Inc., 509
U.S. 579 (1993). But a plaintiff seeking to establish a likelihood of dilution is not
required to go to the expense of producing expert testimony or market surveys; it
may rely entirely on the characteristics of the marks at issue. See 15 U.S.C. §
1125(c)(2)(B) (listing relevant factors). Expert testimony and survey evidence may be
necessary in marginal cases, or where a defendant introduces significant evidence to
show that dilution is unlikely. But JSL presented nothing, other than Orr's
statement that he did not intend to dilute the Visa mark, to rebut the inference of
likely dilution created by the strength and similarity of the marks. Good intentions
alone do not negate a showing of a likelihood of dilution. We therefore need not
reach the admissibility of Visa's expert testimony and market survey evidence.

        JSL claims the eVisa mark cannot cause dilution because, in addition to
being an electronic payment network that's everywhere you want to be, a visa is a
travel document authorizing the bearer to enter a country's territory. When a
trademark is also a word with a dictionary definition, it may be difficult to show
that the trademark holder's use of the word is sufficiently distinctive to deserve anti-
dilution protection because such a word is likely to be descriptive or suggestive of an
essential attribute of the trademarked good. Moreover, such a word may already be
in use as a mark by third parties. For example, we rejected a dilution claim by Trek
Bicycle Corporation for its "Trek" mark in part because it played heavily off the
dictionary meaning of "trek," suggesting that the bicycles were designed for long or
arduous journeys. Thane Int'l, Inc. v. Trek Bicycle Corp., 305 F.3d 894, 912 n.14 (9th
Cir.2002). Additionally, the creators of the Star Trek series had already
"incorporated this common English language word into their trademark," and the
"glow of this celebrity ma[de] it difficult for Trek to obtain fame using the same
word." Id. In our case, Visa's use of the word visa is sufficiently distinctive because it
plays only weakly off the dictionary meaning of the term and JSL presented no

                                                    449
evidence that a third party has used the word as a mark.
        It's true that the word visa is used countless times every day for its common

English definition, but the prevalence of such non-trademark use does not
undermine the uniqueness of Visa as a trademark. See 2 McCarthy on Trademarks and
Unfair Competition § 11:87 (4th ed.2010). "The significant factor is not whether the
word itself is common, but whether the way the word is used in a particular context
is unique enough to warrant trademark protection." Wynn Oil Co. v. Thomas, 839
F.2d 1183, 1190 n.4 (6th Cir.1988). In the context of anti-dilution law, the
"particular context" that matters is use of the word in commerce to identify a good
or service. There are, for instance, many camels, but just one Camel; many tides, but
just one Tide. Camel cupcakes and Tide calculators would dilute the value of those
marks. Likewise, despite widespread use of the word visa for its common English
meaning, the introduction of the eVisa mark to the marketplace means that there
are now two products, and not just one, competing for association with that word.
This is the quintessential harm addressed by anti-dilution law.

        JSL is not using the word visa for its literal dictionary definition, and this
would be a different case if it were. Visa does not claim that it could enforce its Visa
trademark to prevent JSL from opening "Orr's Visa Services," any more than Apple
could shut down Orr's Apple Orchard or Camel could fold up Orr's Camel
Breeders. Visa doesn't own the word "visa" and may not "deplete the stock of useful
words" by asserting otherwise. Conferring anti-dilution rights to common English
words would otherwise be untenable, as whole swaths of the dictionary could be
taken out of circulation. Nor would a suit against Orr's Visa Services advance the
purpose of anti-dilution law. Such use of the word would not create a new
association for the word with a product; it would merely evoke the word's existing
dictionary meaning, as to which no one may claim exclusivity.

        JSL argues that its use of the word "visa" is akin to Orr's Visa Services
because the eVisa mark is meant to "connote the ability to travel, both linguistically
and physically, through the English-speaking world" and therefore employs the
word's common English meaning. JSL's site depicted the eVisa mark next to a
booklet that looks like a passport, and it divided the services offered into the
categories "Travel Passport," "Language Passport" and "Technology Passport." But
these allusions to the dictionary definition of the word visa do not change the fact
that JSL has created a novel meaning for the word: to identify a "multilingual
education and information business." This multiplication of meanings is the
essence of dilution by blurring. Use of the word "visa" to refer to travel visas is
permissible because it doesn't have this effect; the word elicits only the standard
dictionary definition. Use of the word visa in a trademark to refer to a good or
service other than a travel visa, as in this case, undoubtedly does have this effect; the
word becomes associated with two products, rather than one. This is true even

                                                    450
when use of the word also gestures at the word's dictionary definition.
        JSL's allusions to international travel are more obvious and heavy-handed

than Visa's, and JSL claims that its use of the word is therefore "different" from
Visa's. That's true; Visa plays only weakly off the word's association with
international travel, whereas JSL embraced the metaphor with gusto. But dilution
always involves use of a mark by a defendant that is "different" from the plaintiff's
use; the injury addressed by anti-dilution law in fact occurs when marks are placed
in new and different contexts, thereby weakening the mark's ability to bring to
mind the plaintiff's goods or services. The only context that matters is that the
marks are both used in commerce as trademarks to identify a good or service, as
they undoubtedly are in this case.

        The district court was quite right in granting summary judgment to Visa and
enjoining JSL's use of the mark.

        AFFIRMED.

               Louis Vuitton Malletier S.A. v. Haute Diggity Dog, LLC
                                      507 F.3d 252 (2007)

NIEMEYER, Circuit Judge:
        Louis Vuitton Malletier S.A., a French corporation located in Paris, that

manufactures luxury luggage, handbags, and accessories, commenced this action
against Haute Diggity Dog, LLC, a Nevada corporation that manufactures and sells
pet products nationally, alleging trademark infringement under 15 U.S.C. §
1114(1)(a), trademark dilution under 15 U.S.C. § 1125(c), copyright infringement
under 17 U.S.C. § 501, and related statutory and common law violations. Haute
Diggity Dog manufactures, among other things, plush toys on which dogs can chew,
which, it claims, parody famous trademarks on luxury products, including those of
Louis Vuitton Malletier. The particular Haute Diggity Dog chew toys in question
here are small imitations of handbags that are labeled "Chewy Vuiton" and that
mimic Louis Vuitton Malletier's LOUIS VUITTON handbags. . . .

        LVM also contends that Haute Diggity Dog's advertising, sale, and
distribution of the "Chewy Vuiton" dog toys dilutes its LOUIS VUITTON, LV, and
Monogram Canvas marks, which are famous and distinctive, in violation of the
Trademark Dilution Revision Act of 2006 ("TDRA"). It argues, "Before the district
court's decision, Vuitton's famous marks were unblurred by any third party
trademark use." "Allowing defendants to become the first to use similar marks will
obviously blur and dilute the Vuitton Marks." It also contends that "Chewy Vuiton"
dog toys are likely to tarnish LVM's marks because they "pose a choking hazard for
some dogs."

        Haute Diggity Dog urges that, in applying the TDRA to the circumstances
before us, we reject LVM's suggestion that a parody "automatically" gives rise to

                                                    451
"actionable dilution." Haute Diggity Dog contends that only marks that are
"identical or substantially similar" can give rise to actionable dilution, and its
"Chewy Vuiton" marks are not identical or sufficiently similar to LVM's marks. It
also argues that "[its] spoof, like other obvious parodies," " `tends to increase public
identification' of [LVM's] mark with [LVM]," quoting Jordache, 828 F.2d at 1490,
rather than impairing its distinctiveness, as the TDRA requires. As for LVM's
tarnishment claim, Haute Diggity Dog argues that LVM's position is at best based
on speculation and that LVM has made no showing of a likelihood of dilution by
tarnishment.

        Claims for trademark dilution are authorized by the TDRA, a relatively
recent enactment, which provides in relevant part:

        Subject to the principles of equity, the owner of a famous mark ... shall be
        entitled to an injunction against another person who ... commences use of a
        mark or trade name in commerce that is likely to cause dilution by blurring or
        dilution by tarnishment of the famous mark, regardless of the presence or
        absence of actual or likely confusion, of competition, or of actual economic
        injury.

15 U.S.C.A. § 1125(c)(1) (emphasis added). A mark is "famous" when it is "widely
recognized by the general consuming public of the United States as a designation of
source of the goods or services of the mark's owner." Id. § 1125(c)(2)(A). Creating
causes of action for only dilution by blurring and dilution by tarnishment, the TDRA
defines "dilution by blurring" as the "association arising from the similarity between
a mark or trade name and a famous mark that impairs the distinctiveness of the
famous mark." Id. § 1125(c)(2)(B). It defines "dilution by tarnishment" as the
"association arising from the similarity between a mark or trade name and a famous
mark that harms the reputation of the famous mark." Id. § 1125(c)(2)(C).

        Thus, to state a dilution claim under the TDRA, a plaintiff must show:
        (1) that the plaintiff owns a famous mark that is distinctive;

        (2) that the defendant has commenced using a mark in commerce that
        allegedly is diluting the famous mark;

        (3) that a similarity between the defendant's mark and the famous mark gives
        rise to an association between the marks; and

        (4) that the association is likely to impair the distinctiveness of the famous
        mark or likely to harm the reputation of the famous mark.

        In the context of blurring, distinctiveness refers to the ability of the famous
mark uniquely to identify a single source and thus maintain its selling power. See
N.Y. Stock Exch. v. N.Y., N.Y. Hotel LLC, 293 F.3d 550, 558 (2d Cir.2002) (observing

                                                    452
that blurring occurs where the defendant's use creates "the possibility that the
[famous] mark will lose its ability to serve as a unique identifier of the plaintiff's
product") (quoting Deere & Co. v. MTD Prods., Inc., 41 F.3d 39, 43 (2d Cir.1994)). In
proving a dilution claim under the TDRA, the plaintiff need not show actual or
likely confusion, the presence of competition, or actual economic injury. See 15
U.S.C.A. § 1125(c)(1).

        The TDRA creates three defenses based on the defendant's (1) "fair use"
(with exceptions); (2) "news reporting and news commentary"; and (3)
"noncommercial use." Id. § 1125(c)(3).

                                                 A
        We address first LVM's claim for dilution by blurring.
        The first three elements of a trademark dilution claim are not at issue in this
case. LVM owns famous marks that are distinctive; Haute Diggity Dog has
commenced using "Chewy Vuiton," "CV," and designs and colors that are allegedly
diluting LVM's marks; and the similarity between Haute Diggity Dog's marks and
LVM's marks gives rise to an association between the marks, albeit a parody. The
issue for resolution is whether the association between Haute Diggity Dog's marks
and LVM's marks is likely to impair the distinctiveness of LVM's famous marks.
        In deciding this issue, the district court correctly outlined the six factors to
be considered in determining whether dilution by blurring has been shown. See 15
U.S.C.A. § 1125(c)(2)(B). But in evaluating the facts of the case, the court did not
directly apply those factors it enumerated. It held simply:

        [The famous mark's] strength is not likely to be blurred by a parody dog toy
        product. Instead of blurring Plaintiff's mark, the success of the parodic use
        depends upon the continued association with LOUIS VUITTON.

The amicus supporting LVM's position in this case contends that the district court,
by not applying the statutory factors, misapplied the TDRA to conclude that simply
because Haute Diggity Dog's product was a parody meant that "there can be no
association with the famous mark as a matter of law." Moreover, the amicus points
out correctly that to rule in favor of Haute Diggity Dog, the district court was
required to find that the "association" did not impair the distinctiveness of LVM's
famous mark.

        LVM goes further in its own brief, however, and contends:

        When a defendant uses an imitation of a famous mark in connection with
        related goods, a claim of parody cannot preclude liability for dilution.

        * * *

                                                    453
        The district court's opinion utterly ignores the substantial goodwill
        VUITTON has established in its famous marks through more than a century
        of exclusive use. Disregarding the clear Congressional mandate to protect
        such famous marks against dilution, the district court has granted [Haute
        Diggity Dog] permission to become the first company other than VUITTON
        to use imitations of the famous VUITTON Marks.

        In short, LVM suggests that any use by a third person of an imitation of its
famous marks dilutes the famous marks as a matter of law. This contention
misconstrues the TDRA.

        The TDRA prohibits a person from using a junior mark that is likely to
dilute (by blurring) the famous mark, and blurring is defined to be an impairment
to the famous mark's distinctiveness. "Distinctiveness" in turn refers to the public's
recognition that the famous mark identifies a single source of the product using the
famous mark.

        To determine whether a junior mark is likely to dilute a famous mark
through blurring, the TDRA directs the court to consider all factors relevant to the
issue, including six factors that are enumerated in the statute:

        (i) The degree of similarity between the mark or trade name and the famous
        mark.

        (ii) The degree of inherent or acquired distinctiveness of the famous mark.

        (iii) The extent to which the owner of the famous mark is engaging in
        substantially exclusive use of the mark.

        (iv) The degree of recognition of the famous mark.

        (v) Whether the user of the mark or trade name intended to create an
        association with the famous mark.

        (vi) Any actual association between the mark or trade name and the famous
        mark.

15 U.S.C.A. § 1125(c)(2)(B). Not every factor will be relevant in every case, and not
every blurring claim will require extensive discussion of the factors. But a trial court
must offer a sufficient indication of which factors it has found persuasive and
explain why they are persuasive so that the court's decision can be reviewed. The
district court did not do this adequately in this case. Nonetheless, after we apply the
factors as a matter of law, we reach the same conclusion reached by the district
court.

                                                    454
        We begin by noting that parody is not automatically a complete defense to a
claim of dilution by blurring where the defendant uses the parody as its own
designation of source, i.e., as a trademark. Although the TDRA does provide that fair
use is a complete defense and allows that a parody can be considered fair use, it
does not extend the fair use defense to parodies used as a trademark. As the statute
provides:

        The following shall not be actionable as dilution by blurring or dilution by
        tarnishment under this subsection:

        (A) Any fair use ... other than as a designation of source for the person's own goods
        or services, including use in connection with ... parodying....

15 U.S.C.A. § 1125(c)(3)(A)(ii) (emphasis added). Under the statute's plain
language, parodying a famous mark is protected by the fair use defense only if the
parody is not "a designation of source for the person's own goods or services."

        The TDRA, however, does not require a court to ignore the existence of a
parody that is used as a trademark, and it does not preclude a court from
considering parody as part of the circumstances to be considered for determining
whether the plaintiff has made out a claim for dilution by blurring. Indeed, the
statute permits a court to consider "all relevant factors," including the six factors
supplied in § 1125(c)(2)(B).

        Thus, it would appear that a defendant's use of a mark as a parody is relevant
to the overall question of whether the defendant's use is likely to impair the famous
mark's distinctiveness. Moreover, the fact that the defendant uses its marks as a
parody is specifically relevant to several of the listed factors. For example, factor (v)
(whether the defendant intended to create an association with the famous mark)
and factor (vi) (whether there exists an actual association between the defendant's
mark and the famous mark) directly invite inquiries into the defendant's intent in
using the parody, the defendant's actual use of the parody, and the effect that its use
has on the famous mark. While a parody intentionally creates an association with
the famous mark in order to be a parody, it also intentionally communicates, if it is
successful, that it is not the famous mark, but rather a satire of the famous mark.
That the defendant is using its mark as a parody is therefore relevant in the
consideration of these statutory factors.

        Similarly, factors (i), (ii), and (iv)--the degree of similarity between the two
marks, the degree of distinctiveness of the famous mark, and its recognizability--are
directly implicated by consideration of the fact that the defendant's mark is a
successful parody. Indeed, by making the famous mark an object of the parody, a
successful parody might actually enhance the famous mark's distinctiveness by
making it an icon. The brunt of the joke becomes yet more famous. See Hormel

                                                    455
Foods, 73 F.3d at 506 (observing that a successful parody "tends to increase public
identification" of the famous mark with its source); see also Yankee Publ'g Inc. v. News
Am. Publ'g Inc., 809 F.Supp. 267, 272-82 (S.D.N.Y.1992) (suggesting that a
sufficiently obvious parody is unlikely to blur the targeted famous mark).

        In sum, while a defendant's use of a parody as a mark does not support a
"fair use" defense, it may be considered in determining whether the plaintiff-owner
of a famous mark has proved its claim that the defendant's use of a parody mark is
likely to impair the distinctiveness of the famous mark.

        In the case before us, when considering factors (ii), (iii), and (iv), it is readily
apparent, indeed conceded by Haute Diggity Dog, that LVM's marks are distinctive,
famous, and strong. The LOUIS VUITTON mark is well known and is commonly
identified as a brand of the great Parisian fashion house, Louis Vuitton Malletier.
So too are its other marks and designs, which are invariably used with the LOUIS
VUITTON mark. It may not be too strong to refer to these famous marks as icons
of high fashion.

        While the establishment of these facts satisfies essential elements of LVM's
dilution claim, the facts impose on LVM an increased burden to demonstrate that
the distinctiveness of its famous marks is likely to be impaired by a successful
parody. Even as Haute Diggity Dog's parody mimics the famous mark, it
communicates simultaneously that it is not the famous mark, but is only satirizing
it. And because the famous mark is particularly strong and distinctive, it becomes
more likely that a parody will not impair the distinctiveness of the mark. In short, as
Haute Diggity Dog's "Chewy Vuiton" marks are a successful parody, we conclude
that they will not blur the distinctiveness of the famous mark as a unique identifier
of its source.

        It is important to note, however, that this might not be true if the parody is
so similar to the famous mark that it likely could be construed as actual use of the
famous mark itself. Factor (i) directs an inquiry into the "degree of similarity
between the junior mark and the famous mark." If Haute Diggity Dog used the
actual marks of LVM (as a parody or otherwise), it could dilute LVM's marks by
blurring, regardless of whether Haute Diggity Dog's use was confusingly similar,
whether it was in competition with LVM, or whether LVM sustained actual injury.
Thus, "the use of DUPONT shoes, BUICK aspirin, and KODAK pianos would be
actionable" under the TDRA because the unauthorized use of the famous marks
themselves on unrelated goods might diminish the capacity of these trademarks to
distinctively identify a single source. Moseley, 537 U.S. at 431 (quoting H.R.Rep.
No. 104-374, at 3 (1995), as reprinted in 1995 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1029, 1030). This is
true even though a consumer would be unlikely to confuse the manufacturer of
KODAK film with the hypothetical producer of KODAK pianos.

                                                    456
        But in this case, Haute Diggity Dog mimicked the famous marks; it did not
come so close to them as to destroy the success of its parody and, more importantly,
to diminish the LVM marks' capacity to identify a single source. Haute Diggity Dog
designed a pet chew toy to imitate and suggest, but not use, the marks of a high-
fashion LOUIS VUITTON handbag. It used "Chewy Vuiton" to mimic "LOUIS
VUITTON"; it used "CV" to mimic "LV"; and it adopted imperfectly the items of
LVM's designs. We conclude that these uses by Haute Diggity Dog were not so
similar as to be likely to impair the distinctiveness of LVM's famous marks.

        In a similar vein, when considering factors (v) and (vi), it becomes apparent
that Haute Diggity Dog intentionally associated its marks, but only partially and
certainly imperfectly, so as to convey the simultaneous message that it was not in
fact a source of LVM products. Rather, as a parody, it separated itself from the LVM
marks in order to make fun of them.

        In sum, when considering the relevant factors to determine whether blurring
is likely to occur in this case, we readily come to the conclusion, as did the district
court, that LVM has failed to make out a case of trademark dilution by blurring by
failing to establish that the distinctiveness of its marks was likely to be impaired by
Haute Diggity Dog's marketing and sale of its "Chewy Vuiton" products.

                                                 B
         LVM's claim for dilution by tarnishment does not require an extended
discussion. To establish its claim for dilution by tarnishment, LVM must show, in
lieu of blurring, that Haute Diggity Dog's use of the "Chewy Vuiton" mark on dog
toys harms the reputation of the LOUIS VUITTON mark and LVM's other marks.
LVM argues that the possibility that a dog could choke on a "Chewy Vuiton" toy
causes this harm. LVM has, however, provided no record support for its assertion. It
relies only on speculation about whether a dog could choke on the chew toys and a
logical concession that a $10 dog toy made in China was of "inferior quality" to the
$1190 LOUIS VUITTON handbag. The speculation begins with LVM's assertion
in its brief that "defendant Woofie's admitted that `Chewy Vuiton' products pose a
choking hazard for some dogs. Having prejudged the defendant's mark to be a
parody, the district court made light of this admission in its opinion, and utterly
failed to give it the weight it deserved," citing to a page in the district court's
opinion where the court states:

        At oral argument, plaintiff provided only a flimsy theory that a pet may some
        day choke on a Chewy Vuiton squeak toy and incite the wrath of a confused
        consumer against LOUIS VUITTON.

        The court was referring to counsel's statement during oral argument that the
owner of Woofie's stated that "she would not sell this product to certain types of

                                                    457
dogs because there is a danger they would tear it open and choke on it." There is no
record support, however, that any dog has choked on a pet chew toy, such as a
"Chewy Vuiton" toy, or that there is any basis from which to conclude that a dog
would likely choke on such a toy.

        We agree with the district court that LVM failed to demonstrate a claim for
dilution by tarnishment.

                                              Notes

        Difficulties of proof. The Supreme Court initially interpreted the FTDA to
require proof of actual dilution instead of a mere likelihood of dilution, and
Congress changed the statutory language to explicitly require only that a plaintiff
prove a likelihood of dilution. Either approach raises questions of how one is to
prove dilution. The cases in today's reading apply relatively simple tests. Does their
efficiency come at the expense of accuracy? Note how much is made of proxies that
may not resolve the factual inquiry at issue (e.g., mark similarity is not the same as
an association between marks).

        Would we be better off with multifactor tests? Consider the factors outlined
by the statute; are they dispositive of the existence of likely dilution?

        For example, one factor is "[a]ny actual association between the mark or
trade name and the famous mark." So suppose someone sells KOKA-KOLA bubble
gum, and consumers make an association between COCA-COLA the soft drink and
the gum. Is this blurring? It depends. Does the association make it harder for the
consumer to think of the soft drink when they see the COCA-COLA mark? Or
does it strengthen the mark by calling it to the consumer's mind, thus reinforcing it?
See Rebecca Tushnet, Gone in Sixty Milliseconds: Trademark Law and Cognitive Science,
86 Tex. L. Rev. 507, 537 (2008) ("In essence, exposure to near variants or uses in
other contexts makes the trademark more familiar and thus more easily retrieved
from memory."). Note, of course, that the statute defines dilution by blurring as
being more than just an association. It is an association that "impairs the
distinctiveness of the famous mark." But what do we know about such associations?

        There have been attempts to answer this question, but the results are
equivocal. Id. at 509-510 ("Cognitive models offer hope of answering these
objections by conceiving of dilution as an increase in mental or internal search
costs. Consumers allegedly have more difficulty recalling, recognizing, and
producing a diluted trademark, and correspondingly are less likely to purchase
products or services branded with that mark."); id. at 528 (noting that "in the real
world, proof that response delays persist over any appreciable time is limited. Nor
do we know at what point a response delay becomes enough to change a purchase
decision. The dilution studies find some statistically significant differences in

                                                    458
reactions between groups exposed and unexposed to dilutive ads, but statistical
significance does not mean that practical effects are substantial.").

        What should we make of the uncertainty? The dilution plaintiff has the
burden of proof. Does that mean the plaintiff is responsible for resolving all of
dilution's factual uncertainties? Or would this undermine Congress's purpose in
overruling the Supreme Court's earlier, restrictive interpretation of the dilution
cause of action? Do the simplifying approaches of today's cases take us closer to a
pure property right in a word? Can you think of ways to prove likely dilution that
are not discussed in the statute or the cases?

        Is dilution anachronistic? The dilution cause of action is often traced to Frank
Schechter's influential article The Rational Basis of Trademark Protection, 40 HARV. L.
REV. 813 (1927). Note, however, that Schechter wrote at a time in which the
traditional trademark action was less likely to reach confusing trademark uses absent
direct competition. That has changed. Likewise, infringement claims now reach
questions of mere association, which also covers ground that dilution might reach.
Do these developments eliminate the need (assuming there was one) for a dilution
cause of action? Dilution has been a part of the Lanham Act only since 1996. Before
then, however, courts would occasionally use likelihood-of-confusion claims to
target what might be called dilutive behavior. See, e.g., Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders,
Inc. v. Pussycat Cinema, Ltd., 604 F.2d 200, 205 (2d Cir. 1979) (upholding
preliminary injunction against adult film in which characters wore uniforms similar
football team's cheerleaders).

        All that said, the dilution cause of action still performs work. Plaintiffs may
prevail on dilution while losing on infringement. See, e.g., Diageo North Am., Inc. v.
W.J. Deutsch & Sons LTD., 2024 WL 2712636 (2d Cir. 2024).

        No niche fame. Under the original text of the Federal Trademark Dilution
Act, it was unclear whether a mark needed to be nationally famous (e.g.,
STARBUCKS for coffee) to be protected against dilution or if niche or local fame
was good enough (e.g., JAVA DAVE'S for coffee).* The revised language of the
statute seems to make clear that national fame is required as it demands that the
mark be "widely recognized by the general consuming public of the United States as
a designation of source of the goods or services of the mark's owner" to receive
protection from dilution.

                                 605 F.3d 382 (6th Cir. 2010)

MERRITT, Circuit Judge.
        In this trademark "dilution by tarnishment" case, brought under the

Trademark Dilution Revision Act of 2006,1 the question is whether the plaintiff, an

          1 The relevant provisions of the new law change the test for "dilution by tarnishment" from an
"actual" to only a likelihood of "harm" to the "reputation" of the senior mark:

          15 U.S.C. § 1125(c) Dilution by blurring; dilution by tarnishment

          (1) Injunctive relief

          Subject to the principles of equity, the owner of a famous mark that is distinctive, inherently or
          through acquired distinctiveness, shall be entitled to an injunction against another person who, at
          any time after the owner's mark has become famous, commences use of a mark or trade name in
          commerce that is likely to cause dilution by blurring or dilution by tarnishment of the famous mark,
          regardless of the presence or absence of actual or likely confusion, of competition or of actual
          economic injury.

          (2) Definition

          ....

          (C) For purposes of paragraph (1), "dilution by tarnishment" is association arising from the similarity
          between a mark or trade name and a famous mark that harms the reputation of the famous mark.

                                                    461
international lingerie company that uses the trade name designation "Victoria's
Secret" has a valid suit for injunctive relief against the use of the name "Victor's
Little Secret" or "Victor's Secret" by the defendants, a small retail store in a mall in
Elizabethtown, Kentucky, that sells assorted merchandise, including "sex toys" and
other sexually oriented products. The District Court issued the injunction. Since
then the shop has been operating under the name of "Cathy's Little Secret." The
District Court concluded that even though the two parties do not compete in the
same market, the "Victor's Little Secret" mark--because it is sex related--disparages
and tends to reduce the positive associations and the "selling power" of the
"Victoria's Secret" mark. The question is whether the plaintiff's case meets the
definitions and standards for "dilution by tarnishment" set out in the new Act
which amended the old Act, i.e., the Federal Trademark Dilution Act of 1995.2

        The new Act was expressly intended to overrule the Supreme Court
interpretation of the old Act in this very same case, Moseley v. V Secret Catalogue, Inc.,
537 U.S. 418 (2003), rev'g 259 F.3d 464 (6th Cir.2001), aff'g 54 U.S.P.Q.2d 1092
(W.D.Ky.2000). The Supreme Court reversed a panel of this Court that had
affirmed an injunction against "Victor's Little Secret" issued by the District Court.
On remand to the District Court from the Supreme Court after the 2003 reversal,
no new evidence was introduced, and the District Court reconsidered the case
based on the same evidence but used the new language in the new Act which
overrules the Supreme Court in this case. . . . . We conclude that the new Act
creates a kind of rebuttable presumption, or at least a very strong inference, that a
new mark used to sell sex related products is likely to tarnish a famous mark if there
is a clear semantic association between the two. That presumption has not been
rebutted in this case.

                    I. The Supreme Court Opinion and the New Act
        The Supreme Court explained that this case started when an Army Colonel
at Fort Knox saw an ad for "Victor's Secret" in a weekly publication. It advertised
that the small store in Elizabethtown sold adult videos and novelties and lingerie.
There was no likelihood of confusion between the two businesses or the two marks,
but the Army Colonel was offended because the sexually-oriented business was
semantically associating itself with "Victoria's Secret." The Court explained that the

          2 The relevant provisions of the old law provide:

          § 1125(c)(1). The owner of a famous mark shall be entitled, subject to the principles of equity and

          upon such terms as the court deems reasonable, to an injunction against another person's

          commercial use in commerce of a mark or trade name, if such use begins after the mark has become

          famous and causes dilution of the distinctive quality of the mark ....

                                                    462
concepts of "dilution by blurring" and "dilution by tarnishment" originated with an
article in the Harvard Law Review, Frank Schechter, "Rational Basis of Trademark
Protection," 40 HARV. L.REV.. 813 (1927), and that the history and meaning of
the concepts were further well explained in Restatement (Third) of Unfair
Competition, Section 25 (1995). The Restatement section referred to by the
Supreme Court explains this new intellectual property tort and contains in § 25 a
comprehensive statement of "Liability Without Proof of Confusion: Dilution and
Tarnishment." "Tarnishment," as distinguished from "dilution by blurring" was the
only claim before the Supreme Court and is the only claim before us in this new
appeal. We quote at length the relevant Restatement explanation of "tarnishment"
in the footnote below.4

                  4

          c. Interests protected. The antidilution statutes have been invoked against two distinct threats to the
          interests of a trademark owner. First, a mark may be so highly distinctive and so well advertised that
          it acts as a powerful selling tool. Such a mark may evoke among prospective purchasers a positive
          response that is associated exclusively with the goods or services of the trademark owner. To the
          extent that others use the trademark to identify different goods, services or businesses, a dissonance
          occurs that blurs this stimulant effect of the mark. The antidilution statutes protect against this
          dilution of the distinctiveness and selling power of the mark.

          The selling power of a trademark also can be undermined by a use of the mark with goods or
          services such as illicit drugs or pornography that "tarnish" the mark's image through inherently
          negative or unsavory associations, or with goods or services that produce a negative response when
          linked in the minds of prospective purchasers with the goods or services of the prior user, such as
          the use on insecticide of a trademark similar to one previously used by another on food products.

          Tarnishment and dilution of distinctiveness, although conceptually distinct, both undermine the
          selling power of a mark, the latter by disturbing the conditioned association of the mark with the
          prior user and the former by displacing positive with negative associations. Thus, tarnishment and
          dilution of distinctiveness reduce the value of the mark to the trademark owner.

          ....

          g. Tarnishment. The antidilution statutes have also been invoked to protect the positive associations
          evoked by a mark from subsequent uses that may disparage or tarnish those associations. The rule
          stated in Subsection (1)(b) applies to cases in which the tarnishment results from a subsequent use
          of the mark or a substantially similar mark in a manner that associates the mark with different
          goods, services, or businesses. Use of another's mark by the actor, not as a trademark or trade name,
          but in other ways that may disparage or tarnish the prior user's goods, services, business, or mark is
          governed by the rule stated in Subsection (2).

                                                    463
        After reviewing a number of secondary sources other than the Harvard Law
Review article and the Restatement, including state statutes on dilution and a
Fourth Circuit case, the Supreme Court held that "actual harm" rather than merely
the "likelihood of tarnishment" is necessary . . . .

        Thus, the Court held that "actual harm" rather than merely a "likelihood" of
harm must be shown by Victoria's Secret in order to prevail and that this means
that Victoria's Secret carries the burden of proving an actual "lessening of the
capacity of the Victoria's Secret mark to identify and distinguish goods or services
sold in Victoria's Secret stores or advertised in its catalogs." Id. In the new law
Congress rejected the Court's view that a simple "likelihood" of an association in
the consumer's mind of the Victoria's Secret mark with the sexually-oriented videos
and toys of "Victor's Secret" is insufficient for liability.

        The House Judiciary Committee Report states the purpose of the new 2006
legislation as follows:

        The Moseley standard creates an undue burden for trademark holders who
        contest diluting uses and should be revised.

        ....

        The new language in the legislation [provides] ... specifically that the standard
        for proving a dilution claim is "likelihood of dilution" and that both dilution
        by blurring and dilution by tarnishment are actionable.

(Emphasis added.) U.S. Code Cong. & Adm. News, 109th Cong.2d Sess.2006, Vol.
4, pp. 1091, 1092, 1097. . . . The drafters of the Committee Report also called
special attention to the "burden" of proof or persuasion placed on "trademark

          Any designation that is distinctive under the criteria established in § 13 is eligible for protection
          against disparaging or tarnishing use by others. Whenever the subsequent use brings to mind the
          goods, services, business, or mark of the prior user, there is potential for interference with the
          positive images associated with the mark. To prove a case of tarnishment, the prior user must
          demonstrate that the subsequent use is likely to come to the attention of the prior user's prospective
          purchasers and that the use is likely to undermine or damage the positive associations evoked by the
          mark.

          Illustration:

          3. A, a bank, uses the designation "Cookie Jar" to identify its automatic teller machine. B opens a
          topless bar across the street from A under the trade name "Cookie Jar." Although prospective
          customers of A are unlikely to believe that A operates or sponsors the bar, B is subject to liability to
          A for tarnishment under an applicable antidilution statute if the customers are likely to associate A's
          mark or A's business with the images evoked by B's use.

holders" by the Supreme Court's opinion in Moseley, suggesting a possible
modification in the burden of proof. The question for us then is whether "Victor's
Little Secret" with its association with lewd sexual toys creates a "likelihood of
dilution by tarnishment" of Victoria's Secret mark.

                           II. Application of Statutory Standard
        The specific question in this case is whether, without consumer surveys or
polls or other evidence, a semantic "association" is equivalent to a liability-creating
mental "association" of a junior mark like "Victor's Little Secret" with a famous
mark like "Victoria's Secret" that constitutes dilution by tarnishment when the
junior mark is used to sell sexual toys, videos and similar soft-core pornographic
products. There appears to be a clearly emerging consensus in the case law, aided by
the language of § 25 of the Restatement of Trademarks 3d, quoted in footnote 4,
supra, that the creation of an "association" between a famous mark and lewd or
bawdy sexual activity disparages and defiles the famous mark and reduces the
commercial value of its selling power. This consensus stems from an economic
prediction about consumer taste and how the predicted reaction of conventional
consumers in our culture will affect the economic value of the famous mark.
        There have been at least eight federal cases in six jurisdictions that conclude
that a famous mark is tarnished when its mark is semantically associated with a new
mark that is used to sell sex-related products. We find no exceptions in the case law
that allow such a new mark associated with sex to stand. See Pfizer Inc. v. Sachs, 652
F.Supp.2d 512, 525 (S.D.N.Y.2009) (defendants' display at an adult entertainment
exhibition of two models riding a VIAGRA-branded missile and distributing
condoms would likely harm the reputation of Pfizer's trademark); Williams-Sonoma,

467 F.Supp. 366, 377 (S.D.N.Y.1979) (pornographic depiction of a Dallas Cowboys
Cheerleader-style cheerleader in an adult film tarnished the professional mark of the

         The phrase "likely to cause dilution" used in the new statute (see footnote 1)
significantly changes the meaning of the law from "causes actual harm" under the
preexisting law. The word "likely" or "likelihood" means "probably," WEBSTER'S
THIRD NEW INTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY 1310 (1963); BLACK'S LAW
DICTIONARY 1076 (1968). It is important to note also that the Committee
Report quoted above seeks to reduce the "burden" of evidentiary production on the
trademark holder. The burden-of-proof problem, the developing case law, and the
Restatement (Third) of Trademarks in § 25 (particularly subsection g) should now
be interpreted, we think, to create a kind of rebuttable presumption, or at least a
very strong inference, that a new mark used to sell sex-related products is likely to
tarnish a famous mark if there is a clear semantic association between the two. This
res ipsa loquitur-like effect is not conclusive but places on the owner of the new mark
the burden of coming forward with evidence that there is no likelihood or
probability of tarnishment. The evidence could be in the form of expert testimony
or surveys or polls or customer testimony.

         In the present case, the Moseleys have had two opportunities in the District
Court to offer evidence that there is no real probability of tarnishment and have not
done so. They did not offer at oral argument any suggestion that they could make
such a showing or wanted the case remanded for that purpose. The fact that
Congress was dissatisfied with the Moseley result and the Moseley standard of
liability, as well as apparently the Moseley burden of proof, supports the view of
Victoria's Secret that the present record--in the eyes of the legislative branch--shows
a likelihood of tarnishment. Without evidence to the contrary or a persuasive
defensive theory that rebuts the presumption, the defendants have given us no basis
to reverse the judgment of the District Court. We do not find sufficient the
defendants' arguments that they should have the right to use Victor Moseley's first
name and that the effect of the association is de minimis. The Moseleys do not have a
right to use the word "secret" in their mark. They use it only to make the association
with the Victoria's Secret mark. We agree that the tarnishing effect of the Moseley's
mark on the senior mark is somewhat speculative, but we have no evidence to
overcome the strong inference created by the case law, the Restatement, and
Congressional dissatisfaction with the burden of proof used in this case in the
Supreme Court. The new law seems designed to protect trademarks from any
unfavorable sexual associations. Thus, any new mark with a lewd or offensive-to-
some sexual association raises a strong inference of tarnishment. The inference must
be overcome by evidence that rebuts the probability that some consumers will find

                                                    466
the new mark both offensive and harmful to the reputation and the favorable
symbolism of the famous mark.

        Our dissenting colleague, in relying on the Supreme Court treatment of the
proof in this case--for example, the long quotation from the Supreme Court
concerning the legal effect of the evidence--fails to concede what seems obvious:
Congress overruled the Supreme Court's view of the burden of proof. As quoted
above, it said, "the Moseley standard creates an undue burden for trademark
holders who contest diluting uses" It seems clear that the new Act demonstrates that
Congress intended that a court should reach a different result in this case if the
facts remain the same. We do not necessarily disagree with our dissenting colleague
that the policy followed by the Supreme Court in such cases may be better. We
simply believe that the will of Congress is to the contrary with regard to the proof in
this case and with regard to the method of allocating the burden of proof. . . .

JULIA SMITH GIBBONS, Circuit Judge, concurring.
        I fully concur in the majority opinion with the exception of one small

quibble. I would not use the term "rebuttable presumption" to describe the
inference that a new mark used to sell sex-related products is likely to tarnish a
famous mark if there is a clear semantic association between the two. Practically
speaking, what the inference is called makes little difference. I agree with the
majority opinion that the inference is a strong one and that, to counter it, some
evidence that there is no likelihood or probability of tarnishment is required. But
because we are endeavoring to interpret a new law and because the legislative history
is not explicit on the point of modification of the burden of proof, I think it best to
end our analysis by characterizing the inference as an inference.

KAREN NELSON MOORE, Circuit Judge, dissenting.
        Because I believe that Victoria's Secret has failed to produce sufficient

evidence to show that the Moseleys' use of the name "Victor's Little Secret" is likely
to tarnish the VICTORIA'S SECRET mark, I would reverse the judgment of the
district court and must respectfully dissent.

        Under the Trademark Dilution Revision Act of 2006 ("TDRA"), Victoria's
Secret is entitled to injunctive relief if the Moseleys' use of "Victor's Little Secret" as
the name of their adult-oriented novelty store "is likely to cause dilution ... by
tarnishment of the" VICTORIA'S SECRET mark. 15 U.S.C. § 1125(c)(1).
"[D]ilution by tarnishment" is defined as an "association arising from the similarity
between a mark or trade name and a famous mark that harms the reputation of the
famous mark." Id. § 1125(c)(2)(C). Thus, under the terms of the statute, to
determine whether the VICTORIA'S SECRET mark is likely to be tarnished by the
Moseleys' use, this court must inquire as to both the "association" between the two
marks and the "harm" that the association causes to the senior mark.

                                                    467
        Because I agree that there is a clear association between the two marks, the
determinative inquiry in this dilution-by-tarnishment case is whether that
association is likely to harm Victoria's Secret's reputation. See id. § 1125(c)(2)(C)
("that harms the reputation of the famous mark"). Contrary to the majority's
conclusion, however, given the record before the panel, I would hold that Victoria's
Secret has failed to meet its burden to show that the Moseleys' use of "Victor's Little
Secret" is likely to dilute Victoria's Secret's mark.2

        Victoria's Secret's evidence of tarnishment includes nothing more than the
following: (1) an affidavit from Army Colonel John E. Baker stating that he "was ...
offended by [the] defendants' use of [Victoria's Secret's] trademark to promote ...
unwholesome, tawdry merchandise," such as " `adult' novelties and gifts," and that
since his "wife ... and ... daughter ... shop at Victoria's Secret, [he] was further
dismayed by [the] defendants' effort to associate itself with, trade off on the image
of, and in fact denigrate a store frequented by members of [his] family,"; and (2) a
statement from one of Victoria's Secret's corporate officers that Victoria's Secret
strives to "maintain[ ] an image that is sexy and playful" and one that "avoid[s]
sexually explicit or graphic imagery."

        Reviewing Baker's affidavit, I believe that it is plain that Baker made a
"mental association" between "Victor's Little Secret" and "Victoria's Secret." It is
also clear that Baker held a negative impression of "Victor's Little Secret." But
despite the clear negative association of this one individual when confronted with
"Victor's Little Secret," Victoria's Secret has presented no evidence that Baker's, or
anyone else's, distaste or dislike of "Victor's Little Secret" is likely to taint their
positive opinion or perception of Victoria's Secret. Yet evidence that the junior
mark is likely to undermine or alter the positive associations of the senior mark--i.e.,
evidence that the junior mark is likely to harm the reputation of the senior mark--is
precisely the showing required under the plain language of 15 U.S.C. §
1125(c)(2)(C) to prove dilution by tarnishment. As the Second Circuit recently
noted in Starbucks Corp. v. Wolfe's Borough Coffee, Inc., 588 F.3d 97 (2d Cir.2009):

          2 I respectfully disagree with the majority's conclusion that in dilution-by-tarnishment cases involving

new marks "with lewd or offensive-to-some sexual association[s]" the TDRA establishes a presumption or

inference of tarnishment that the Moseleys must rebut. To be sure, the House Judiciary Committee Report

highlights Congress's concern with the pre-TDRA actual-dilution standard, but I do not read its concern that

the previous standard created "an undue burden" to mean that Congress envisioned a modification of the

party that bears the burden of proof as opposed to simply a lightening of the evidentiary showing. See

H.R.Rep. No. 109-23, at 5 (2005) ("Witnesses at the [ ] [legislative] hearings focused on the standard of harm

threshold articulated in Moseley [sic].... The Moseley [sic] standard creates an undue burden for trademark

holders who contest diluting uses and should be revised."). The burden to show tarnishment remains with

Victoria's Secret.

                                                    468
        That a consumer may associate a negative-sounding junior mark with a
        famous mark says little of whether the consumer views the junior mark as
        harming the reputation of the famous mark. The more relevant question, for
        purposes of tarnishment, would have been how a hypothetical coffee [with a
        negative-sounding name] would affect the positive impressions about the
        coffee sold by Starbucks.

Starbucks Corp., 588 F.3d at 110; see also J. Thomas McCarthy, 4 McCarthy on
Trademarks and Unfair Competition § 24:89 (4th ed.) [hereinafter McCarthy on
Trademarks] (discussing tarnishment claims as being premised on the notion that
"positive associations" of the senior mark will be displaced or degraded by the
negative associations of the junior mark); Restatement (Third) of Unfair
Competition § 25 cmt. g (1995) ("To prove a case of tarnishment, the prior user
must demonstrate that the subsequent use is likely to ... undermine or damage the
positive associations evoked by the mark."). In fact, when reviewing the exact same
evidentiary record, the Supreme Court explicitly noted that Victoria's Secret's offer
of proof included no evidence that "Victor's Little Secret" affected Baker's positive
impressions of Victoria's Secret:

        The record in this case establishes that an army officer ... did make the
        mental association with "Victoria's Secret," but it also shows that he did not
        therefore form any different impression of the store that his wife and daughter had
        patronized. There is a complete absence of evidence of any lessening of the
        capacity of the VICTORIA'S SECRET mark to identify and distinguish
        goods or services sold in Victoria's Secret stores or advertised in its catalogs.
        The officer was offended by the ad, but it did not change his conception of
        Victoria's Secret. His offense was directed entirely at [the Moseleys], not at
        [Victoria's Secret]. Moreover, the expert retained by respondents had nothing
        to say about the impact of [the Moseleys'] name on the strength of [Victoria's
        Secret's] mark.

Moseley, 537 U.S. at 434 (emphases added).3

          3 The majority mischaracterizes my citation to the Supreme Court's decision as evidencing a refusal

to follow the "will of Congress" and a desire to follow the pre-TDRA "policy [of the] ... Supreme Court." My

citation to the Supreme Court's decision, however, does no such thing. First, as stated previously, I believe

that the majority's conclusion that Congress intended to change which party has the burden of proof--i.e.,

the framework governing which party must put forth evidence in support of its position--as opposed to the

standard of harm--i.e., actual harm versus a likelihood of harm--is not supported by the statute or the

legislative history. In fact, the only evidence that the majority cites in support of its belief that Congress

intended to place the burden of proof on the defendant is the House Committee Report, but even that

                                                    469
        In short, Victoria's Secret has presented no probative evidence that anyone is
likely to think less of Victoria's Secret as a result of "Victor's Little Secret" and
cannot therefore prevail on its claim of dilution by tarnishment. Instead of
developing a record on remand that contains at least some evidence that Victoria's
Secret's reputation is likely to suffer because of the negative response that "Victor's
Little Secret" engendered, the record before the panel indicates only that a single
individual thinks poorly of "Victor's Little Secret." On this record, it is simply no
more probable that Victoria's Secret will suffer reputational harm as a result of the
Moseleys' use of "Victor's Little Secret" than it is probable that those who are
offended by "Victor's Little Secret" will limit their negative impressions to the
Moseleys and refrain from projecting those negative associations upon Victoria's
Secret. Baker's affidavit does nothing to contradict this conclusion, and given the
absence of any indication that his or his family's opinion of Victoria's Secret

Report undercuts the majority's argument. The full paragraph from which the majority draws its quotation
states:

          Witnesses at the[ ] [legislative] hearings focused on the standard of harm threshold articulated in
          Moseley [sic]. For example, a representative of the International Trademark Association observed that
          "[b]y the time measurable, provable damage to the mark has occurred much time has passed, the
          damage has been done, and the remedy, which is injunctive relief, is far less effective." The
          Committee endorses this position. The Moseley [sic] standard creates an undue burden for
          trademark holders who contest diluting uses and should be revised.

H.R.Rep. No. 109-23, at 5 (internal footnote omitted and emphasis added). It was the "standard of harm
threshold," i.e., the showing of actual harm that the Supreme Court employed, that was Congress's concern,
not the party bearing the burden of proof. This conclusion is supported by the hearings to which the
Committee Report refers. During those hearings, the focus of both the House Representatives and the
witnesses was whether Congress should "maintain an actual dilution standard, as the Supreme Court held in
the Victoria's Secret case," or adopt a "likelihood of dilution standard." Trademark Dilution Revision Act of
2005: Hearing Before the Subcomm. on Courts, the Internet, and Intellectual Property of the H. Comm. on the Judiciary,
109th Cong. 4 (2005) (statement of Rep. Berman); see generally id. at 1-54.

          I certainly recognize that Congress changed the law concerning dilution in response to the Supreme
Court's decision in Moseley, but the Supreme Court in Moseley said nothing about changing the party bearing
the burden of proof and neither does the amended statute. Instead, the statute explicitly states that "dilution
by tarnishment" is an "association arising from the similarity between a mark or trade name and a famous
mark that harms the reputation of the famous mark." 15 U.S.C. § 1125(c)(2)(C) (emphasis added). In concluding
that Victoria's Secret has failed to prove a likelihood of tarnishment because it has failed to present evidence
that Victor's Little Secret is likely to harm the reputation of its mark, I am doing nothing more than applying
the plain language of the statute that Congress enacted after the Supreme Court's decision. This approach
certainly reflects the "will of Congress."

                                                    470
changed following the Moseleys' use of "Victor's Little Secret," his affidavit may, in
fact, provide evidence that individuals are likely to confine their distaste to the
Moseleys. See id. ("The officer was offended by the ad, but it did not change his
conception of Victoria's Secret. His offense was directed entirely at [the Moseleys],
not at [Victoria's Secret].").

        Certainly, it is possible that the Moseleys' use of "Victor's Little Secret" to sell
adult-oriented material and other novelties could reflect poorly on the
VICTORIA'S SECRET mark and could cause Victoria's Secret to suffer damage to
its "sexy and playful" reputation, but the evidentiary standard set forth in the statute
is one of likelihood not mere possibility. Likelihood is based on probable
consequence and amounts to more than simple speculation as to what might
possibly happen. See McCarthy on Trademarks § 24:115 n. 2 (indicating that
" `likelihood' in the dilution part of the Lanham Act has the same meaning as it
does in the traditional infringement sections of the Lanham Act: as synonymous
with `probability' "); see also Parks v. LaFace Records, 329 F.3d 437, 446 (6th
Cir.2003) ("A `likelihood' means a `probability' rather than a `possibility' of
confusion."). Yet, as the majority notes, on the instant record, the "tarnishing effect
of the Moseley's mark on the senior mark" is nothing more than "speculative."

        Despite the absence of evidence, the majority is willing to assume that
Victoria's Secret has met its burden to prove the essential element of "harm to
reputation" based on the fact that numerous cases from other jurisdictions
conclude, without much inquiry, "that a famous mark is tarnished when its mark is
semantically associated with a new mark that is used to sell sex-related products." I
do not agree. Although it is true that courts have concluded that a finding of
tarnishment is likely when a mark's "likeness is placed in the context of sexual
activity, obscenity, or illegal activity," Hormel Foods Corp., 73 F.3d at 507, a court
cannot ignore the showing of reputational harm that the statute requires.4

          4 Nor can the court ignore the character of the senior mark when applying the majority's "rule."

Victoria's Secret sells women's lingerie, and, as Victoria's Secret readily admits, its own mark is already

associated with sex, albeit not with sex novelties. See ROA at 90 (Kriss Aff.) (noting that Victoria's Secret

attempts to maintain a "sexy and playful" image); see also, e.g., id. at 156-57 (depicting Victoria's Secret

advertisements for "sexy little things" lingerie, which urge customers to "[b]e bad for goodness sake[ ] [i]n

peek-a-boo's, bras and sexy Santa accessories," to "[g]ive flirty panties" as gifts, and participate in the store's

"panty fantasy," which it describes as "Very racy. Very lacy"); id. at 209 (reproducing an article in Redbook

magazine entitled "46 Things to Do to a Naked Man," which highlights Victoria's Secret's role in the sexual

activities of one of the contributors).

          In essence, the VICTORIA'S SECRET mark is not entirely separate from the sexual context within

which the junior mark, "Victor's Little Secret," operates. This fact makes the instant case unlike many of the

cases that the majority cites. Cf. Williams-Sonoma, Inc. v. Friendfinder, Inc., No. C 06-6572 JSW (MEJ), 2007 WL

                                                    471
        Even assuming that "Victor's Little Secret" is plainly unwholesome when
compared to Victoria's Secret and that this case is completely analogous to those
cases on which the majority relies, I still maintain that it is improper simply to
assume likelihood of harm to the reputation of a senior mark when dealing with a
junior mark of sexual character. As recounted above, there is no evidence
connecting Victor's Little Secret's "unwholesome" or "tawdry" sexual character to
the senior mark's reputation, and there is nothing in the language of the TDRA
that would allow the court to forgive a party's obligation present proof as to an
element of the tarnishment cause of action--i.e., the likelihood of harm to
reputation.5 See McCarthy on Trademarks § 24:115 ("Even after the 2006 revision
when only a likelihood of dilution is required, ... judges should demand persuasive
evidence that dilution is likely to occur. Even the probability of dilution should be
proven by evidence, not just by theoretical assumptions about what possibly could
occur or might happen.").

cheerleaders were portrayed in a pornographic film).

          5 The potential problem with simply assuming tarnishment when the junior mark places the senior
mark in a sexual context becomes apparent if one considers a different case. What if the holder of a sex-
related senior mark levied a claim of dilution by tarnishment against the holder of a junior mark that was
similarly associated with sex? Would the court be willing to assume without further proof that despite their
similar sexual origins the junior mark necessarily tarnishes the senior mark? Under the majority's reasoning,
such an assumption would be appropriate. This cannot be the law.

                                                    472
        With its conclusion that there is sufficient evidence of harm to the
reputation of the VICTORIA'S SECRET mark based solely on the sexual nature of
the junior mark, the majority sanctions an almost non-existent evidentiary standard
and, in the process, essentially eliminates the requirement that a plaintiff provide
some semblance of proof of likelihood of reputational harm in order to prevail on a
tarnishment claim, despite the plain language of 15 U.S.C. § 1125(c)(2). Because I
believe that Victoria's Secret has not met its burden to show that "Victor's Little
Secret" is likely to dilute the famous mark by way of tarnishment, I respectfully
dissent.

                       VIP Prods. LLC v. Jack Daniel's Props. Inc.
                         2025 WL 275909 (D. Ariz. Jan. 23, 2025)

        [One of the most important trademark cases of recent years was the litigation
involving Jack Daniel's against VIP. The latter marketed a parody dog chew toy
designed to evoke a bottle of Jack Daniel's whiskey.

        The "Bad Spaniels" toy makes several poop jokes about Jack Daniel's. Instead
of "Old No. 7 Tennessee Sour Mash Whiskey," the toy's label reads "The Old No. 2
On Your Tennessee Carpet." Likewise, the small print on the toy reads "43% poo
by vol." and "100% Smelly."

        Jack Daniel's brought infringement and dilution claims. The litigation has
moved up and down the courts for over a decade, and we will discuss the
infringement claims and the Supreme Court's treatment of them in extensive detail
in the later chapter about trademarks and free expression. This excerpt is from the

                                                    473
remand opinion that followed the Supreme Court case. It concerns the dilution by
tarnishment claim.]

Stephen M. McNamee, Senior United States District Judge
        . . . . The TDRA's final factor centers on reputational harm; that is, whether

associations with VIP's "Bad Spaniels" product "harms the reputation of the famous
mark," which, here, is Jack Daniel's trademarks and trade dress. Reputational harm
"generally arises when the plaintiff's trademark is linked to products of shoddy
quality, or is portrayed in an unwholesome or unsavory context likely to evoke
unflattering thoughts about the owner's product." Tiffany (NJ) Inc. v. eBay, Inc.,
600 F.3d 93, 111 (2d Cir. 2010) (quoting Deere & Co. v. MTD Prods., Inc., 41
F.3d 39, 43 (2d Cir. 1994)). For example, there is a strong consensus among courts
across jurisdictions that a famous mark is tarnished when it is semantically
associated with a new mark that uses the famous mark to sell sex-related products.
See V Secret, 605 F.3d at 388 (collecting cases).

        A trademark may also be tarnished if the mark loses its ability to serve as a
"wholesome identifier" of the plaintiff's product. . . .

        Regarding reputational harm, the parties opted to present evidence in the
form of expert testimony. . . .

        Findings as to Dr. Itamar Simonson
        Jack Daniel's engaged Dr. Itamar Simonson, a Professor of Marketing at
Stanford University. Dr. Simonson, relying on consumer psychology research,
concluded that VIP's introduction of "Bad Spaniels" into the marketplace resulted
in reputational harm to Jack Daniel's trademarks and trade dress. Dr. Simonson has
served as an expert witness on numerous occasions, providing testimony on issues
related to marketing, consumer behavior, trademark-related matters, false
advertising, and branding. Dr. Simonson has conducted, supervised, or evaluated
over 1,000 marketing research studies. Such studies related to consumer behavior,
consumer information processing, brand equity, trademarks, branding, marketing
strategies, and advertising.
        Dr. Simonson's opinions as to this matter are supported by empirical studies
evaluating two stages of establishing a likelihood of dilution by tarnishment. First,
whether the allegedly dilution product will bring or call to mind the allegedly
diluted mark, and second, assuming that the allegedly diluting product does call to
mind the allegedly diluted mark, whether it has affected the brand equity and brand
association of the allegedly diluted mark. Dr. Simonson concluded that the first
stage was satisfied because the point of VIP's product was to bring Jack Daniel's
whiskey to mind. Consumer psychology research utilized to evaluate the second
stage was based on numerous empirical studies. The Court credits that the studies
relied upon by Dr. Simonson support certain conclusions that apply to all products

                                                    474
and services regarding the impact of adding a negative association onto the
association of the existing brand.

        The Associative Network Model ("ANM") has been empirically tested and
verified numerous times since the 1970's. Regarding application of the ANM, the
Court credits Dr. Simonson's conclusion that when consumers are evaluating
brands, certain mental associations come to mind. In accordance with the ANM
and based upon Dr. Simonson's review of Jack Daniel's commercials and
advertisements, Dr Simonson's understanding about Jack Daniel's brand, and the
key messages Jack Daniel's communicates regarding its brand values--namely
authenticity, integrity, independence, and loyalty--the Court credits Dr. Simonson's
testimony of documented positive mental associations that come to mind when
evaluating Jack Daniel's before VIP introduced the "Bad Spaniels" dog toy. The
Court credits Dr. Simonson's conclusion regarding the effects of "Bad Spaniels"
and the negative mental associations that arise when defecation, feces, and poo are
included among the associations of customers evaluating Jack Daniel's whiskey.

        Dr. Simonson relied on consumer psychology research to establish that when
food or beverage is associated with defecation, disgust is generated in the
consumer's mind with respect to that food or beverage which has been associated
with defecation. Well-documented empirical research supports that the negative
associations of "Old No. 2," referring to defecation, and "poo by weight" would
create disgust in the mind of the consumer evaluates Jack Daniel's whiskey.

        Dr. Simonson relied on consumer psychology research in his evaluation of
the second stage of the likelihood of dilution by tarnishment. Based on the ANM,
the Court credits Dr. Simonson's conclusion that the "Bad Spaniels" product is
likely to tarnish Jack Daniel's trademarks and trade dress by creating negative
associations, either consciously or unconsciously, and undermining the pre-existing
positive associations with Jack Daniel's whiskey. The Court credits Dr. Simonson's
conclusion that such negative associations are particularly harmful for a company
such as Jack Daniel's because the goods it offers for sale involve human
consumption and human consumption and canine excrement do not mix. Further,
the Court credits Dr. Simonson's conclusion that such associations are particularly
harmful to Jack Daniel's because Jack Daniel's brand name along with its equity is a
very important asset.

        Findings as to Mr. Bruce Silverman
        VIP engaged Mr. Bruce Silverman, an advertising, marketing, and branding
consultant for the past 40 to 50 years, to rebut the opinion and findings of Dr.
Simonson. Mr. Silverman has worked with companies that manufacture or produce
goods or services in addition to his primary work with advertising and public
relations agencies. In West Los Angeles, Mr. Silverman arranged four focus groups
to test consumer reactions to "Bad Spaniels." Mr. Silverman concluded that the

                                                    475
focus groups had an overall favorable impression of Jack Daniel's upon discussion
of VIP's "Bad Spaniels" dog toy.

        The Court finds that Mr. Silverman's reliance on the West Los Angeles focus
groups is flawed because the groups were initially directed by the moderator that the
product under evaluation, "Bad Spaniels," was a spoof product and as a result the
focus groups produced predetermined results. In other words, the moderator's
biased presentation of the products tainted the groups' conclusions. Moreover, Mr.
Silverman did not have expertise or specialized knowledge in trademark dilution
matters; rather, his experience was in advertising.

        Here, the Court credits and gives prevailing weight to Dr. Simonson's
specialized knowledge and specific expertise in consumer psychology to evaluate and
conclude that there is a likelihood of a tarnishing effect of the "Bad Spaniels" dog
toy upon Jack Daniel's trademarks and trade dress. . . .

        The Court also rejects VIP's argument that "Bad Spaniels" does not tarnish
Jack Daniel's trademarks and trade dress because poop jokes are innocuous in
comparison to sex and drug associations. While it is true, as VIP argues, that courts
have generally found tarnishment in such instances--the Sixth Circuit in Moseley II
even recognized a presumption of tarnishment when a junior user's mark is used to
sell sex-related products--the antidilution statute does not dictate that tarnishment
may only occur via association with sex and drugs. . . . Courts may find tarnishment
if there is a likelihood that the plaintiff's mark will suffer negative associations with
an inferior product. Because Jack Daniel's produces a product intended for human
consumption, association of Jack Daniel's marks with something like dog feces is
particularly detrimental.

        While it is obviously true that "Bad Spaniels" does not actually contain dog
feces and consumers would not believe that it does, the fact remains that "Bad
Spaniels" creates an association between dog feces and Jack Daniel's by way of
referencing dog feces in substitution for Jack Daniel's listed qualities. VIP's use of
"The Old No. 2 on your Tennessee carpet" in place of "Old No. 7 Tennessee Sour
Mash Whiskey," together with VIP's replacement of "40% alcohol by vol. (80
proof)" with "43% poo by vol." and "100% smelly" create unsavory associations that
denigrate Jack Daniel's marks and undermine the positive associations that Jack
Daniel's has taken considerable expense to create. . . .

                                 296 F.3d 894 (9th Cir. 2002)

KOZINSKI, Circuit Judge:
        If this were a sci-fi melodrama, it might be called Speech-Zilla meets

Trademark Kong. . . .
        Barbie was born in Germany in the 1950s as an adult collector's item. Over

the years, Mattel transformed her from a doll that resembled a "German street
walker,"1 as she originally appeared, into a glamorous, long-legged blonde. Barbie
has been labeled both the ideal American woman and a bimbo. She has survived
attacks both psychic (from feminists critical of her fictitious figure) and physical
(more than 500 professional makeovers). She remains a symbol of American
girlhood, a public figure who graces the aisles of toy stores throughout the country
and beyond. With Barbie, Mattel created not just a toy but a cultural icon.

        With fame often comes unwanted attention. Aqua is a Danish band that has,
as yet, only dreamed of attaining Barbie-like status. In 1997, Aqua produced the
song Barbie Girl on the album Aquarium. In the song, one bandmember
impersonates Barbie, singing in a high-pitched, doll-like voice; another
bandmember, calling himself Ken, entices Barbie to "go party." (The lyrics are in the
Appendix.) Barbie Girl singles sold well and, to Mattel's dismay, the song made it
onto Top 40 music charts.

        Mattel brought this lawsuit against the music companies who produced,
marketed and sold Barbie Girl: MCA Records, Inc., Universal Music International
Ltd., Universal Music A/S, Universal Music & Video Distribution, Inc. and MCA
Music Scandinavia AB (collectively, "MCA"). MCA in turn challenged the district
court's jurisdiction under the Lanham Act and its personal jurisdiction over the
foreign defendants, Universal Music International Ltd., Universal Music A/S and
MCA Music Scandinavia AB (hereinafter "foreign defendants"); MCA also brought
a defamation claim against Mattel for statements Mattel made about MCA while
this lawsuit was pending. The district court concluded it had jurisdiction over the
foreign defendants and under the Lanham Act, and granted MCA's motion for
summary judgment on Mattel's federal and state-law claims for trademark
infringement and dilution. The district court also granted Mattel's motion for
summary judgment on MCA's defamation claim. . . .

        Mattel separately argues that, under the Federal Trademark Dilution Act
("FTDA"), MCA's song dilutes the Barbie mark in two ways: It diminishes the

          1 M.G. Lord, FOREVER BARBIE: THE UNAUTHORIZED BIOGRAPHY OF A REAL DOLL 32 (1994).

                                                    477
mark's capacity to identify and distinguish Mattel products, and tarnishes the mark
because the song is inappropriate for young girls.

        "Dilution" refers to the "whittling away of the value of a trademark" when
it's used to identify different products. 4 J. Thomas McCarthy, McCarthy on
Trademarks and Unfair Competition § 24.67, at 24-120; § 24.70, at 24-122 (2001).
For example, Tylenol snowboards, Netscape sex shops and Harry Potter dry cleaners
would all weaken the "commercial magnetism" of these marks and diminish their
ability to evoke their original associations. Ralph S. Brown, Jr., Advertising and the
Public Interest: Legal Protection of Trade Symbols, 57 Yale L.J. 1165, 1187 (1948),
reprinted in 108 Yale L.J. 1619 (1999). These uses dilute the selling power of these
trademarks by blurring their "uniqueness and singularity," Frank I. Schechter, The
Rational Basis of Trademark Protection, 40 Harv. L.Rev. 813, 831 (1927), and/or by
tarnishing them with negative associations.

        By contrast to trademark infringement, the injury from dilution usually
occurs when consumers aren't confused about the source of a product: Even if no
one suspects that the maker of analgesics has entered into the snowboard business,
the Tylenol mark will now bring to mind two products, not one. Whereas
trademark law targets "interference with the source signaling function" of
trademarks, dilution protects owners "from an appropriation of or free riding on"
the substantial investment that they have made in their marks. I.P. Lund Trading ApS
v. Kohler Co., 163 F.3d 27, 50 (1st Cir.1998).

        Originally a creature of state law, dilution received nationwide recognition in
1996 when Congress amended the Lanham Act by enacting the FTDA.3 . . .
Dilutive uses are prohibited unless they fall within one of the . . . statutory
exemptions discussed below. . . . Barbie easily qualifies under the FTDA as a famous
and distinctive mark, and reached this status long before MCA began to market the
Barbie Girl song. The commercial success of Barbie Girl establishes beyond dispute
that the Barbie mark satisfies each of these elements.

        We are also satisfied that the song amounts to a "commercial use in
commerce." Although this statutory language is ungainly, its meaning seems clear: It
refers to a use of a famous and distinctive mark to sell goods other than those
produced or authorized by the mark's owner. That is precisely what MCA did with
the Barbie mark: It created and sold to consumers in the marketplace commercial

          3 Even at the state level, dilution is of relatively recent vintage. The first anti-dilution statute was

enacted in Massachusetts in 1947, see Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. Ch. 110B, § 12 (West 1992). By the time the

FTDA was enacted in 1996, only twenty-six states had anti-dilution statutes on the books. See 4 McCarthy §

24:80, at 24-136.2 n. 2; H.R.Rep. No. 104-374, at 3-4 (1995), reprinted in 1995 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1029,

1030-31.

                                                    478
products (the Barbie Girl single and the Aquarium album) that bear the Barbie
mark.

        MCA's use of the mark is dilutive. MCA does not dispute that, while a
reference to Barbie would previously have brought to mind only Mattel's doll, after
the song's popular success, some consumers hearing Barbie's name will think of
both the doll and the song, or perhaps of the song only. This is a classic blurring
injury and is in no way diminished by the fact that the song itself refers back to
Barbie the doll. To be dilutive, use of the mark need not bring to mind the junior
user alone. The distinctiveness of the mark is diminished if the mark no longer
brings to mind the senior user alone.5

        [The court then turned to the statutory exemption for noncommercial uses.]
        A "noncommercial use" exemption, on its face, presents a bit of a
conundrum because it seems at odds with the earlier requirement that the junior
use be a "commercial use in commerce." If a use has to be commercial in order to
be dilutive, how then can it also be noncommercial so as to satisfy the exception of
section 1125(c)(4)(B)? If the term "commercial use" had the same meaning in both
provisions, this would eliminate one of the three statutory exemptions defined by
this subsection, because any use found to be dilutive would, of necessity, not be
noncommercial.
        Such a reading of the statute would also create a constitutional problem,
because it would leave the FTDA with no First Amendment protection for dilutive
speech other than comparative advertising and news reporting. This would be a
serious problem because the primary (usually exclusive) remedy for dilution is an
injunction.6 As noted above, tension with the First Amendment also exists in the
trademark context, especially where the mark has assumed an expressive function
beyond mere identification of a product or service. These concerns apply with
greater force in the dilution context because dilution lacks two very significant
limitations that reduce the tension between trademark law and the First
Amendment.
        First, depending on the strength and distinctiveness of the mark, trademark
law grants relief only against uses that are likely to confuse. A trademark injunction
is usually limited to uses within one industry or several related industries. Dilution
law is the antithesis of trademark law in this respect, because it seeks to protect the
mark from association in the public's mind with wholly unrelated goods and

          5 Because we find blurring, we need not consider whether the song also tarnished the Barbie mark.

          6 The FTDA provides for both injunctive relief and damages, but the latter is only available if

plaintiff can prove a willful intent to dilute. 15 U.S.C. § 1125(c)(2).

                                                    479
services. The more remote the good or service associated with the junior use, the
more likely it is to cause dilution rather than trademark infringement. A dilution
injunction, by contrast to a trademark injunction, will generally sweep across broad
vistas of the economy.

        Second, a trademark injunction, even a very broad one, is premised on the
need to prevent consumer confusion. This consumer protection rationale--averting
what is essentially a fraud on the consuming public--is wholly consistent with the
theory of the First Amendment, which does not protect commercial fraud. Cent.
Hudson Gas & Elec. v. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 447 U.S. 557, 566 (1980); see Thompson v.
W. States Med. Ctr., 535 U.S. 357 (2002) (applying Central Hudson). Moreover,
avoiding harm to consumers is an important interest that is independent of the
senior user's interest in protecting its business.

        Dilution, by contrast, does not require a showing of consumer confusion, 15
U.S.C. § 1127, and dilution injunctions therefore lack the built-in First
Amendment compass of trademark injunctions. In addition, dilution law protects
only the distinctiveness of the mark, which is inherently less weighty than the dual
interest of protecting trademark owners and avoiding harm to consumers that is at
the heart of every trademark claim.

        Fortunately, the legislative history of the FTDA suggests an interpretation of
the "noncommercial use" exemption that both solves our interpretive dilemma and
diminishes some First Amendment concerns: "Noncommercial use" refers to a use
that consists entirely of noncommercial, or fully constitutionally protected, speech.
See 2 Jerome Gilson et al., Trademark Protection and Practice § 5.12[1][c][vi], at 5-240
(this exemption "is intended to prevent the courts from enjoining speech that has
been recognized to be [fully] constitutionally protected," "such as parodies"). Where,
as here, a statute's plain meaning "produces an absurd, and perhaps
unconstitutional, result[, it is] entirely appropriate to consult all public materials,
including the background of [the statute] and the legislative history of its adoption."
Green v. Bock Laundry Mach. Co., 490 U.S. 504, 527 (1989) (Scalia, J., concurring).

        The legislative history bearing on this issue is particularly persuasive. First,
the FTDA's sponsors in both the House and the Senate were aware of the potential
collision with the First Amendment if the statute authorized injunctions against
protected speech. Upon introducing the counterpart bills, sponsors in each house
explained that the proposed law "will not prohibit or threaten noncommercial
expression, such as parody, satire, editorial and other forms of expression that are
not a part of a commercial transaction." 141 Cong. Rec. S19306-10, S19310 (daily
ed. Dec. 29, 1995) (statement of Sen. Hatch); 141 Cong. Rec. H14317-01, H14318
(daily ed. Dec. 12, 1995) (statement of Rep. Moorhead). The House Judiciary
Committee agreed in its report on the FTDA. H.R.Rep. No. 104-374, at 4 (1995),

                                                    480
reprinted in 1995 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1029, 1031 ("The bill will not prohibit or threaten
`noncommercial' expression, as that term has been defined by the courts.").7

        The FTDA's section-by-section analysis presented in the House and Senate
suggests that the bill's sponsors relied on the "noncommercial use" exemption to
allay First Amendment concerns. H.R. Rep. No. 104-374, at 8, reprinted in 1995
U.S.C.C.A.N. 1029, 1035 (the exemption "expressly incorporates the concept of
`commercial' speech from the `commercial speech' doctrine, and proscribes dilution
actions that seek to enjoin use of famous marks in `non-commercial' uses (such as
consumer product reviews)"); 141 Cong. Rec. S19306-10, S19311 (daily ed. Dec.
29, 1995) (the exemption "is consistent with existing case law[, which] recognize[s]
that the use of marks in certain forms of artistic and expressive speech is protected
by the First Amendment"). At the request of one of the bill's sponsors, the section-
by-section analysis was printed in the Congressional Record. 141 Cong. Rec.
S19306-10, S19311 (daily ed. Dec. 29, 1995). Thus, we know that this
interpretation of the exemption was before the Senate when the FTDA was passed,
and that no senator rose to dispute it.

        To determine whether Barbie Girl falls within this exemption, we look to
our definition of commercial speech under our First Amendment caselaw. See
H.R.Rep. No. 104-374, at 8, reprinted in 1995 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1029, 1035 (the
exemption "expressly incorporates the concept of `commercial' speech from the
`commercial speech' doctrine"); 141 Cong. Rec. S19306-10, S19311 (daily ed. Dec.
29, 1995) (the exemption "is consistent with existing [First Amendment] case law").
"Although the boundary between commercial and noncommercial speech has yet to
be clearly delineated, the `core notion of commercial speech' is that it `does no more
than propose a commercial transaction.' " Hoffman v. Capital Cities/ABC, Inc., 255
F.3d 1180, 1184 (9th Cir.2001) (quoting Bolger v. Youngs Drug Prod's Corp., 463 U.S.
60, 66 (1983)). If speech is not "purely commercial"--that is, if it does more than
propose a commercial transaction--then it is entitled to full First Amendment
protection. Id. at 1185-86 (internal quotation marks omitted).

        In Hoffman, a magazine published an article featuring digitally altered images
from famous films. Computer artists modified shots of Dustin Hoffman, Cary
Grant, Marilyn Monroe and others to put the actors in famous designers' spring

          7 Our interpretation of the noncommercial use exemption does not eliminate all tension between

the FTDA and the First Amendment because the exemption does not apply to commercial speech, which

enjoys "qualified but nonetheless substantial protection." Bolger v. Youngs Drug Prod's Corp., 463 U.S. 60,

68 (1983) (applying Central Hudson Gas & Electric Corp. v. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 447 U.S. 557 (1980)). It is

entirely possible that a dilution injunction against purely commercial speech would run afoul of the First

Amendment. Because that question is not presented here, we do not address it.

                                                    481
fashions; a still of Hoffman from the movie "Tootsie" was altered so that he
appeared to be wearing a Richard Tyler evening gown and Ralph Lauren heels.
Hoffman, who had not given permission, sued under the Lanham Act and for
violation of his right to publicity.

        The article featuring the altered image clearly served a commercial purpose:
"to draw attention to the for-profit magazine in which it appear[ed]" and to sell
more copies. Nevertheless, we held that the article was fully protected under the
First Amendment because it included protected expression: "humor" and "visual
and verbal editorial comment on classic films and famous actors." Because its
commercial purpose was "inextricably entwined with [these] expressive elements,"
the article and accompanying photographs enjoyed full First Amendment
protection.

        Hoffman controls: Barbie Girl is not purely commercial speech, and is
therefore fully protected. To be sure, MCA used Barbie's name to sell copies of the
song. However, as we've already observed, the song also lampoons the Barbie image
and comments humorously on the cultural values Aqua claims she represents. Use
of the Barbie mark in the song Barbie Girl therefore falls within the noncommercial
use exemption to the FTDA. For precisely the same reasons, use of the mark in the
song's title is also exempted. . . .

        After Mattel filed suit, Mattel and MCA employees traded barbs in the press.
When an MCA spokeswoman noted that each album included a disclaimer saying
that Barbie Girl was a "social commentary [that was] not created or approved by the
makers of the doll," a Mattel representative responded by saying, "That's
unacceptable.... It's akin to a bank robber handing a note of apology to a teller
during a heist. [It n]either diminishes the severity of the crime, nor does it make it
legal." He later characterized the song as a "theft" of "another company's property."

        MCA filed a counterclaim for defamation based on the Mattel
representative's use of the words "bank robber," "heist," "crime" and "theft." But all
of these are variants of the invective most often hurled at accused infringers, namely
"piracy." No one hearing this accusation understands intellectual property owners
to be saying that infringers are nautical cutthroats with eyepatches and peg legs who
board galleons to plunder cargo. In context, all these terms are nonactionable
"rhetorical hyperbole," Gilbrook v. City of Westminster, 177 F.3d 839, 863 (9th
Cir.1999). The parties are advised to chill.

        AFFIRMED.

        Defenses. The case was decided under older language of the dilution statute.
Today, the statute provides for the following defenses:

        (3) Exclusions The following shall not be actionable as dilution by blurring
        or dilution by tarnishment under this subsection:

                (A) Any fair use, including a nominative or descriptive fair use, or
                facilitation of such fair use, of a famous mark by another person other
                than as a designation of source for the person's own goods or services,
                including use in connection with--

                         (i) advertising or promotion that permits consumers to
                         compare goods or services; or
                         (ii) identifying and parodying, criticizing, or commenting upon
                         the famous mark owner or the goods or services of the famous
                         mark owner.
                (B) All forms of news reporting and news commentary.
                (C) Any noncommercial use of a mark.
15 U.S.C. § 1125(c)(3).

                                                    484
        Caution about "noncommercial uses." In 2023, the Supreme Court narrowed
the scope of the noncommercial use exception in Jack Daniel's Properties, Inc. v. VIP
Products LLC, 599 U.S. 140 (2023). Though it reserved the question of the ambit of
the exception, it ruled that it cannot apply if the challenged use is as a mark, that is,
as a source-identifying use. The Court's logic concerned the operation of the "fair
use" defense. Its reasoning will be easier to track once we study trademark fair use,
which is the subject of the next chapter. The Jack Daniel's opinion will be discussed
in much greater detail in chapter 24.

        Did Mattel know its own best interests? Years later Mattel licensed the song from
Aqua and used it to promote Barbie products. As reported by the Wall Street Journal:

        Fast forward to 2009, the year of Barbie's 50th birthday. During February's
        New York fashion shows, the Barbie runway show was among the hottest
        fashion week tickets, and the show's exuberance was memorable among a
        season of mostly somber presentations. The pumping Barbie runway
        soundtrack, included ELO, Madonna and... Aqua. In fact, Aqua closed out
        the final runway strut as pink heart confetti rained down on guests.
        It was no fluke. "There's nothing more iconic than that song," Barbie Senior
        Vice President of Marketing, Stephanie Cota says. "Yes, there's an interesting
        history with Mattel and Aqua. But one of the things that's great about Barbie
        is that she's had 50 years to figure herself out. "
        The song "is such the epitome of Barbie. It's a fun, kicky upbeat song," she
        added. "We've re-written the lyrics ever so slightly. There's a bit of girl
        empowerment that gets infused in there."

21. Fair Use

Problem

        Philippa Donahue is a motivational speaker offering services under the
OWN YOUR POWER mark, which has received a registration. She has learned
that an issue of O (Oprah Winfrey's magazine) used the words "Own Your Power"
on its front cover in an issue that had several articles built around the concept of
tapping one's inner abilities. In addition, the magazine hosted a similarly themed
"Own Your Power" event. Images from the event were hosted on Winfrey's website:

        If Donahue can prove a likelihood of confusion, may Winfrey assert any fair
use defenses?

"Classic" Fair Use

                  Section 33(b) of the Lanham Act (15 U.S.C. § 1115)
        [providing that an incontestable mark] "shall be subject to the following
        defenses or defects . . .
        (4) That the use of the name, term, or device charged to be an infringement
        is a use, otherwise than as a mark, of the party's individual name in his own
        business, or of the individual name of anyone in privity with such party, or
        of a term or device which is descriptive of and used fairly and in good faith

                                                    486
        only to describe the goods or services of such party, or their geographic
        origin"

        The "classic" fair use defense is a long recognized one in trademark law (as
evidenced by its explicit incorporation into the Lanham Act). Recall the Zatarain's
case we read near the beginning of the course. As you will recall, the court held that
the plaintiff's FISH-FRI mark had obtained secondary meaning necessary for
trademark protection. But winning protection was a pyrrhic victory for the
trademark holder, as the court explained:

        Zatarain's term "Fish-Fri" is a descriptive term that has acquired a secondary
        meaning in the New Orleans area. Although the trademark is valid by virtue
        of having acquired a secondary meaning, only that penumbra or fringe of
        secondary meaning is given legal protection. Zatarain's has no legal claim to
        an exclusive right in the original, descriptive sense of the term; therefore,
        Oak Grove and Visko's are still free to use the words "fish fry" in their
        ordinary, descriptive sense, so long as such use will not tend to confuse
        customers as to the source of the goods.

        The record contains ample evidence to support the district court's
        determination that Oak Grove's and Visko's use of the words "fish fry" was
        fair and in good faith. Testimony at trial indicated that the appellees did not
        intend to use the term in a trademark sense and had never attempted to
        register the words as a trademark. Oak Grove and Visko's apparently
        believed "fish fry" was a generic name for the type of coating mix they
        manufactured. In addition, Oak Grove and Visko's consciously packaged
        and labelled their products in such a way as to minimize any potential
        confusion in the minds of consumers. The dissimilar trade dress of these
        products prompted the district court to observe that confusion at the point
        of purchase--the grocery shelves--would be virtually impossible. Our review
        of the record convinces us that the district court's determinations are correct.
        We hold, therefore, that Oak Grove and Visko's are entitled to fair use of
        the term "fish fry" to describe their products; accordingly, Zatarain's claim of
        trademark infringement must fail.

        Is the defendants' fair use a defense? Or does it simply mean that the
plaintiff did not prove its case? In other words, do we say that the plaintiff loses
regardless of whether there was a likelihood of confusion because of the fair use? Or
do we say that the plaintiff loses because there was no likelihood of confusion as
evidenced by the fair use? The Supreme Court considered the issue in KP Permanent
Make-Up.

                                                    487
              KP Permanent Make-Up, Inc. v. Lasting Impression I, Inc.
                                      543 U.S. 111 (2004)

Justice SOUTER delivered the opinion of the Court.
        The question here is whether a party raising the statutory affirmative defense

of fair use to a claim of trademark infringement, 15 U.S.C. § 1115(b)(4), has a
burden to negate any likelihood that the practice complained of will confuse
consumers about the origin of the goods or services affected. We hold it does not.

        [The case involved competing makers of permanent makeup over the right to
use the term "micro color." Lasting Impression had an incontestable registration for
"Micro Colors" and claimed KP Permanent infringed it by producing an advertising
brochure with the term in a large typeface. In the ensuing litigation, the district
court concluded that KP had established fair use. The Ninth Circuit held that the
district court erred because it had not determined whether KP's use was likely to
cause confusion. ("Therefore, KP can only benefit from the fair use defense if there
is no likelihood of confusion between KP's use of the term `micro color' and
Lasting's mark").]

        We granted KP's petition for certiorari to address a disagreement among the
Courts of Appeals on the significance of likely confusion for a fair use defense to a
trademark infringement claim, and the obligation of a party defending on that
ground to show that its use is unlikely to cause consumer confusion. . . .

                                                 II
                                                 A
        . . . . Although an incontestable registration is "conclusive evidence ... of the
registrant's exclusive right to use the ... mark in commerce," § 1115(b), the
plaintiff's success is still subject to "proof of infringement as defined in section
1114," ibid. And that, as just noted, requires a showing that the defendant's actual
practice is likely to produce confusion in the minds of consumers about the origin
of the goods or services in question. This plaintiff's burden has to be kept in mind
when reading the relevant portion of the further provision for an affirmative
defense of fair use, available to a party whose
        "use of the name, term, or device charged to be an infringement is a use,
        otherwise than as a mark, ... of a term or device which is descriptive of and
        used fairly and in good faith only to describe the goods or services of such
        party, or their geographic origin ...." § 1115(b)(4).

        Two points are evident. Section 1115(b) places a burden of proving
likelihood of confusion (that is, infringement) on the party charging infringement
even when relying on an incontestable registration. And Congress said nothing

                                                    488
about likelihood of confusion in setting out the elements of the fair use defense in §
1115(b)(4).

        Starting from these textual fixed points, it takes a long stretch to claim that a
defense of fair use entails any burden to negate confusion. It is just not plausible
that Congress would have used the descriptive phrase "likely to cause confusion, or
to cause mistake, or to deceive" in § 1114 to describe the requirement that a
markholder show likelihood of consumer confusion, but would have relied on the
phrase "used fairly" in § 1115(b)(4) in a fit of terse drafting meant to place a
defendant under a burden to negate confusion. " `[W]here Congress includes
particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the
same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in
the disparate inclusion or exclusion.' " Russello v. United States, 464 U.S. 16, 23
(1983) (quoting United States v. Wong Kim Bo, 472 F.2d 720, 722 (C.A.5 1972);
alteration in original).4

        Nor do we find much force in Lasting's suggestion that "used fairly" in §
1115(b)(4) is an oblique incorporation of a likelihood-of-confusion test developed in
the common law of unfair competition. Lasting is certainly correct that some unfair
competition cases would stress that use of a term by another in conducting its trade
went too far in sowing confusion, and would either enjoin the use or order the
defendant to include a disclaimer. See, e.g., Baglin v. Cusenier Co., 221 U.S. 580, 602
(1911) ("[W]e are unable to escape the conclusion that such use, in the manner
shown, was to serve the purpose of simulation ..."); Herring-Hall-Marvin Safe Co. v.
Hall's Safe Co., 208 U.S. 554, 559 (1908) ("[T]he rights of the two parties have been
reconciled by allowing the use, provided that an explanation is attached"). But the
common law of unfair competition also tolerated some degree of confusion from a
descriptive use of words contained in another person's trademark. See, e.g., William
R. Warner & Co. v. Eli Lilly & Co., 265 U.S. 526, 528 (1924) (as to plaintiff's
trademark claim, "[t]he use of a similar name by another to truthfully describe his
own product does not constitute a legal or moral wrong, even if its effect be to cause
the public to mistake the origin or ownership of the product"); Canal Co. v. Clark,
13 Wall. 311, 327 (1872) ("Purchasers may be mistaken, but they are not deceived
by false representations, and equity will not enjoin against telling the truth"); see
also 3 L. Altman, Callmann on Unfair Competition, Trademarks and Monopolies §
18:2, pp. 18-8 to 18-9, n. 1 (4th ed.2004) (citing cases). While these cases are

          4 Not only that, but the failure to say anything about a defendant's burden on this point was almost

certainly not an oversight, not after the House Subcommittee on Trademarks declined to forward a proposal

to provide expressly as an element of the defense that a descriptive use be " `[un]likely to deceive the public.' "

Hearings on H.R. 102 et al. before the Subcommittee on Trade-Marks of the House Committee on Patents,

77th Cong., 1st Sess., 167-168 (1941) (hereinafter Hearings) (testimony of Prof. Milton Handler).

                                                    489
consistent with taking account of the likelihood of consumer confusion as one
consideration in deciding whether a use is fair, see Part II-B, infra, they do not stand
for the proposition that an assessment of confusion alone may be dispositive.
Certainly one cannot get out of them any defense burden to negate it entirely.

        Finally, a look at the typical course of litigation in an infringement action
points up the incoherence of placing a burden to show nonconfusion on a
defendant. If a plaintiff succeeds in making out a prima facie case of trademark
infringement, including the element of likelihood of consumer confusion, the
defendant may offer rebutting evidence to undercut the force of the plaintiff's
evidence on this (or any) element, or raise an affirmative defense to bar relief even if
the prima facie case is sound, or do both. But it would make no sense to give the
defendant a defense of showing affirmatively that the plaintiff cannot succeed in
proving some element (like confusion); all the defendant needs to do is to leave the
factfinder unpersuaded that the plaintiff has carried its own burden on that point.
A defendant has no need of a court's true belief when agnosticism will do. Put
another way, it is only when a plaintiff has shown likely confusion by a
preponderance of the evidence that a defendant could have any need of an
affirmative defense, but under Lasting's theory the defense would be foreclosed in
such a case. "[I]t defies logic to argue that a defense may not be asserted in the only
situation where it even becomes relevant." Shakespeare Co. v. Silstar Corp., 110 F.3d,
at 243. Nor would it make sense to provide an affirmative defense of no confusion
plus good faith, when merely rebutting the plaintiff's case on confusion would
entitle the defendant to judgment, good faith or not. . . .

                                                 B
        Since the burden of proving likelihood of confusion rests with the plaintiff,
and the fair use defendant has no free-standing need to show confusion unlikely, it
follows (contrary to the Court of Appeals's view) that some possibility of consumer
confusion must be compatible with fair use, and so it is. The common law's
tolerance of a certain degree of confusion on the part of consumers followed from
the very fact that in cases like this one an originally descriptive term was selected to
be used as a mark, not to mention the undesirability of allowing anyone to obtain a
complete monopoly on use of a descriptive term simply by grabbing it first. The
Lanham Act adopts a similar leniency, there being no indication that the statute was
meant to deprive commercial speakers of the ordinary utility of descriptive words.
"If any confusion results, that is a risk the plaintiff accepted when it decided to
identify its product with a mark that uses a well known descriptive phrase."
Cosmetically Sealed Industries, Inc. v. Chesebrough-Pond's USA Co., 125 F.3d, at 30. See
also Park `N Fly, Inc. v. Dollar Park and Fly, Inc., 469 U.S. 189, 201 (1985) (noting
safeguards in Lanham Act to prevent commercial monopolization of language); Car-
Freshner Corp. v. S.C. Johnson & Son, Inc., 70 F.3d 267, 269 (C.A.2 1995) (noting

                                                    490
importance of "protect[ing] the right of society at large to use words or images in
their primary descriptive sense").5 This right to describe is the reason that
descriptive terms qualify for registration as trademarks only after taking on
secondary meaning as "distinctive of the applicant's goods," 15 U.S.C. § 1052(f),
with the registrant getting an exclusive right not in the original, descriptive sense,
but only in the secondary one associated with the markholder's goods, 2 McCarthy,
supra, § 11:45 ("The only aspect of the mark which is given legal protection is that
penumbra or fringe of secondary meaning which surrounds the old descriptive
word").

        While we thus recognize that mere risk of confusion will not rule out fair
use, we think it would be improvident to go further in this case, for deciding
anything more would take us beyond the Ninth Circuit's consideration of the
subject. It suffices to realize that our holding that fair use can occur along with some
degree of confusion does not foreclose the relevance of the extent of any likely
consumer confusion in assessing whether a defendant's use is objectively fair. Two
Courts of Appeals have found it relevant to consider such scope, and commentators
and amici here have urged us to say that the degree of likely consumer confusion
bears not only on the fairness of using a term, but even on the further question
whether an originally descriptive term has become so identified as a mark that a
defendant's use of it cannot realistically be called descriptive. See Shakespeare Co. v.
Silstar Corp., 110 F.3d, at 243 ("[T]o the degree that confusion is likely, a use is less
likely to be found fair ..." (emphasis deleted)); Sunmark, Inc. v. Ocean Spray
Cranberries, Inc., 64 F.3d, at 1059; Restatement § 28; Brief for American Intellectual
Property Law Association as Amicus Curiae 13-18; Brief for Private Label
Manufacturers Association as Amicus Curiae 16-17; Brief for Society of Permanent
Cosmetic Professionals et al. as Amici Curiae 8-11.

        Since we do not rule out the pertinence of the degree of consumer confusion
under the fair use defense, we likewise do not pass upon the position of the United
States, as amicus, that the "used fairly" requirement in § 1115(b)(4) demands only
that the descriptive term describe the goods accurately. Tr. of Oral Arg. 17.
Accuracy of course has to be a consideration in assessing fair use, but the
proceedings in this case so far raise no occasion to evaluate some other concerns
that courts might pick as relevant, quite apart from attention to confusion. The
Restatement raises possibilities like commercial justification and the strength of the
plaintiff's mark. Restatement § 28. As to them, it is enough to say here that the
door is not closed....

          5 See also Hearings 72 (testimony of Wallace Martin, Chairman, American Bar Association

Committee on Trade-Mark Legislation) ("Everybody has got a right to the use of the English language and has

got a right to assume that nobody is going to take that English language away from him").

                                              Notes

        Not so clear. As you may have noticed, the defendant's victory was hardly
unqualified. The Court left open the possibility that the presence of likely
confusion might affect the merits of whether a use is fair. 543 U.S. at 123 ("It
suffices to realize that our holding that fair use can occur along with some degree of
confusion does not foreclose the relevance of the extent of any likely consumer
confusion in assessing whether a defendant's use is objectively fair."). The Ninth
Circuit ran with this suggestion on remand and held that likelihood of confusion
matters in determining whether the defense is successfully established, leaving open
as a fact issue whether the defendants could assert it. See KP Permanent Make-Up,
408 F.3d at 609.

        Use as a mark? For a use to be fair it must be "otherwise than as a mark." But
many uses could be two things at once. See, e.g., Sands, Taylor & Wood Co. v.
Quaker Oats Co., 978 F.2d 947, 954 (7th Cir. 1992) (suit by holder of THIRST
AID mark against GATORADE for latter's slogan, "GATORADE is Thirst Aid for
that deep down body thirst" and upholding district court's conclusion that
defendant used phrase as a mark). But compare SportFuel, Inc. v. PepsiCo, Inc., 932
F.3d 589, 593 (7th Cir. 2019) (Gatorade's slogan, "Gatorade The Sports Fuel
Company" was a fair use of the term "Sports Fuel," providing a defense to an
infringement claim from SportFuel).2

        In a similar vein, recall the Ninth Circuit's rejection of the prospect of
treating West Coast's use of MOVIEBUFF as being potentially descriptive (insofar
as it might have meant, "this service is like Brookfield's") because "moviebuff"
without a space did not have the dictionary meaning that "movie buff" would have.
Brookfield, 174 F.3d at 1066 ("Even though [`MovieBuff'] differs from `Movie Buff'
by only a single space, that difference is pivotal. The term `Movie Buff' is a

          2 Here is one of Gatorade's uses. Does it look like a trademark use to you?

                                                    492
descriptive term, which is routinely used in the English language to describe a movie
devotee. `MovieBuff' is not. . . ."). The court's inflexibility with defenses is
noticeable when juxtaposed with its willingness to broaden the scope of actionable
confusion (via its enthusiasm for a broadened conception of the initial interest
confusion doctrine).

                             Packman v. Chicago Tribune Co.
                                 267 F.3d 628 (7th Cir. 2001)

RIPPLE, Circuit Judge.
        On June 15, 1998, in recognition of the Chicago Bulls' sixth National

Basketball Association ("NBA") championship, the headline of the front page of the
Chicago Tribune read "The joy of six." As it has done on several other historic
occasions, the Chicago Tribune Company reproduced its entire front page on t-shirts,
posters, plaques and other memorabilia. The Tribune contracted with Front Page
News, Inc., to print on t-shirts a collage comprised of the Tribune masthead and six
headlines describing each of the Bulls' NBA victories, including "The joy of six"
headline.

        Diana Packman holds federal and Illinois trademarks for the phrase "the joy
of six," for use in relation to football and basketball games. She brought this action
against the Tribune and Front Page under the Lanham Act for trademark
infringement and unfair competition and Illinois law. The district court granted the
defendants' joint motion for summary judgment, holding that the "fair use" defense
defeated Ms. Packman's claims, and, in the alternative, that there was no evidence
that consumers were likely to be confused as to the source of the defendants'
products. Ms. Packman appeals from the district court's summary judgment ruling,
as well as from the court's denial of her motion to compel discovery. For the reasons
set forth in the following opinion, we affirm the district court in both respects.

                                                 I
                                       BACKGROUND
        The phrase "the joy of six" is a play on the 1970s book series The Joy of Sex. It
has been used to describe positive feelings associated with six of anything, e.g., the
birth of sextuplets, a six-run inning in a baseball game, six characters on a television
show, and, in this case, six championships in a sporting event.
A. The History of Ms. Packman's Trademark
        Ms. Packman's husband, Richard Packman, began using the phrase "the joy
of six" in the mid-1980s to describe a group with whom he exercised at a local
health club at 6:00 a.m. In 1994, the Packmans began printing the phrase on flyers
to advertise occasional gatherings of family and friends to watch football games. On
July 1, 1997, Ms. Packman obtained a federal trademark for "the joy of six" for use

                                                    493
in connection with "entertainment services in the nature of football games."2
Beginning in September 1996, the Packmans began using "the joy of six" to
promote outings to watch or attend basketball games and on February 3, 1998, Ms.
Packman obtained a federal trademark to use the phrase in connection with
"entertainment services in the nature of basketball games."3 Ms. Packman also
printed "the joy of six" on small quantities of hats and t-shirts to promote the
gatherings, in connection with National Football League teams pursuing a possible
sixth Super Bowl championship, in particular the San Francisco 49ers and the
Dallas Cowboys and in relation to the Chicago Bulls' pursuit of a sixth NBA
championship.

        Ms. Packman did not produce evidence of the number of gatherings or
outings, the number of attendees, or the profit, if any, they generated. The record
does not contain any documentary evidence of the Packmans' sales of hats and t-
shirts bearing "the joy of six" mark. Taking the Packmans' deposition testimony as
true, however, a small quantity of t-shirts and hats were given away, sold to friends
and family, or sold at one Ohio retail outlet and generated little, if any, profit. In
addition, Mr. Packman sold an unknown number of "The Joy of Six is Coming ...
Chicago Basketball" t-shirts at cost to a homeless street vendor, who presumably
resold them. In addition, the Packmans attempted, without success, to negotiate
contracts to license "the joy of six" for use in connection with National Football
League and NBA teams. Just prior to the Bulls' sixth NBA championship, the
Packmans began negotiating a deal for t-shirts bearing "the joy of six" mark to be
produced by a Chicago retailer. The Packmans claim, however, that the retailer
backed out of the deal after the Tribune introduced its t-shirts bearing the June 15,
1998 front page and "The joy of six" headline.
B. The Tribune's Use of "the joy of six"

        As early as 1996, sportswriters at the Tribune and the Chicago Sun-Times
began using "the joy of six" to describe the Bulls' anticipated sixth NBA
championship. The Packmans did not protest the use of the phrase they had
trademarked, but instead sent a letter, hat and t-shirt to the writers, encouraging
them to use the phrase:

        Recently granted the registered trademark for "The Joy of Six" slogan, I
        encourage you to employ this catchy tag line in your writings and reports
        throughout the 1997-1998 NBA season as the Bulls shoot for their sixth
        straight year of stellar success.

          2 The trademark was registered in Ms. Packman's name for estate planning purposes.

          3 On May 5, 1997, Ms. Packman registered "the joy of six" as a servicemark for use in connection

with basketball games under Illinois law.

                                                    494
        Mr. Packman admitted that, based on this letter, he would not have objected
to the writers' using the phrase in a column headline.

        On June 15, 1998, the Tribune printed, on its front page directly beneath its
masthead, a banner headline that read "The joy of six," describing the sixth NBA
championship won by the Bulls the previous night. The headline included a graphic
listing the six years in which the Bulls had won championships and the names of
the defeated teams. The font and size of the phrase in the Tribune headline are
visibly distinct from the font and size used by the Packmans on their flyers, hats and
t-shirts. At least eight other newspapers in the United States used the phrase "the
joy of six" in their headlines that day.

        As it has done with other historic front pages, the Tribune reproduced its
front page, including "The joy of six" headline, on t-shirts, posters, plaques, and
other memorabilia, to promote the Tribune and memorialize its coverage of the
Bulls' historic victory. The manager of the Chicago Tribune Store, Mary Tremont,
decided, without input from the Tribune's editorial board, to reproduce the entire
June 15 front page onto these promotional items. The items were sold at the
Michigan Avenue Tribune Store, at a storefront of the Tribune's offices in Vernon
Hills, and, for one month in 1999, at the Tribune's kiosk in Woodfield Mall. The
Tribune also instructed one of its vendors, Front Page News, to create a t-shirt
bearing the Tribune masthead amidst a collage of the actual headlines reporting all
of the Bulls' championships: "Two for Two: Bulls Still Champs," "Three-mendous,"
"Ringmasters," "The Jackson Five," and "The joy of six." Anticipating the Bulls'
winning the championship and the Tribune's printing a catchy phrase to describe
the victory, Ms. Tremont and Front Page designed this shirt before June 15, without
knowledge of the exact wording of the headline. The collage t-shirt was sold in the
Tribune store and, for four days in 1998, by Front Page to wholesalers.

        Shortly after the Tribune's June 15 headline appeared, several of the
Packmans' friends and family members contacted them to congratulate them on
their "deal" with the Tribune. These individuals had seen the Tribune's headline
and knew of Ms. Packman's trademark on "the joy of six," but there is no evidence
that they purchased or attempted to purchase either the Tribune's memorabilia or
the Packmans' hats and t-shirts. . . .

                                      1. The Lanham Act
        . . . . In this case, defendants asserted the fair use defense in addition to
arguing that there was no likelihood of confusion and that Ms. Packman's mark was
invalid. The district court did not rule on the validity of the mark, nor shall we,
because the fair use defense and likelihood of confusion analysis dispose of Ms.
Packman's claims in their entirety.

                                   2. The Fair Use Defense

                                                    495
        To prevail on the fair use defense, defendants must show that: (1) they used
"The joy of six" in a non-trademark use; (2) the phrase is descriptive of their goods
or services; and (3) they used the phrase "fairly and in good faith" only to describe
their goods or services. 15 U.S.C. § 1115(b)(4).

                                    a. Non-Trademark Use
        The district court held that, because Ms. Packman did not rebut evidence
that defendants used "the joy of six" only in a descriptive manner, she failed to raise
a genuine issue of material fact as to the nature of defendants' use of the phrase.
Ms. Packman contends that, in reaching this conclusion, the district court ignored
facts showing that defendants' use of "The joy of six" was a traditional trademark
use: (1) defendants applied the mark directly to the goods; (2) defendants labeled
the items with the phrase; and (3) the phrase is the most prominent text on all the
items and, in her view, was used as "an attention-getting symbol." We agree with the
district court that Ms. Packman failed to rebut the evidence of defendants'
descriptive, non-trademark use of "The joy of six."
        First, the record does not support Ms. Packman's argument that the Tribune
used "The joy of six" to identify itself as the source of the newspaper or the
championship memorabilia. Rather, the Tribune's distinctive masthead, which
appears prominently on the front page and on each piece of memorabilia
containing the phrase, identifies the source of the products. In addition, the
Tribune masthead also prominently appears on one side of the products' tags,
plainly indicating the Tribune as the source. The masthead signifies that the
products come from the Tribune and not any of the other newspapers that ran the
same headline on June 15, 1998. The Tribune's use of its well-known masthead also
identifies the phrase as a newspaper headline reporting on an event, and not as a
Tribune trademark. Cf. M.B.H. Enter., 633 F.2d at 54 (radio station's call letters and
frequency, not slogan, identified source of advertising). The phrase "The joy of six"
does not identify the source of any of the defendants' memorabilia, and thus, the
defendants' use was "otherwise than as a [trade]mark." 15 U.S.C. § 1115(b)(4); cf.
Platinum Home Mortgage Corp. v. Platinum Fin. Group, Inc., 149 F.3d 722, 728 (7th
Cir.1998) (because "platinum" described quality of mortgage services and did not
identify particular source or designate specific origin of services, it was not entitled
to trademark protection absent proof of secondary meaning); M.B.H. Enter., 633
F.2d at 55 (defendant's "I LOVE YOU" slogans attributed quality of civic
involvement and words, by themselves, did not designate source of services and thus
did not constitute trademark use).
        Second, Ms. Packman ignores her own deposition testimony, in which she
admitted that, in the context of the Bulls, "the joy of six" referred to happiness
about their six championships and that the phrase is widely used to describe the joy
of six of anything. The Tribune used the phrase "The joy of six" to describe the

                                                    496
happiness associated with six Bulls' championships. On the front page of the
Tribune and the championship memorabilia, "The joy of six" reflects that very
emotion. See Sunmark, 64 F.3d at 1059 (word or mark is considered descriptive if it
merely refers to a characteristic of the product).

        Our decision in Sunmark supports the district court's finding that the
Tribune did not employ "The joy of six" as a trademark. In Sunmark, the maker of
"SweeTARTS" candy sought to enjoin Ocean Spray from using the phrase "sweet-
tart" to describe its cranberry juice drinks. In addition to finding that Ocean Spray
had used "sweet-tart" merely to describe the taste of its drinks, this court noted that
Ocean Spray had not claimed exclusive use of the phrase and could not object if
other juice-makers used it. Nor could these defendants have objected to wide use of
the phrase, as evidenced by several other newspapers' printing "the joy of six"
headline on June 15, 1998, to describe the Bulls' championships and the varied use
of the phrase to describe positive emotions associated with six of anything, such as
sextuplets.

        Sands, Taylor & Wood, on which Ms. Packman relies, is distinguishable. The
fair use defense was unavailable in that case because the defendant's slogan,
"Gatorade is Thirst-Aid," used the plaintiff's "Thirst Aid" mark as a trademark.
Sands, Taylor & Wood, 978 F.2d at 954. Integral to the court's conclusion was
evidence that "Thirst Aid" appeared more prominently than "Gatorade" in the
advertisements and that the rhyming quality of the two words created a "memorable
slogan ... uniquely associated" with the defendant's "Gatorade" product. Here, the
Tribune used its masthead, not "The joy of six," to foster the association between
the products (the memorabilia) and their source (the Tribune). Cf. M.B.H. Enter.,
633 F.2d at 54 (defendant's prominent display of its call letters and frequency in
connection with "I LOVE YOU" slogans indicated defendant as source of
advertisements and thus was non-trademark use). Furthermore, the wide and varied
use of "the joy of six" bars a conclusion that any association between the Tribune
and the phrase is unique. Cf. Sunmark, 64 F.3d at 1059 (descriptive use of common
phrase was unlikely to constitute trademark use). And, the masthead and the phrase
appear in proximity to each other, but not as part of a "memorable slogan,"
rendering any association between the two weaker than was present in Sands, Taylor
& Wood.

        Accordingly, because Ms. Packman failed to raise a genuine issue of material
fact as to the nature of defendants' use of "The joy of six," we agree with the district
court that defendants employed the phrase in a non-trademark use.

                       b. Defendants Used the Phrase Descriptively
        Descriptive terms " `impart information directly.' " M.B.H. Enter., 633 F.2d
at 54 (citation omitted). The defendants used "The joy of six" as a headline to
describe a newsworthy event and the happiness associated with the Bulls' sixth NBA

                                                    497
championship. This use did not change with the reproduction of the Tribune's
front page onto championship memorabilia. As Ms. Packman herself admitted, "the
joy of six" is a phrase commonly used to describe the emotions associated with six of
anything. Ms. Packman cannot appropriate the phrase to herself and thereby
prevent others from using the phrase in a descriptive sense, as defendants did here.
See Blau Plumbing, 781 F.2d at 609-10 (a person "cannot appropriate the English
language" and thereby render others inarticulate); M.B.H. Enter., 633 F.2d at 55
(owner of registered mark " `may not appropriate to itself common English slang
terms and thus prevent others from using such phrases in their descriptive sense' ")
(citation omitted). The district court correctly concluded that no genuine issue of
material fact existed as to defendants' descriptive use of the phrase.

        Furthermore, the record lacks any evidence that "the joy of six" had acquired
a secondary meaning as used by Ms. Packman, and she does not point to any
evidence in rebuttal. Secondary meaning is "a mental association in buyers' minds
between the alleged mark and a single source of the product." 2 J. Thomas
McCarthy, Trademarks and Unfair Competition § 15:5, at 15-9 (4th ed.2001)
(emphasis in original). A mark acquires secondary meaning when it has been used
so long and so exclusively by one company in association with its goods or services
that the word or phrase has come to mean that those goods or services are the
company's trademark. Id. § 15:5, at 15-10; see Platinum Home Mortgage, 149 F.3d at
728. Proof of secondary meaning can be established through direct consumer
testimony, consumer surveys, length and manner of use, amount and manner of
advertising, volume of sales, place in the market, and evidence of intentional
copying. See Platinum Home Mortgage, 149 F.3d at 728; Spraying Sys. Co. v. Delavan,
Inc., 975 F.2d 387, 393 (7th Cir.1992). Ms. Packman's assertion of secondary
meaning is purely speculative. She does not tell us how many shirts or hats the Ohio
store or the Chicago street vendor sold, how many items she produced, who
purchased them, or whether she advertised her products. See Platinum Home
Mortgage, 149 F.3d at 729 (rejecting plaintiff's circumstantial evidence of advertising
and sales). Thus, the record confirms the absence of a secondary meaning
altogether. Ms. Packman used the mark primarily in connection with small group
outings to sporting events, did not commercially advertise her outings or her
products, and used the phrase in connection with the Bulls for less than three years.
See id., 149 F.3d at 728 (plaintiff who used mark for only three years could not
demonstrate that mark had secondary meaning). The phrase "the joy of six" did not
achieve a level of distinctiveness with respect to Ms. Packman's goods or services,
nor does it exclusively relate to the Bulls' sixth championship. See Spraying Sys., 975
F.2d at 393 (evidence of third-party use of mark cast further doubt on plaintiff's
assertion of secondary meaning). Accordingly, the record supports only one
conclusion, that "the joy of six" is merely a descriptive phrase without a secondary

                                                    498
meaning, a phrase which defendants, or any other person, may rightfully use. See
Blau Plumbing, 781 F.2d at 610 (descriptive mark without secondary meaning was
unworthy of trademark protection).

                      c. Defendants Used the Phrase in Good Faith
        Ms. Packman maintains that the Tribune's knowledge of her trademark (as a
result of Mr. Packman's letter to the sportswriters) before running the "The joy of
six" headline and its failure to cease its sale of the championship memorabilia after
she threatened legal action are evidence of the defendants' bad faith. The district
court determined that this evidence did not give rise to an inference of bad faith
because Mr. Packman's letter encouraged rather than discouraged use of the phrase,
and the Tribune used the phrase in the very manner suggested: as a headline to
celebrate the Bulls' success in winning a sixth championship.
        Mere knowledge of Ms. Packman's trademark on the phrase is insufficient to
establish that the Tribune acted in bad faith and to preclude summary judgment.
See M.B.H. Enter., 633 F.2d at 54. The defendants' good faith "can be judged only
by inquiry into [their] subjective purpose in using the slogan[ ]." Id., 633 F.2d at 54.
In M.B.H. Enter., the plaintiff had a registered trademark for the words "I LOVE
YOU" for use in entertainment services related to radio programs and had licensed
a promotion using the phrase "I LOVE YOU MILWAUKEE" to radio station
WISN in Milwaukee. When radio station WOKY began its own campaign
professing its love for Milwaukee, using the phrases "WOKY LOVES
MILWAUKEE" and "I LOVE MILWAUKEE" signed by WOKY, the plaintiff
sought to enjoin WOKY's efforts. Addressing the issue of WOKY's good faith, the
court found that WOKY's intent to reap commercial advantage from its
declarations of love for the city did not demonstrate that WOKY intended to use
the phrase as a trademark. Rather, WOKY's use of its call letters and radio
frequency--its trademarks identifying WOKY as the source--in each of the ads
suggested that WOKY lacked the intent to use the slogans as trademarks.
Accordingly, the court found that WOKY had not acted in bad faith or with the
intent to confuse the public about the source of the affection for Milwaukee.
        Similarly, the presence of the Tribune's distinctive masthead above "The joy
of six" headline and on each piece of championship memorabilia will not support
an inference that the Tribune acted in bad faith. Nor does the defendants' receipt
of commercial benefit from promoting the newspaper or selling championship
memorabilia demonstrate use of "The joy of six" in bad faith. Ms. Tremont,
manager of the Tribune Store, testified that she selected the June 15, 1998 front
page for reproduction onto memorabilia consistent with the Tribune's practice of
capturing historical events reported by the newspaper. This decision was made
without editorial input and without knowledge of the exact wording of the headline
for that day. Therefore the syntax of the headline played no part in the decision to

                                                    499
produce and market the Tribune's products in celebration of the Bulls' sixth
championship, and therefore will not support any inference that the defendants
acted in bad faith.

        Ms. Packman failed to adduce evidence creating a genuine issue of fact as to
any of the three elements of the fair use defense. Accordingly, the district court did
not err in finding that defendants' use of "The joy of six" was a nontrademark use,
in good faith, to describe a characteristic or quality of their goods. . . .

                          Marketquest Group, Inc. v. BIC Corp.
                                 862 F.3d 927 (9th Cir. 2017)

M. SMITH, Circuit Judge:
        Marketquest Group, Inc. (Marketquest) appeals the district court's grant of

summary judgment in favor of Norwood Promotional Products, LLC (Norwood),
BIC Corp., and BIC USA, Inc. (collectively, Defendants) on Marketquest's
trademark infringement claims. The district court held that Defendants' uses of
Marketquest's trademarks "All-in-One" and "The Write Choice" were completely
protected by the fair use defense. We reverse and remand. . . .

        Marketquest produces and sells promotional products, and has used its
United States Patent and Trademark Office registered trademarks "All-in-One" and
"The Write Choice" since 1999 and 2000, respectively. In 2009, BIC Corp. and
BIC USA, Inc. (collectively, BIC) acquired Norwood, a promotional products
company, and in 2010 Norwood published a promotional products catalogue for
2011 that featured the phrase "All-in-One" on the cover of and in the catalogue.
The 2011 catalogue consolidated all of Norwood's eight "hard goods" catalogues "in
one" catalogue, whereas they were previously published in separate catalogues. In
2010, BIC also used the phrase "The WRITE Pen Choice for 30 Years" in
advertising and packaging for its pens, in connection with its thirtieth anniversary
promotion.

        [Marketquest alleged infringement of Marketquest's "All-in-One" and "The
Write Choice" trademarks. It moved for a preliminary injunction and submitted
evidence with respect to the defendants' use of the "All-in-One" mark, but not "The
Write Choice." The court denied the injunction, concluding that the defendants
were likely to succeed on a fair use defense. After discovery, both sides moved for
summary judgment.]

        . . . . The district court granted summary judgment for Defendants, holding
that there was "some likelihood of confusion and therefore the potential for
trademark infringement liability," but that further analysis of likelihood of
confusion was unnecessary because fair use provided Defendants a complete defense
to allegations of infringement of both the "All-in-One" and "The Write Choice"
trademarks. Marketquest timely appealed. . . .

                                                    500
         III. The district court erred by granting summary judgment in favor of
Defendants based upon on the fair use defense regarding their use of "All-in-
One."

        Applying the "classic fair use" defense, "[a] junior user is always entitled to
use a descriptive term in good faith in its primary, descriptive sense other than as a
trademark." Cairns v. Franklin Mint Co., 292 F.3d 1139, 1150 (9th Cir. 2002). A
defendant must show that its use is (1) other than as a trademark, (2) descriptive of
the defendant's goods, and (3) in good faith. 15 U.S.C. § 1115(b)(4). Additionally,
"the degree of customer confusion [is] a factor in evaluating fair use." KP Permanent
II, 408 F.3d at 609.

        The district court considered the elements of the fair use defense, and
concluded that Defendants' use of "All-in-One" in connection with the 2011
catalogue was completely protected by the fair use defense. As discussed below,
genuine issues of material fact exist regarding the elements of fair use in this case,
thereby precluding summary judgment. While summary judgment on the fair use
defense in a trademark case is possible, we reiterate that "summary judgment is
generally disfavored" in trademark cases, due to "the intensely factual nature of
trademark disputes." Fortune Dynamic, 618 F.3d at 1031.

        A. Non-catalogue uses of All-in-One
        Marketquest first argues that the district court erred by not specifically
analyzing all of the uses of "All-in-One" employed by Defendants, since the fair use
analysis often varies when a defendant uses the same mark in different ways. The
"other uses" of "All-in-One" included (1) promotional materials that featured an
image of the 2011 catalogue; (2) promotional materials that directed customers to
look for products or information in "the 2011 Norwood All in ONE catalogue";
and (3) an online advertisement that said "Put Your Drinkware Needs ... in a
Norwood ALL in ONE Basket," which included a photo of a basket containing
several different types of drinkware. Defendants respond that there was no need to
conduct a design-by-design review because all of these uses connected to the 2011
catalogue, and there is no basis for the claim that the district court did not consider
all the evidence, even if other uses were not specifically referenced by the district
court.
        It appears from its summary judgment order that the district court focused
on Defendants' use of "All-in-One" on the 2011 catalogue, and perhaps did not
consider other uses. While a design-by-design review of promotional materials that
merely included a picture of the 2011 catalogue was not required, references to "the
2011 Norwood All in ONE catalogue" and "a Norwood ALL in ONE Basket" are
sufficiently distinct to require analysis for fair use. These uses are considered below,
along with the 2011 catalogue use.
         B. Use other than as a trademark.

                                                    501
        A fair use must be a use other than as a trademark. 15 U.S.C. § 1115(b)(4).
A trademark is used "to identify and distinguish ... goods ... from those
manufactured or sold by others and to indicate the source of the goods." Id. § 1127.
"To determine whether a term is being used as a mark, we look for indications that
the term is being used to associate it with a manufacturer," and "whether the term is
used as a symbol to attract public attention." Fortune Dynamic, 618 F.3d at 1040
(internal quotation marks omitted). We also consider "whether the allegedly
infringing user undertook precautionary measures ... to minimize the risk that the
term will be understood in its trademark sense." Id. (internal quotation marks
omitted).

        A genuine issue of fact exists regarding whether Defendants used "All-in-
One" as a trademark. Defendants did take "precautionary measures" when featuring
"All-in-One" on the 2011 catalogue: Norwood was printed at the top in large, bold,
capital letters with a trademark symbol, while "All-in-One" was located further down
on the page, in smaller letters, without a trademark symbol, and positioned as a
heading over a list of all the products consolidated "in one" catalogue. This suggests
that Norwood was used to indicate the source of the goods, rather than "All-in-
One" (although it is possible for more than one trademark to appear on a catalogue
cover). However, when considering all of Defendants' uses of "All-in-One," a jury
could potentially find trademark use. The "precautionary measures" listed above
were not present when Defendants referred to "the 2011 Norwood All in ONE
catalogue" and "a Norwood ALL in ONE Basket." In these uses, there is no obvious
distinction between Norwood and "All-in-One," and both could reasonably be
understood to indicate source.

        C. Descriptive use.
        To prevail on fair use, a defendant must show that it used the mark "in its
primary, descriptive sense." Fortune Dynamic, 618 F.3d at 1041 (quoting Brother
Records, Inc. v. Jardine, 318 F.3d 900, 906 (9th Cir. 2003) (alteration omitted)); see 15
U.S.C. § 1115(b)(4). While "we accept some flexibility in what counts as
descriptive," Fortune Dynamic, 618 F.3d at 1042, "the scope of the fair use defense
varies with ... the descriptive purity of the defendant's use and whether there are
other words available to do the describing." Id. at 1041. Even when "there [is] some
evidence of descriptive use, [a jury] could still reasonably conclude that [a
defendant's] lack of `precautionary measures' " outweighs such evidence. Id. at 1042.
        There is a strong argument that Defendants' use of "All-in-One" on the 2011
catalogue was descriptive, because it was used as a heading for a list of the products
consolidated "all in one" catalogue. Moreover, as discussed above, Defendants took
"precautionary measures" on their catalogue cover by using a design that indicated
descriptive use. However, Defendants' other uses of "All-in-One" were arguably not
descriptive, and "precautionary measures" were not taken with these uses. While

                                                    502
Defendants' use of "All-in-One" as a heading on the 2011 catalogue strongly
indicates descriptive use, such use is not apparent in decontextualized references to
"the 2011 Norwood All in ONE catalogue." Additionally, "Put Your Drinkware
Needs ... in a Norwood ALL in ONE Basket" does not fall under the descriptive use
explanation that Defendants advance because it does not refer to a consolidated
catalogue. It may descriptively refer to consolidating drinkware in a basket, but the
"descriptive purity" of such use is questionable because it is unclear if the basket is
literal or suggestive. Uses of "All-in-One" in ways that stripped it of its possible
descriptive meaning undermine Defendants' descriptive use argument, such that a
finder of fact could determine that the use was not descriptive. Moreover, a finder
of fact could determine that Defendants "had at [their] disposal a number of
alternative words [or phrases] that could adequately capture [their] goal," limiting
the scope of the fair use defense in this case. Id. at 1042.

        D. In good faith.
        A defendant asserting fair use must also show that it used the mark in good
faith. 15 U.S.C. § 1115(b)(4). When considering forward confusion, this element
"involves the same issue as the intent factor in the likelihood of confusion analysis";
that is, "whether defendant in adopting its mark intended to capitalize on plaintiff's
good will." Fortune Dynamic, 618 F.3d at 1043. . . . [T]he good faith inquiry differs
somewhat from the Sleekcraft intent factor, regardless of the underlying theory of
confusion. In fair use, good faith is an element of the defense, not merely a factor to
consider when it is relevant in a given case.
        As with intent in Sleekcraft, there is no bright-line rule or required piece of
evidence to establish good or bad faith. While the focus may differ when
considering forward or reverse confusion, generally the same types of evidence will
be relevant to this inquiry. This includes evidence such as whether the defendant
intended to create confusion, whether forward or reverse; intended to push the
plaintiff out of the market; remained ignorant of the plaintiff's mark when it
reasonably should have known of the mark; knew of the mark and showed bad faith
in its disregard of the plaintiff's rights; or any other evidence relevant to whether the
defendant's claimed "objectively fair" use of the mark was done in good faith. See
KP Permanent I, 543 U.S. at 123; see also, e.g., Fortune Dynamic, 618 F.3d at 1043
(holding that a material question of fact existed regarding defendant's good faith
when the plaintiff introduced evidence that the defendant carelessly failed to
investigate the trademark at issue, along with expert testimony that a trademark
search would have been standard practice in the relevant industry).
        Marketquest argues that because this case presents reverse confusion, mere
knowledge of Marketquest's ownership and use of the "All-in-One" mark establishes
bad faith on the part of Defendants, and fair use is thus unavailable as a matter of
law. That is incorrect. An inference of bad faith does not arise from mere

                                                    503
knowledge of a mark when the use is otherwise objectively fair, even in a case
presenting reverse confusion. Marketquest also argues that Defendants' use of two
of its marks in the same year supports an inference of bad faith. This fact by itself,
coupled with Marketquest's knowledge of the marks, is thin evidence of bad faith.
However, we cannot say on summary judgment that no reasonable finder of fact
could infer bad faith from these facts.

         E. Degree of consumer confusion.
        "The fair use defense only comes into play once the party alleging
infringement has shown by a preponderance of the evidence that confusion is
likely." KP Permanent II, 408 F.3d at 608-09. This is because if there is no likelihood
of consumer confusion, then there is no trademark infringement, making an
affirmative defense to trademark infringement irrelevant. KP Permanent I, 543 U.S.
at 120. After the plaintiff meets the threshold showing, in the fair use analysis "the
degree of customer confusion [is] a factor" to consider. KP Permanent II, 408 F.3d at
609. However, a defendant raising the defense does not have the burden to negate
any likelihood of consumer confusion. KP Permanent I, 543 U.S. at 114. Some
consumer confusion is compatible with fair use, and when a plaintiff chooses "to
identify its product with a mark that uses a well known descriptive phrase" it
assumes the risk of some confusion. Id. at 121-22.
        The district court held that Marketquest met the threshold requirement for
fair use by showing that there is some likelihood of confusion, relying upon its
previous Sleekcraft analysis in the order denying Marketquest's motion for a
preliminary injunction. However, the district court held that any further Sleekcraft
analysis was "unnecessary" because fair use provided Defendants a complete
defense.
        Marketquest argues that the district court's holding was incomplete because
it did not conduct a full Sleekcraft analysis, nor did it consider the additional factors
that we stated in KP Permanent II would be relevant to the jury's consideration of
fair use in that case.2 Defendants counter that a court may grant summary judgment
on the fair use defense without deciding the likelihood of confusion because
confusion is not the focus of fair use; the focus is objective fairness, and some
confusion is accepted.
         We emphasize that the degree of consumer confusion is a factor in the fair

          2 These factors included "the degree of likely confusion, the strength of the trademark, the

descriptive nature of the term for the product or service being offered by [the defendant] and the availability

of alternate descriptive terms, the extent of the use of the term prior to the registration of the trademark, and

any differences among the times and contexts in which [the defendant] has used the term." KP Permanent II,

408 F.3d at 609.

                                                    504
use analysis, not an element of fair use. See KP Permanent I, 543 U.S. at 118
("Congress said nothing about likelihood of confusion in setting out the elements
of the fair use defense."). This factor is useful in considering whether, overall, the
use was objectively fair. A use that is likely to confuse consumers, or that has caused
actual confusion, is less likely to be objectively fair (although some confusion is
permissible). Accord Shakespeare Co. v. Silstar Corp. of Am., 110 F.3d 234, 243 (4th
Cir. 1997) ("While it is true that to the degree that confusion is likely, a use is less
likely to be found fair, it does not follow that a determination of likely confusion
precludes considering the fairness of use."). The Sleekcraft factors and additional
factors that we identified as relevant in KP Permanent II may also be relevant in a
given case where fair use is at issue. A court is not required in every case to recite
and analyze all the factors identified in Sleekcraft and KP Permanent II one-by-one for
a fair use analysis to be complete. A court may do so, but these are merely factors to
facilitate a court's analysis, to the degree they are relevant in a given case.

        In this case, the district court referenced its previous Sleekcraft analysis at the
preliminary injunction phase. The district court was not required to conduct this
analysis again and determine all potential issues of fact as a matter of law before
considering summary judgment on fair use. However, because we reverse summary
judgment on fair use for the reasons indicated above, we leave it to the district court
to determine on remand the relevance of the degree of consumer confusion in this
case.

        IV. The district court erred by applying the fair use analysis to Defendants'
use of "The Write Choice" after determining that Marketquest presented no
evidence of likely confusion.

        The district court found that there was "no evidence of actual or potential
confusion" resulting from Defendants' use of "The Write Choice," and then
concluded that Defendants had shown fair use. That fair use analysis was in error
because "[t]he fair use defense only comes into play once the party alleging
infringement has shown by a preponderance of the evidence that confusion is
likely." KP Permanent II, 408 F.3d at 608-09. The district court could not properly
find here that there was no evidence of confusion, fail to conduct a Sleekcraft
analysis, and still conclude that the Defendants qualified for the fair use defense.
Thus, we remand for the district court to consider Marketquest's trademark
infringement claim regarding Defendants' use of "The Write Choice."

                                                    505
22. Nominative Fair Use

                        Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc. v. Tabari
                                610 F.3d 1171 (9th Cir. 2010)

KOZINSKI, Chief Judge:
        In this trademark infringement case, we consider the application of the

nominative fair use doctrine to internet domain names.
                                               Facts

        Farzad and Lisa Tabari are auto brokers--the personal shoppers of the
automotive world. They contact authorized dealers, solicit bids and arrange for
customers to buy from the dealer offering the best combination of location,
availability and price. Consumers like this service, as it increases competition among
dealers, resulting in greater selection at lower prices. For many of the same reasons,
auto manufacturers and dealers aren't so keen on it, as it undermines dealers'
territorial exclusivity and lowers profit margins. Until recently, the Tabaris offered
this service at buy-a-lexus.com and buyorleaselexus.com.

        Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A. ("Toyota") is the exclusive distributor of Lexus
vehicles in the United States, and jealous guardian of the Lexus mark. A Toyota
marketing executive testified at trial that Toyota spends over $250 million every year
promoting the Lexus brand. In the executive's estimation, "Lexus is a very
prestigious luxury brand and it is an indication of an exclusive luxury experience."
No doubt true.

        Toyota objected to the Tabaris' use on their website of copyrighted
photography of Lexus vehicles and the circular "L Symbol Design mark." Toyota
also took umbrage at the Tabaris' use of the string "lexus" in their domain names,
which it believed was "likely to cause confusion as to the source of [the Tabaris']
web site." The Tabaris removed Toyota's photography and logo from their site and
added a disclaimer in large font at the top. But they refused to give up their domain
names. Toyota sued, and the district court found infringement after a bench trial. It
ordered the Tabaris to cease using their domain names and enjoined them from
using the Lexus mark in any other domain name. Pro se as they were at trial, the
Tabaris appeal.

                                     Nominative Fair Use
        When customers purchase a Lexus through the Tabaris, they receive a
genuine Lexus car sold by an authorized Lexus dealer, and a portion of the proceeds
ends up in Toyota's bank account. Toyota doesn't claim the business of brokering
Lexus cars is illegal or that it has contracted with its dealers to prohibit selling
through a broker. Instead, Toyota is using this trademark lawsuit to make it more
difficult for consumers to use the Tabaris to buy a Lexus.

                                                    506
        The district court applied the eight-factor test for likelihood of confusion
articulated in AMF Inc. v. Sleekcraft Boats, 599 F.2d 341, 348-49 (9th Cir.1979), and
found that the Tabaris' domain names--buy-a-lexus.com and buyorleaselexus.com--
infringed the Lexus trademark. But we've held that the Sleekcraft analysis doesn't
apply where a defendant uses the mark to refer to the trademarked good itself. See
Playboy Enters., Inc. v. Welles, 279 F.3d 796, 801 (9th Cir.2002); New Kids on the Block
v. News Am. Publ'g, Inc., 971 F.2d 302, 308 (9th Cir.1992). The Tabaris are using the
term Lexus to describe their business of brokering Lexus automobiles; when they say
Lexus, they mean Lexus. We've long held that such use of the trademark is a fair
use, namely nominative fair use. And fair use is, by definition, not infringement.
The Tabaris did in fact present a nominative fair use defense to the district court.

        In cases where a nominative fair use defense is raised, we ask whether (1) the
product was "readily identifiable" without use of the mark; (2) defendant used more
of the mark than necessary; or (3) defendant falsely suggested he was sponsored or
endorsed by the trademark holder. Welles, 279 F.3d at 801 (quoting New Kids, 971
F.2d at 308-09). This test "evaluates the likelihood of confusion in nominative use
cases." Id. It's designed to address the risk that nominative use of the mark will
inspire a mistaken belief on the part of consumers that the speaker is sponsored or
endorsed by the trademark holder. The third factor speaks directly to the risk of
such confusion, and the others do so indirectly: Consumers may reasonably infer
sponsorship or endorsement if a company uses an unnecessary trademark or "more"
of a mark than necessary. But if the nominative use satisfies the three-factor New
Kids test, it doesn't infringe. If the nominative use does not satisfy all the New Kids
factors, the district court may order defendants to modify their use of the mark so
that all three factors are satisfied; it may not enjoin nominative use of the mark
altogether.

        A. The district court enjoined the Tabaris from using "any ... domain name,
service mark, trademark, trade name, meta tag or other commercial indication of
origin that includes the mark LEXUS." A trademark injunction, particularly one
involving nominative fair use, can raise serious First Amendment concerns because
it can interfere with truthful communication between buyers and sellers in the
marketplace. See Va. State Bd. of Pharmacy v. Va. Citizens Consumer Council, Inc., 425
U.S. 748, 763-64 (1976). Accordingly, "we must [e]nsure that [the injunction] is
tailored to eliminate only the specific harm alleged." E. & J. Gallo Winery v. Gallo
Cattle Co., 967 F.2d 1280, 1297 (9th Cir.1992). To uphold the broad injunction
entered in this case, we would have to be convinced that consumers are likely to
believe a site is sponsored or endorsed by a trademark holder whenever the domain
name contains the string of letters that make up the trademark.

        In performing this analysis, our focus must be on the " `reasonably prudent
consumer' in the marketplace." Cf. Dreamwerks Prod. Grp., Inc. v. SKG Studio, 142

                                                    507
F.3d 1127, 1129 (9th Cir.1998) (describing the test for likelihood of confusion in
analogous Sleekcraft context). The relevant marketplace is the online marketplace,
and the relevant consumer is a reasonably prudent consumer accustomed to
shopping online; the kind of consumer who is likely to visit the Tabaris' website
when shopping for an expensive product like a luxury car. See, e.g., Interstellar Starship
Servs., Ltd. v. Epix, Inc., 304 F.3d 936, 946 (9th Cir.2002). Unreasonable, imprudent
and inexperienced web-shoppers are not relevant.

        The injunction here is plainly overbroad--as even Toyota's counsel
grudgingly conceded at oral argument--because it prohibits domain names that on
their face dispel any confusion as to sponsorship or endorsement. The Tabaris are
prohibited from doing business at sites like independent-lexus-broker.com and we-
are-definitely-not-lexus.com, although a reasonable consumer wouldn't believe
Toyota sponsors the websites using those domains. Prohibition of such truthful and
non-misleading speech does not advance the Lanham Act's purpose of protecting
consumers and preventing unfair competition; in fact, it undermines that rationale
by frustrating honest communication between the Tabaris and their customers.

        Even if we were to modify the injunction to exclude domain names that
expressly disclaim sponsorship or endorsement (like the examples above), the
injunction would still be too broad. The Tabaris may not do business at
lexusbroker.com, even though that's the most straightforward, obvious and truthful
way to describe their business. The nominative fair use doctrine allows such truthful
use of a mark, even if the speaker fails to expressly disavow association with the
trademark holder, so long as it's unlikely to cause confusion as to sponsorship or
endorsement. In New Kids, for instance, we found that use of the "New Kids on the
Block" mark in a newspaper survey did not infringe, even absent a disclaimer,
because the survey said "nothing that expressly or by fair implication connotes
endorsement or joint sponsorship." Speakers are under no obligation to provide a
disclaimer as a condition for engaging in truthful, non-misleading speech.

        Although our opinion in Volkswagenwerk Aktiengesellschaft v. Church remarked
on that defendant's "prominent use of the word `Independent' whenever the terms
`Volkswagen' or `VW' appeared in his advertising," 411 F.2d 350, 352 (9th
Cir.1969), it isn't to the contrary. The inclusion of such words will usually negate
any hint of sponsorship or endorsement, which is why we mentioned them in
concluding that there was no infringement in Volkswagenwerk. But that doesn't
mean such words are required, and Volkswagenwerk doesn't say they are. Our
subsequent cases make clear they're not.

        The district court reasoned that the fact that an internet domain contains a
trademark will "generally" suggest sponsorship or endorsement by the trademark
holder. When a domain name consists only of the trademark followed by .com, or
some other suffix like .org or .net, it will typically suggest sponsorship or

                                                    508
endorsement by the trademark holder. Cf. Panavision Int'l, L.P. v. Toeppen, 141 F.3d
1316, 1327 (9th Cir.1998).4 This is because "[a] customer who is unsure about a
company's domain name will often guess that the domain name is also the
company's name." Id. (quoting Cardservice Int'l v. McGee, 950 F.Supp. 737, 741
(E.D.Va.1997)) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Brookfield Commc'ns, Inc.
v. W. Coast Entm't Corp., 174 F.3d 1036, 1045 (9th Cir.1999). If customers type in
trademark.com and find the site occupied by someone other than the trademark
holder, they may well believe it is the trademark holder, despite contrary evidence
on the website itself. Alternatively, they may become discouraged and give up
looking for the trademark holder's official site, believing perhaps that such a website
doesn't exist. Panavision, 141 F.3d at 1327.

        But the case where the URL consists of nothing but a trademark followed by
a suffix like .com or .org is a special one indeed. The importance ascribed to
trademark.com in fact suggests that far less confusion will result when a domain
making nominative use of a trademark includes characters in addition to those
making up the mark. Because the official Lexus site is almost certain to be found at
lexus.com (as, in fact, it is), it's far less likely to be found at other sites containing
the word Lexus. On the other hand, a number of sites make nominative use of
trademarks in their domains but are not sponsored or endorsed by the trademark
holder: You can preen about your Mercedes at mercedesforum.com and
mercedestalk.net, read the latest about your double-skim-no-whip latte at
starbucksgossip.com and find out what goodies the world's greatest electronics store
has on sale this week at fryselectronics-ads.com. Consumers who use the internet for
shopping are generally quite sophisticated about such matters and won't be fooled
into thinking that the prestigious German car manufacturer sells boots at
mercedesboots.com, or homes at mercedeshomes.com, or that comcastsucks.org is

          4 Of course, not every trademark.com domain name is likely to cause consumer confusion. See

Interstellar Starship, 304 F.3d at 944-46. For instance, we observed in Interstellar Starship that an apple orchard

could operate at the website apple.com without risking confusion with Apple Computers, in light of the vast

difference between their products. "If, however, the apple grower ... competed directly with Apple Computer

by selling computers, initial interest confusion probably would result," as the apple grower would be using

the apple.com domain to appropriate the goodwill Apple Computer had developed in its trademark.

          When a website deals in goods or services related to a trademarked brand, as in this case, it is much

closer to the second example, where apple.com competes with Apple Computers. If a company that repaired

iPods, iPads and iPhones were to set up at apple.com, for instance, consumers would naturally assume that

the company was sponsored or endorsed by Apple (or, more likely, that it was Apple). Where a site is used to

sell goods or services related to the trademarked brand, a trademark.com domain will therefore suggest

sponsorship or endorsement and will not generally be nominative fair use.

                                                    509
sponsored or endorsed by the TV cable company just because the string of letters
making up its trademark appears in the domain.

        When people go shopping online, they don't start out by typing random
URLs containing trademarked words hoping to get a lucky hit. They may start out
by typing trademark.com, but then they'll rely on a search engine or word of mouth.
If word of mouth, confusion is unlikely because the consumer will usually be aware
of who runs the site before typing in the URL. And, if the site is located through a
search engine, the consumer will click on the link for a likely-relevant site without
paying much attention to the URL. Use of a trademark in the site's domain name
isn't materially different from use in its text or metatags in this context; a search
engine can find a trademark in a site regardless of where exactly it appears. In
Welles, we upheld a claim that use of a mark in a site's metatags constituted
nominative fair use; we reasoned that "[s]earchers would have a much more difficult
time locating relevant websites" if the law outlawed such truthful, non-misleading
use of a mark. The same logic applies to nominative use of a mark in a domain
name.

        Of course a domain name containing a mark cannot be nominative fair use
if it suggests sponsorship or endorsement by the trademark holder. We've already
explained why trademark.com domains have that effect. Sites like trademark-
USA.com, trademark-of-glendale.com or e-trademark.com will also generally suggest
sponsorship or endorsement by the trademark holder; the addition of "e" merely
indicates the electronic version of a brand, and a location modifier following a
trademark indicates that consumers can expect to find the brand's local subsidiary,
franchise or affiliate. See Visa Int'l Serv. Ass'n v. JSL Corp., No. 08-15206, 2010 WL
2559003, 610 F.3d 1088 (9th Cir. June 28, 2010). For even more obvious reasons,
domains like official-trademark-site.com or we-are-trademark.com affirmatively
suggest sponsorship or endorsement by the trademark holder and are not
nominative fair use. But the district court's injunction is not limited to this narrow
class of cases and, indeed, the Tabaris' domain names do not fall within it. . . .

        Toyota argues it is entitled to exclusive use of the string "lexus" in domain
names because it spends hundreds of millions of dollars every year making sure
everyone recognizes and understands the word "Lexus." But "[a] large expenditure
of money does not in itself create legally protectable rights." Smith v. Chanel, Inc.,
402 F.2d 562, 568 (9th Cir.1968); see also Ty Inc. v. Perryman, 306 F.3d 509, 513
(7th Cir.2002); Mark A. Lemley, The Modern Lanham Act and the Death of Common
Sense, 108 Yale L.J. 1687, 1714-15 (1999). Indeed, it is precisely because of Toyota's
investment in the Lexus mark that "[m]uch useful social and commercial discourse
would be all but impossible if speakers were under threat of an infringement lawsuit

                                                    510
every time they made reference to [Lexus] by using its trademark." New Kids, 971
F.2d at 307.8

        It is the wholesale prohibition of nominative use in domain names that
would be unfair. It would be unfair to merchants seeking to communicate the
nature of the service or product offered at their sites. And it would be unfair to
consumers, who would be deprived of an increasingly important means of receiving
such information. As noted, this would have serious First Amendment implications.
The only winners would be companies like Toyota, which would acquire greater
control over the markets for goods and services related to their trademarked brands,
to the detriment of competition and consumers. The nominative fair use doctrine is
designed to prevent this type of abuse of the rights granted by the Lanham Act.

        B. Toyota asserts that, even if the district court's injunction is overbroad, it
can be upheld if limited to the Tabaris' actual domain names: buyorleaselexus.com
and buy-a-lexus.com. We therefore apply the three-part New Kids test to the domain
names, and we start by asking whether the Tabaris' use of the mark was "necessary"
to describe their business. Toyota claims it was not, because the Tabaris could have
used a domain name that did not contain the Lexus mark. It's true they could have
used some other domain name like autobroker.com or fastimports.com, or have
used the text of their website to explain their business. But it's enough to satisfy our
test for necessity that the Tabaris needed to communicate that they specialize in
Lexus vehicles, and using the Lexus mark in their domain names accomplished this
goal. While using Lexus in their domain names wasn't the only way to communicate
the nature of their business, the same could be said of virtually any choice the
Tabaris made about how to convey their message: Rather than using the internet,
they could publish advertisements in print; or, instead of taking out print ads, they
could rely on word of mouth. We've never adopted such a draconian definition of
necessity, and we decline to do so here. In Volkswagenwerk, for instance, we affirmed
the right of a mechanic to put up a sign advertising that he specialized in repairing
Volkswagen cars, although he could have used a sandwich board, distributed leaflets
or shouted through a megaphone. 411 F.2d at 352.9 One way or the other, the

          8 "Words ... do not worm their way into our discourse by accident." Alex Kozinski, Trademarks

Unplugged, 68 N.Y.U. L.Rev. 960, 975 (1993). Trademark holders engage in "well-orchestrated campaigns

intended to burn them into our collective consciousness." Id. Although trademark holders gain something by

pushing their trademark into the lexicon, they also inevitably lose a measure of control over their mark.

          9 The Seventh Circuit has similarly upheld the right of a seller of Beanie Babies to operate at

"bargainbeanies.com" on the grounds that "[y]ou can't sell a branded product without using its brand name."

Ty Inc., 306 F.3d at 512. In a prophetic choice of examples, Judge Posner remarked that prohibiting such a

domain name "would amount to saying that if a used car dealer truthfully advertised that it sold Toyotas, or if

                                                    511
Tabaris need to let consumers know that they are brokers of Lexus cars, and that's
nearly impossible to do without mentioning Lexus, be it via domain name, metatag,
radio jingle, telephone solicitation or blimp.

        The fact that the Tabaris also broker other types of cars does not render their
use of the Lexus mark unnecessary.10 Lisa Tabari testified: "I in my conviction and
great respect for the company always try to convince the consumer to first purchase
a Lexus or Toyota product." If customers decide to buy some other type of car, the
Tabaris may help with that, but their specialty is Lexus. The Tabaris are entitled to
decide what automotive brands to emphasize in their business, and the district court
found that the Tabaris do in fact specialize in Lexus vehicles. Potential customers
would naturally be interested in that fact, and it was entirely appropriate for the
Tabaris to use the Lexus mark to let them know it.

        Nor are we convinced by Toyota's argument that the Tabaris unnecessarily
used domain names containing the Lexus trademark as their trade name. The
Tabaris' business name is not buyorleaselexus.com or buy-a-lexus.com; it's Fast
Imports. Toyota points out that the Tabaris' domain names featured prominently in
their advertising, but that by no means proves the domain names were synonymous
with the Tabaris' business. The Tabaris may have featured their domain names in
their advertisements in order to tell consumers where to find their website, as well
as to communicate the fact that they can help buy or lease a Lexus. Toyota would
have to show significantly more than "prominent" advertisement to establish the
contrary. We therefore conclude that the Tabaris easily satisfy the first New Kids
factor.

        As for the second and third steps of our nominative fair use analysis, Toyota
suggests that use of the stylized Lexus mark and "Lexus L" logo was more use of the
mark than necessary and suggested sponsorship or endorsement by Toyota. This is
true: The Tabaris could adequately communicate their message without using the
visual trappings of the Lexus brand. Moreover, those visual cues might lead some
consumers to believe they were dealing with an authorized Toyota affiliate. Imagery,
logos and other visual markers may be particularly significant in cyberspace, where
anyone can convincingly recreate the look and feel of a luxury brand at minimal
expense. It's hard to duplicate a Lexus showroom, but it's easy enough to ape the
Lexus site.

a muffler manufacturer truthfully advertised that it specialized in making mufflers for installation in Toyotas,

Toyota would have a claim of trademark infringement." Id.

          10 Toyota doesn't suggest that the Tabaris used the Lexus mark to refer to those other cars, or that

the Tabaris used the Lexus mark in order to redirect customers to those cars. Everyone seems to concede the

Tabaris are bona fide Lexus brokers. We therefore do not consider whether the Tabaris used the Lexus mark

in conjunction with brokering vehicles other than Lexus, or whether such use would be infringing.

                                                    512
        But the Tabaris submitted images of an entirely changed site at the time of
trial: The stylized mark and "L" logo were gone, and a disclaimer appeared in their
place. The disclaimer stated, prominently and in large font, "We are not an
authorized Lexus dealer or affiliated in any way with Lexus. We are an Independent
Auto Broker." While not required, such a disclaimer is relevant to the nominative
fair use analysis. See Welles, 279 F.3d at 803. Toyota claims the Tabaris' disclaimer
came too late to protect against confusion caused by their domain names, as such
confusion would occur before consumers saw the site or the disclaimer. See
Brookfield, 174 F.3d at 1057. But nothing about the Tabaris' domains would give
rise to such confusion; the Tabaris did not run their business at lexus.com, and
their domain names did not contain words like "authorized" or "official." See pp.
1178-79 supra. Reasonable consumers would arrive at the Tabaris' site agnostic as to
what they would find. Once there, they would immediately see the disclaimer and
would promptly be disabused of any notion that the Tabaris' website is sponsored
by Toyota. Because there was no risk of confusion as to sponsorship or
endorsement, the Tabaris' use of the Lexus mark was fair.

        This makeover of the Tabaris' site is relevant because Toyota seeks only
forward-looking relief. In Volkswagenwerk, we declined to order an injunction where
the defendant had likewise stopped all infringing activities by the time of trial, 411
F.2d at 352, although we've said that an injunction may be proper if there's a risk
that infringing conduct will recur, Polo Fashions, Inc. v. Dick Bruhn, Inc., 793 F.2d
1132, 1135-36 (9th Cir.1986). Even assuming some form of an injunction is
required to prevent relapse in this case, the proper remedy for infringing use of a
mark on a site generally falls short of entirely prohibiting use of the site's domain
name, as the district court did here. See Interstellar Starship, 304 F.3d at 948. "[O]nly
upon proving the rigorous elements of cyber-squatting ... have plaintiffs successfully
forced the transfer of an infringing domain name." Id. Forced relinquishment of a
domain is no less extraordinary.

        The district court is in a better position to assess in the first instance the
timing and extent of any infringing conduct, as well as the scope of the remedy, if
any remedy should prove to be required. We therefore vacate the injunction and
remand for reconsideration. The important principle to bear in mind on remand is
that a trademark injunction should be tailored to prevent ongoing violations, not
punish past conduct. Speakers do not lose the right to engage in permissible speech
simply because they may have infringed a trademark in the past.

        C. When considering the scope and timing of any infringement on remand,
the district court must eschew application of Sleekcraft and analyze the case solely
under the rubric of nominative fair use. The district court treated nominative fair
use as an affirmative defense to be established by the Tabaris only after Toyota
showed a likelihood of confusion under Sleekcraft. This was error; nominative fair

                                                    513
use "replaces" Sleekcraft as the proper test for likely consumer confusion whenever
defendant asserts to have referred to the trademarked good itself.

        On remand, Toyota must bear the burden of establishing that the Tabaris'
use of the Lexus mark was not nominative fair use. A finding of nominative fair use
is a finding that the plaintiff has failed to show a likelihood of confusion as to
sponsorship or endorsement. See Welles, 279 F.3d at 801; New Kids, 971 F.2d at 308
("Because [nominative fair use] does not implicate the source-identification function
that is the purpose of trademark, it does not constitute unfair competition.").11 And,
as the Supreme Court has unambiguously instructed, the Lanham Act always places
the "burden of proving likelihood of confusion ... on the party charging
infringement." KP Permanent Make-Up, Inc. v. Lasting Impression I, Inc., 543 U.S. 111,
118 (2004). In this case, that party is Toyota. "[A]ll the [Tabaris] need[ ] to do is to
leave the factfinder unpersuaded." Id. at 120.

        We have previously said the opposite: "[T]he nominative fair use defense
shifts to the defendant the burden of proving no likelihood of confusion." Brother
Records, Inc., 318 F.3d at 909 n.5. But that rule is plainly inconsistent with Lasting
Impression and has been "effectively overruled." Miller v. Gammie, 335 F.3d 889, 893
(9th Cir.2003) (en banc); see also 4 McCarthy on Trademarks and Unfair Competition §
23:11 at 82 n.5 (4th ed.2010). A defendant seeking to assert nominative fair use as a
defense need only show that it used the mark to refer to the trademarked good, as
the Tabaris undoubtedly have here. The burden then reverts to the plaintiff to show
a likelihood of confusion. . . .

        We vacate and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion. At the
very least, the injunction must be modified to allow some use of the Lexus mark in
domain names by the Tabaris. Trademarks are part of our common language, and
we all have some right to use them to communicate in truthful, non-misleading
ways. . . . .

FERNANDEZ, Circuit Judge, concurring:
        I concur in the majority's conclusion that the district court erred in its

handling of the nominative fair use defense. I write separately, however, because I
cannot concur in all that is said by the majority.

        First, and principally, I feel compelled to disassociate myself from statements
by the majority which are not supported by the evidence or by the district court's
findings. I simply cannot concur in essentially factual statements whose provenance

          11 This is necessarily so because, unlike classic fair use, nominative fair use is not specifically

provided for by statute. A court may find classic fair use despite "proof of infringement" because the Lanham

Act authorizes that result. See 15 U.S.C. § 1115(b)(4). Nominative fair use, on the other hand, represents a

finding of no liability under that statute's basic prohibition of infringing use. See id. § 1114.

                                                    514
is our musings rather than the record and determinations by trier of fact. For
example, on this record I do not see the basis for the majority's assertion that the
"relevant consumer is ... accustomed to shopping online"; or that "[c]onsumers who
use the internet for shopping are generally quite sophisticated" so that they are not
likely to be misled; or that "the worst that can happen is that some consumers may
arrive at [a] site uncertain as to what they will find"; or that, in fact, consumers are
agnostic and, again, not likely to be misled; or that "[r]easonable consumers would
arrive at the Tabaris' site agnostic as to what they would find."

        . . . . To the extent that the majority sees [the defendants'] activities as
especially socially worthy and above reproach, I do not agree. . . .

                                              Notes

        How do you solve a riddle like nominative use? The view that nominative uses
should not give rise to trademark liability is a venerable one but there are different
ways to formalize it. Some courts treat nominative fair use as a defense. Is that what
the Ninth Circuit does? Check footnote 11. How else might courts treat nominative
uses?

        For those courts recognizing nominative fair use as a distinct doctrine (rather
than as an issue that may be addressed in basic likelihood of confusion analysis, as
discussed below) there is a divide as to whether it is a defense. The Ninth Circuit, as
you read in the Toyota case, treats nominative fair use analysis as a replacement for
the ordinary multifactor test where nominative uses are at issue. Its test is therefore
a test for likelihood-of-confusion and not, properly speaking, a "defense."

        In contrast, the Third Circuit treats nominative fair use as a true defense to
be considered after a court uses a modified version of the multifactor test to find the
existence of a likelihood of confusion. Century 21 Real Estate Corp. v. Lendingtree,
Inc., 425 F.3d 211, 223 n.3 (3d Cir. 2005) ("A nominative use defendant need only
prove fairness and is not required to negate confusion.").

        What are the advantages of the Third Circuit's approach? Disadvantages?
What is the legal source of the nominative fair use doctrine? Does that help with
determining whether it should be treated as a defense or not?

        Other ways of handling nominative uses. Another way of handling nominative
fair use situations is to treat them like ordinary infringement claims, addressing the
specifics of the nominative use in context of disposing of the claim. See, e.g.,
Century 21, 425 F.3d at 232 (Fisher, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part)
(criticizing modification because "to the extent the majority places any burden on
plaintiffs at all, it is so watered-down that plaintiffs might prove likely confusion on
one Lapp factor alone"). Or courts may just deal with nominative fair use in a more

                                                    515
rough and ready manner. For example, recall the Tiffany case (the jeweler's litigation
against eBay for hosting listings that sold counterfeit Tiffany goods). In addition to
rejecting Tiffany's contributory infringement claim against eBay, the Second Circuit
turned aside a direct infringement claim based on eBay's display of the Tiffany mark
in its listings. The court explained (Tiffany (NJ) Inc. v. eBay Inc., 600 F.3d 93, 102-
03 (2d Cir. 2010)):

        We need not address the viability of the [nominative fair use] doctrine to
        resolve Tiffany's claim, however. We have recognized that a defendant may
        lawfully use a plaintiff's trademark where doing so is necessary to describe
        the plaintiff's product and does not imply a false affiliation or endorsement
        by the plaintiff of the defendant. "While a trademark conveys an exclusive
        right to the use of a mark in commerce in the area reserved, that right
        generally does not prevent one who trades a branded product from
        accurately describing it by its brand name, so long as the trader does not
        create confusion by implying an affiliation with the owner of the product."
        Dow Jones & Co. v. Int'l Sec. Exch., Inc., 451 F.3d 295, 308 (2d Cir.2006) .
        . . cf. Prestonettes, Inc. v. Coty, 264 U.S. 359, 368 (1924) (when a "mark is
        used in a way that does not deceive the public," there is "no such sanctity in
        the word as to prevent its being used to tell the truth. It is not taboo.").

        We agree with the district court that eBay's use of Tiffany's mark on its
        website and in sponsored links was lawful. eBay used the mark to describe
        accurately the genuine Tiffany goods offered for sale on its website. And
        none of eBay's uses of the mark suggested that Tiffany affiliated itself with
        eBay or endorsed the sale of its products through eBay's website.

        And now for something even more complicated. For reasons known only to
themselves, a panel of the Second Circuit decided to further complicate nominative
fair use in a 2016 opinion.

        Because we believe that the nominative fair use factors will be helpful to a
        district court's analysis, we hold that, in nominative use cases, district courts
        are to consider the Ninth Circuit and Third Circuit's nominative fair use
        factors, in addition to the Polaroid factors. When considering a likelihood of
        confusion in nominative fair use cases, in addition to discussing each of the
        Polaroid factors, courts are to consider: (1) whether the use of the plaintiff's
        mark is necessary to describe both the plaintiff's product or service and the
        defendant's product or service, that is, whether the product or service is not
        readily identifiable without use of the mark; (2) whether the defendant uses
        only so much of the plaintiff's mark as is necessary to identify the product or

                                                    516
service; and (3) whether the defendant did anything that would, in
conjunction with the mark, suggest sponsorship or endorsement by the
plaintiff holder, that is, whether the defendant's conduct or language reflects
the true or accurate relationship between plaintiff's and defendant's products
or services.

When assessing the second nominative fair use factor, courts are to consider
whether the alleged infringer "step[ped] over the line into a likelihood of
confusion by using the senior user's mark too prominently or too often, in
terms of size, emphasis, or repetition." McCarthy § 23:11; see, e.g., PACCAR
Inc. v. TeleScan Technologies, L.L.C., 319 F.3d 243, 256 (6th Cir.2003) ("Using
[the plaintiff's] trademarks in its domain names, repeating the marks in the
main titles of the web sites and in the wallpaper underlying the web sites,
and mimicking the distinctive fonts of the marks go beyond using the marks
`as is reasonably necessary to identify' [the plaintiff's] trucks, parts, and
dealers."), abrogated on other grounds by KP Permanent Make-Up, Inc., 543 U.S.
at 116-17; Brother Records, Inc. v. Jardine, 318 F.3d 900, 908 (9th Cir.2003)
(considering the fact that the defendant used the mark " `The Beach Boys'
more prominently and boldly" than the rest of its name "The Beach Boys
Family and Friends" such that event organizers and members of the audience
were confused about who was performing); Playboy Enters., Inc. v. Welles, 279
F.3d 796, 804 (9th Cir.2002) (holding that defendant's repeated use of the
abbreviation "PMOY '81" meaning "Playmate of the Year 1981" on the
background/wallpaper of her website failed to establish nominative fair use
because "[t]he repeated depiction of "PMOY '81" is not necessary to describe
[the defendant]"), abrogated on other grounds by Miller v. Gammie, 335 F.3d 889
(9th Cir.2003); cf. Swarovski Aktiengesellschaft v. Building No. 19, Inc., 704 F.3d
44, 51-52 (1st Cir.2013) (reversing preliminary injunction restricting
discount retailer from using large size font in advertising sale of "Swarovski"
crystal figurines because lower court erred by assuming that retailer used
"more of the mark than necessary" without determining if large size font was
likely to cause consumer confusion).

Additionally, when considering the third nominative fair use factor, courts
must not, as the district court did here, consider only source confusion, but
rather must consider confusion regarding affiliation, sponsorship, or
endorsement by the mark holder. See Courtenay Commc'ns Corp. v. Hall, 334
F.3d 210, 213 n. 1 (2d Cir.2003) (vacating dismissal of Lanham Act claims
and holding nominative fair use did not supply alternative grounds for
dismissal because defendant's "hyperlink connection to a page of

                                           517
        endorsements suggests affiliation, sponsorship, or endorsement by" the
        plaintiff (internal quotation marks omitted)).
        We therefore remand for reconsideration of the Polaroid factors in addition
        to the nominative fair use factors, keeping in mind the numerous types of
        confusion that are relevant to an infringement analysis other than mere
        source confusion and the numerous ways in which a certification mark may
        be infringed.
Int'l Info. Sys. Sec. Certification Consortium, Inc. v. Sec. Univ., LLC, 823 F.3d
153, 168-69 (2d Cir. 2016). Worse, the court emphasized, in an omitted footnote,
that "with reference to the Polaroid factors, this combination of factors is not
exclusive, and other factors may be considered where relevant." Cert was, sadly,
denied.

Green Field repaints the balls and fills gashes with a plastic material. The original
trademark remains visible. When Green Field sells the reconditioned balls, it does
so under its own label. It includes a conspicuous disclaimer that says
"Reconditioned balls; repaired by Green Field, which is not affiliated with the
original manufacturer." Some of the balls are warped from past use, so they are not
of equal quality to newly purchased balls. Is Green Field vulnerable to suit from the
original manufacturers?

The "first-sale" or "exhaustion" doctrine

        Patent, copyright, and trademark law all have a version of the first-sale or
exhaustion doctrine. The principle is simple: the ability of an IP holder to control
the sale of a protected product is exhausted after its first authorized sale. So, in the
copyright context, a copyright owner can control whether copies of the protected
work may be prepared for sale. But once you make an authorized purchase, you
have the right to sell your copy regardless of the copyright holder's wishes.

        This principle extends to trademark law. Under trademark's first-sale
doctrine, the resale of a genuine trademarked good does not create liability for
trademark infringement (in other words, the trademark holder cannot claim that
the second sale by its customer would create confusion as to source or sponsorship).
"It is the essence of the `first sale' doctrine that a purchaser who does no more than
stock, display, and resell a producer's product under the producer's trademark

                                                    519
violates no right conferred upon the producer by the Lanham Act. When a
purchaser resells a trademarked article under the producer's trademark, and
nothing more, there is no actionable misrepresentation under the statute."
Sebastian Intern., Inc. v. Longs Drug Stores Corp., 53 F.3d 1073, 1076 (9th Cir.
1995). We can see here an accommodation of trademark's tensions. After all, it is
possible that consumers might believe that the reseller of a trademarked good is
affiliated with the original seller, Mary Kay, Inc. v. Weber, 601 F. Supp. 2d 839, 849
(N.D. Tex. 2009) (rejecting survey that measured evidence of consumers confused
by defendant's resale of plaintiff's branded product as measuring "irrelevant
confusion"). Such an approach would stifle competition, raising prices for
consumers and undermining expectations about what may be done with purchased
property.

        The "first sale" rule provides a sensible and stable accommodation between
        strong and potentially conflicting forces. By guaranteeing that a product will
        be identified with its producer, it serves the legitimate purposes of trademark
        law--the producer gains the good will associated with the quality of its
        product, and the consumer gets exactly what the consumer bargains for, the
        genuine product of the particular producer. On the other hand, the "first
        sale" rule preserves an area for competition by limiting the producer's power
        to control the resale of its product.

Sebastian, 53 F.3d at 1075 (footnote omitted). Of course, if a reseller removed the
trademark (to avoid a claim of false sponsorship) one could expect a reverse passing
off claim to follow. Thus the need for a defense for resale activities. Interestingly,
the defense is not statutory (this is also the case with patent, but not copyright, law).
If not in the statute, what is its doctrinal basis?

        Exceptions. The first-sale doctrine is not absolute. For example, just because
one may resell a good does not mean that one may falsely represent that one is an
authorized dealer. The reseller also may not alter the goods in a material way
without disclosure, or transform them into another product altogether that retains
the original mark. There is therefore potential infringement where a defendant
rebuilds or modifies the goods in some manner. Case law fights over what material
differences are.

        Likelihood of confusion remains the touchstone for analysis. So long as
consumers are not confused, refurbishing trademarked products is legal.
Prestonettes, Inc. v. Coty, 264 U.S. 359, 369 (1924) (Holmes, J.) ("If the defendant's
rebottling the plaintiff's perfume deteriorates it and the public is adequately
informed who does the rebottling, the public, with or without the plaintiff's

                                                    520
assistance, is likely to find it out."). Of course, as we've seen, it can be hard to
predict when a court will conclude consumers will be confused. Labels play a large
role in avoiding such findings, as Professor McCarthy explains:

        Under the authority of the COTY case, the courts have required a repacker
        and rebottler to use a label closely following the label approved in the COTY
        case. That is, the label, if it is to use the trademark of the original
        manufacturer, must clearly state: (1) that the trademarked product has been
        rebottled or repacked; (2) that the rebottler or repacker is wholly separate
        and distinct from the original manufacturer; (3) the name of the rebottler or
        repacker. A fourth requirement is that the label not emphasize the original
        manufacturer's trademark by putting it in larger type, different color or size,
        etc.

4 MCCARTHY § 25:35 (footnote omitted). See also Champion Spark Plug Co. v.
Sanders, 331 U.S. 125 (1947) (allowing sales of reconditioned, but so labeled, spark
plugs). But see id. at 129 ("Cases may be imagined where the reconditioning or
repair would be so extensive or so basic that it would be a misnomer to call the
article by its original name, even though the words `used' or `repaired' were
added."). This latter qualification is a frequent battleground. See generally 4
MCCARTHY § 25:40 (collecting cases). For example, Rolex Watch USA, Incorporated v.
BeckerTime, L.L.C., 96 F.4th 715 (5th Cir. 2024), recited these facts:

        BeckerTime sells primarily decades-old preowned watches containing Rolex
        branded parts. The at-issue watches in this case are watches sold by
        BeckerTime that are identified as "Genuine Rolex," but contain both Rolex
        and non-Rolex parts. The watches specifically considered by the district court
        contained additional diamonds, which were added "as hour markers to the
        refinished dials by drilling holes in the dials and placing aftermarket
        diamonds or other stones and settings in the holes." To refinish dials,
        BeckerTime "strips the dial down to bare metal, then, after the refurbishing
        process is complete, reapplies Rolex's trademarks." These "modifications" are
        not performed or authorized by Rolex.

        BeckerTime lists the retail prices of their modified watches with comparison
        prices to new Rolex watches, but for the watches considered, the district
        court found that "Rolex has never sold a watch matching the description"
        provided by BeckerTime. The at-issue watches contain "at least one Rolex
        trademark" and "aftermarket bezels (not made or endorsed by Rolex) ...
        including bezels with added diamonds." BeckerTime further applies
        "aftermarket bands or straps (not made or endorsed by Rolex)" that

                                                    521
        "sometimes include a genuine Rolex clasp or buckle displaying Rolex's
        trademarks." The parts BeckerTime adds to the at-issue watches "do not bear
        any markings indicating BeckerTime is the source." Further, the district
        court found that the parts replaced, such as the bezel, dials, and bracelets,
        "are integral and necessary to the at-issue watches."

Here, the circuit court upheld a ruling in Rolex's favor, concluding that the
defendant's conduct fell under the "misnomer" exception to Champion. Id. at 722
("Unlike the plugs in Champion that `are nevertheless Champion plugs and not
those of another make,' BeckerTime's watches are of another make and cannot
properly be called genuine Rolex watches. (quoting Champion, 331 U.S. at 128)).

        Some cases emphasize the trademark holders' right to exercise quality control
as opening the door to infringement claims based on the resale of wholesale goods
at the retail level under the original marks. Shell Oil Co. v. Commercial Petroleum,
Inc., 733 F. Supp. 40 (W.D.N.C. 1989), aff'd, 928 F.2d 104 (4th Cir. 1991). Cases
in this line may be in tension with the principles of first sale. Polymer Technology
Corp. v. Mimran, 37 F.3d 74, 80 (2d Cir. 1994) ("[A]lthough consumers may
wonder why they are able to buy a product that is labeled `For Professional
Distribution Only' in a retail store, they are certainly not being deceived about what
they are receiving.").

                        Hamilton International Ltd. v. Vortic LLC
                                 13 F.4th 264 (2d Cir. 2021)

Cronan, District Judge[*]:
        Plaintiff-Appellant Hamilton International Ltd. ("Hamilton"), a large and

well-known manufacturer of watches, brought suit against . . . Vortic Watch Co.
("Vortic"), and its founder Robert Thomas Custer, alleging trademark infringement,
counterfeiting, unfair competition, and dilution. Vortic, also a watchmaker, sold
"The Lancaster," a watch that featured refurbished antique pocket watch parts
retaining Hamilton's original trademark. . . .

        This case turns on the question of consumer confusion. The Supreme Court
in Champion Spark Plug Co. v. Sanders held that in the context of refurbished goods,
the likelihood of consumer confusion is determined by looking to the disclosures a
second-hand dealer provides to purchasers. 331 U.S. 125, 128-31 (1947). The
District Court, relying on Champion, first concluded that Vortic had fully disclosed
the watch's restoration and lack of affiliation with Hamilton. The District Court
then considered the general factors that we have identified as informing the

          * Sitting by designation.

                                                    522
likelihood of confusion in trademark infringement actions. Weighing both Vortic's
full disclosure under Champion and the relevant Polaroid factors, the District Court
found no likelihood that a significant number of ordinary prudent purchasers
would be misled by the use of Hamilton's mark on The Lancaster.

        . . . . In affirming the District Court, we confirm that a plaintiff in a
trademark infringement suit bears the burden of proving that a defendant's use of
the mark is likely to mislead consumers, even when Champion is implicated, and
that no particular order of analysis is required provided that the court considers all
appropriate factors in light of the circumstances of the case. . . .

        . . . . Prior to 1969, Hamilton manufactured pocket watches at its U.S.
factory in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Custer founded Vortic in 2013 and, seeking to
"preserve American history," endeavored to make a watch that would be "100%
Made in America." Custer discovered, however, that at the time, no active
companies in the United States produced watch movements, i.e., "the gears and
springs in a system needed to tell time." As a result, Vortic salvaged and restored
parts from antique American-made pocket watches originally manufactured in the
late 1800s and early 1900s and then encased them in new wristwatches. Those
included antique parts from watches bearing Hamilton's trademark.

        At issue is Vortic's line of wristwatches called "The Lancaster." Named after
the Pennsylvania city where Hamilton was originally based, The Lancaster features
restored antique pocket watch movements and front dials made by the Hamilton
Watch Company between 1894 and 1950. The Lancaster has a large pocket watch-
style knob located at the 12 o'clock position. The watch's wrist strap and the case
surrounding its movements and dial--as well as various internal engineering parts
such as the crowns, screws, and inserts--were manufactured by Vortic or came from
modern sources in the United States. Because Vortic used a restored original front
dial, Hamilton's trademark is readily visible on the front of the watch. The back of
The Lancaster is encased in a glass cover, revealing the watch's movements, which
feature the engraved words, "Hamilton Watch Lancaster, PA." The back case is
surrounded by a metal ring with the words "Vortic Watch Co." and "The
Lancaster" engraved on it, along with Vortic's serial number for the watch. Below is
a picture of the front and back of The Lancaster:

                                                    523
        Vortic produced and distributed fifty-eight of these watches from 2014 to
2018. Each buyer received the watch in a wooden box with a booklet that displayed
Vortic's logo and described Vortic's manufacturing, assembly, and restoration
process. The box also contained an original watchmaking certificate, when available,
as well as a "Vortic Watch Company Authentication Card." That card provided the
watch's Vortic serial number and movement serial number, and was signed by the
Vortic watchmaker who did the conversion. Vortic's advertisements for The
Lancaster similarly emphasized the antique and authentic nature of the watch's
parts.

        [Hamilton sued, alleging "that Vortic, at Custer's direction, sold The
Lancaster with Hamilton's mark and without Hamilton's consent or authorization,
causing confusion as to the watch's origin and giving the false impression that the
watch was offered by, or affiliated with, Hamilton . . . ." After a bench trial, the
district court ruled in favor of the defendants.]

       1. The District Court's Application of Champion
        We begin with Hamilton's argument that the District Court erred in
applying Champion to assess whether there was a likelihood of consumer confusion.
The District Court identified and applied the Polaroid factors, focusing on the ones
that it found particularly relevant in this action. But the District Court also correctly
recognized that application of these non-exhaustive factors is not a "mechanical
process," and "depending on the complexity of the issues, `the court may have to
take still other variables into account.' " (first quoting Guthrie Healthcare Sys. v.
ContextMedia, Inc., 826 F.3d 27, 37 (2d Cir. 2016); and then quoting Savin Corp. v.

                                                    524
Savin Grp., 391 F.3d 439, 456 (2d Cir. 2004)). Thus, while Polaroid articulated
general standards to apply in assessing consumer confusion, particular situations
may call for a more refined analysis. In its 1947 decision in Champion, the Supreme
Court identified one such situation.

        In Champion, a manufacturer of spark plugs with the trademark "Champion"
sued a second-hand dealer who collected used "Champion" plugs, refurbished
them, and sold them. The Supreme Court found it permissible for the reused plugs
to retain the "Champion" trademark, despite the second-hand dealer lacking
authorization to use that trademark, because of disclosures made by that seller. The
Court determined that the retention of the "Champion" logo would not mislead
consumers, because the plugs were "nevertheless Champion plugs and not those of
another make," and contained the words "Used" or "Repaired" stamped on the
plugs, which "serve[d] the requirements of full disclosure." In reaching this result,
the Court explained that while "inferiority is expected in most second-hand
articles," any "[i]nferiority is immaterial so long as the article is clearly and
distinctively sold as repaired or reconditioned rather than as new." Citing its prior
decision in Prestonettes, the Court explained that it "is wholly permissible" for a
second-hand dealer to obtain an advantage from the trademark, "so long as the
manufacturer is not identified with the inferior qualities of the product resulting
from wear and tear or the reconditioning by the dealer." "Full disclosure," the
Court explained, "gives the manufacturer all the protection to which he is entitled."
The Champion Court cautioned, however, that "[c]ases may be imagined where the
reconditioning or repair would be so extensive or so basic that it would be a
misnomer to call the article by its original name, even though the words `used' or
`repaired' were added." The takeaway from Champion is that, when a used "genuine
product" is resold after being refurbished, the seller's disclosures and the extent of a
product's modifications are significant factors to consider in whether that seller is
liable for trademark infringement.

        Hamilton argues that the "reconditioning or repair" that went into The
Lancaster was so extensive that the District Court erred in applying Champion in the
first place. According to Hamilton, The Lancaster is not "a modified genuine
Hamilton product," but rather a "new watch that contains various Hamilton parts."
We find no error in the District Court's determination that the facts as found at
trial brought this case under Champion.

         The District Court determined, with ample support from the evidence
adduced at trial, that Vortic used genuine, original parts from pocket watches made
by Hamilton, refurbished and repaired them, and modified them into a wristwatch.
The only modification to the original movements was the replacement of a lever
which makes it easier for users to change the time. Describing this as an "apparently
slight modification," the District Court noted that Hamilton failed to put forth any

                                                    525
reason why such a modification would have been "particularly significant to
consumers or ... somehow material to a likelihood of confusion." And after
inspecting the watch, as well as viewing photographs of the watch, the District
Court concluded that a consumer would view The Lancaster as an antique pocket
watch modified into a wristwatch rather than an entirely new product. ("[T]he
Court finds that the watch obviously presents to a viewer as restored antique pocket
watch movement, face, and hands ... reincorporated into a new wristwatch. ... [T]he
hands, face, and movement have a patina, style, and look that convey that they are
restored antiques."). In light of those findings, which were supported by the trial
evidence and were not clearly erroneous, the District Court properly analyzed
Hamilton's federal trademark infringement claim under the framework laid out in
Champion.

       2. Champion's Interaction with the Polaroid Factors and the Burden of
Proof

        Hamilton also takes issue with the sequence in which the District Court
considered Champion and Polaroid. Hamilton argues that the District Court erred by
failing to first determine the likelihood of confusion under the Polaroid factors
before turning to the "full disclosure" analysis under Champion. Hamilton contends
that a defendant bears the burden of showing that Champion's "full disclosure"
standard is met, and that the weight accorded this burden can only be determined
by first measuring the level of confusion through an analysis of the Polaroid factors.

         We conclude that the District Court did not err in declining to require
Vortic to prove the effectiveness of its disclosures under Champion. Initially, it is
worth noting that Vortic did in fact offer proof that its disclosures were effective:
Custer testified that the company has never been contacted by anyone confused as
to Hamilton's affiliation with Vortic's watches, and Hamilton offered no evidence
to the contrary that the District Court found reliable. But more importantly, in a
trademark infringement case, the plaintiff bears the burden of proving a likelihood
of consumer confusion in the alleged infringer's use of the mark. The District Court
correctly looked to Champion and at the disclosures made by Vortic in determining
whether Hamilton met that burden. . . .

        Furthermore, our precedents confirm that a court is not required to consider
factors relevant to likelihood of confusion in any set order. . . . In the context of
trademark infringement cases involving the resale of refurbished goods, Champion
informs that consumer confusion analysis. Both Polaroid and Champion are thus
aimed at discerning whether a consumer would be misled by the defendant's use of
the plaintiff's trademark. There is no hard and fast order in which a court must
undertake that analysis.

                                                    526
        In sum, the District Court properly placed the burden of proving trademark
infringement on Hamilton, and correctly analyzed the relevant considerations under
Polaroid and Champion.

        3. The District Court's Findings Under Champion and Polaroid
        We turn next to Hamilton's challenges to the District Court's findings under
Champion and Polaroid. We find no error, clear or otherwise, in either.
        In conducting its Champion analysis, the District Court identified several
ways that Vortic disclosed that The Lancaster contained refurbished original parts
and was not affiliated with Hamilton. For example, a magazine advertisement
explained that Vortic's watches are "custom fabricated using railroad era, American
made pocket watch movements to create timeless, one-of-a-kind wristwatches for
individuals with contemporary vision." Another advertisement explained: "All of
the components (movement, dial, hands) between the two Gorilla Glass crystals are
~ 100 years old, and started their life in a Railroad-Era pocket watch made by the
Hamilton Watch Company. The watches were made in Lancaster Pennsylvania in
the late 1800's and early 1900's." Vortic's website further stated that the company
"uses vintage movements whose case has been scrapped for its precious metal value,
and meticulously restores the inner workings in order to build a completely custom
watch around it."
        In addition to these promotional materials, the District Court cited the
watch itself in assessing the adequacy of Vortic's disclosures. Relying on its own
examination of The Lancaster, the District Court explained that the watch--with its
larger size, the 12 o'clock knob position, and the general look of its parts as restored
antiques--"obviously presents to a viewer as restored antique pocket watch
movement, face, and hands that have been reincorporated into a new wristwatch."
The District Court further found that The Lancaster "would convey to any ordinary
prudent purchaser that the watch was made by Vortic and that the Hamilton mark
is displayed only because Hamilton created the original movement, face, and hands
that have subsequently been restored," "not[ing] that `Vortic,' `Lancaster,' and the
serial number are all prominently engraved on the case while the Hamilton mark is
only visible inside the glass case, on a movement and face that appear obviously
antique."
        These factual findings, all firmly grounded in the record, fully supported the
District Court's conclusion that Vortic adequately disclosed the origin of The
Lancaster and its lack of affiliation with Hamilton. And the District Court properly
weighed Vortic's full disclosure heavily in its consumer confusion analysis. . . .
        Nor was there any clear error in the District Court's factual findings as to the
Polaroid factors. In light of its determination that Vortic provided full disclosure
under Champion, the District Court found three Polaroid factors to be particularly

                                                    527
significant in this case: actual confusion, the defendant's good faith in adopting the
mark, and the product's customer base. . . .

        The District Court first found that Hamilton failed to proffer any proof of
actual confusion . . . . Similarly, the District Court's finding that Custer and Vortic
did not act in bad faith was supported by Custer's trial testimony describing his
intent in founding Vortic and manufacturing The Lancaster. Nor do we accept
Hamilton's unsupported proposition that continued sales of The Lancaster after
Vortic's receipt of a cease-and-desist letter necessarily demonstrates bad faith.
Finally, the District Court's finding as to the sophistication of the relevant
consumer base was grounded in uncontroverted evidence that the average price of
Vortic's watches ranged from $1,500 to $5,000, as well as Custer's testimony
describing Vortic's customers as "college-educated men ... with above-average
income," most of whom "own multiple wristwatches."

        We also find no error in the District Court's determination that the other
Polaroid factors were less relevant in this case.6 But regardless, the District Court
considered each of the five remaining Polaroid factors and properly weighed them in
accordance with the trial evidence.

        While the District Court determined that Hamilton's mark was "relatively
strong," it found that the other factors supported entering judgment in favor of
Vortic and Custer on Hamilton's federal trademark claim. Relying on the
disclosures that it discussed in its Champion analysis, the District Court properly
concluded that the "similarity of the marks" factor did not support a finding of
confusion given the context in which the mark appeared on The Lancaster. [The
court went on to approve of the district court's treatment of the proximity, bridging
the gap, and product quality factors.]

        As the above discussion demonstrates, a common theme emerged from the
bench trial: Hamilton--which bore the burden of establishing confusion--failed to
come forward with any reliable evidence showing that consumers were likely to be
misled. We find no clear error in the District Court's factual findings in connection
with its analysis under Champion or in connection with the Polaroid factors. We
further conclude that the District Court correctly applied Champion and Polaroid to

          6 Indeed, the District Court's decision to place less emphasis on certain Polaroid factors is consistent
with Champion. The defendant in Champion used the plaintiff's exact trademark, and the Supreme Court
noted that while "inferiority is expected in most second-hand articles," it is "immaterial so long as the article
is clearly and distinctively sold as repaired or reconditioned rather than as new." Accordingly, the Court
suggested that as long as there was full disclosure as to the refurbished nature of the item, factors such as the
strength of the mark, similarity between marks, and quality of the products would be less relevant. Similarly,
while a traditional Polaroid analysis instructs that closer competitive proximity of the products leads to a
greater probability of consumer confusion, the analysis in Champion suggests that in the context of second-
hand goods, similarity of the products could work to a defendant's advantage.

                                                    528
these factual findings to conclude that there was no likelihood of consumer
confusion.

                                     Notes and Questions

        Why Polaroid? If Champion is a substitute for an ordinary likelihood-of-
confusion inquiry, why did the district court employ the multifactor test? Would it
have been error to rely exclusively on Champion?

        Suppose the district court found instead that Vortic met the requirements of
Champion but consideration of the Polaroid factors nonetheless pointed to a finding
of infringement. What then? By the same token, what if the court ultimately
decided that Champion did not apply due to the extent of the changes to plaintiff's
materials. Would the accurate disclosures still compel a ruling in favor of
defendants? On what basis? Could one argue nominative fair use?

        What do we want? Does Hamilton experience any harm from Vortic's
conduct? If Vortic could easily remove the name "Hamilton" from the face of the
watch should it do so? Would that make the watch more or less desirable?

        New products. Should it matter to the doctrine if the trademarked product is
incorporated into a new product? See, e.g., Bluetooth SIG Inc. v. FCA US LLC, 30
F.4th 870, 871 (9th Cir. 2022) ("Does the first sale doctrine apply when a
trademarked product has been incorporated in a new product? We answer yes."
(cleaned up)).

"Gray" goods

                        Hokto Kinoko Co. v. Concord Farms, Inc.
                                738 F.3d 1085 (9th Cir. 2013)

WARDLAW, Circuit Judge:
        . . . . Hokuto Japan is a Japanese corporation that produces mushrooms in

Japan. These mushrooms include maitake, white beech (marketed as "Bunapi"), and
brown beech (marketed as "Bunashimeji") mushrooms, and are sold in 3.5 ounce
packages. Hokuto Japan's mushrooms are grown in nonorganic conditions
throughout Japan and sold in Japanese-language packaging.

        In 2006, Hokuto Japan incorporated Hokto USA, also a Japanese
corporation, to produce and market mushrooms in the United States. Hokto USA
is a wholly owned subsidiary of Hokuto Japan. Like Hokuto Japan, Hokto USA
produces white beech, brown beech, and maitake mushrooms. Unlike Hokuto
Japan's mushrooms, however, Hokto USA's mushrooms are certified organic and

                                                    529
produced in a state-of-the-art facility in San Marcos, California. Hokto USA's
mushrooms are robotically transported within the facility in plastic bottles, and its
entire process is computer controlled. While most mushroom-growing techniques
involve manure and compost, Hokto USA uses a sterilized culture medium made of
sawdust, corn cob pellets, vegetable protein, and other nutrients. Hokto USA also
enforces strict temperature controls and other quality control standards, both in its
San Marcos facility and during the transportation and storage of its mushrooms, to
ensure that the mushrooms stay fresh for as long as possible.

        The production of mushrooms in the United States did not start off quite as
smoothly as planned. Although Hokto USA was incorporated in 2006, its San
Marcos growing facility was not completed until 2009. While the facility was under
construction, Hokto USA resorted to importing mushrooms from Hokuto Japan.
Because U.S. consumers have different preferences than Japanese consumers,
Hokuto Japan grew mushrooms for Hokto USA in special conditions. Most
significantly, Hokuto Japan used a special growing medium that met U.S. Certified
Organic standards. Hokuto Japan also worked with Hokto USA to develop English-
language packaging for the U.S. market. The packaging identified the mushrooms as
"Certified Organic" and provided nutritional information geared toward U.S.
consumers.

        When the San Marcos facility finally opened in 2009, Hokto USA began
producing its own mushrooms and stopped importing Hokuto Japan's mushrooms.
But in 2010, there was a shortfall of white beech mushrooms. To meet its
customers' demand, Hokto USA imported two shipments of Hokuto Japan's
inferior white beech mushrooms, which were produced in Japan and sold in
Hokuto Japan's usual Japanese-language packaging. Before selling these mushrooms
to U.S. consumers, Hokto USA affixed a white sticker to every package, which
clearly identified the mushrooms as a product of Japan and identified the product
as "white beech mushrooms." The white stickers also identified the "distributor" as
Hokto USA and provided U.S. customer service information.
B. The Trademarks

        In 2003, Hokuto Japan acquired Japanese trademark registrations for a series
of marks ("Hokto marks"), including variations on its logo and several mushroom-
shaped cartoon characters with faces, arms, and legs. These registrations protected
Hokuto Japan's rights to use the marks to market a wide variety of goods, ranging
from mushrooms to live fish to bonsai trees.

        Hokuto Japan also sought U.S. trademark registrations on the same
marks . . . . The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) issued
registrations for the cartoon-character marks (Reg. Nos. 3182866, 3179700, and
3182867) in December 2006 and for the Hokto logo (Reg. No. 3210268) on
February 20, 2007, for use in connection with all of the listed goods . . . .

                                                    530
        In August 2008, Hokuto Japan granted Hokto USA a license for the
exclusive use of the marks in the United States. In 2010, Hokuto Japan assigned all
of its rights under the American trademark registrations to Hokto USA. Both the
mushrooms sold by Hokuto Japan in Japan and those sold by Hokto USA in the
United States are marketed in packaging that prominently features the Hokto
marks . . . .
C. Concord Farms

        Meanwhile, Concord Farms, a U.S. corporation that grows and imports
mushrooms, has been importing Hokuto Japan's mushrooms from Japan since
2003. From 2003 to 2009, Concord Farms imported Hokuto Japan's maitake,
brown beech, and white beech mushrooms. Since 2009, it has imported only the
maitake mushrooms. Because Concord Farms purchases these products through a
series of wholesalers, Hokuto Japan was initially unaware that Concord Farms was
importing its mushrooms. The mushrooms Concord Farms imports into the United
States are the nonorganic mushrooms that Hokuto Japan produces in Japan for
Japanese consumption and are packaged in the Japanese packaging, which features
the Hokto marks. Concord Farms's warehouse is not temperature controlled, and
Concord Farms does not impose formal limits on how long mushrooms are kept in
the warehouse.

        In July 2009, Hokto USA learned that Concord Farms imports Hokuto
Japan's mushrooms when Hokto USA's representative saw packages of Hokuto
Japan's Japanese-packaged, nonorganic maitake mushrooms mixed with packages of
Hokto USA's maitake mushrooms in a grocery store display. All of the mushrooms
were under a sign that said "organic" and "made in USA," but the Japanese
products under the sign were neither. There was too much moisture in the Hokuto
Japan packages, and the mushrooms were going bad. The store's manager told
Hokto USA's representative that he had purchased the Hokuto Japan mushrooms
from Concord Farms. At a produce exposition three months later, Hokto USA's
representative requested that Concord Farms refrain from importing, selling, or
distributing Hokuto Japan's mushrooms. Concord Farms refused. . . .

                                       III. Discussion
A. Gray-Market Goods

        The crux of Hokto USA's claim is that when Concord Farms imported
mushrooms bearing the Hokto marks from Hokuto Japan and sold those
mushrooms in the United States, it infringed Hokto USA's rights to those marks.
This case thus implicates the set of trademark principles governing so-called "gray-
market goods": goods that are legitimately produced and sold abroad under a
particular trademark, and then imported and sold in the United States in
competition with the U.S. trademark holder's products.

                                                    531
        The Supreme Court has explained that a gray-market good is "a foreign-
manufactured good, bearing a valid United States trademark, that is imported
without the consent of the United States trademark holder." K Mart Corp. v. Cartier,
Inc., 486 U.S. 281, 285 (1988). The mushrooms at issue here fit comfortably within
the Supreme Court's definition. Some commentators apply the term "gray market"
only where both the trademark owner and the alleged infringer import their
product from foreign countries, see J. Thomas McCarthy, McCarthy on Trademarks
and Unfair Competition § 29:46 (4th ed.2005), or only where the U.S. trademark
owner also owns foreign rights in the disputed mark, see 1 Jerome Gilson, Trademark
Protection and Practice § 4.05[6] (2004). Regardless of whether we categorize the
mushrooms here as gray-market goods, however, the fundamental nature of the
infringement claim is the same as that in gray-market cases: Hokto USA alleges that
Concord Farms violated its trademarks by importing legitimately produced goods
sold under those same marks.
B. Genuine Goods

        In general, the sale of gray-market goods may infringe on the U.S. trademark
holder's rights, subject to the consumer confusion analysis that generally governs
trademark infringement claims. An exception to this rule, however, is that
trademark law does not extend to the sale of "genuine goods." If the Japanese-
produced Hokuto Japan mushrooms that Concord Farms imported were "genuine"
Hokto USA goods, then Concord Farms would not be liable for trademark
infringement. The district court correctly concluded that the mushrooms were not
"genuine goods."

        We have approached the "genuine good" inquiry both as a threshold
question for the applicability of trademark law, and as part of the test for consumer
confusion. Compare NEC Elecs. v. CAL Circuit Abco, 810 F.2d 1506, 1509 (9th
Cir.1987) ("Trademark law generally does not reach the sale of genuine goods...."
(emphasis added)), with Am. Circuit Breaker, 406 F.3d at 585 (analyzing genuineness
within discussion of the absence of the likelihood of confusion). Here, because we
confront a classic gray-market case, we must analyze the genuine goods question as a
threshold matter, for if Concord Farms's mushrooms are "genuine," it is not subject
to liability for trademark infringement.

        1. The No-Material-Difference Requirement
        "Genuine," in the trademark context, is a term of art: a gray-market good is
"genuine" only if it does not materially differ from the U.S. trademark owner's
product. See, e.g., McCarthy, supra, § 29:51.75 ("[I]f there are material differences
between the gray market imports and the authorized imports, then the gray market
imports are not `genuine' goods and can create a likelihood of confusion."); see also
Iberia Foods Corp. v. Romeo, 150 F.3d 298, 303 (3d Cir.1998) (explaining that where
goods are marketed under "identical marks but are materially different ... the alleged

                                                    532
infringer's goods are considered `non-genuine' and the sale of the goods constitutes
infringement" (citations omitted)); Societe Des Produits Nestle, S.A. v. Casa Helvetia,
Inc., 982 F.2d 633, 638 (1st Cir.1992) ("It follows that the Venezuelan chocolates
purveyed by Casa Helvetia were not `genuine' ... if they (a) were not authorized for
sale in the United States and (b) differed materially from the authorized (Italian-
made) version.").

        We first established that trademark law does not extend to the sale of
genuine goods in NEC Electronics. There, the question before us was whether a U.S.
subsidiary of a foreign manufacturer may sue for trademark infringement where
another company "buys the parent's identical goods abroad and then sells them here
using the parent's true mark." 810 F.2d at 1508-09 (emphasis added). In American
Circuit Breaker, applying the NEC Electronics rule, we explained that a genuine-goods
exception "makes good sense and comports with the consumer protection rationale
of trademark law" because a consumer who purchases a genuine good receives
essentially the product he expected. 406 F.3d at 585. In both NEC Electronics and
American Circuit Breaker, exemption from trademark law turned on whether the
allegedly infringing product differed materially from the U.S. trademark holder's
product.

        Because the likelihood of confusion increases as the differences between
products become more subtle, the threshold for determining a material difference is
low. The key question is whether a consumer is likely to consider a difference
relevant when purchasing a product. Courts have found a wide range of differences
"material" in this context. The Second Circuit, for instance, held that Cabbage
Patch dolls were not "genuine" when accompanied with fictitious "birth certificates"
and "adoption papers" written in a foreign language. Original Appalachian Artworks,
Inc. v. Granada Elecs., Inc., 816 F.2d 68, 73 (2d Cir.1987). The D.C. Circuit held
that there were material differences between the British and American versions of
dishwasher detergent where the chemical composition of the detergents differed
slightly, and the British detergent was labeled "washing up liquid" rather than
"dishwashing liquid" and included a "royal emblem." Lever Bros. v. United States, 877
F.2d 101, 103 (D.C.Cir.1989). Along the same lines, a district court in the Central
District of California, comparing the Mexican and U.S. versions of Pepsi, held that
differences in quality control and the use of Spanish, rather than English, on the
soda cans were material differences. PepsiCo, Inc. v. Reyes, 70 F.Supp.2d 1057, 1059
(C.D.Cal.1999). We agree that differences in language, quality control, and
packaging may each be sufficiently material to render imported goods not
"genuine."

        2. Concord Farms's Mushrooms
        Whether the mushrooms that Concord Farms imports from Hokuto Japan
are genuine goods thus turns on whether they materially differ from Hokto USA's

                                                    533
mushrooms. Concord Farms's mushrooms are not organic, are grown under
Hokuto Japan's less extensive quality control standards, and are sold in packaging
designed for domestic Japanese consumers. The Hokuto Japan packaging is in
Japanese, and the packages' weights are measured in grams, not ounces. The
Hokuto Japan packaging identifies the mushrooms as the "product of" the specific
Japanese prefecture in which they were produced. It also displays Hokuto Japan's
website and telephone number. To determine whether these Concord Farms
mushrooms are "genuine" Hokto USA goods, we must compare them to the three
categories of Hokto USA's mushrooms: (1) the mushrooms that Hokto USA
imported from Hokuto Japan prior to the opening of Hokto USA's San Marcos,
California plant; (2) the mushrooms that Hokto USA produces at its California
plant; (3) and the white beech mushrooms that Hokto USA imported from Hokuto
Japan in May and November 2010 to supplement its supply.

        The mushrooms that Hokto USA imported from Hokuto Japan prior to the
opening of the San Marcos facility materially differed from Concord Farms's
mushrooms both in their production and in their packaging. Hokto USA submitted
uncontradicted evidence that certified organic status is more important to American
consumers than to Japanese consumers, and that Hokuto Japan used a special
growing medium to ensure that the mushrooms intended for sale by Hokto USA in
the United States met U.S. Certified Organic standards. In contrast, Hokuto Japan
does not use this special growing medium to produce mushrooms intended for
Japanese consumption; so, when Concord Farms imported Hokuto Japan's
mushrooms for sale in the United States, they did not meet Certified Organic
standards. Hokuto Japan and Hokto USA also developed packaging in both English
and Japanese, in contrast to the packaging developed for Japanese consumers. The
dual-language packaging described in English the mushrooms' recommended
serving size, calorie count, and other nutritional information. We agree with the
district court that these differences in production and packaging are material,
rendering these imports not "genuine."

        Concord Farms's mushrooms materially differ even more from the
mushrooms that Hokto USA produces in its San Marcos facility. Like the pre-2009
imports, Hokto USA's mushrooms are certified organic and sold in dual-language
packaging. At its San Marcos facility, Hokto USA uses a hygienic, computer-
controlled cultivation process, which includes the robotic transport of mushrooms
in plastic bottles; a sterile culture medium composed of sawdust, corn cob pellets,
and other nutrients; and aggressive sterilization and temperature controls to ensure
a longer shelf life. The packaging on the domestically produced mushrooms
identifies them as a "Product of USA," provides weights in grams and ounces, and
displays Hokto USA's website.

                                                    534
        Concord Farms's mushrooms are also materially different from the white
beech mushrooms that Hokto USA imported from Hokuto Japan in May and
November 2010. When Hokto imported Hokuto Japan's mushrooms because of
problems at Hokto USA's San Marcos facility, it ensured that a label was affixed to
each imported package. The label included the English name for the mushrooms,
listed the packages' weights in ounces rather than grams, clearly identified the
mushrooms' origin, and provided a U.S. address for customer service inquiries. It is
more than likely that consumers would consider these clarifying English-language
labels relevant when purchasing the mushrooms. See Bourdeau Bros. v. Int'l Trade
Comm'n, 444 F.3d 1317, 1323-24 (Fed.Cir.2006) (explaining that "there need only
be one material difference between a domestic and a foreign product" to support
the conclusion that the product is not genuine). Concord Farms's mushrooms are
therefore not "genuine goods" in relation to any of the three separately sold and
packaged Hokto USA products. . . . . Because Concord Farms's mushrooms are not
"genuine" Hokto USA goods, Concord Farms is not exempt from potential liability
under trademark law. [The court then upheld the finding of a likelihood of
consumer confusion.]

24. Expressive Uses and the First
Amendment

                     Anheuser-Busch, Inc. v. Balducci Publications
                                 28 F.3d 769 (8th Cir. 1994)

JOHN R. GIBSON, Senior Circuit Judge.
        Anheuser-Busch, Inc., appeals from the judgment of the district court

dismissing its federal and state trademark infringement, trademark dilution, and
unfair competition claims against Balducci Publications and its publishers, Richard
and Kathleen Balducci, for the use of registered Anheuser-Busch trademarks in a
fictitious advertisement for "Michelob Oily." We have carefully reviewed the record
before us, and we reverse.

        Anheuser-Busch operates a brewery in St. Louis. Its products include the
Michelob family of beers: Michelob, Michelob Dry, Michelob Light and Michelob
Classic Dark. For use in its marketing of these products, Anheuser-Busch owns
several federally-registered trademarks: (1) Michelob; (2) Michelob Dry; (3) A &
Eagle Design; (4) Bottle and Label Configuration; (5) Bottle Configuration; (6)
Vertical Stripe Design; (7) the phrase "ONE TASTE AND YOU'LL DRINK IT
DRY;" and (8) Vertical Stripe and A & Eagle Design. Of these, (1) and (3) are also
registered Missouri trademarks.

        Balducci Publications is a publishing business owned by Richard and
Kathleen Balducci, also defendants in this case. Balducci Publications has published
Snicker, a humor magazine, since April 1987. The back cover of issue 5 1/2 ,
published in April 1989, contains a mock advertisement for the fictitious product
"Michelob Oily." A reduced copy of the advertisement is attached as Appendix A.
The advertisement states in bold type, "ONE TASTE AND YOU'LL DRINK IT
OILY" immediately above "MICHELOB OILY®." The accompanying graphics
include a partially-obscured can of Michelob Dry pouring oil onto a fish, an oil-
soaked rendition of the A & Eagle design (with the eagle exclaiming "Yuck!") below
a Shell Oil symbol, and various "Michelob Oily" products bearing a striking
resemblance to appellants' Michelob family. This resemblance was quite intentional,
as evidenced by the admitted use of actual Anheuser-Busch "clip-art"1 in replicating
several of the protected trademarks. In smaller text the ad opines, "At the rate it's
being dumped into our oceans, lakes and rivers, you'll drink it oily sooner or later,

          1 Clip-art consists of collections of pictures which may be inserted into a new publishing application,

such as an advertisement. Anheuser-Busch distributes clip-art to ensure accurate and consistent

representation of its marks.

                                                    536
anyway." Finally, the following disclaimer is found in extremely small text running
vertically along the right side of the page: "Snicker Magazine Editorial by Rich
Balducci. Art by Eugene Ruble. Thank goodness someone still cares about quality
(of life)." A full-size reproduction of this part of the ad is contained in Appendix B.

        Balducci continues to sell back issues of Snicker-including Issue 5 1/2 .
Advertising for back issues of the magazine has included the words "Michelob Oily"
and a blue ribbon design associated with Anheuser-Busch.

        Mr. Balducci stated at trial that he used the parody to comment on: (1) the
effects of environmental pollution, including a specific reference to the then-recent
Shell oil spill in the Gasconade River-a source of Anheuser-Busch's water supply; (2)
Anheuser-Busch's subsequent decision to temporarily close its St. Louis brewery;
and (3) the proliferation of Anheuser-Busch beer brands and advertisements. The
defendants concede they possessed no knowledge that any Anheuser-Busch product
actually contained oil.

        Anheuser-Busch, displeased with Balducci's extensive use of its trademarks
and the possible implication that its products were tainted with oil, brought this suit
in May 1989. It asserted five causes of action: (1) infringement of federally-registered
trademarks, 15 U.S.C. § 1114(1); (2) federal unfair competition, 15 U.S.C. §
1125(a); (3) state trademark infringement, Mo.Rev.Stat. § 417.056; (4) common law
unfair competition; and (5) state law trademark dilution, Mo.Rev.Stat. § 417.061. It
sought one dollar in nominal damages and injunctive relief.

        Other than the Balducci ad itself, the primary evidence offered by Anheuser-
Busch was a study designed by Jacob Jacoby, Ph.D., and conducted under the
supervision of Leon B. Kaplan, Ph.D. This survey, conducted in St. Louis shopping
malls, involved 301 beer drinkers or purchasers who claimed to periodically review
magazines or newspapers. The surveyors showed the Balducci ad to 200 participants
and a Michelob Dry ad to the remaining 101. Of those viewing the Balducci ad,
many expressed an impression of Anheuser-Busch's role in its creation. For
example, fifty-eight percent felt the creators "did have to get permission to use the
Michelob name." Fifty-six percent believed permission would be required for the
various symbols and logos. Six percent of the classified2 responses construed the
Balducci ad to be an actual Anheuser-Busch advertisement. Almost half (45%)
found nothing about the parody which suggested it was an editorial, and seventy-five
percent did not perceive it as satirical. Virtually none (3.5%) noticed the tiny
disclaimer on the side of the ad. Fifty-five percent construed the parody as
suggesting that Michelob beer is or was in some way contaminated with oil. As a

          2 The staff at Princeton Research & Data Consulting Center, Inc. classified the answers to open-

ended questions. Balducci objects to this classification process generally, but offers no persuasive evidence

that any significant number of responses have been erroneously classified.

                                                    537
result, twenty-two percent stated they were less likely to buy Michelob beer in the
future.

        After a bench trial, the district court ruled in favor of Balducci on each of
the five theories. Although the court found that "Defendants clearly used Plaintiff's
marks in their ad parody, they used some of those marks without alteration, and
they did so without Plaintiff's permission," it dismissed the trademark claims
because "Defendants' use of [the] marks did not create a likelihood of confusion in
the marketplace." In reaching this decision, the court expressed the need to give
"special sensitivity" to the First Amendment aspects of the case. Accordingly, the
court concluded that although "Plaintiff's statistical evidence [might] well be
persuasive in the context of a classic trademark infringement case,.... where the
allegedly infringing use occurs in an editorial context," more persuasive evidence of
confusion is required. The court similarly dismissed the state law dilution claim,
stating that "because Defendant's use of Plaintiff's marks occurred in an editorial
context, there is no threat of tarnishment through association with shoddy or
disharmonious products." Finally, the court rejected the unfair competition claims
because the "parody was not in any way connected with the sale of a product and
because Plaintiff has failed to establish a likelihood of confusion in the
marketplace."

        On appeal, Anheuser-Busch contends the district court gave inordinate
weight to Balducci's First Amendment claims and erred in finding no likelihood of
confusion. Balducci contends the court correctly found no likelihood of confusion
and, furthermore, argues the ad parody is absolutely protected by the First
Amendment.

                                                 I.
         This case involves the tension between the protection afforded by the
Lanham Act to trademark owners and the competing First Amendment rights of
the parodist. Our analysis of the district court's decision encompasses two related,
but distinct steps. We begin by considering whether the district court erred in
finding no likelihood of confusion. Since a trademark infringement action requires
a likelihood of confusion, this finding, if upheld, decides this case. If we conclude
the court erred in finding no likelihood of confusion, we must consider Balducci's
additional argument that the First Amendment protects it from liability.
        Section 32(1) of the Lanham Act protects owners of registered trademarks
from uses "likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive." 15 U.S.C.
§ 1114(1). The determination of whether "likelihood of confusion" exists is a
factual determination which we review under the clearly erroneous standard. Mutual
of Omaha Ins. Co. v. Novak, 836 F.2d 397, 398 (8th Cir.1987); SquirtCo v. Seven-Up
Co., 628 F.2d 1086, 1091 (8th Cir.1980). However, our review is not so limited
when, as here, the district court's "conclusions are inextricably bound up in its view

                                                    538
of the law." Calvin Klein Cosmetics Corp. v. Lenox Labs., 815 F.2d 500, 504 (8th
Cir.1987). Rather than first considering whether Balducci's ad parody was likely to
confuse the public and then considering the scope of First Amendment protection,
the district court conflated the two. The court essentially skewed its likelihood of
confusion analysis in an attempt to give "special sensitivity" to the First
Amendment, holding Anheuser Busch to a higher standard than required in a
"classic trademark infringement case." Since we cannot separate the court's factual
finding of confusion from its legal conclusions, we conduct a de novo review of the
well-developed record before us.

        Many courts have applied, we believe correctly, an expansive interpretation
of likelihood of confusion, extending "protection against use of [plaintiff's] mark on
any product or service which would reasonably be thought by the buying public to
come from the same source, or thought to be affiliated with, connected with, or
sponsored by, the trademark owner." McCarthy, Trademarks and Unfair Competition
§ 24.03, at 24-13 (3d ed. 1992); Novak, 836 F.2d at 398; Nike, Inc. v. "Just Did It"
Enters., 6 F.3d 1225, 1228 (7th Cir.1993); Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders, Inc. v. Pussycat
Cinema, Ltd., 604 F.2d 200, 204-05 (2d Cir.1979); Jordache Enters., Inc. v. Levi Strauss,
841 F.Supp. 506, 514-15 (S.D.N.Y.1993). This approach seems consistent with
congressional intent, as evidenced by the express inclusion during the 1989 revision
of the Lanham Act of protection against confusion as to "origin, sponsorship, or
approval." 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a). This court enumerated several factors pertinent to
the finding of likelihood of confusion in SquirtCo, 628 F.2d at 1091: (1) the strength
of the trademark; (2) the similarity between the plaintiff's and defendant's marks;
(3) the competitive proximity of the parties' products; (4) the alleged infringer's
intent to confuse the public; (5) evidence of any actual confusion; and (6) the degree
of care reasonably expected of the plaintiff's potential customers. These factors are
not a distinct test, but represent the sort of considerations which a court should
consider in determining whether likelihood of confusion exists. We briefly consider
the application of these factors to this case.

        Anheuser-Busch possessed several very strong trademarks that Balducci
displayed virtually unaltered in the ad parody. Thus, the first two SquirtCo factors
weigh heavily in favor of Anheuser-Busch. The third factor, competitive proximity,
is less one-sided. Balducci does not directly compete with Anheuser-Busch.
Confusion, however, may exist in the absence of direct competition. Moreover,
Balducci published the parody on the back cover of a magazine--a location
frequently devoted to real ads, even in Snicker. This location threatens to confuse
consumers accustomed to seeing advertisements on the back cover of magazines.

        Our analysis of Balducci's intent relies, of necessity, on circumstantial
evidence. According to Richard Balducci, he sought to comment on certain social
conditions through parody. "An intent to parody is not an intent to confuse."

                                                    539
Jordache Enters., Inc. v. Hogg Wyld, Ltd., 828 F.2d 1482, 1486 (10th Cir.1987). Other
factors, however, suggest Balducci had, if not an intent to confuse, at least an
indifference to the possibility that some consumers might be misled by the parody.
For example, no significant steps were taken to remind readers that they were
viewing a parody and not an advertisement sponsored or approved by Anheuser-
Busch. Balducci carefully designed the fictitious ad to appear as authentic as
possible. Several of Anheuser-Busch's marks were used with little or no alteration.
The disclaimer is virtually undetectable. Balducci even included a ® symbol after
the words Michelob Oily. These facts suggest that Balducci sought to do far more
than just "conjure up" an image of Anheuser-Busch in the minds of its readers. Cf.
Walt Disney Productions v. Air Pirates, 581 F.2d 751, 758 (9th Cir.1978), cert. denied,
439 U.S. 1132 (1979) (in copyright context, "fair use" doctrine does not entitle
parodist to copy everything needed to create the "best parody;" rather, the parodist
may copy only that portion of the protected work necessary to "conjure up the
original"). These factors limit the degree to which Balducci's intent to parody weighs
in favor of a finding of no likelihood of confusion.

        Balducci's desired message, or humor, presumably hinged on consumers'
ultimate realization that although this "advertisement" was based on the painstaking
duplication of Anheuser-Busch's marks, it was in fact a parody or editorial parody.
We have significant doubt as to whether many consumers would develop this
understanding of Balducci's true purpose. There is a distinct possibility, accepted by
the district court, "that a superficial observer might believe that the ad parody was
approved by Anheuser-Busch." The back cover of magazines is frequently used for
advertisements and cannot be expected to command the thoughtful deliberation of
all or even most of the viewing public. The district court downplayed this fact,
observing that "[o]nce again ... the First Amendment concerns at issue in this
litigation require a closer examination of Plaintiff's claims." When objectively
viewed, the fourth and sixth SquirtCo factors (i.e., intent and degree of care) may not
fully support Anheuser-Busch, but they are consistent with a finding that the parody
presented a significant likelihood of confusing consumers.

        The survey evidence, whether considered as direct or indirect evidence of
actual confusion, tilts the analysis in favor of Anheuser-Busch. Over half of those
surveyed thought Balducci needed Anheuser-Busch's approval to publish the ad.
Many of these presumably felt that such approval had in fact been obtained. Six
percent thought that the parody was an actual Anheuser-Busch advertisement.
Other courts have accepted similar survey findings. See Novak, 836 F.2d at 400; Nat'l
Football League Props., Inc. v. New Jersey Giants, Inc., 637 F.Supp. 507, 517
(D.N.J.1986) (citing decisions relying on surveys showing 8.5% to 15% confusion);
Schieffelin & Co. v. Jack Company of Boca, 850 F.Supp. 232, 247-48 (S.D.N.Y.1994).
In Novak, for example, "approximately ten percent of all the persons surveyed

                                                    540
thought that Mutual `goes along' with Novak's product." 836 F.2d at 400. The court
found this persuasive despite the existence of "some ambiguity" in the survey
question. Thus, we are left with evidence, obtained by means of a valid consumer
survey, that strongly indicates actual consumer confusion.

        Our review of the record before the district court, including the Balducci ad
and the survey evidence,4 convinces us that the court erred in finding no likelihood
of confusion. The court reached its finding only after it mistakenly weighted its
analysis in favor of Balducci in an effort to satisfy the limits set by the First
Amendment. We believe the better course would have been to analyze the
likelihood of confusion first and then proceed to an analysis of the First
Amendment issues.

        Having determined that a likelihood of confusion exists, we must next
consider Balducci's argument that the First Amendment protects it from liability for
its ad parody. Parody does implicate the First Amendment's protection of artistic
expression. Cliffs Notes, Inc. v. Bantam Doubleday Dell Pub. Group, 886 F.2d 490, 493
(2d Cir.1989). Based on this, Balducci argues it has an absolute First Amendment
right to use plaintiff's trademarks in its parody. No such absolute right exists. See id.
at 493-94 ("Trademark protection is not lost simply because the allegedly infringing
use is in connection with a work of artistic expression.") (quoting Silverman v. CBS
Inc., 870 F.2d 40, 49 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 492 U.S. 907 (1989)); Nike, 6 F.3d at
1228; Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders, 604 F.2d at 206 (defendant liable for using
cheerleader uniform in X-rated film); Pillsbury Co. v. Milky Way Productions, Inc., 215
U.S.P.Q. 124, 135 (N.D.Ga.1981) (defendant liable for dilution for publishing
cartoon of "Poppin' Fresh" and "Poppie Fresh" doughpersons engaging in sexual
intercourse and fellatio); Edgar Rice Burroughs, Inc. v. Manns Theaters, 195 U.S.P.Q.
159, 162 (C.D.Cal.1976) (defendant liable for using TARZAN mark in X-rated
film).

        In arguing against the reasoning of these many cases, Balducci relies on this
court's opinion in Mutual of Omaha Ins. Co. v. Novak, 836 F.2d 397 (8th Cir.1987),
cert. denied, 488 U.S. 933 (1988). In Novak, a panel of this court upheld an
injunction against Novak's continued sale of anti-war T-shirts, coffee mugs and
other products containing words such as "Mutants of Omaha" and bearing symbols
with a likeness to plaintiff's Indian head logo. In dicta, the court stated that the
injunction "in no way infringes upon the constitutional protection the First
Amendment would provide were Novak to present an editorial parody in a book,
magazine, or film." This language does not support absolute protection for editorial

          4 We have considered Balducci's argument attacking the survey's findings because of alleged

shortcomings in its methodology; however, like the district court, we have "no quarrel with the [survey's]

design or execution."

                                                    541
parody, but merely reflects the fact that a parody contained in an obvious editorial
context is less likely to confuse, and thus more deserving of protection than those
displayed on a product. A parody creating a likelihood of confusion may be subject
to a trademark infringement action. Cliffs Notes, 886 F.2d at 494 (confusing
parodies are "vulnerable under trademark law"); L.L. Bean, Inc. v. Drake Publishers,
Inc., 811 F.2d 26, 32 n. 3 (1st Cir.) (confusing parodies "implicate[ ] the legitimate
commercial and consumer protection objectives of trademark law"), cert. denied and
appeal dismissed, 483 U.S. 1013 (1987).

        There is no simple, mechanical rule by which courts can determine when a
potentially confusing parody falls within the First Amendment's protective reach.
Thus, "in deciding the reach of the Lanham Act in any case where an expressive
work is alleged to infringe a trademark, it is appropriate to weigh the public interest
in free expression against the public interest in avoiding consumer confusion." Cliffs
Notes, 886 F.2d at 494. "This approach takes into account the ultimate test in
trademark law, namely, the likelihood of confusion as to the source of the goods in
question." Id. at 495 (internal quotations omitted).

        In applying this balancing test, we begin with the recognition that parody
serves as a "humorous form of social commentary and literary criticism that dates
back as far as Greek antiquity." Bean, 811 F.2d at 28. Balducci purports to comment
on several matters, including environmental pollution and Anheuser-Busch's brand
proliferation. The First Amendment's protection of social commentary generally,
and parody in particular, is certainly implicated in this case. "The fact that parody
can claim legitimacy for some appropriation does not, of course, tell either parodist
or judge much about where to draw the line." Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc., 510
U.S. 569, ----, 114 S.Ct. 1164, 1172 (1994). "The benefit to the one making the
parody ... arises from the humorous association, not from public confusion as to the
source of the marks." Jordache Enters., 828 F.2d at 1486. Thus, we must weigh the
public interest in protecting Balducci's expression against the public interest in
avoiding consumer confusion.

        Applying this standard, we are convinced that the First Amendment places
no bar to the application of the Lanham Act in this case. As we have discussed,
Balducci's ad parody was likely to confuse consumers as to its origin, sponsorship or
approval. This confusion might have to be tolerated if even plausibly necessary to
achieve the desired commentary--a question we need not decide. In this case, the
confusion is wholly unnecessary to Balducci's stated purpose. By using an obvious
disclaimer, positioning the parody in a less-confusing location, altering the protected
marks in a meaningful way, or doing some collection of the above, Balducci could
have conveyed its message with substantially less risk of consumer confusion. Other
courts have upheld the use of obvious variations of protected marks. See, e.g., Cliffs
Notes, 886 F.2d at 496 ("Spy Notes" held not to infringe "Cliffs Notes" mark);

                                                    542
Jordache Enters., 828 F.2d at 1485-88 (comparing "Jordache" and "Lardashe" jeans).
The First Amendment does not excuse Balducci's failure to do so. As the Second
Circuit observed:

        A parody must convey two simultaneous--and contradictory--messages: that
        it is the original, but also that it is not the original and is instead a parody. To
        the extent that it does only the former but not the latter, it is not only a poor
        parody but also vulnerable under trademark law, since the customer will be
        confused.
Cliffs Notes, 886 F.2d at 494; see Nike, 6 F.3d at 1228. Balducci's ad, developed
through the nearly unaltered appropriation of Anheuser-Busch's marks, conveys
that it is the original, but the ad founders on its failure to convey that it is not the
original. Thus, it is vulnerable under trademark law since the customer is likely to
be confused, as the record before the district court demonstrated.
        We believe it is important to acknowledge the limits of our holding today.
We do not hold that Balducci's extensive borrowing of Anheuser-Busch's
trademarks amounts to a per se trademark violation. Unlike copyright and patent
owners, trademark owners have no right in gross. By taking steps to insure that
viewers adequately understood this was an unauthorized editorial, Balducci might
have avoided or at least sharply limited any confusion, and thereby escaped from
liability. Absent such measures, Balducci's ad parody was likely to confuse
consumers and fall subject to federal trademark law. . . .

                                 507 F.3d 252 (4th Cir. 2007)

NIEMEYER, Circuit Judge:
        [recall the facts from the dilution reading]

                                                    545
        LVM contends first that Haute Diggity Dog's marketing and sale of its
"Chewy Vuiton" dog toys infringe its trademarks because the advertising and sale of
the "Chewy Vuiton" dog toys is likely to cause confusion. See 15 U.S.C. §
1114(1)(a). LVM argues:

        The defendants in this case are using almost an exact imitation of the house
        mark VUITTON (merely omitting a second "T"), and they painstakingly
        copied Vuitton's Monogram design mark, right down to the exact
        arrangement and sequence of geometric symbols. They also used the same
        design marks, trade dress, and color combinations embodied in Vuitton's
        Monogram Multicolor and Monogram Cerises [Cherry] handbag collections.
        Moreover, HDD did not add any language to distinguish its products from
        Vuitton's, and its products are not "widely recognized."1

        Haute Diggity Dog contends that there is no evidence of confusion, nor
could a reasonable factfinder conclude that there is a likelihood of confusion,
because it successfully markets its products as parodies of famous marks such as
those of LVM. It asserts that "precisely because of the [famous] mark's fame and
popularity ... confusion is avoided, and it is this lack of confusion that a parodist
depends upon to achieve the parody." Thus, responding to LVM's claims of
trademark infringement, Haute Diggity Dog argues:

        The marks are undeniably similar in certain respects. There are visual and
        phonetic similarities. [Haute Diggity Dog] admits that the product name and
        design mimics LVM's and is based on the LVM marks. It is necessary for the
        pet products to conjure up the original designer mark for there to be a
        parody at all. However, a parody also relies on "equally obvious
        dissimilarit[ies] between the marks" to produce its desired effect.

        Concluding that Haute Diggity Dog did not create any likelihood of
confusion as a matter of law, the district court granted summary judgment to Haute
Diggity Dog. We review its order de novo.

          1 We take this argument to be that Haute Diggity Dog is copying too closely the marks and trade

dress of LVM. But we reject the statement that LVM has a trademark consisting of the one word VUITTON.

At oral argument, counsel for LVM conceded that the trademark is "LOUIS VUITTON," and it is always

used in that manner rather than simply as "VUITTON." It appears that LVM has employed this technique to

provide a more narrow, but irrelevant, comparison between its VUITTON and Haute Diggity Dog's

"Vuiton." In resolving this case, however, we take LVM's arguments to compare "LOUIS VUITTON" with

Haute Diggity Dog's "Chewy Vuiton."

                                                    546
        To prove trademark infringement, LVM must show (1) that it owns a valid
and protectable mark; (2) that Haute Diggity Dog uses a "re-production, counterfeit,
copy, or colorable imitation" of that mark in commerce and without LVM's
consent; and (3) that Haute Diggity Dog's use is likely to cause confusion. 15 U.S.C.
§ 1114(1)(a); CareFirst, 434 F.3d at 267. The validity and protectability of LVM's
marks are not at issue in this case, nor is the fact that Haute Diggity Dog uses a
colorable imitation of LVM's mark. Therefore, we give the first two elements no
further attention. To determine whether the "Chewy Vuiton" product line creates a
likelihood of confusion, we have identified several nonexclusive factors to consider:
(1) the strength or distinctiveness of the plaintiff's mark; (2) the similarity of the two
marks; (3) the similarity of the goods or services the marks identify; (4) the similarity
of the facilities the two parties use in their businesses; (5) the similarity of the
advertising used by the two parties; (6) the defendant's intent; and (7) actual
confusion. See Pizzeria Uno Corp. v. Temple, 747 F.2d 1522, 1527 (4th Cir.1984).
These Pizzeria Uno factors are not always weighted equally, and not all factors are
relevant in every case.

        Because Haute Diggity Dog's arguments with respect to the Pizzeria Uno
factors depend to a great extent on whether its products and marks are successful
parodies, we consider first whether Haute Diggity Dog's products, marks, and trade
dress are indeed successful parodies of LVM's marks and trade dress.

        For trademark purposes, "[a] `parody' is defined as a simple form of
entertainment conveyed by juxtaposing the irreverent representation of the
trademark with the idealized image created by the mark's owner." People for the
Ethical Treatment of Animals v. Doughney (" PETA "), 263 F.3d 359, 366 (4th
Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks omitted). "A parody must convey two
simultaneous--and contradictory--messages: that it is the original, but also that it is
not the original and is instead a parody." Id. (internal quotation marks and citation
omitted). This second message must not only differentiate the alleged parody from
the original but must also communicate some articulable element of satire, ridicule,
joking, or amusement. Thus, "[a] parody relies upon a difference from the original
mark, presumably a humorous difference, in order to produce its desired effect."
Jordache Enterprises, Inc. v. Hogg Wyld, Ltd., 828 F.2d 1482, 1486 (10th Cir.1987)
(finding the use of "Lardashe" jeans for larger women to be a successful and
permissible parody of "Jordache" jeans).

        When applying the PETA criteria to the facts of this case, we agree with the
district court that the "Chewy Vuiton" dog toys are successful parodies of LVM
handbags and the LVM marks and trade dress used in connection with the
marketing and sale of those handbags. First, the pet chew toy is obviously an

                                                    547
irreverent, and indeed intentional, representation of an LVM handbag, albeit much
smaller and coarser. The dog toy is shaped roughly like a handbag; its name "Chewy
Vuiton" sounds like and rhymes with LOUIS VUITTON; its monogram CV
mimics LVM's LV mark; the repetitious design clearly imitates the design on the
LVM handbag; and the coloring is similar. In short, the dog toy is a small, plush
imitation of an LVM handbag carried by women, which invokes the marks and
design of the handbag, albeit irreverently and incompletely. No one can doubt that
LVM handbags are the target of the imitation by Haute Diggity Dog's "Chewy
Vuiton" dog toys.

        At the same time, no one can doubt also that the "Chewy Vuiton" dog toy is
not the "idealized image" of the mark created by LVM. The differences are
immediate, beginning with the fact that the "Chewy Vuiton" product is a dog toy,
not an expensive, luxury LOUIS VUITTON handbag. The toy is smaller, it is plush,
and virtually all of its designs differ. Thus, "Chewy Vuiton" is not LOUIS
VUITTON ("Chewy" is not "LOUIS" and "Vuiton" is not "VUITTON," with its
two Ts); CV is not LV; the designs on the dog toy are simplified and crude, not
detailed and distinguished. The toys are inexpensive; the handbags are expensive
and marketed to be expensive. And, of course, as a dog toy, one must buy it with pet
supplies and cannot buy it at an exclusive LVM store or boutique within a
department store. In short, the Haute Diggity Dog "Chewy Vuiton" dog toy
undoubtedly and deliberately conjures up the famous LVM marks and trade dress,
but at the same time, it communicates that it is not the LVM product.

        Finally, the juxtaposition of the similar and dissimilar--the irreverent
representation and the idealized image of an LVM handbag--immediately conveys a
joking and amusing parody. The furry little "Chewy Vuiton" imitation, as
something to be chewed by a dog, pokes fun at the elegance and expensiveness of a
LOUIS VUITTON handbag, which must not be chewed by a dog. The LVM
handbag is provided for the most elegant and well-to-do celebrity, to proudly display
to the public and the press, whereas the imitation "Chewy Vuiton" "handbag" is
designed to mock the celebrity and be used by a dog. The dog toy irreverently
presents haute couture as an object for casual canine destruction. The satire is
unmistakable. The dog toy is a comment on the rich and famous, on the LOUIS
VUITTON name and related marks, and on conspicuous consumption in general.
This parody is enhanced by the fact that "Chewy Vuiton" dog toys are sold with
similar parodies of other famous and expensive brands--"Chewnel No. 5" targeting
"Chanel No. 5"; "Dog Perignonn" targeting "Dom Perignon"; and "Sniffany &
Co." targeting "Tiffany & Co."

                                                    548
        We conclude that the PETA criteria are amply satisfied in this case and that
the "Chewy Vuiton" dog toys convey "just enough of the original design to allow
the consumer to appreciate the point of parody," but stop well short of
appropriating the entire marks that LVM claims. PETA, 263 F.3d at 366 (quoting
Jordache, 828 F.2d at 1486).

        Finding that Haute Diggity Dog's parody is successful, however, does not end
the inquiry into whether Haute Diggity Dog's "Chewy Vuiton" products create a
likelihood of confusion. See 6 J. Thomas McCarthy, Trademarks and Unfair
Competition § 31:153, at 262 (4th ed. 2007) ("There are confusing parodies and non-
confusing parodies. All they have in common is an attempt at humor through the
use of someone else's trademark"). The finding of a successful parody only
influences the way in which the Pizzeria Uno factors are applied. See, e.g., Anheuser-
Busch, Inc. v. L & L Wings, Inc., 962 F.2d 316, 321 (4th Cir.1992) (observing that
parody alters the likelihood-of-confusion analysis). Indeed, it becomes apparent that
an effective parody will actually diminish the likelihood of confusion, while an
ineffective parody does not. We now turn to the Pizzeria Uno factors.

                                                 A
         As to the first Pizzeria Uno factor, the parties agree that LVM's marks are
strong and widely recognized. They do not agree, however, as to the consequences
of this fact. LVM maintains that a strong, famous mark is entitled, as a matter of
law, to broad protection. While it is true that finding a mark to be strong and
famous usually favors the plaintiff in a trademark infringement case, the opposite
may be true when a legitimate claim of parody is involved. As the district court
observed, "In cases of parody, a strong mark's fame and popularity is precisely the
mechanism by which likelihood of confusion is avoided."
        We agree with the district court. It is a matter of common sense that the
strength of a famous mark allows consumers immediately to perceive the target of
the parody, while simultaneously allowing them to recognize the changes to the
mark that make the parody funny or biting. See Tommy Hilfiger Licensing, Inc. v.
Nature Labs, LLC, 221 F.Supp.2d 410, 416 (S.D.N.Y.2002) (noting that the strength
of the "TOMMY HILFIGER" fashion mark did not favor the mark's owner in an
infringement case against "TIMMY HOLEDIGGER" novelty pet perfume). In this
case, precisely because LOUIS VUITTON is so strong a mark and so well
recognized as a luxury handbag brand from LVM, consumers readily recognize that
when they see a "Chewy Vuiton" pet toy, they see a parody. Thus, the strength of
LVM's marks in this case does not help LVM establish a likelihood of confusion.

                                                 B

                                                    549
        With respect to the second Pizzeria Uno factor, the similarities between the
marks, the usage by Haute Diggity Dog again converts what might be a problem for
Haute Diggity Dog into a disfavored conclusion for LVM.

        Haute Diggity Dog concedes that its marks are and were designed to be
somewhat similar to LVM's marks. But that is the essence of a parody--the
invocation of a famous mark in the consumer's mind, so long as the distinction
between the marks is also readily recognized. While a trademark parody necessarily
copies enough of the original design to bring it to mind as a target, a successful
parody also distinguishes itself and, because of the implicit message communicated
by the parody, allows the consumer to appreciate it.

        In concluding that Haute Diggity Dog has a successful parody, we have
impliedly concluded that Haute Diggity Dog appropriately mimicked a part of the
LVM marks, but at the same time sufficiently distinguished its own product to
communicate the satire. The differences are sufficiently obvious and the parody
sufficiently blatant that a consumer encountering a "Chewy Vuiton" dog toy would
not mistake its source or sponsorship on the basis of mark similarity.

        This conclusion is reinforced when we consider how the parties actually use
their marks in the marketplace. The record amply supports Haute Diggity Dog's
contention that its "Chewy Vuiton" toys for dogs are generally sold alongside other
pet products, as well as toys that parody other luxury brands, whereas LVM markets
its handbags as a top-end luxury item to be purchased only in its own stores or in its
own boutiques within department stores. These marketing channels further
emphasize that "Chewy Vuiton" dog toys are not, in fact, LOUIS VUITTON
products.

                                                 C
        Nor does LVM find support from the third Pizzeria Uno factor, the similarity
of the products themselves. It is obvious that a "Chewy Vuiton" plush imitation
handbag, which does not open and is manufactured as a dog toy, is not a LOUIS
VUITTON handbag sold by LVM. Even LVM's most proximate products--dog
collars, leashes, and pet carriers--are fashion accessories, not dog toys. As Haute
Diggity Dog points out, LVM does not make pet chew toys and likely does not
intend to do so in the future. Even if LVM were to make dog toys in the future, the
fact remains that the products at issue are not similar in any relevant respect, and
this factor does not favor LVM.

                                                 D
        The fourth and fifth Pizzeria Uno factors, relating to the similarity of facilities
and advertising channels, have already been mentioned. LVM products are sold
exclusively through its own stores or its own boutiques within department stores. It

                                                    550
also sells its products on the Internet through an LVM-authorized website. In
contrast, "Chewy Vuiton" products are sold primarily through traditional and
Internet pet stores, although they might also be sold in some department stores.
The record demonstrates that both LVM handbags and "Chewy Vuiton" dog toys
are sold at a Macy's department store in New York. As a general matter, however,
there is little overlap in the individual retail stores selling the brands.

        Likewise with respect to advertising, there is little or no overlap. LVM
markets LOUIS VUITTON handbags through high-end fashion magazines, while
"Chewy Vuiton" products are advertised primarily through pet-supply channels.

        The overlap in facilities and advertising demonstrated by the record is so
minimal as to be practically nonexistent. "Chewy Vuiton" toys and LOUIS
VUITTON products are neither sold nor advertised in the same way, and the de
minimis overlap lends insignificant support to LVM on this factor.

                                                 E
        The sixth factor, relating to Haute Diggity Dog's intent, again is neutralized
by the fact that Haute Diggity Dog markets a parody of LVM products. As other
courts have recognized, "An intent to parody is not an intent to confuse the public."
Jordache, 828 F.2d at 1486. Despite Haute Diggity Dog's obvious intent to profit
from its use of parodies, this action does not amount to a bad faith intent to create
consumer confusion. To the contrary, the intent is to do just the opposite--to evoke
a humorous, satirical association that distinguishes the products. This factor does not
favor LVM.

                                                 F
        On the actual confusion factor, it is well established that no actual confusion
is required to prove a case of trademark infringement, although the presence of
actual confusion can be persuasive evidence relating to a likelihood of confusion.
        While LVM conceded in the district court that there was no evidence of
actual confusion, on appeal it points to incidents where retailers misspelled "Chewy
Vuiton" on invoices or order forms, using two Ts instead of one. Many of these
invoices also reflect simultaneous orders for multiple types of Haute Diggity Dog
parody products, which belies the notion that any actual confusion existed as to the
source of "Chewy Vuiton" plush toys. The misspellings pointed out by LVM are far
more likely in this context to indicate confusion over how to spell the product name
than any confusion over the source or sponsorship of the "Chewy Vuiton" dog toys.
We conclude that this factor favors Haute Diggity Dog.
        In sum, the likelihood-of-confusion factors substantially favor Haute Diggity
Dog. But consideration of these factors is only a proxy for the ultimate statutory test
of whether Haute Diggity Dog's marketing, sale, and distribution of "Chewy

Vuiton" dog toys is likely to cause confusion. Recognizing that "Chewy Vuiton" is
an obvious parody and applying the Pizzeria Uno factors, we conclude that LVM has
failed to demonstrate any likelihood of confusion. Accordingly, we affirm the
district court's grant of summary judgment in favor of Haute Diggity Dog on the
issue of trademark infringement. . . .

                                547 F.3d 1095 (9th Cir. 2008)

O'SCANNLAIN, Circuit Judge:
        We must decide whether a producer of a video game in the "Grand Theft

Auto" series has a defense under the First Amendment against a claim of trademark
infringement.

                                                  I
                                                 A
        Rockstar Games, Inc. ("Rockstar"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Take-Two
Interactive Software, Inc., manufactures and distributes the Grand Theft Auto series
of video games (the "Series"), including Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas ("San
Andreas" or the "Game"). The Series is known for an irreverent and sometimes
crass brand of humor, gratuitous violence and sex, and overall seediness.
        Each game in the Series takes place in one or more dystopic, cartoonish cities
modeled after actual American urban areas. The games always include a disclaimer
stating that the locations depicted are fictional. Players control the game's
protagonist, trying to complete various "missions" on a video screen. The plot
advances with each mission accomplished until the player, having passed through
thousands of cartoon-style places along the way, wins the game.
        Consistent with the tone of the Series, San Andreas allows a player to
experience a version of West Coast "gangster" culture. The Game takes place in the
virtual cities of "Los Santos," "San Fierro," and "Las Venturas," based on Los
Angeles, San Francisco, and Las Vegas, respectively.
        Los Santos, of course, mimics the look and feel of actual Los Angeles
neighborhoods. Instead of "Hollywood," "Santa Monica," "Venice Beach," and
"Compton," Los Santos contains "Vinewood," "Santa Maria," "Verona Beach," and
"Ganton." Rockstar has populated these areas with virtual liquor stores,
ammunition dealers, casinos, pawn shops, tattoo parlors, bars, and strip clubs. The
brand names, business names, and other aspects of the locations have been changed
to fit the irreverent "Los Santos" tone. Not especially saintly, Los Santos is complete
with gangs who roam streets inhabited by prostitutes and drug pushers while
random gunfire punctuates the soundtrack.

                                                    552
        To generate their vision for Los Santos, some of the artists who drew it
visited Los Angeles to take reference photographs. The artists took pictures of
businesses, streets, and other places in Los Angeles that they thought evoked the
San Andreas theme. They then returned home (to Scotland) to draw Los Santos,
changing the images from the photographs as necessary to fit into the fictional
world of Los Santos and San Andreas. According to Nikolas Taylor ("Taylor"), the
Lead Map Artist for Los Santos, he and other artists did not seek to "re-creat[e] a
realistic depiction of Los Angeles; rather, [they] were creating `Los Santos,' a
fictional city that lampooned the seedy underbelly of Los Angeles and the people,
business and places [that] comprise it." One neighborhood in the fictional city is
"East Los Santos," the Game's version of East Los Angeles. East Los Santos contains
variations on the businesses and architecture of the real thing, including a virtual,
cartoon-style strip club known as the "Pig Pen."

                                                 B
        ESS Entertainment 2000, Inc. ("ESS"), operates a strip club, which features
females dancing nude, on the eastern edge of downtown Los Angeles under the
name Play Pen Gentlemen's Club ("Play Pen"). ESS claims that Rockstar's depiction
of an East Los Santos strip club called the Pig Pen infringes its trademark and trade
dress associated with the Play Pen.
        The Play Pen's "logo" consists of the words "the Play Pen" (and the lower-
and upper-case letters forming those words) and the phrase "Totally Nude"
displayed in a publicly available font, with a silhouette of a nude female dancer
inside the stem of the first "P." Apparently, ESS has no physical master or precise
template for its logo. Different artists draw the nude silhouette in Play Pen's logo
anew for each representation, although any final drawing must be acceptable to Play
Pen's owners. There are several different versions of the silhouette, and some
advertisements and signs for the Play Pen do not contain the nude silhouettes.
        Although the artists took some inspiration from their photographs of the
Play Pen, it seems they used photographs of other East Los Angeles locations to
design other aspects of 15148 the Pig Pen. The Pig Pen building in Los Santos, for
instance, lacks certain characteristics of the Play Pen building such as a stone facade,
a valet stand, large plants and gold columns around the entrance, and a six-foot
black iron fence around the parking lot. The Play Pen also has a red, white, and
blue pole sign near the premises, which includes a trio of nude silhouettes above the
logo and a separate "Totally Nude" sign below. The Pig Pen does not.

                                                 C
         On April 22, 2005, ESS filed the underlying trademark violation action in
district court against Rockstar. . . . The heart of ESS's complaint is that Rockstar has

                                                    553
used Play Pen's distinctive logo and trade dress without its authorization and has
created a likelihood of confusion among consumers as to whether ESS has
endorsed, or is associated with, the video depiction. . . .

        [Rockstar moved for summary judgment, arguing nominative fair use, the
First Amendment, and claiming the absence of a likelihood of confusion. The
district court ruled in its favor on First Amendment grounds.]

                                                 II
        Rockstar argues that, regardless of whether it infringed ESS's trademark
under the Lanham Act or related California law, it is entitled to two defenses: one
under the nominative fair use doctrine and one under the First Amendment.

                                                 A
        "Unlike a traditional fair use scenario, [nominative fair use occurs when] the
defendant ... us[es] the trademarked term to describe not its own product, but the
plaintiff's." Playboy Enters., Inc. v. Welles, 279 F.3d 796, 801 (9th Cir.2002). The
doctrine protects those who deliberately use another's trademark or trade dress "for
the `purposes of comparison, criticism [,] or point of reference.' " Walking Mountain,
353 F.3d at 809 (alteration omitted) (quoting New Kids on the Block v. News Am.
Publ'g, Inc., 971 F.2d 302, 306 (9th Cir.1992)). In this case, however, Rockstar's use
of "Pig Pen" is not "identical to the plaintiff's [Play Pen] mark." Furthermore, the
district court observed that Rockstar's Lead Map Artist "testified the goal in
designing the Pig Pen was ... not to comment on Play Pen per se." Since Rockstar did
not use the trademarked logo to describe ESS's strip club, the district court correctly
held that the nominative fair use defense does not apply in this case.

                                                 B
        Rockstar's second defense asks us to consider the intersection of trademark
law and the First Amendment. The road is well traveled. We have adopted the
Second Circuit's approach from Rogers v. Grimaldi, which "requires courts to
construe the Lanham Act `to apply to artistic works only where the public interest in
avoiding consumer confusion outweighs the public interest in free expression.' "
Walking Mountain, 353 F.3d at 807 (emphasis in original) (quoting Rogers v. Grimaldi,
875 F.2d 994, 999 (2d Cir.1989)). The specific test contains two prongs. An artistic
work's use of a trademark that otherwise would violate the Lanham Act is not
actionable " `unless the [use of the mark] has no artistic relevance to the underlying
work whatsoever, or, if it has some artistic relevance, unless [it] explicitly misleads as
to the source or the content of the work.' " Mattel, Inc. v. MCA Records, Inc., 296
F.3d 894, 902 (9th Cir.2002) (quoting Rogers, 875 F.2d at 999). Although this test
traditionally applies to uses of a trademark in the title of an artistic work, there is no

                                                    554
principled reason why it ought not also apply to the use of a trademark in the body
of the work. See Walking Mountain, 353 F.3d at 809 n. 17 (implying that it would be
acceptable to apply the Rogers test to non-titular trade dress claim). The parties do
not dispute such an extension of the doctrine.

                                                 1
        We first adopted the Rogers test in MCA Records, a case which is instructive
for that reason. MCA Records, 296 F.3d at 902 ("We agree with the Second Circuit's
analysis and adopt the Rogers standard as our own."). In MCA Records, the maker of
the iconic "Barbie" dolls sued MCA for trademark infringement in the title of a
song the record company had released, called "Barbie Girl." The song was a
commentary "about Barbie and the values ... she [supposedly] represents." Applying
Rogers, the court held that the First Amendment protected the record company. The
first prong was straightforward. Because the song was about Barbie, "the use of
Barbie in the song title clearly is relevant to the underlying work."
        Moving to the second prong, we made an important point. "The only
indication," we observed, "that Mattel might be associated with the song is the use
of Barbie in the title; if this were enough to satisfy this prong of the Rogers test, it
would render Rogers a nullity." MCA Records, 296 F.3d at 902 (emphasis in original).
This makes good sense. After all, a trademark infringement claim presupposes a use
of the mark. If that necessary element in every trademark case vitiated a First
Amendment defense, the First Amendment would provide no defense at all.

                                                 2
        Keeping MCA Records and related cases in mind, we now turn to the matter
before us. ESS concedes that the Game is artistic and that therefore the Rogers test
applies. However, ESS argues both that the incorporation of the Pig Pen into the
Game has no artistic relevance and that it is explicitly misleading. It rests its
argument on two observations: (1) the Game is not "about" ESS's Play Pen club the
way that "Barbie Girl" was "about" the Barbie doll in MCA Records; and (2) also
unlike the Barbie case, where the trademark and trade dress at issue was a cultural
icon (Barbie), the Play Pen is not a cultural icon.
        ESS's objections, though factually accurate, miss the point. Under MCA
Records and the cases that followed it, only the use of a trademark with " `no artistic
relevance to the underlying work whatsoever ' " does not merit First Amendment
protection. Id. (emphasis added) (quoting Rogers, 875 F.2d at 999). In other words,
the level of relevance merely must be above zero. It is true that the Game is not
"about" the Play Pen the way that Barbie Girl was about Barbie. But, given the low
threshold the Game must surmount, that fact is hardly dispositive. It is also true
that Play Pen has little cultural significance, but the same could be said about most

                                                    555
of the individual establishments in East Los Angeles. Like most urban
neighborhoods, its distinctiveness lies in its "look and feel," not in particular
destinations as in a downtown or tourist district. And that neighborhood, with all
that characterizes it, is relevant to Rockstar's artistic goal, which is to develop a
cartoon-style parody of East Los Angeles. Possibly the only way, and certainly a
reasonable way, to do that is to recreate a critical mass of the businesses and
buildings that constitute it. In this context, we conclude that to include a strip club
that is similar in look and feel to the Play Pen does indeed have at least "some
artistic relevance." See id.

                                                 3
        ESS also argues that Rockstar's use of the Pig Pen " `explicitly misleads as to
the source or the content of the work.' " Id. (quoting Rogers, 875 F.2d at 999). This
prong of the test points directly at the purpose of trademark law, namely to "avoid
confusion in the marketplace by allowing a trademark owner to prevent others from
duping consumers into buying a product they mistakenly believe is sponsored by the
trademark owner." Walking Mountain, 353 F.3d at 806 (internal quotation marks
and alteration omitted). The relevant question, therefore, is whether the Game
would confuse its players into thinking that the Play Pen is somehow behind the Pig
Pen or that it sponsors Rockstar's product. In answering that question, we keep in
mind our observation in MCA Records that the mere use of a trademark alone
cannot suffice to make such use explicitly misleading.
        Both San Andreas and the Play Pen offer a form of low-brow entertainment;
besides this general similarity, they have nothing in common. The San Andreas
Game is not complementary to the Play Pen; video games and strip clubs do not go
together like a horse and carriage or, perish the thought, love and marriage.
Nothing indicates that the buying public would reasonably have believed that ESS
produced the video game or, for that matter, that Rockstar operated a strip club. A
player can enter the virtual strip club in Los Santos, but ESS has provided no
evidence that the setting is anything but generic. It also seems far-fetched that
someone playing San Andreas would think ESS had provided whatever expertise,
support, or unique strip-club knowledge it possesses to the production of the game.
After all, the Game does not revolve around running or patronizing a strip club.
Whatever one can do at the Pig Pen seems quite incidental to the overall story of
the Game. A reasonable consumer would not think a company that owns one strip
club in East Los Angeles, which is not well known to the public at large, also
produces a technologically sophisticated video game like San Andreas.
        Undeterred, ESS also argues that, because players are free to ignore the
storyline and spend as much time as they want at the Pig Pen, the Pig Pen can be

                                                    556
considered a significant part of the Game, leading to confusion. But fans can spend
all nine innings of a baseball game at the hot dog stand; that hardly makes Dodger
Stadium a butcher's shop. In other words, the chance to attend a virtual strip club is
unambiguously not the main selling point of the Game.

                                                III
        Considering all of the foregoing, we conclude that Rockstar's modification of
ESS's trademark is not explicitly misleading and is thus protected by the First
Amendment. Since the First Amendment defense applies equally to ESS's state law
claims as to its Lanham Act claim, the district court properly dismissed the entire
case on Rockstar's motion for summary judgment.

                                     Notes and Questions

        Accommodating the First Amendment. In general, courts treat trademark law,
with its roots in fraud prevention, as not raising First Amendment concerns. But as
these cases indicate, matters are more difficult where the speech at issue concerns a
non-traditional trademark use. How should trademark law provide breathing room
for First Amendment interests? Are expressive uses appropriately considered in the
context of ordinary trademark analysis? Should the multifactor test be modified to
account for expressive uses? Are expressive uses simply unlikely to confuse? Or does
the growth of the trademark cause of action require development of a distinct
analysis--like the Rogers test--to balance interests and ensure that the law does not
threaten First Amendment rights?

        The importance of the Rogers framework. Prior to the Jack Daniel's case, coming
up, the Rogers test had been adopted by multiple circuits, most notably by the
Second and Ninth Circuits, which include the entertainment centers of New York
and Hollywood, respectively.

        What is an expressive work? An interesting question concerning the Rogers test
is determining when the artistic relevance analysis applies. For example, should it
apply to television commercials? After all, commercials are often (always?) expressive.
But if pushed too far, that kind of thinking would let the Rogers test swallow a lot of
infringement analysis (would that be so bad?). Compare Facenda v. N.F.L. Films,
Inc., 542 F.3d 1007, 1018 (3d Cir. 2008) (reserving question of whether to adopt
the Rogers test because challenged infomercial was "commercial speech rather than
artistic expression"), with Twentieth Century Fox Television v. Empire Distribution,
Inc., 875 F.3d 1192, 1196-97 (9th Cir. 2017) ("Although it is true that these

                                                    557
promotional efforts technically fall outside the title or body of an expressive work, it
requires only a minor logical extension of the reasoning of Rogers to hold that works
protected under its test may be advertised and marketed by name, and we so hold. .
. . The balance of First Amendment interests struck in Rogers . . . could be
destabilized if the titles of expressive works were protected but could not be used to
promote those works.").

        The limits of Rogers. The concern that Rogers might take over much of
trademark law seems to influence the Jack Daniel's case to which we now turn. As
you may know, Jack Daniel's is a well-known whiskey. The company's trademark
registrations include JACK DANIEL'S, "Old No. 7," the name as a logo (the arched
lettering), its label, and even the square-shaped bottle that holds it. VIP is a
company that makes dog chew toys under the "Silly Squeakers" brand. The toys are
designed to evoke well-known brand names. The product line includes, for example,
"Blue Cats Trippin," "Mountain Drool," and "Heinie Sniff'n."* "Bad Spaniels" is its
take on Jack Daniel's.

          * Arranged in order:

                                                    558
        The toy's label reads "The Old No. 2 On Your Tennessee Carpet" instead of
"Old No. 7 Tennessee Sour Mash Whiskey." The small print on the bottom of the
VIP label reads "43% poo by vol." and "100% smelly." The toy comes with a
hangtag that includes a disclaimer of association with Jack Daniel's. It looks like
this:

        Confused? Jack Daniel's thought you might be. It therefore demanded that
VIP stop sales. The parties ultimately ended up in court litigating whether the chew
toy infringes or tarnishes the Jack Daniel's marks.

        After a bench trial, the district court ruled in favor of Jack Daniel's on both
claims. VIP appealed, challenging the district court's fact findings, but also its legal
rulings along the way. The Ninth Circuit saw things VIP's way. First, the dilution by
tarnishment claim could not stand because of the dilution statute's exclusion of
liability for "non-commercial" uses. Because the dog toy had an inherently non-
commercial component--by making fun of Jack Daniel's--no dilution claim was
possible. Second, also resting on the chew toy's expressive aspect, the district court
erred by not applying the Rogers test to the infringement claims.

        On remand, the district court dutifully went through the Rogers analysis, and
the infringement claim became an easy win for VIP. On the first prong, the court
noted that the toy "imitates, yet alters, JDPI's trade dress to make a joke about a dog
defecating on the carpet." Given that, the trade dress "is relevant, if not central, to
VIP's message." As for the second prong, VIP did not engage in explicitly
misleading conduct, so the Jack Daniel's trademark claim had to fail.

        The district judge found the outcome depressing, lamenting that

                                                    559
        it appears nearly impossible for any trademark holder to prevail under the
        Rogers test. Where relevance need be merely "above zero" - which is to say,
        relevance can be scant or de minimis - it is difficult to imagine what creative
        junior use would not pass the Rogers test. . . . Similarly, the "explicitly
        misleading" standard essentially displaces the likelihood-of-confusion test
        with a standard that excuses nearly any use less than slapping another's
        trademark on your own work and calling it your own.

        Notably, the court saw the issue not as one of consumer harm, but the
interest of Jack Daniel's in brand protection.

        [W]hile JDPI finds the depiction of a dog relishing a bowel movement on a
        carpet distasteful and an abuse of its mark, in the final analysis, JDPI has no
        means to protect the viability of its trademark. Yet, the Court is bound by
        Ninth Circuit precedent. For JDPI or similarly situated trademark holders to
        obtain a different outcome, they must seek relief before the United States
        Supreme Court or the United States Congress.

        Jack Daniel's ultimately filed a cert petition on the following questions: "1.
Whether humorous use of another's trademark as one's own on a commercial
product is subject to the Lanham Act's traditional likelihood-of-confusion analysis,
or instead receives heightened First Amendment protection from trademark-
infringement claims" and "2. Whether humorous use of another's mark as one's
own on a commercial product is "noncommercial" under 15 U.S.C. §
1125(c)(3)(C), thus barring as a matter of law a claim of dilution by tarnishment
under the Trademark Dilution Revision Act."

        The Supreme Court granted the petition.

                     Jack Daniel's Properties, Inc. v. VIP Prod. LLC
                                      599 U.S. 140 (2023)

Justice KAGAN delivered the opinion of the Court.
        This case is about dog toys and whiskey, two items seldom appearing in the

same sentence. Respondent VIP Products makes a squeaky, chewable dog toy
designed to look like a bottle of Jack Daniel's whiskey. Though not entirely. On the
toy, for example, the words "Jack Daniel's" become "Bad Spaniels." And the
descriptive phrase "Old No. 7 Brand Tennessee Sour Mash Whiskey" turns into
"The Old No. 2 On Your Tennessee Carpet." The jokes did not impress petitioner
Jack Daniel's Properties. It owns trademarks in the distinctive Jack Daniel's bottle
and in many of the words and graphics on the label. And it believed Bad Spaniels

                                                    560
had both infringed and diluted those trademarks. Bad Spaniels had infringed the
marks, the argument ran, by leading consumers to think that Jack Daniel's had
created, or was otherwise responsible for, the dog toy. And Bad Spaniels had diluted
the marks, the argument went on, by associating the famed whiskey with, well, dog
excrement.

        The Court of Appeals, in the decision we review, saw things differently.
Though the federal trademark statute makes infringement turn on the likelihood of
consumer confusion, the Court of Appeals never got to that issue. On the court's
view, the First Amendment compels a stringent threshold test when an
infringement suit challenges a so-called expressive work--here (so said the court), the
Bad Spaniels toy. And that test knocked out Jack Daniel's claim, whatever the
likelihood of confusion. Likewise, Jack's dilution claim failed--though on that issue
the problem was statutory. The trademark law provides that the "noncommercial"
use of a mark cannot count as dilution. 15 U.S.C. § 1125(c)(3)(C). The Bad
Spaniels marks, the court held, fell within that exemption because the toy
communicated a message--a kind of parody--about Jack Daniel's.

        Today, we reject both conclusions. The infringement issue is the more
substantial. In addressing it, we do not decide whether the threshold inquiry
applied in the Court of Appeals is ever warranted. We hold only that it is not
appropriate when the accused infringer has used a trademark to designate the
source of its own goods--in other words, has used a trademark as a trademark. That
kind of use falls within the heartland of trademark law, and does not receive special
First Amendment protection. The dilution issue is more simply addressed. The use
of a mark does not count as noncommercial just because it parodies, or otherwise
comments on, another's products. . . .

                                                 II
        Our first and more substantial question concerns Jack Daniel's infringement
claim: Should the company have had to satisfy the Rogers threshold test before the
case could proceed to the Lanham Act's likelihood-of-confusion inquiry?1 The
parties address that issue in the broadest possible way, either attacking or defending
Rogers in all its possible applications. Today, we choose a narrower path. Without
deciding whether Rogers has merit in other contexts, we hold that it does not when
an alleged infringer uses a trademark in the way the Lanham Act most cares about:
as a designation of source for the infringer's own goods. VIP used the marks derived

filter.  1 To be clear, when we refer to "the Rogers threshold test," we mean any threshold First Amendment

                                                    561
from Jack Daniel's in that way, so the infringement claim here rises or falls on
likelihood of confusion. But that inquiry is not blind to the expressive aspect of the
Bad Spaniels toy that the Ninth Circuit highlighted. Beyond source designation,
VIP uses the marks at issue in an effort to "parody" or "make fun" of Jack Daniel's.
And that kind of message matters in assessing confusion because consumers are not
so likely to think that the maker of a mocked product is itself doing the mocking.

                                                 A
        To see why the Rogers test does not apply here, first consider the case from
which it emerged. The defendants there had produced and distributed a film by
Federico Fellini titled "Ginger and Fred" about two fictional Italian cabaret dancers
(Pippo and Amelia) who imitated Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire. When the film
was released in the United States, Ginger Rogers objected under the Lanham Act to
the use of her name. The Second Circuit rejected the claim. It reasoned that the
titles of "artistic works," like the works themselves, have an "expressive element"
implicating "First Amendment values." And at the same time, such names posed
only a "slight risk" of confusing consumers about either "the source or the content
of the work." So, the court concluded, a threshold filter was appropriate. When a
title "with at least some artistic relevance" was not "explicitly misleading as to source
or content," the claim could not go forward. But the court made clear that it was
not announcing a general rule. In the typical case, the court thought, the name of a
product was more likely to indicate its source, and to be taken by consumers in just
that way.
        Over the decades, the lower courts adopting Rogers have confined it to similar
cases, in which a trademark is used not to designate a work's source, but solely to
perform some other expressive function. So, for example, when the toymaker Mattel
sued a band over the song "Barbie Girl"--with lyrics including "Life in plastic, it's
fantastic" and "I'm a blond bimbo girl, in a fantasy world"--the Ninth Circuit
applied Rogers. Mattel, Inc. v. MCA Records, Inc., 296 F.3d 894, 901 (2002). That was
because, the court reasoned, the band's use of the Barbie name was "not [as] a
source identifier": The use did not "speak[ ] to [the song's] origin." Similarly, the
Eleventh Circuit dismissed a suit under Rogers when a sports artist depicted the
Crimson Tide's trademarked football uniforms solely to "memorialize" a notable
event in "football history." University of Ala. Bd. of Trustees v. New Life Art, Inc., 683
F.3d 1266, 1279 (2012). And when Louis Vuitton sued because a character in the
film The Hangover: Part II described his luggage as a "Louis Vuitton" (though
pronouncing it Lewis), a district court dismissed the complaint under Rogers. See
Louis Vuitton Malletier S. A. v. Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc., 868 F.Supp.2d 172
(S.D.N.Y. 2012). All parties agreed that the film was not using the Louis Vuitton

                                                    562
mark as its "own identifying trademark." When that is so, the court reasoned,
"confusion will usually be unlikely," and the "interest in free expression" counsels
in favor of avoiding the standard Lanham Act test.

        The same courts, though, routinely conduct likelihood-of-confusion analysis,
without mentioning Rogers, when trademarks are used as trademarks--i.e., to
designate source. And the Second Circuit--Rogers' home court--has made especially
clear that Rogers does not apply in that context. For example, that court held that an
offshoot political group's use of the trademark "United We Stand America" got no
Rogers help because the use was as a source identifier. See United We Stand Am., Inc.
v. United We Stand, Am. New York, Inc., 128 F.3d 86, 93 (1997). True, that slogan
had expressive content. But the defendant group, the court reasoned, was using it
"as a mark," to suggest the "same source identification" as the original "political
movement." And similarly, the Second Circuit (indeed, the judge who authored
Rogers) rejected a motorcycle mechanic's view that his modified version of Harley
Davidson's bar-and-shield logo was an expressive parody entitled to Rogers'
protection. See Harley-Davidson, Inc. v. Grottanelli, 164 F.3d 806, 812-813 (1999).
The court acknowledged that the mechanic's adapted logo conveyed a "somewhat
humorous[ ]" message. But his use of the logo was a quintessential "trademark use":
to brand his "repair and parts business"--through signage, a newsletter, and T-
shirts--with images "similar" to Harley-Davidson's.

        The point is that whatever you make of Rogers--and again, we take no
position on that issue--it has always been a cabined doctrine. If we put this case to
the side, the Rogers test has applied only to cases involving "non-trademark uses"--or
otherwise said, cases in which "the defendant has used the mark" at issue in a "non-
source-identifying way." S. Dogan & M. Lemley, Grounding Trademark Law
Through Trademark Use, 92 Iowa L. Rev. 1669, 1684 (2007); see id., at 1683-1684,
and n. 58. The test has not insulated from ordinary trademark scrutiny the use of
trademarks as trademarks, "to identify or brand [a defendant's] goods or services."
Id., at 1683.

        We offer as one last example of that limitation a case with a striking
resemblance to this one. It too involved dog products, though perfumes rather than
toys. Yes, the defendant sold "a line of pet perfumes whose names parody elegant
brands sold for human consumption." Tommy Hilfiger Licensing, Inc. v. Nature Labs,
LLC, 221 F.Supp.2d 410, 412 (S.D.N.Y. 2002) (MUKASEY, J.). The product at
issue was named Timmy Holedigger--which Tommy Hilfiger didn't much like. The
defendant asked for application of Rogers. The court declined it, relying on Harley-
Davidson. Rogers, the court explained, kicks in when a suit involves solely
"nontrademark uses of [a] mark--that is, where the trademark is not being used to

                                                    563
indicate the source or origin" of a product, but only to convey a different kind of
message. When, instead, the use is "at least in part" for "source identification"--
when the defendant may be "trading on the good will of the trademark owner to
market its own goods"--Rogers has no proper role. And that is so, the court
continued, even if the defendant is also "making an expressive comment," including
a parody of a different product. The defendant is still "mak[ing] trademark use of
another's mark," and must meet an infringement claim on the usual battleground
of "likelihood of confusion."

        That conclusion fits trademark law, and reflects its primary mission. From its
definition of "trademark" onward, the Lanham Act views marks as source
identifiers--as things that function to "indicate the source" of goods, and so to
"distinguish" them from ones "manufactured or sold by others." § 1127. The
cardinal sin under the law . . . is to undermine that function. It is to confuse
consumers about source--to make (some of) them think that one producer's
products are another's. And that kind of confusion is most likely to arise when
someone uses another's trademark as a trademark--meaning, again, as a source
identifier--rather than for some other expressive function. To adapt one of the cases
noted above: Suppose a filmmaker uses a Louis Vuitton suitcase to convey
something about a character (he is the kind of person who wants to be seen with the
product but doesn't know how to pronounce its name). Now think about a
different scenario: A luggage manufacturer uses an ever-so-slightly modified LV logo
to make inroads in the suitcase market. The greater likelihood of confusion inheres
in the latter use, because it is the one conveying information (or misinformation)
about who is responsible for a product. That kind of use "implicate[s] the core
concerns of trademark law" and creates "the paradigmatic infringement case." G.
Dinwoodie & M. Janis, Confusion Over Use: Contextualism in Trademark Law, 92
Iowa L. Rev. 1597, 1636 (2007). So the Rogers test--which offers an escape from the
likelihood-of-confusion inquiry and a shortcut to dismissal--has no proper
application.2

        Nor does that result change because the use of a mark has other expressive
content--i.e., because it conveys some message on top of source. Here is where we

          2 That is not to say (far from it) that every infringement case involving a source-identifying use

requires full-scale litigation. Some of those uses will not present any plausible likelihood of confusion--

because of dissimilarity in the marks or various contextual considerations. And if, in a given case, a plaintiff

fails to plausibly allege a likelihood of confusion, the district court should dismiss the complaint under

Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). See 6 McCarthy § 32:121.75 (providing examples).

                                                    564
most dramatically part ways with the Ninth Circuit, which thought that because Bad
Spaniels "communicates a humorous message," it is automatically entitled to Rogers'
protection. On that view, Rogers might take over much of the world. For trademarks
are often expressive, in any number of ways. Consider how one liqueur brand's
trade dress (beyond identifying source) tells a story, with a bottle in the shape of a
friar's habit connoting the product's olden monastic roots:

        Or take a band name that "not only identifies the band but expresses a view
about social issues." [Matal v. Tam, 582 U.S. 218,] 245 [(2017)] (opinion of ALITO,
J.) (discussing "The Slants"). Or note how a mark can both function as a mark and
have parodic content--as the court found in the Hilfiger/Holedigger litigation. The
examples could go on and on. As a leading treatise puts the point, the Ninth
Circuit's expansion of Rogers "potentially encompasses just about everything"
because names, phrases, symbols, designs, and their varied combinations often
"contain some `expressive' message" unrelated to source. 6 McCarthy § 31:144.50.
That message may well be relevant in assessing the likelihood of confusion between
two marks, as we address below. But few cases would even get to the likelihood-of-
confusion inquiry if all expressive content triggered the Rogers filter. In that event,
the Rogers exception would become the general rule, in conflict with courts'
longstanding view of trademark law.

        The Ninth Circuit was mistaken to believe that the First Amendment
demanded such a result. The court thought that trademark law would otherwise
"fail[ ] to account for the full weight of the public's interest in free expression." But
as the Mattel (i.e., Barbie) court noted, when a challenged trademark use functions
as "source-identifying," trademark rights "play well with the First Amendment":
"Whatever first amendment rights you may have in calling the brew you make in
your bathtub `Pepsi' " are "outweighed by the buyer's interest in not being fooled
into buying it." . . . Or yet again, in an especially clear rendering: "[T]he trademark
law generally prevails over the First Amendment" when "another's trademark (or a

                                                    565
confusingly similar mark) is used without permission" as a means of "source
identification." Yankee Publishing Inc. v. News Am. Publishing Inc., 809 F.Supp. 267,
276 (S.D.N.Y. 1992) (LEVAL, J.) (emphasis deleted). So for those uses, the First
Amendment does not demand a threshold inquiry like the Rogers test. When a mark
is used as a mark (except, potentially, in rare situations), the likelihood-of-confusion
inquiry does enough work to account for the interest in free expression.

                                                 B
        Here, the District Court correctly held that "VIP uses its Bad Spaniels
trademark and trade dress as source identifiers of its dog toy." In fact, VIP conceded
that point below. In its complaint, VIP alleged that it both "own[s] and "use[s]" the
" `Bad Spaniels' trademark and trade dress for its durable rubber squeaky novelty
dog toy." The company thus represented in this very suit that the mark and dress,
although not registered, are used to "identify and distinguish [VIP's] goods" and to
"indicate [their] source." § 1127. (Registration of marks, you'll recall, is optional.)
        In this Court, VIP says the complaint was a mere "form allegation"--a matter
of "rote." Tr. of Oral Arg. 73. But even if we knew what that meant, VIP has said
and done more in the same direction. First, there is the way the product is
marketed. On the hangtag, the Bad Spaniels logo sits opposite the concededly
trademarked Silly Squeakers logo, with both appearing to serve the same source-
identifying function. And second, there is VIP's practice as to other products in the
Silly Squeakers line. The company has consistently argued in court that it owns,
though has never registered, the trademark and trade dress in dog toys like "Jose
Perro" (cf. Jose Cuervo) and "HeinieSniff `n" (cf. Heineken). And it has chosen to
register the names of still other dog toys, including Dos Perros (#6176781), Smella
Arpaw (#6262975), and Doggie Walker (#6213816). Put all that together, and more
than "form" or "rote" emerges: VIP's conduct is its own admission that it is using
the Bad Spaniels (née Jack Daniel's) trademarks as trademarks, to identify product
source.
        Because that is so, the only question in this suit going forward is whether the
Bad Spaniels marks are likely to cause confusion. There is no threshold test working
to kick out all cases involving "expressive works." But a trademark's expressive
message--particularly a parodic one, as VIP asserts--may properly figure in assessing
the likelihood of confusion. See, e.g., Louis Vuitton Malletier S. A. v. Haute Diggity
Dog, LLC, 507 F.3d 252, 265 (C.A.4 2007) (Parody "influences the way in which the
[likelihood-of-confusion] factors are applied"); Brief for United States as Amicus
Curiae 17-22 (same). A parody must "conjure up" "enough of [an] original to make
the object of its critical wit recognizable." Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc., 510 U.S.
569, 588 (1994) (internal quotation marks omitted). Yet to succeed, the parody

                                                    566
must also create contrasts, so that its message of ridicule or pointed humor comes
clear. And once that is done (if that is done), a parody is not often likely to create
confusion. Self-deprecation is one thing; self-mockery far less ordinary. So although
VIP's effort to ridicule Jack Daniel's does not justify use of the Rogers test, it may
make a difference in the standard trademark analysis. Consistent with our ordinary
practice, we remand that issue to the courts below.

                                                III
        Our second question, more easily dispatched, concerns Jack Daniel's claim of
dilution by tarnishment (for the linkage of its whiskey to less savory substances).
Recall that the Ninth Circuit dismissed that claim based on one of the Lanham
Act's "[e]xclusions" from dilution liability--for "[a]ny noncommercial use of a mark."
§ 1125(c)(3)(C). On the court's view, the "use of a mark may be `noncommercial'
even if used to sell a product." And VIP's use is so, the court continued, because it
"parodies" and "convey[s] a humorous message" about Jack Daniel's. We need not
express a view on the first step of that reasoning because we think the second step
wrong. However wide the scope of the "noncommercial use" exclusion, it cannot
include, as the Ninth Circuit thought, every parody or humorous commentary.
        To begin to see why, consider the scope of another of the Lanham Act's
exclusions--this one for "[a]ny fair use." As described earlier, the "fair use" exclusion
specifically covers uses "parodying, criticizing, or commenting upon" a famous mark
owner. § 1125(c)(3)(A)(ii). But not in every circumstance. Critically, the fair-use
exclusion has its own exclusion: It does not apply when the use is "as a designation
of source for the person's own goods or services." § 1125(c)(3)(A). In that event, no
parody, criticism, or commentary will rescue the alleged dilutor. It will be subject to
liability regardless.
        The problem with the Ninth Circuit's approach is that it reverses that
statutorily directed result, as this case illustrates. Given the fair-use provision's carve-
out, parody (and criticism and commentary, humorous or otherwise) is exempt from
liability only if not used to designate source. Whereas on the Ninth Circuit's view,
parody (and so forth) is exempt always--regardless whether it designates source. The
expansive view of the "noncommercial use" exclusion effectively nullifies Congress's
express limit on the fair-use exclusion for parody, etc. Just consider how the Ninth
Circuit's construction played out here. The District Court had rightly concluded
that because VIP used the challenged marks as source identifiers, it could not
benefit from the fair-use exclusion for parody. The Ninth Circuit took no issue with
that ruling. But it shielded VIP's parodic uses anyway. In doing so, the court
negated Congress's judgment about when--and when not--parody (and criticism and
commentary) is excluded from dilution liability.

                                                    567
                                                IV
        Today's opinion is narrow. We do not decide whether the Rogers test is ever
appropriate, or how far the "noncommercial use" exclusion goes. On infringement,
we hold only that Rogers does not apply when the challenged use of a mark is as a
mark. On dilution, we hold only that the noncommercial exclusion does not shield
parody or other commentary when its use of a mark is similarly source-identifying. It
is no coincidence that both our holdings turn on whether the use of a mark is
serving a source-designation function. The Lanham Act makes that fact crucial, in
its effort to ensure that consumers can tell where goods come from.
        For the reasons stated, we vacate the judgment below and remand for further
proceedings consistent with this opinion.
        It is so ordered.

Justice SOTOMAYOR, with whom Justice ALITO joins, concurring.
        I join the Court's opinion in full. I write separately to emphasize that in the

context of parodies and potentially other uses implicating First Amendment
concerns, courts should treat the results of surveys with particular caution. As
petitioner did here, plaintiffs in trademark infringement cases often commission
surveys that purport to show that consumers are likely to be confused by an
allegedly infringing product. Like any other evidence, surveys should be understood
as merely one piece of the multifaceted likelihood of confusion analysis. Courts
should also carefully assess the methodology and representativeness of surveys, as
many lower courts already do.

        When an alleged trademark infringement involves a parody, however, there
is particular risk in giving uncritical or undue weight to surveys. Survey answers may
reflect a mistaken belief among some survey respondents that all parodies require
permission from the owner of the parodied mark. Some of the answers to the survey
in this case illustrate this potential. See App. 81-82, n. 25 (" `I'm sure the dog toy
company that made this toy had to get [Jack Daniel's] permission and legal rights to
essentially copy the[ir] product in dog toy form' "); ibid. (" `The bottle is mimicked
after the Jack Daniel BBQ sauce. So they would hold the patent therefore you
would have to ask permission to use the image' "); see also Anheuser-Busch, Inc. v.
Balducci Publications, 28 F.3d 769, 772-773, 775 (C.A.8 1994) (describing a similar
situation). Plaintiffs can point to this misunderstanding of the legal framework as
evidence of consumer confusion. Cleverly designed surveys could also prompt such
confusion by making consumers think about complex legal questions around
permission that would not have arisen organically out in the world.

        Allowing such survey results to drive the infringement analysis would risk
silencing a great many parodies, even ones that by other metrics are unlikely to

                                                    568
result in the confusion about sourcing that is the core concern of the Lanham Act.
Well-heeled brands with the resources to commission surveys would be handed an
effective veto over mockery. After all, "[n]o one likes to be the butt of a joke, not
even a trademark." 6 J. McCarthy, Trademarks and Unfair Competition § 31:153
(5th ed. 2023). This would upset the Lanham Act's careful balancing of "the needs
of merchants for identification as the provider of goods with the needs of society for
free communication and discussion." P. Leval, Trademark: Champion of Free
Speech, 27 Colum. J. L. & Arts 187, 210 (2004). Courts should thus ensure surveys
do not completely displace other likelihood-of-confusion factors, which may more
accurately track the experiences of actual consumers in the marketplace. Courts
should also be attentive to ways in which surveys may artificially prompt such
confusion about the law or fail to sufficiently control for it.

Justice GORSUCH, with whom Justice THOMAS and Justice BARRETT join,
concurring.

        I am pleased to join the Court's opinion. I write separately only to
underscore that lower courts should handle Rogers v. Grimaldi, 875 F.2d 994 (C.A.2
1989), with care. Today, the Court rightly concludes that, even taken on its own
terms, Rogers does not apply to cases like the one before us. But in doing so, we
necessarily leave much about Rogers unaddressed. For example, it is not entirely clear
where the Rogers test comes from--is it commanded by the First Amendment, or is it
merely gloss on the Lanham Act, perhaps inspired by constitutional-avoidance
doctrine? For another thing, it is not obvious that Rogers is correct in all its
particulars--certainly, the Solicitor General raises serious questions about the
decision. All this remains for resolution another day, and lower courts should be
attuned to that fact.

                                     Notes and Questions

        Why fight? What is Jack Daniel's hoping to accomplish with this litigation?
What is the harm to the company of VIP's conduct? Would winning the case
benefit consumers?

        What is a source-identifying trademark use? The Court styles its ruling as narrow.
The opinion expressly distinguishes prior applications of the Rogers test, and it draws
an intuitively appealing line between uses that identify source and those that do not.
So maybe Jack Daniel's just prevents application of Rogers to "quintessential"
trademark uses? Compare Punchbowl, Inc. v. AJ Press, LLC, 52 F.4th 1091, 1097
(9th Cir. 2022) (applying Rogers to a brand name in pre-Jack Daniel's litigation),

                                                    569
opinion withdrawn, 78 F.4th 1158 (9th Cir. 2023), with Punchbowl, Inc. v. AJ Press,
LLC, 90 F.4th 1022 (9th Cir. 2024) (ruling that Rogers does not apply in light of Jack
Daniel's).

        But is that line clear? Consider, for example, the chew toy at issue in Jack
Daniel's. Would a consumer see the purportedly infringing material as source
identifying? Or is it the object of desire (e.g., "I want a chew toy that makes fun of
JACK DANIEL'S")? Recall the same issue with regards to the assertion of trademark
rights over merchandise. Does this reflect trademark law's solicitude for
merchandising interests of trademark holders? So might it be the case that the Rogers
test will be applied more or less as before, but just not to merchandise?

        And how clear is that line? Vans, Inc. v. MSCHF Prod. Studio, Inc., 88 F.4th
125 (2d Cir. 2023), concerns the plaintiff's "Old Skool" shoe, which provoked a
parody, titled the "Wavy Baby." The defendant was an "art collective" whose
"mission is to use artwork `to start a conversation about consumer culture ... by
participating in consumer culture.' MSCHF recontextualizes everyday objects as a
means of commenting on contemporary society. MSCHF's work has been displayed
in museums, galleries, auction houses, and art shows worldwide, including Phillips
Auction House, Art Basel, the Design Museum of London, and the Perrotin gallery.
MSCHF's works are often sold with `manifestos' that explain the work's
commentary and are sold in `drops,' or prescribed sales periods. Recent drops have
critiqued music, the political system, consumerism, digital media, standardized
testing, holidays, and the legal system. " Id. at 130 (paragraph break and citation to
the district court opinion omitted). Here are the respective designs:

                                                    570
        Note the sole pattern, indicating a lack of utility of the defendant's product
as a shoe. Is this a trademark use? If so, is likelihood of confusion plausible? The
Second Circuit said yes on both counts, upholding the district court's refusal to
apply Rogers as well as its preliminary injunction in the plaintiff's favor.

        What about titles? Are titles trademark uses for purposes of the Rogers test? If
yes, that seems to undermine a foundational use of Rogers, as the original Rogers case
concerned a movie title. Justice Kagan's opinion, moreover, went out of its way to
distinguish Rogers, suggesting that movie titles are not the kind of trademark uses
that would foreclose application of the Rogers framework. Post-Jack Daniels, however,
several opinions have been reluctant to apply Rogers to titles. For example, Davis v.
Blue Tongue Films involves a trademark claim by authors of a book titled Gringo
against the makers of a film with the same name (but different plot). This looks like
a job for Rogers, right? Wrong.

        The Rogers test does not apply at this stage in the proceedings because the
        [complaint] plausibly alleges that the Movie uses "Gringo" as a source
        identifier. The [complaint's] allegations that Filmmakers chose the titular
        mark "Gringo" to suggest an association between the Book and Movie,
        displayed the mark in similar ways, and distributed the Movie through the
        same commercial platform support a plausible inference that Filmmakers
        used the "Gringo" title to identify the source of the Movie. We reject
        Filmmakers' arguments that this case is like Mattel, Inc. v. MCA Records, Inc.,
        296 F.3d 894 (9th Cir. 2002), because the SAC alleges that Filmmakers used
        "Gringo" not merely to convey a message about the Movie's plot but also to
        garner attention by "exploiting the goodwill, public recognition and
        commercial success enjoyed by the Book," see id. at 901.

Davis v. Blue Tongue Films, No. 23-3968, 2024 WL 5182630, at *2 (9th Cir. Dec.
20, 2024) (some citations omitted). The dissent would have held that the plaintiffs
had not established secondary meaning for the purported mark.

        Permission confusion. If a use is not source-identifying, how is there a
trademark claim in the first place? Merchandising and expressive use cases return us
to the question of what kinds of confusion matter. Assume arguendo that nobody
thinks that Jack Daniel's was the source of the Bad Spaniels chew toy, but that some
people think that the whiskey maker must have given permission for the toy to exist.
Should that be an adequate basis for a trademark suit? Justice Sotomayor's
concurrence says no, at least where parody is concerned. But in general?

                                                    571
        The issue produced a fascinating exchange in oral argument in Jack Daniel's
between Justice Alito and the Solicitor General's attorney.

        JUSTICE ALITO: And what about the fact that a lot of people surveyed may
        think that as a matter of law, it was necessary to get the approval of the mark
        holder?

        MR. GUARNIERI: Well, that's a hard case. It's a hard question. . . .

        I think that's hard to say because the Lanham Act itself --one theory of
        trademark infringement is that consumers are confused about whether the mark holder
        has granted its permission to use its marks, that is, whether it has granted legal
        permission to the allegedly infringing junior mark. If the surveyed consumers
        think, yeah, you couldn't do this without getting Jack Daniel's permission, I think
        that's --that's evidence of likelihood of confusion in --now I will say . . . . surveys are
        just -I mean, it's one piece of the puzzle here, but it's not the whole thing.
        They are meant to be an approximation of consumer perceptions in the
        marketplace.

Transcript of Oral Argument at 52-53 (emphases added). The exchange is
illuminating, for it shows that even the Solicitor General's office seems to believe
that the likelihood of mistaken consumer perceptions about mere permission--not
source, not quality, not endorsement--could give trademark holders the power to
control speech about their marks if such evidence exists.

        The role of surveys. Note the critique of surveys by the Sotomayor concurrence.
Recall that the initial bench trial in this case concluded that VIP did indeed infringe
the Jack Daniel's trademarks. The district judge relied in large part on a survey by
Jack Daniel's that purportedly showed a 29% level of confusion on the part of test
subjects. VIP produced an expert who claimed that the survey was significantly
flawed. How to resolve the battle of experts? The district judge simply ignored the
critiques of VIP's expert because VIP's expert did not conduct a survey of his own.
"Although Dr. Nowlis objected to Dr. Ford's control stimulus, Dr. Nowlis did not
support this view by conducting a survey or by conducting independent research; he
simply couched his opinion regarding lack of confusion through generalized
objections to Dr. Ford's report." 291 F. Supp. 3d at 908.

        But assuming the survey was a good one, the claimed confusion level of 29%
obscures a more controversial legal conclusion. As the district judge noted, the 29%
figure combined perceptions of source, affiliation, and the belief that the toy was
"put out with the authorization or approval of Jack Daniel's." 291 F. Supp. 3d at

                                                    572
907. In other words, much of the confusion was about permission. The district
court made no effort to disaggregate permission confusion from source confusion,
but VIP's expert reviewed the survey and found that the "source" confusion was
only 11.8%,* which is lower than the typical threshold for surveys to be treated as
evidence of likely confusion. So even leaving aside questions of survey design,
permission confusion was the main confusion at issue in the case, not source. VIP's
expert noted that given the parodic nature of the chew toy, "it is clear that many
respondents in fact recognized that the product is made or put out by VIP products,
and yet were thinking that VIP would need to get authorization or approval from
Jack Daniel's in order to sell such a parody product."

        Litigating expressive uses. What if courts move away from the Rogers test? Does
Jack Daniel's give trademark holders too much power to threaten litigation? Part of
the appeal of the Rogers framework is its ability to block certain claims without the
costs of a full trial. Jack Daniel's responds to this concern by noting that meritless
claims may still be disposed of early, perhaps even on a 12(b)(6) motion. Does this
comport with the factual nature of trademark litigation? What if the plaintiff has a
survey in its favor. What then? Do courts have the leeway to simply declare that a
rational consumer would not be confused by the use? How exactly are courts
supposed to take the expressive nature of a use into account in a likelihood-of-
confusion analysis?

        On that point, note the Court's approving cite of the "Chewy Vuiton" case
discussed earlier in the chapter. Is that case so different than Jack Daniel's? On
remand, the district judge in Jack Daniel's decided that there was not much
difference. He acknowledged the Supreme Court's suggestion that "the parodic use
of a trademark may properly factor into the likelihood of confusion analysis" and
considered the likelihood-of-confusion factors in a manner to reflect the parodic
nature of the VIP toy.

        Neither party seizes a runaway victory upon reconsideration of the Sleekcraft
        factors when accounting for the parodic intentions of "Bad Spaniels."
        However, beginning the Sleekcraft evaluation with the premise that a
        successful parody is unlikely to be confusing, the Court finds that Jack
        Daniel's has not shown by a preponderance of the evidence that VIP's "Bad
        Spaniels" toy creates a likelihood of confusion. The foremost concern of

          * This analysis can be found at page 82 of the Joint Appendix to the Jack Daniel's case.

                                                    573
        trademark infringement is consumer confusion as to source, and, when
        accounting for parody, the Court cannot conclude based on the Sleekcraft
        factors that consumer confusion is likely.

        . . . . Adjusting the Sleekcraft factors to account for parody neutralizes or flips
        three important factors--similarity of the marks, VIP's intent, and strength of
        Jack Daniel's mark--in VIP's favor. See GoTo.com, Inc. v. Walt Disney Co., 202
        F.3d 1199, 1205 (9th Cir. 2000) ("The first Sleekcraft factor--the similarity of
        the marks--has always been considered a critical question in the likelihood-of-
        confusion analysis."). Without a strong showing on the remaining factors,
        Jack Daniel's has not shown a likelihood of confusion. As such, the Court
        finds by a preponderance of the evidence that VIP has not infringed on Jack
        Daniel's trademark rights.

VIP Prods. LLC v. Jack Daniel's Props. Inc., at *25 (D. Ariz. Jan. 23, 2025). Jack
Daniel's still prevailed on its dilution claim, as discussed in Chapter 20.

        Up for grabs? Consider the Gorsuch concurrence, which seems open to future
challenges of the Rogers test on the grounds that it is without textual basis. Can you
think of other trademark doctrines that might be in danger if we take a purely text-
based approach to implementing the Lanham Act?

Problems

        1. Chris Webber was a famous basketball player. One of his more
notorious moments came in college when his team, the University of Michigan
Wolverines, was playing for the national championship. Late in the game, Webber
called for a timeout, but Michigan was out of timeouts, which resulted in a
technical foul (a penalty) against the team that ended its chance of winning.*

        Arrow is a rock band. They recently released a largely instrumental track in
the "shoegaze" style (think My Bloody Valentine--youtube** the group if you don't
know them) called "Michigan Wolverines." The lyrics on the song are hard to make
out, as they exist largely as accompaniment to the music. Most of the lyrics that can
be deciphered sound like recipes for cake. The only reference in the song that
evokes Michigan at all is the following verse:

          * Side note, the first paragraph is true. What follows is a made-up hypothetical.
          ** Is that a generic use?

The University of Michigan threatens suit. What advice can we give Arrow?

        2. Speaking of the University of Michigan, suppose the following:
Bilinda Butcher is an artist. She paints a picture of the Michigan football team
taking the field. The University threatens suit for use of the team's trademarked
colors and uniforms. Do they have a case?

        3. Bart Simpson achieves viral fame when he accidentally destroys the set
of a popular television show on live television. Standing amid the mess he caused,
he innocently says, "I didn't do it." The moment becomes a meme, and Bart
becomes famous as the "I didn't do it" kid. Of course he registers the phrase as a
trademark and licenses it to vendors, who place it on a wide range of merchandise,
including greeting cards.

        Milhouse Enterprises is a greeting card company. It releases a card in which a
boy (who looks nothing like Bart) is standing in a kitchen in which a pot and pan--
filled with pasta and marinara sauce, respectively--have fallen to the floor, making a
huge mess. Inside the card, the caption reads, "I didn't do it. But Happy Birthday!"

        If Simpson sues for trademark infringement, can Milhouse defend under
Rogers? Does Simpson have any counterarguments?

Democratic parties of the United States are

often known by animal logos--an elephant

parties have trademark rights to certain

representations of these animals. What

Shirts depicting a donkey or elephant drunk with the caption, "Time to Sober Up

America!"? Can the insulted party sue for trademark infringement? What if it has a

survey indicating that some number of respondents think permission was required?*

25. Trademark Procedure

        The previous readings have detailed many of the issues that come up in
trademark litigation, but there remain several important practice-related matters--
most notably remedies--that we have not addressed. The purpose of this reading is
to provide an overview of some of them.

Remedies

        So you've won your case. What can you get? The law of remedies under the
Lanham Act has a variety of complications. They come from somewhat messy
statutory wording, but also from the fundamental tension of trademark litigation--
the consumer interest in accurate information is being vindicated by someone other
than the consumer. The remedies sought by the consumers' champions (i.e., the
trademark holders) do not necessarily serve the interests of consumers.

        15 U.S.C. § 1117. Section 35 of the Lanham Act provides, in part, that one
who prevails in litigation under sections 32, 43(a),1 43(d), or establishes a willful
violation of § 43(d):

        shall be entitled, subject to the provisions of sections 1111 and 1114 of this
        title, and subject to the principles of equity, to recover

                (1) defendant's profits,

                (2) any damages sustained by the plaintiff, and

                (3) the costs of the action.

        The court shall assess such profits and damages or cause the same to be
        assessed under its direction. In assessing profits the plaintiff shall be required
        to prove defendant's sales only; defendant must prove all elements of cost or
        deduction claimed. In assessing damages the court may enter judgment,
        according to the circumstances of the case, for any sum above the amount
        found as actual damages, not exceeding three times such amount. If the
        court shall find that the amount of the recovery based on profits is either
        inadequate or excessive the court may in its discretion enter judgment for

          1 Remember that section 43(a) also includes the false advertising cause of action.

                                                    576
        such sum as the court shall find to be just, according to the circumstances of
        the case. Such sum in either of the above circumstances shall constitute
        compensation and not a penalty. The court in exceptional cases may award
        reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party.

Monetary Remedies

        Monetary remedies are a bit of a mess in the Lanham Act. Note that the
excerpt quoted above contemplates two types of monetary remedies: damages and
defendant's profits. The latter is a traditional remedy at equity (damages, of course,
being the standard remedy at law). Both remedies are to be awarded, however,
"subject to the principles of equity," suggesting that equitable principles apply
generally. Although both damages and profits may be awarded, there should not be
a double recovery. See, e.g., RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF UNFAIR COMPETITION § 36,
cmt. c (1995).

        Damages. A damages remedy requires, well, damage to the plaintiff, typically
in the form of lost sales. See, e.g., Resource Developers, Inc. v. Statue of Liberty-Ellis
Island Foundation, Inc., 926 F.2d 134, 139 (2d Cir. 1991) ("When a plaintiff seeks
money damages in either a product infringement case or a false advertising case
asserted under section 43(a), the plaintiff must introduce evidence of actual
consumer confusion. This requirement must be distinguished from cases brought
under the Lanham Act in which only injunctive relief is sought; in those cases the
plaintiff need only prove a likelihood of confusion among consumers." (citations
omitted)). This makes the remedy a tricky one insofar as lost sales are hard to prove.

        Courts sometimes accept circumstantial evidence, like a survey, as proof of
actual confusion. RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF UNFAIR COMPETITION § 36 cmt. i
(1995) ("direct proof of actual confusion or deception is often unavailable, and the
proof may consist instead of circumstantial evidence such as consumer surveys,
market analysis, or the nature of the defendant's misconduct. In trademark
infringement cases involving directly competing goods, proof of actual confusion
may permit the further inference that sales have been diverted from the plaintiff to
the defendant." (internal citation omitted)). Several cases accept proof of
intentionally deceptive conduct as a substitute for evidence of actual confusion, or
at least as a way to shift the burden to the defendant by creating a rebuttable
presumption of damage. Boosey & Hawkes Music Publishers, Ltd. v. Walt Disney
Co., 145 F.3d 481, 493 (2d Cir. 1998) ("Our case law is well settled that in order for
a Lanham Act plaintiff to receive an award of damages the plaintiff must prove either

                                                    577
actual consumer confusion or deception resulting from the violation, ... or that the
defendant's actions were intentionally deceptive thus giving rise to a rebuttable
presumption of consumer confusion." (internal quotations omitted)). The plaintiff
still bears the burden of causation. RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF UNFAIR
COMPETITION § 36 cmt. h (1995). Professor McCarthy notes that courts,
analogizing to antitrust law, are more strict about requiring a plaintiff to show that
there has been damage than they are about being precise as to how much damage
there was. 5 MCCARTHY § 30:76.

        There are other compensable damages beyond lost sales. A court may find
harm to a markholder's goodwill resulting from the defendant's conduct. The
defendant may have interfered with the plaintiff's ability to develop a market.
Sometimes courts will find that the plaintiff is due a reasonable royalty to reflect
what it might have received had the mark been licensed. This latter remedy is
particularly germane in the franchise setting. On these and other measures of
damages, including the possibility of corrective advertising, see generally 5
MCCARTHY §§ 30:77-87.

        Punitive damages. "In assessing damages the court may enter judgment,
according to the circumstances of the case, for any sum above the amount found as
actual damages, not exceeding three times such amount." In other words, precision
is not required. That said, the treble damages remedy cannot be punitive, as the
award "shall constitute compensation and not a penalty." Although Lanham Act
damages awards are not punitive, damages for analogous state causes of action may
be. In Adidas-America, Inc. v. Payless ShoeSource, Inc., 2008 WL 4279812 (D. Or.
2008), a jury ruled in favor of Adidas on a mix of state and federal claims that
Payless sold confusingly similar shoes and sportswear. The damage award totaled
$305 million, of which $137 million were punitive damages based on the state
claims. The district judge ordered a remittitur of the punitive award to $15 million
(or a new trial if Adidas did not accept the reduction).2

        Statutory damages. Plaintiffs under ACPA and in counterfeiting cases have
the option to elect statutory damages in lieu of proving actual damages. Section 35
provides:

          2 Relatedly, the jury award of $137 million in profits, which included the federal claims, was
reduced to $19.7 million on the grounds that so high an award would be punitive in violation of the Lanham
Act. Adidas also received $30.6 million in damages calculated as a reasonable royalty.

                                                    578
        (c) Statutory damages for use of counterfeit marks

        In a case involving the use of a counterfeit mark (as defined in section
        1116(d) of this title) in connection with the sale, offering for sale, or
        distribution of goods or services, the plaintiff may elect, at any time before
        final judgment is rendered by the trial court, to recover, instead of actual
        damages and profits under subsection (a) of this section, an award of
        statutory damages for any such use in connection with the sale, offering for
        sale, or distribution of goods or services in the amount of--

                (1) not less than $1,000 or more than $200,000 per counterfeit mark
                per type of goods or services sold, offered for sale, or distributed, as
                the court considers just; or

                (2) if the court finds that the use of the counterfeit mark was willful,
                not more than $2,000,000 per counterfeit mark per type of goods or
                services sold, offered for sale, or distributed, as the court considers
                just.

        (d) Statutory damages for violation of section 1125(d)(1)

        In a case involving a violation of section 1125(d)(1) of this title, the plaintiff
        may elect, at any time before final judgment is rendered by the trial court, to
        recover, instead of actual damages and profits, an award of statutory damages
        in the amount of not less than $1,000 and not more than $100,000 per
        domain name, as the court considers just.

        Statutory damages may exceed actual damages and may consider an award's
deterrent effect even in the absence of a defendant's willfulness. Top Tobacco, L.P.
v. Star Importers & Wholesalers, Inc., 135 F.4th 1244 (11th Cir. 2025). But see
MCCARTHY § 30:95 ("Some courts will consider whether the amount of statutory
damages requested bears a plausible relationship to plaintiff's actual damages.").

        Defendant's profits. Accounting of profits is a traditional equitable remedy.
The profits remedy in trademark is naturally only a rough (at best) measure of
damages for the plaintiff as it would require both competition and the prospect that
every sale accrued by the defendant would have gone to the plaintiff. At the same
time, it offers another route for calculation in contexts in which the damages to the
plaintiff are hard to ascertain. Venture Tape Corp. v. McGills Glass Warehouse,
540 F.3d 56, 63 (1st Cir. 2008) ("When a mark owner cannot prove actual damages

                                                    579
attributable to the infringer's misconduct (e.g., specific instances of lost sales), its
recovery of an equitable share of the infringer's profits serves, inter alia, as a "rough
measure" of the likely harm that the mark owner incurred because of the
infringement, while also preventing the infringer's unjust enrichment and deterring
further infringement." (internal citation omitted)). But as an equitable remedy (and
recall again that the statute directs that its remedies be applied in accord with
equitable principles), it is applied in a flexible manner by the courts. This includes
situations in which the defendant has not caused lost sales, but the remedy is
ordered to protect unjust enrichment. See, e.g., Banjo Buddies, Inc. v. Renosky, 399
F.3d 168, 177-78 (3d Cir. 2005) (accounting appropriate "if the defendant is
unjustly enriched, if the plaintiff has sustained damages, or if an accounting is
necessary to deter infringement"). This suggests that actual confusion should not be
required in cases in which the court aims to deter, but a minority of cases
considering the issue so require. 5 MCCARTHY § 30:63.

                            Romag Fasteners, Inc v. Fossil, Inc.
                                    140 S. Ct. 1492 (2020)

Justice GORSUCH delivered the opinion of the Court.
        When it comes to remedies for trademark infringement, the Lanham Act

authorizes many. A district court may award a winning plaintiff injunctive relief,
damages, or the defendant's ill-gotten profits. Without question, a defendant's state
of mind may have a bearing on what relief a plaintiff should receive. An innocent
trademark violator often stands in very different shoes than an intentional one. But
some circuits have gone further. These courts hold a plaintiff can win a profits
remedy, in particular, only after showing the defendant willfully infringed its
trademark. The question before us is whether that categorical rule can be reconciled
with the statute's plain language.

        The question comes to us in a case involving handbag fasteners. Romag sells
magnetic snap fasteners for use in leather goods. Fossil designs, markets, and
distributes a wide range of fashion accessories. Years ago, the pair signed an
agreement allowing Fossil to use Romag's fasteners in Fossil's handbags and other
products. Initially, both sides seemed content with the arrangement. But in time
Romag discovered that the factories Fossil hired in China to make its products were
using counterfeit Romag fasteners--and that Fossil was doing little to guard against
the practice. Unable to resolve its concerns amicably, Romag sued. The company
alleged that Fossil had infringed its trademark and falsely represented that its
fasteners came from Romag. After trial, a jury agreed with Romag, and found that
Fossil had acted "in callous disregard" of Romag's rights. At the same time,

                                                    580
however, the jury rejected Romag's accusation that Fossil had acted willfully, as that
term was defined by the district court.

         For our purposes, the last finding is the important one. By way of relief for
Fossil's trademark violation, Romag sought (among other things) an order requiring
Fossil to hand over the profits it had earned thanks to its trademark violation. But
the district court refused this request. The court pointed out that controlling
Second Circuit precedent requires a plaintiff seeking a profits award to prove that
the defendant's violation was willful. Not all circuits, however, agree with the
Second Circuit's rule. We took this case to resolve that dispute over the law's
demands.

         Where does Fossil's proposed willfulness rule come from? The relevant
section of the Lanham Act governing remedies for trademark violations, § 35, 15
U.S.C. § 1117(a), says this:

        "When a violation of any right of the registrant of a mark registered in the
        Patent and Trademark Office, a violation under section 1125(a) or (d) of this
        title, or a willful violation under section 1125(c) of this title, shall have been
        established ..., the plaintiff shall be entitled, subject to the provisions of
        sections 1111 and 1114 of this title, and subject to the principles of equity,
        to recover (1) defendant's profits, (2) any damages sustained by the plaintiff,
        and (3) the costs of the action."

        Immediately, this language spells trouble for Fossil and the circuit precedent
on which it relies. The statute does make a showing of willfulness a precondition to
a profits award when the plaintiff proceeds under § 1125(c). That section, added to
the Lanham Act some years after its initial adoption, creates a cause of action for
trademark dilution--conduct that lessens the association consumers have with a
trademark. But Romag alleged and proved a violation of § 1125(a), a provision
establishing a cause of action for the false or misleading use of trademarks. And in
cases like that, the statutory language has never required a showing of willfulness to
win a defendant's profits. Yes, the law tells us that a profits award is subject to
limitations found in §§ 1111 and 1114. But no one suggests those cross-referenced
sections contain the rule Fossil seeks. Nor does this Court usually read into statutes
words that aren't there. It's a temptation we are doubly careful to avoid when
Congress has (as here) included the term in question elsewhere in the very same
statutory provision.

        A wider look at the statute's structure gives us even more reason for pause.
The Lanham Act speaks often and expressly about mental states. Section 1117(b)
requires courts to treble profits or damages and award attorney's fees when a

                                                    581
defendant engages in certain acts intentionally and with specified knowledge. Section
1117(c) increases the cap on statutory damages from $200,000 to $2,000,000 for
certain willful violations. Section 1118 permits courts to order the infringing items
be destroyed if a plaintiff proves any violation of § 1125(a) or a willful violation of §
1125(c). Section 1114 makes certain innocent infringers subject only to injunctions.
Elsewhere, the statute specifies certain mens rea standards needed to establish
liability, before even getting to the question of remedies. See, e.g., §§
1125(d)(1)(A)(i), (B)(i) (prohibiting certain conduct only if undertaken with "bad
faith intent" and listing nine factors relevant to ascertaining bad faith intent).
Without doubt, the Lanham Act exhibits considerable care with mens rea standards.
The absence of any such standard in the provision before us, thus, seems all the
more telling.

        So how exactly does Fossil seek to conjure a willfulness requirement out of §
1117(a)? Lacking any more obvious statutory hook, the company points to the
language indicating that a violation under § 1125(a) can trigger an award of the
defendant's profits "subject to the principles of equity." In Fossil's telling, equity
courts historically required a showing of willfulness before authorizing a profits
remedy in trademark disputes. Admittedly, equity courts didn't require so much in
patent infringement cases and other arguably analogous suits. See, e.g., Dowagiac
Mfg. Co. v. Minnesota Moline Plow Co., 235 U.S. 641, 644, 650-651 (1915). But,
Fossil says, trademark is different. There alone, a willfulness requirement was so
long and universally recognized that today it rises to the level of a "principle of
equity" the Lanham Act carries forward.

        It's a curious suggestion. Fossil's contention that the term "principles of
equity" includes a willfulness requirement would not directly contradict the statute's
other, express mens rea provisions or render them wholly superfluous. But it would
require us to assume that Congress intended to incorporate a willfulness
requirement here obliquely while it prescribed mens rea conditions expressly
elsewhere throughout the Lanham Act. That might be possible, but on first blush it
isn't exactly an obvious construction of the statute.

        Nor do matters improve with a second look. The phrase "principles of
equity" doesn't readily bring to mind a substantive rule about mens rea from a
discrete domain like trademark law. In the context of this statute, it more naturally
suggests fundamental rules that apply more systematically across claims and practice
areas. A principle is a "fundamental truth or doctrine, as of law; a comprehensive
rule or doctrine which furnishes a basis or origin for others." Black's Law Dictionary
1417 (3d ed. 1933); Black's Law Dictionary 1357 (4th ed. 1951). And treatises and
handbooks on the "principles of equity" generally contain transsubstantive guidance

                                                    582
on broad and fundamental questions about matters like parties, modes of proof,
defenses, and remedies. See, e.g., E. Merwin, Principles of Equity and Equity
Pleading (1895); J. Indermaur & C. Thwaites, Manual of the Principles of Equity
(7th ed. 1913); H. Smith, Practical Exposition of the Principles of Equity (5th ed.
1914); R. Megarry, Snell's PRINCIPLES OF EQUITY (23d ed. 1947). Our precedent,
too, has used the term "principles of equity" to refer to just such transsubstantive
topics. See, e.g., eBay Inc. v. MercExchange, L. L. C., 547 U.S. 388, 391, 393 (2006);
Holmberg v. Armbrecht, 327 U.S. 392, 395 (1946). Congress itself has elsewhere used
"equitable principles" in just this way: An amendment to a different section of the
Lanham Act lists "laches, estoppel, and acquiescence" as examples of "equitable
principles." 15 U.S.C. § 1069. Given all this, it seems a little unlikely Congress
meant "principles of equity" to direct us to a narrow rule about a profits remedy
within trademark law.

        But even if we were to spot Fossil that first essential premise of its argument,
the next has problems too. From the record the parties have put before us, it's far
from clear whether trademark law historically required a showing of willfulness
before allowing a profits remedy. The Trademark Act of 1905--the Lanham Act's
statutory predecessor which many earlier cases interpreted and applied--did not
mention such a requirement. It's true, as Fossil notes, that some courts proceeding
before the 1905 Act, and even some later cases following that Act, did treat
willfulness or something like it as a prerequisite for a profits award and rarely
authorized profits for purely good-faith infringement. See, e.g., Horlick's Malted Milk
Corp. v. Horluck's, Inc., 51 F.2d 357, 359 (W.D. Wash. 1931) (explaining that the
plaintiff "cannot recover defendant's profits unless it has been shown beyond a
reasonable doubt that defendant was guilty of willful fraud in the use of the
enjoined trade-name"); see also Saxlehner v. Siegel-Cooper Co., 179 U.S. 42, 42-43
(1900) (holding that one defendant "should not be required to account for gains
and profits" when it "appear[ed] to have acted in good faith"). But Romag cites
other cases that expressly rejected any such rule. See, e.g., Oakes v. Tonsmierre, 49 F.
447, 453 (C.C.S.D. Ala. 1883); see also Stonebraker v. Stonebraker, 33 Md. 252, 268
(1870); Lawrence-Williams Co. v. Societe Enfants Gombault et Cie, 52 F.2d 774, 778
(C.A.6 1931).

        The confusion doesn't end there. Other authorities advanced still different
understandings about the relationship between mens rea and profits awards in
trademark cases. See, e.g., H. Nims, Law of Unfair Competition and Trade-Marks §
424 (2d ed. 1917) ("An accounting will not be ordered where the infringing party
acted innocently and in ignorance of the plaintiff's rights"); N. Hesseltine, Digest of
the Law of Trade-Marks and Unfair Trade 305 (1906) (contrasting a case holding

                                                    583
"[n]o account as to profits allowed except as to user after knowledge of plaintiff's right
to trademark" and one permitting profits "although defendant did not know of
infringement" (emphasis added)). And the vast majority of the cases both Romag
and Fossil cite simply failed to speak clearly to the issue one way or another. See,
e.g., Hostetter v. Vowinkle, 12 F.Cas. 546, 547 (No. 6,714) (C.C.D. Neb. 1871);
Graham v. Plate, 40 Cal. 593, 597-599 (1871); Hemmeter Cigar Co. v. Congress Cigar
Co., 118 F.2d 64, 71-72 (C.A.6 1941).

        At the end of it all, the most we can say with certainty is this. Mens rea
figured as an important consideration in awarding profits in pre-Lanham Act cases.
This reflects the ordinary, transsubstantive principle that a defendant's mental state
is relevant to assigning an appropriate remedy. That principle arises not only in
equity, but across many legal contexts. See, e.g., Smith v. Wade, 461 U.S. 30, 38-51
(1983) (42 U.S.C. § 1983); Morissette v. United States, 342 U.S. 246, 250-263 (1952)
(criminal law); Wooden-Ware Co. v. United States, 106 U.S. 432, 434-435 (1882)
(common law trespass). It's a principle reflected in the Lanham Act's text, too,
which permits greater statutory damages for certain willful violations than for other
violations. 15 U.S.C. § 1117(c). And it is a principle long reflected in equity practice
where district courts have often considered a defendant's mental state, among other
factors, when exercising their discretion in choosing a fitting remedy. See, e.g., L. P.
Larson, Jr., Co. v. Wm. Wrigley, Jr., Co., 277 U.S. 97, 99-100 (1928); Lander v. Lujan,
888 F.2d 153, 155-156 (C.A.D.C. 1989); United States v. Klimek, 952 F.Supp. 1100,
1117 (E.D. Pa. 1997). Given these traditional principles, we do not doubt that a
trademark defendant's mental state is a highly important consideration in
determining whether an award of profits is appropriate. But acknowledging that
much is a far cry from insisting on the inflexible precondition to recovery Fossil
advances.

        With little to work with in the statute's language, structure, and history,
Fossil ultimately rests on an appeal to policy. The company tells us that stouter
restraints on profits awards are needed to deter "baseless" trademark suits.
Meanwhile, Romag insists that its reading of the statute will promote greater respect
for trademarks in the "modern global economy." As these things go, amici amplify
both sides' policy arguments. Maybe, too, each side has a point. But the place for
reconciling competing and incommensurable policy goals like these is before
policymakers. This Court's limited role is to read and apply the law those
policymakers have ordained, and here our task is clear. The judgment of the court
of appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent
with this opinion.

        It is so ordered.

                                                    584
                                     Notes and Questions

        Other views. Justice Alito, joined by Justices Breyer and Kagan, concurred,
noting that although pre-Lanham Act case law "show[s] that willfulness is a highly
important consideration in awarding profits," it is "not an absolute precondition."
Justice Sotomayor concurred in the judgment, expressing concern that the majority
opinion might open the door to punishing innocent infringement. She argued that
"the weight of authority . . . indicates that profits were hardly, if ever, awarded for
innocent infringement." This reluctance comports with "longstanding equitable
principles which, after all, seek to deprive only wrongdoers of their gains from
misconduct." As a result, "a district court's award of profits for innocent or good-
faith trademark infringement would not be consonant with the "principles of
equity" referenced in § 1117(a) and reflected in the cases the majority cites."

        Lazy textualism. Romag's statutory interpretation raises some potentially
troubling issues. Note the opinion's confidence that the fact that the statute
requires willfulness for dilution monetary remedies implies that willfulness is not
required for recovering profits in an infringement action. The opinion treats the
Lanham Act as an integrated whole that Congress enacted all at once (e.g.,
"Without doubt, the Lanham Act exhibits considerable care with mens rea
standards."). Were this true, then it might make sense to assume that references to
mens rea in some provisions impliedly excludes such consideration in others. But of
course that's not how today's Lanham Act came to be; it has been amended
multiple times. This demands attentiveness on the part of judges in interpreting
how provisions enacted decades apart may interact. See, e.g., Rescuecom Corp. v.
Google Inc., 562 F.3d 123, 131-141 (2d Cir. 2009) (tracing varying use of the term
"use in commerce" in the Lanham Act over the decades).

        That attentiveness is lacking here. 15 U.S.C. § 1117's reference to principles
of equity was part of the original Lanham Act of 1946. The dilution damages
language was only added in 1999. Does that tell us anything about Congress's view
of background principles in place fifty years before? Put another way, suppose the
Court had been persuaded that principles of equity did indeed require willfulness
for a profits remedy when the Lanham Act was initially enacted. Would it be proper
to read the 1999 enactment as implicitly repealing that understanding? Would that
possibility have been on Congress's mind? The legislative history indicates that
Congress's purpose was focused on the availability of dilution remedies generally, as
the initial federal dilution statute neglected to include remedies for dilution in §

                                                    585
1117 despite referring to them elsewhere. "Therefore, in an attempt to clarify
Congress' intent and to avoid any confusion by courts trying to interpret the statute,
[the amendment] makes the appropriate changes . . . to allow for injunctive relief
and damages." H.R. Rep. 106-250, 6 (July 22, 1999); id. (the provision seeks "to
clarify that in passing the Dilution Act, Congress did intend to allow for injunctive
relief and/or damages against a defendant found to have wilfully intended to engage
in commercial activity that would cause dilution of a famous trademark."; id. at 10
(the provision "clarif[ies] that recovery of profits, damages and costs, and attorneys
fees are also available for a willful violation" of the dilution statute (emphasis
added)).

        Should Congress have been aware of the possibility that a provision about
dilution remedies might lead a court to reinterpret the law on infringement remedies?
Is it plausible to expect members of Congress to think about such matters (after all,
wouldn't omitting the willfulness language open the door to another kind of
misinterpretation)? Does this mode of interpretation create any risks?

        To be sure, of course, the Court disagreed that the background principles in
favor of a willfulness requirement were in fact clear. Fair enough. But that is a
question independent of unrelated legislative activity in the 1990s.

        Trademark policy. Is it a good idea to allow the possibility of profits for
innocent infringement? What does the opinion do to the incentives of potential
plaintiffs? Defendants? Recall the Court's admonition in Wal-Mart that
"[c]ompetition is deterred, however, not merely by successful suit but by the
plausible threat of successful suit." Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Samara Bros., 529 U.S.
205, 214 (2000). Is it fair to say that Romag raises the uncertainty costs for
trademark defendants?

        What is bad faith? Bad faith is a slippery concept, capable of a variety of
formulations. Professor McCarthy boils it down to the observation that "[t]o put it
bluntly, courts are not willing to grant an accounting of profits unless the judge
"gets mad" at the defendant. Ringing epithets . . . are often used as justification for
the granting of an accounting of profits." 5 MCCARTHY § 30:62

        The defendant's burden. If a court determines that profits are appropriate, the
statute places the burden on the defendant to prove any offsets. The plaintiff need
only prove the defendant's sales.

                                                    586
        Profits and jury trials. Should a request for profits require a trial by jury? You
may recall from other courses that the right to a jury trial for a civil federal matter
exists only for legal, but not equitable, remedies.3 That said, some courts say that the
remedy is effectively a damages remedy, requiring a jury trial absent waiver of the
right. Compare, e.g., Daisy Group, Ltd. v. Newport News, Inc., 999 F. Supp. 548, 551
(S.D.N.Y. 1998) ("[A] claim for profits under the Lanham Act gives rise to a right to
trial by jury."), with G.A. Modefine S.A. v. Burlington Coat Factory Warehouse
Corp., 888 F. Supp. 44, 45 (S.D.N.Y. 1995) ("As to Plaintiffs' claim for an
accounting and disgorgement of profits, the law in the Second Circuit is clear that
this is an equitable remedy.").

        Going after affiliates. In Dewberry Group, Inc. v. Dewberry Engineers Inc., 145 S.
Ct. 681 (2025), the Supreme Court considered an effort to claim that 15 U.S.C. §
1117 permits a prevailing plaintiff to seek profits from the defendant's affiliates.
Because the named defendant reported no profits, the district court concluded that
treating its affiliates (who were not named defendants) as independent would allow
the defendant to "evade the financial consequences of its willful, bad faith

          3 The Seventh Amendment provides: "In Suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall
exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no fact tried by a jury, shall be
otherwise re-examined in any Court of the United States, than according to the rules of the common law." At
an early stage, the Supreme Court explained that "common law" had a broader meaning than just suits based
on judge-made law. The term means:

          not merely suits, which the common law recognized among its old and settled proceedings, but suits
          in which legal rights were to be ascertained and determined, in contradistinction to those where
          equitable rights alone were recognized, and equitable remedies were administered. . . . In a jury
          sense, the amendment then may well be construed to embrace all suits, which are not of equity and
          admiralty jurisdiction, whatever may be the peculiar form which they may assume to settle legal
          rights.

Parsons v. Bedford, Breedlove & Robeson, 3 Pet. 433, 447, 7 L.Ed. 732 (1830). "The Seventh Amendment
thus applies not only to common-law causes of action but also to statutory causes of action analogous to
common-law causes of action ordinarily decided in English law courts in the late 18th century, as opposed to
those customarily heard by courts of equity or admiralty." City of Monterey v. Del Monte Dunes at Monterey,
Ltd., 526 U.S. 687, 708-09 (1999) (internal quotation and citation omitted)).

                                                    587
infringement." Id. at 686. Better, in the court's view, to group the companies
together to account for the "economic reality" of the situation.

        The Fourth Circuit agreed; the Supreme Court did not. The Court
explained that the Lanham Act does not authorize remedies against anyone but the
actual defendant, and background principles of corporate law do not offer a basis
for treating multiple affiliated companies as a single entity. "[I]n fact the usual rule is
the opposite." Id. at 686. To be sure, in such situations there may be a basis for
claiming that a court should pierce the corporate veil, but the plaintiff did not
attempt to argue for veil piercing before the lower courts. Id. at 687.

        Special remedies for counterfeiting. Section 35(b) provides:

        In assessing damages under subsection (a) for any violation of section
        32(1)(a) of this Act or section 220506 of title 36, United States Code,
        [Olympic Symbols Act] in a case involving use of a counterfeit mark or
        designation (as defined in section 34(d) of this Act), the court shall, unless
        the court finds extenuating circumstances, enter judgment for three times
        such profits or damages, whichever amount is greater, together with a
        reasonable attorney's fee, if the violation consists of--

                (1) intentionally using a mark or designation, knowing such mark or
                designation is a counterfeit mark (as defined in section 34(d) of this
                Act), in connection with the sale, offering for sale, or distribution of
                goods or services; or

                (2) providing goods or services necessary to the commission of a
                violation specified in paragraph (1), with the intent that the recipient
                of the goods or services would put the goods or services to use in
                committing the violation.

        Counterfeiting activities may also prompt criminal charges under 18 U.S.C.
§ 2320.

        Attorney fees. Section 35 authorizes them for "exceptional cases." Judge
Posner has described the various standards for determining what is "exceptional" as
a "jumble." Nightingale Home Healthcare, Inc. v. Anodyne Therapy, LLC, 626 F.3d
958, 961 (7th Cir. 2010). For the Seventh Circuit, the court concluded "that a case
under the Lanham Act is `exceptional,' in the sense of warranting an award of
reasonable attorneys' fees to the winning party, if the losing party was the plaintiff
and was guilty of abuse of process in suing, or if the losing party was the defendant

                                                    588
and had no defense yet persisted in the trademark infringement or false advertising
for which he was being sued, in order to impose costs on his opponent." Id. at 963-
64.

        The Supreme Court has since issued a ruling in the patent context that
promises to bring order to the jumble identified by Judge Posner. The Patent and
Lanham Acts contain identical fee shifting language, so the Court's interpretation
of the patent provision is easily applied to the Lanham Act. As explained by the
Fourth Circuit:

        [W]e adopted the Supreme Court's interpretation of an "exceptional case" in
        an identical provision of the Patent Act in Octane Fitness, LLC v. ICON
        Health & Fitness, Inc., --- U.S. ----, 134 S.Ct. 1749 (2014). Relying on
        Octane Fitness, we concluded that

                a district court may find a case `exceptional' and therefore award
                attorneys fees to the prevailing party under § 1117(a) when it
                determines, in light of the totality of the circumstances, that (1) there
                is an unusual discrepancy in the merits of the positions taken by the
                parties, based on the non-prevailing party's position as either frivolous
                or objectively unreasonable; (2) the non-prevailing party has litigated
                the case in an unreasonable manner; or (3) there is otherwise the need
                in particular circumstances to advance considerations of
                compensation and deterrence.

Verisign, Inc. v. XYZ.COM LLC, 891 F.3d 481, 483-84 (4th Cir. 2018) (citation
omitted); see also Tobinick v. Novella, 884 F.3d 1110 (11th Cir. 2018); 5
MCCARTHY § 30:99 (collecting cases). In Verisign, the Fourth Circuit explained,
again following the Octane Fitness approach, that fee determinations should be made
under a preponderance of the evidence standard. 891 F.3d at 485.

Injunctions

        Injunctions are, of course, a standard (equitable) remedy against future
infringing activity. Conceptually, it is hard to understand how to avoid an
injunction as a remedy. To rely solely on damages would effectively serve as a
compulsory license. This is forbidden by international agreements. Agreement on
Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) art. 21. More directly,
it would frustrate the ability of the plaintiff's mark to identify and distinguish the
source of a product or service. That said, courts have discretion to tailor injunctive

                                                    589
remedies to balance the equities between the parties and require defendants to take
steps to avoid or ameliorate consumer confusion.

        Preliminary relief. Issues sometimes arise when a preliminary injunction is at
stake. Should courts enjoin the defendant prior to a finding of infringement? The
question boils down to whether the alleged infringement will cause irreparable
harm that a future award of damages cannot fully remedy.4

        Courts have traditionally been inclined to find that infringement causes
irreparable harm, justifying both preliminary and prospective injunctive relief. In
2006, however, the Supreme Court issued the landmark patent case, eBay Inc. v.
MercExchange, L.L.C., 547 U.S. 388 (2006), which threatened to disrupt this
understanding. In eBay, the Supreme Court took issue with the Federal Circuit's
"general rule that courts will issue permanent injunctions against patent
infringement absent exceptional circumstances." 401 F.3d 1323, 1339 (2005). Like
trademark remedies, the patent statute directs that injunctions be given "in
accordance with the principles of equity." 35 U.S.C. § 283. The Supreme Court
determined that the Federal Circuit's presumption in favor of injunctions ignored
traditional principles of equity (the backdrop against which Congress legislated and
which the patent statute implicitly incorporated).

        According to well-established principles of equity, a plaintiff seeking a
        permanent injunction must satisfy a four-factor test before a court may grant
        such relief. A plaintiff must demonstrate: (1) that it has suffered an
        irreparable injury; (2) that remedies available at law, such as monetary
        damages, are inadequate to compensate for that injury; (3) that, considering
        the balance of hardships between the plaintiff and defendant, a remedy in

          4 The Seventh Circuit has summarized its preliminary injunction standard as follows.

          To obtain a preliminary injunction, [the plaintiff must show that he or she] is likely to succeed on
          the merits, that [plaintiff] is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, that
          the "balance of equities" tips in [plaintiff's] favor (i.e., denying an injunction poses a greater risk to
          [plaintiff] than granting an injunction poses to the [defendant]), and that issuing an injunction is in
          the public interest.

Smith v. Executive Director of Indiana War Memorials Com'n, 742 F.3d 282 (7th Cir. 2014). In some cases,
particularly where counterfeiting operations are ongoing, a temporary restraining order may be appropriate.
See 5 MCCARTHY § 30:34.

                                                    590
        equity is warranted; and (4) that the public interest would not be disserved by
        a permanent injunction. The decision to grant or deny permanent injunctive
        relief is an act of equitable discretion by the district court, reviewable on
        appeal for abuse of discretion.

        These familiar principles apply with equal force to disputes arising under the
        Patent Act. As this Court has long recognized, "a major departure from the
        long tradition of equity practice should not be lightly implied." Nothing in
        the Patent Act indicates that Congress intended such a departure. To the
        contrary, the Patent Act expressly provides that injunctions "may" issue "in
        accordance with the principles of equity." 35 U.S.C. § 283.

eBay, 547 U.S. at 391-92 (citations omitted). The Court held "the decision whether
to grant or deny injunctive relief rests within the equitable discretion of the district
courts, and that such discretion must be exercised consistent with traditional
principles of equity, in patent disputes no less than in other cases governed by such
standards." Id. at 394.

        Courts had applied eBay to trademark law. See, e.g., North American Medical
Corp. v. Axiom Worldwide, Inc., 522 F.3d 1211, 1228 (11th Cir. 2008). One could
still argue, however, that threats to goodwill or loss of a mark's distinctiveness are
hard to address via future monetary remedies alone. As one district judge explained:

        Regardless of whether the presumption [of irreparable harm] still applies, in
        this case it is clear that [plaintiff] will suffer irreparable harm if [defendant] is
        not enjoined from using its trademarks. While "economic injury alone does
        not support a finding of irreparable harm, because such injury can be
        remedied by a damage award," Rent-A-Center, Inc. v. Canyon Television &
        Appliance Rental, Inc., 944 F.2d 597, 603 (9th Cir.1991), the Ninth Circuit
        has recognized that damage to goodwill is an irreparable harm. Id. Business
        goodwill includes a company's reputation. See WMX Techs. v. Miller, 80
        F.3d 1315, 1325 (9th Cir.1996).

Century 21 Real Estate LLC v. All Professional Realty, Inc., 2011 WL 221651 at
*12 (E.D. Cal. 2011).

        In 2020, Congress enacted a statute to undo the effect of eBay on trademark
law. The Trademark Modernization Act of 2020 amended 15 U.S.C. § 1116(a) to
provide that:

        A plaintiff seeking any such injunction shall be entitled to a rebuttable
        presumption of irreparable harm upon a finding of a violation identified in

                                                    591
        this subsection in the case of a motion for a permanent injunction or upon a
        finding of likelihood of success on the merits for a violation identified in this
        subsection in the case of a motion for a preliminary injunction or temporary
        restraining order.

        Keep your distance. When an injunction is awarded as relief, the losing
defendant may be required to keep a "safe distance" away from the plaintiff's mark.
This may mean preventing the defendant from using a mark "whose use by non-
infringers would not necessarily be actionable." Taubman Co. v. Webfeats, 319 F.3d
770, 779 (6th Cir. 2003).

        Destruction orders. Section 36 of the Lanham Act (15 U.S.C. § 1118) gives the
court the ability to

        order that all labels, signs, prints, packages, wrappers, receptacles, and
        advertisements in the possession of the defendant, bearing the registered
        mark or, in the case of a violation of section 1125(a) of this title or a willful
        violation under section 1125(c) of this title, the word, term, name, symbol,
        device, combination thereof, designation, description, or representation that
        is the subject of the violation, or any reproduction, counterfeit, copy, or
        colorable imitation thereof, and all plates, molds, matrices, and other means
        of making the same, shall be delivered up and destroyed.

        Ex parte seizure orders. Section 34(d) (15 U.S.C. § 1116(d)) provides that a
court "may, upon ex parte application, grant an order . . . providing for the seizure
of goods and counterfeit marks involved in such violation and the means of making
such marks, and records documenting the manufacture, sale, or receipt of things
involved in such violation." See also In re Lorillard Tobacco Co., 370 F.3d 982, 989
(9th Cir. 2004) (noting that the remedy is an extraordinary one that must be carried
out in accordance with the exact provisions of section 34(d)).

Other procedural and litigation matters

        Statutes of limitations and laches. When must a trademark suit be brought? The
issue can be complicated. The Lanham Act has no statute of limitations, but the
federal statute providing a catchall statute of limitations is limited to actions
commencing after the date of enactment (December 1, 1990). 28 U.S.C. § 1658
("Except as otherwise provided by law, a civil action arising under an Act of
Congress enacted after the date of enactment of this section may not be

                                                    592
commenced later than 4 years after the cause of action accrues."). The last major
amendments to the infringement cause of action came in the late 1980s.5 The
McCarthy treatise therefore concludes that § 1658 "probably" does not apply to
section 43(a) claims. 5 MCCARTHY § 27:48 (citing Jones v. R.R. Donnelley & Sons
Co., 541 U.S. 369 (2004) ("We conclude that a cause of action `aris[es] under an
Act of Congress enacted' after December 1, 1990--and therefore is governed by §
1658's 4-year statute of limitations--if the plaintiff's claim against the defendant was
made possible by a post-1990 enactment."); see also id. §§ 31:23, 31:33.

        Where there is no applicable federal limitations period, the normal course is
for the federal court to "borrow" the limitations period from the most analogous
state cause of action. 5 MCCARTHY § 27:48. This is often done under the rubric of
the doctrine of laches, for there is a clear statutory hook to apply equitable
principles to Lanham Act remedies. See 15 U.S.C. §§ 1116, 1117 (providing for
both injunctive and monetary remedies subject to the "principles of equity"). To
determine a reasonable period for acting, courts may look to analogous state law
causes of action that have actual limitations periods. See, e.g., Au-Tomotive Gold
Inc. v. Volkswagen of America, Inc., 603 F.3d 1133, 1139-40 (9th Cir. 2010) ("If a
Lanham Act claim `is filed within the analogous state limitations period, the strong
presumption is that laches is inapplicable; if the claim is filed after the analogous
limitations period has expired, the presumption is that laches is a bar to suit.'
Because the Lanham Act does not have its own statute of limitations, we borrow the
most analogous statute of limitations from state law in order to determine whether
the plaintiff's delay in filing suit was reasonable." (quoting Jarrow Formulas, Inc. v.
Nutrition Now, Inc., 304 F.3d 829, 835-36 (9th Cir. 2002)). Battles over which is the
analogous state law cause of action naturally follow. Id. at 1140 (applying state
statute of limitations for fraud).

        Even though laches is an equitable doctrine, courts apply it in the trademark
context to limit damages (i.e., legal remedies) as well as injunctions. See, e.g., Kars 4
Kids Inc. v. Am. Can!, 98 F.4th 436, 451 (3d Cir. 2024) ("Because the Lanham Act
has no statute of limitations and applies the principles of equity to all claims, laches
may bar both equitable and legal relief.").

        Challenging trademark validity. How does one obtain a judicial declaration that
a mark is valid or invalid? One obvious way is in the course of defending a

          5 Note, however, that the dilution provisions of section 43(a) were first enacted in 1996 (and

received major amendments in 2006). ACPA is similarly a post-1990 cause of action.

                                                    593
trademark suit. Trademark defendants often challenge the validity of the plaintiff's
mark as a defense to infringement. The Lanham Act also authorizes courts to order
the cancellation of a registered mark. 15 U.S.C. § 1119. Rather than wait to be
sued, potential trademark defendants sometimes bring declaratory judgment actions
of trademark invalidity, though these suits may face standing hurdles, as noted in
the next note.

        Ripeness and mootness. A general problem of trademark owners is that they
may overassert rights not only in litigation, but in the use of cease-and-desist letters.
These letters may overclaim, but they still have an in terrorem effect. Suppose,
however, that the recipient wishes not only to continue the challenged use but to go
on the offensive. The junior user may bring a declaratory judgment action, seeking
to adjudicate the legality of its use, but users of the declaratory judgment statute
generally must show the existence of a genuine dispute. As the First Circuit
explained:

        The more difficult question is whether [plaintiff] could reasonably have
        anticipated a claim against it under section 43(a) of the Lanham Act and
        therefore brought a declaratory judgment to forestall it. . . . [S]uch reasonable
        anticipation is a settled requirement in a federal declaratory judgment action
        of this character. A federal court will not start up the machinery of
        adjudication to repel an entirely speculative threat. . . . [T]he conduct of
        [plaintiff], as described by the [defendant's] letters, could easily amount to a
        violation of section 43(a); the second letter alleged that [plaintiff's] alleged
        use was "misleading, confusing, and will result in irreparable harm"--
        language typical of a claim under section 43(a). The first letter threatened to
        seek recovery of damages, as well as an injunction. Damages are a standard
        remedy under section 43(a). In all events, the question under the case law on
        declaratory judgments is not whether the Pioneer companies made a specific
        threat to bring a section 43(a) claim or even had such a claim in mind. The
        federal declaratory judgment statute aims at resolving potential disputes,
        often commercial in character, that can reasonably be feared by a potential
        target in light of the other side's conduct. No competent lawyer advising
        PHC could fail to tell it that, based on the threatening letters and the
        surrounding circumstances, a section 43(a) suit was a likely outcome.

PHC, Inc. v. Pioneer Healthcare, Inc., 75 F.3d 75, 79 (1st Cir. 1996) (citations and
paragraph breaks omitted).

                                                    594
        What if the declaratory judgment defendant disclaims (in a sufficiently
binding way) any intent to sue over the conduct at issue. Will this allow it to moot
the litigation? The Supreme Court said yes in Nike, Inc. v. Already, LLC, 568 U.S. 85
(2013). There, Nike brought an infringement action against Already and drew a
counterclaim of invalidity. Nike then issued a covenant not to sue and moved to
dismiss the case (and the counterclaim) as moot. The Court held that it could do so.
Note that Nike's tactics allow it to evade a potential challenge to its mark while
allowing it to continue to assert it against other potential defendants who might not
be similarly inclined to fight back. On the other hand, the covenant not to sue
granted Already may weaken its mark if Already's use would have been infringing in
some way.

        How about if a potential defendant secures a judgment of non-infringement,
but still wishes to pursue invalidation of the mark? See San Diego Cnty. Credit
Union v. Citizens Equity First Credit Union, 65 F.4th 1012, 1018 (9th Cir. 2023)
("After a party obtains declaratory relief which decrees that it is not infringing a
trademark, does it retain Article III standing to invalidate that mark? That is the
central question presented in these appeals, and, under the circumstances presented
here, we answer it: No.").

        Preclusion and the PTO. Recall from our discussion of trademark registration
that the Trademark Office may pass on any number of issues that might be relevant
to future litigation. It may, for example, declare a mark functional or likely to cause
confusion with a previously used or registered mark. Should such a decision have
preclusive effect in future litigation raising the same issues? When the ruling comes
from the TTAB, the issue is a difficult one. Even if a court were inclined to defer to
an administrative finding, there is the issue of determining whether the factual
questions are consistent (and whether the earlier decision was ex parte or part of an
adjudication involving both litigating parties). For example, when the TTAB
determines whether a mark is likely to cause confusion, it may lack evidence of
market context if the mark has yet to be used in commerce (as would be the case for
an intent-to-use-based application).

        The issue came before the Supreme Court in a 2015 case. In B & B
Hardware, Inc. v. Hargis Industries, Inc., 716 F.3d 1020 (8th Cir. 2013), the Eighth
Circuit concluded, over a dissent, that a TTAB determination that confusion was
likely would not receive preclusive effect. The court noted that the factors used by
the TTAB differed from those of the Eighth Circuit, and that while they were
similar, the administrative body did not place the same emphasis on marketplace
context as would have the court. Id. at 1025 ("[T]he TTAB placed greater emphasis

                                                    595
on the appearance and sound when spoken of the two marks and ultimately
determined that there was a likelihood of confusion. While this approach may be
appropriate when determining issues of registration, it ignores a critical
determination of trademark infringement, that being the marketplace usage of the
marks and products."); compare id. at 1029 (Colloton, J., dissenting) ("That this
court might disagree with the balance struck by the Trademark Board in a particular
case is not reason to deny its decision preclusive effect.").

        The Supreme Court reversed, holding that agency decisions may be the basis
of issue preclusion and that the likelihood of confusion standards in a registration
and infringement setting were sufficiently alike for preclusion purposes. "It is
incredible to think that a district court's adjudication of particular usages would not
have preclusive effect in another district court. Why would unchallenged TTAB
decisions be different?" B & B Hardware, Inc. v. Hargis Indus., Inc., 575 U.S. 138,
160 (2015). Justice Ginsburg concurred, but noted that preclusion will often be
inappropriate because the TTAB, unlike the courts, often only considers marks in
the abstract and without evidence of marketplace use. Id. at 160-61 (Ginsburg, J.,
concurring).

        Insurance. A frequent form of trademark litigation is derivative of
infringement issues--insurance. Liability policies have language that may, or may
not, cover trademark infringement claims, creating litigation over policy scope. See,
e.g., CGS Industries, Inc. v. Charter Oak Fire Ins. Co., 720 F.3d 71 (2d Cir. 2013).

        Extraterritorial application of the Lanham Act. When will the Lanham Act apply
to conduct outside the United States? Until recently, the issue was guided by the
Supreme Court's opinion in Steele v. Bulova Watch, 344 U.S. 280 (1952), which was
the basis of a variety of tests among the circuit courts that considered the effects of
the defendant's conduct within the United States.

        All that changed with Abitron Austria GmbH v. Hetronic Int'l, Inc., 600 U.S.
412 (2023). Applying post-Bulova precedents on extraterritoriality, the Court ruled
that the text of Lanham Act does not overcome the presumption against
extraterritorial application of United States statutes. Id. at 420-21. So when is a
Lanham Act claim a "domestic" application? "[T]he proper test requires determining
the provision's focus and then ascertaining whether [the plaintiff] can establish that
the conduct relevant to that focus occurred in the United States." Id. at 421
(cleaned up). Five Justices agreed that that "the conduct relevant to any focus the
parties have proffered is infringing use in commerce, as the Act defines it." Id. at 422
(emphasis added). This rejects the alternative approach, favored by four of the

                                                    596
Justices, of treating "consumer confusion" as the focus of the statute. Id. at 433
(Sotomayor, J., concurring in the judgment).

      Church & Dwight Co., Inc. v. SPD Swiss Precision Diagnostics, GmBH
                                  843 F.3d 48 (2d Cir. 2016)

LEVAL, Circuit Judge:
        In an exceptionally well argued case, Defendant SPD Swiss Precision

Diagnostics GmbH, a marketer of over-the-counter pregnancy test kits, appeals from
the judgment of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New
York (Nathan, J.), in favor of Plaintiff Church & Dwight Co. Inc., a leading
competing marketer of over-the-counter pregnancy test kits. After a bench trial, the
district court found Defendant liable for false advertising, in violation of Section
43(a) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a). The pregnancy tests of both Plaintiff
and Defendant detect pregnancy by the presence in the woman's urine of the
hormone human chorionic gonadotropin ("hCG"), which is produced upon the
implantation of a fertilized egg in a woman's uterus. In August 2013, following a
Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") approval process, Defendant released its
new product, the Clearblue Advanced Pregnancy Test with Weeks Estimator (the
"Product"). Defendant's Product, in addition to telling the woman whether she is
pregnant, is the first such product to also furnish information as to how long (how
many weeks) she has been pregnant, which it does by measuring the amount of hCG
in her urine.

                                                    598
        Plaintiff's claims focus on how Defendant's Product packaging characterized
the advancement of pregnancy. The information communicated by Defendant's
Product was the number of weeks passed since the woman's ovulation. (An egg is ripe
and capable of fertilization only for twenty-four hours following ovulation.
Implantation of the fertilized egg in the uterine lining, which causes the release of
hCG, occurs between six and nine days after ovulation.)

        For a number of reasons--partially historical, partially because of the
desirability of conformity--the metric commonly used by the medical profession to
describe how long a woman has been pregnant (notwithstanding its obvious literal
inaccuracy) speaks in terms of the number of weeks elapsed not since ovulation,
fertilization, or implantation of the egg, but since the woman's last menstrual period
(the "LMP"). A pregnant woman's LMP normally occurs approximately two weeks
prior to her ovulation. Thus, the medical profession's conventional formula to
describe how many weeks a woman has been pregnant yields a number two weeks
higher than the number furnished by the Product, which measures weeks since
ovulation. It is an uncontested given in this litigation that, when the Defendant's
Product and the woman's doctor are in complete agreement in estimating how long
the woman has been pregnant, the Product would announce a number of weeks
that is about two weeks lower than what the doctor would say.3

        The gist of Plaintiff's claim is that, in informing the user as to how long her
pregnancy had been in effect, Defendant's Product communicated the false
impression that it uses the same metric and gives the same number of weeks of
pregnancy as a medical professional would do. . . .

        Plaintiff and Defendant are leading manufacturers of home, over-the-counter
pregnancy tests and direct competitors in the U.S. market. Plaintiff uses the brand
name "First Response," while Defendant uses the "Clearblue" brand. Plaintiff's First
Response products have generally led the home pregnancy test market, and
Defendant's Clearblue products have been Plaintiff's closest competitor. . . .

        The issues raised in this case involve the biology of the reproductive cycle
and, relatedly, the medical conventions used by doctors to measure and describe the
duration of pregnancy. The district court described these issues with a clarity on
which we cannot improve. We set forth the district court's explanation here:

        The Reproductive Cycle

          3 For example, if a doctor would tell a woman she is three weeks pregnant, then the Product would

indicate that the same woman is one week pregnant.

                                                    599
. . . . The typical menstrual cycle lasts 28 days and is marked by two key
events: the menstrual period and ovulation. The latter is the release of a ripe
egg (or ovum) from the ovary. The time from [LMP] to ovulation, known as
the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle, is generally two weeks, but
variance in the length of the follicular phase can be "significant." The time
from ovulation to the next menstrual period, known as the luteal phase of
the menstrual cycle, is two weeks and is subject to much less variance than
the follicular phase.

For a successful pregnancy to proceed, the following steps must take place.
First, either through sexual intercourse or assisted reproductive technology,
sperm must fertilize an egg within 24 hours of ovulation because a ripe egg
can survive outside the ovary for only about 12 to 24 hours. In the case of
sexual intercourse, fertilization may occur several days after intercourse, but
it will not occur more than one day after ovulation. Second, the fertilized
egg, now referred to as a blastocyst, must travel down the fallopian tube to
the uterus. Third, the blastocyst must adhere to the endometrium (part of
the lining of the uterus), a process called implantation, which occurs
approximately six to nine days after ovulation. Once implantation occurs, the
blastocyst begins secreting [hCG], a hormone that, among other things,
signals to a woman's body that she is pregnant and prevents menses.

Home pregnancy tests, including [Defendant's] Clearblue brand and
[Plaintiff's] First Response brand, determine whether a woman is pregnant by
detecting the presence (or absence) of hCG--the hormone released following
implantation--in urine.

The Multiple Methods Used to Determine Pregnancy Duration

Prior to advances in modern medicine, doctors had only one way to
determine a woman's estimated date of delivery: the date of her LMP, which
occurs, on average, 40 weeks prior to delivery. Before the development of
more advanced medical technology, such as ultrasound, a woman's LMP
provided the most readily available and reliable estimate of pregnancy
duration, which is also known as gestational age. One of the disadvantages of
using LMP for determining pregnancy duration is that it assumes a standard
28-day menstrual cycle and that ovulation occurs on day 14; [however], the
follicular phase of the menstrual cycle is prone to vary. In addition, women
often have a poor recollection of their LMP. These two shortcomings mean

                                           600
that an estimate based on LMP may provide an inaccurate prediction of the
date of delivery.

Ultrasound technology provides doctors with a more sophisticated way to
determine pregnancy duration, and it is now "standard practice to take an
ultrasound scan of the developing fetus about 8 to 12 weeks after the
reported LMP." An ultrasound scan is used to measure a fetus's crown-rump
length, which, using a formula, can be converted into an estimate of
"embryonic age" (the number of weeks that have passed since fertilization).
Because fertilization occurs, on average, two weeks after a woman's LMP, a
woman's estimated date of delivery is generally 38 weeks after fertilization.
Although ultrasound results are more accurate, "the date of the LMP...
remains the most commonly used method for estimating gestational age and
assigning a due date."

. . . .

The Standard Convention for Expressing Pregnancy Duration

Although there are multiple ways to determine a woman's estimated date of
delivery, and thus the duration of her pregnancy, there is a separate issue of
how to express it--i.e., what words to use to describe "how far along" the
pregnancy is. And on this point, which is the point that truly matters for
resolution of this case, there is little genuine dispute. Doctors and others use
a standard convention to express pregnancy duration. It is stated in terms of
the number of weeks since a woman's LMP. As [Defendant]'s medical expert,
Dr. Kurt Barnhart, testified: "While doctors have long known that women
are not, and cannot be, pregnant at their LMP because ovulation does not
occur, on average, for another two weeks, LMP has continued to be a
reference point because, until relatively recently, it was either impossible or
impractical to estimate when ovulation occurred." He further noted that
"even after the advent of ultrasound scanning technology, the methods for
estimating when ovulation (and hence fertilization) occurred were generally
intrusive, expensive, and/or impractical, and obviously could not be self-
administered by a woman at home prior to becoming pregnant." Thus, for
both historical and practical reasons, dating a woman's pregnancy from her LMP
has been and remains a widely used method for determining pregnancy duration. But
more importantly, it has continued to be the standard--indeed, universal--convention
for expressing pregnancy duration.

                                           601
        In fact, even when pregnancy duration is determined using other methods,
        such as ultrasound scans, most medical professionals still convert to the LMP
        convention when communicating pregnancy duration to patients and other
        medical providers. Ultrasound machines are even programmed to
        automatically convert an estimate of embryonic age based on crown-rump
        length into an estimate of pregnancy duration based on weeks since LMP....

        "[D]octors typically will date the pregnancy according to the ultrasound
        results, but they will (by convention) express the duration of pregnancy in
        terms of the time since LMP would have been expected to occur in a normal
        menstrual cycle." ... In short, while doctors may have multiple ways to arrive
        at the convention--e.g., LMP, ultrasound, date of embryo transfer--they use a
        standard and uniform convention for expressing pregnancy duration: weeks
        since LMP.

        III. Defendant's Product
                                   a. The Weeks Estimator

        Before Defendant's Product was released, most pregnancy tests were binary,
expressing only whether or not a woman is pregnant, which was detected by the
presence of hCG in her urine. Defendant's Product, by measurement of the amount
of hCG rather than only its presence, additionally estimates time elapsed since
implantation. The number of weeks stated by Defendant's Product as having passed
is the number of weeks since ovulation. Depending on the Product's hCG
measurement, its message to the user reads either "Not Pregnant" or "Pregnant"
and "1-2 [weeks]"; "2-3 [weeks]"; or "3+ [weeks]." If the result reads Pregnant, 1-2
weeks, 2-3 weeks, or 3+ weeks, that means that the user is pregnant and that her
hCG levels indicate that the stated number of weeks have passed since ovulation. . . .

                   c. The Launch Package and Advertising Campaign
        Defendant launched the Product in August 2013. The Launch Package
contained the Product's name--Clearblue Advanced Pregnancy Test with Weeks
Estimator--in large font, along with a picture of the Product. The Launch Package
also exhibited four windows, designed to appear similar to the window that appears
on the Product itself. One window showed the word "Pregnant" on the first line
and "1-2 weeks" on the second; the second showed the word "Pregnant" on the first
line and "2-3 weeks" on the second; the third showed the word "Pregnant" on the
first line and "3+ weeks" on the second; and the fourth read "Not Pregnant." (See
image below.) The word "ovulation" did not appear on the front or back of the

                                                    602
Launch Package to describe the Product. One side panel of the Launch Package
contained the full FDA-required Indications for Use Statement in small font. (See
image below.)

        The Product launch was accompanied by a marketing campaign. One feature
of the campaign was a fifteen-second television commercial that ran from August
28, 2013 to December 2, 2013 (the "TV Commercial"). The commercial showed
two women sitting at a kitchen table, engaging in the following dialogue:

        Woman 1: I'm pregnant.
        Woman 2: Really?
        Woman 1: Two weeks.
        Woman 2: You already went to the doctor?
        Woman 1: Not yet, but I took this new Clearblue test. It's like two tests in
one.
        Woman 2: Oh my God, I think I'm going to cry!
        During and after this dialogue, the screen shifted to examples of the various
results that can appear on the device, such as "Pregnant / 1-2 Weeks." For two
seconds of the commercial, the words "ESTIMATED WEEKS SINCE
OVULATION" appeared on the screen, and for nine seconds the following
appeared at the bottom of the screen:
        Word "weeks" on display is for illustration only. For home use only. Always
        consult a doctor if you suspect you are pregnant and to confirm, date and
        monitor pregnancy. Not for multiple pregnancies. Estimates weeks since
        ovulation up to 3+ weeks. Do not use to monitor pregnancy progress or
        duration.

        The commercial closed with a voiceover: "The new Clearblue pregnancy test
also estimates how many weeks. Weeks Estimator. Only from Clearblue."

        Defendant maintained a webpage dedicated to promoting the Product. A
banner at the top of the page stated: "The ONLY Pregnancy Test that Estimates
Weeks." A large photo of the Product appeared with the window reading "Pregnant

                                                    603
/ 1-2 weeks." The webpage stated that the Product "is the FIRST and ONLY
pregnancy test that not only tests you if you are pregnant but also estimates the
number of weeks. It's like 2 tests in 1!"

        Defendant also promoted the Product through product placement in the
television program "The Doctors." Additionally, Defendant marketed the Product
in retailer presentations, web banners, retailer circulars and websites, and in-store
advertising. For example, one advertisement that appeared in Walgreens stated
"How Far Along Am I? Clearblue Advanced Pregnancy Test with Weeks Estimator
tells you in words if you are pregnant, and estimates how many weeks by measuring
the pregnancy hormone level."

                                    d. The FDA's Response
        [The Plaintiff complained to the FDA, which concluded that the
Defendant's marketing violated restrictions the agency imposed in approving the
product.] During a November 18, 2013 conference call with Defendant, the FDA
related its concerns. Among other things, the FDA complained that the Launch
Package included display windows with the word "weeks." It instructed Defendant
to remove the word "weeks" from the windows and replace it with "weeks along"
outside the windows.
        After some back and forth with the FDA, Defendant submitted a "mitigation
proposal" to address the FDA's concerns, which ultimately resulted in the Revised
Package and advertising.

                   e. The Revised Package and Advertising Campaign
        The Revised Package, which was launched in February 2014, differed from
the Launch Package in several ways. The Revised Package included a gray strip in
the top right corner with the phrase "Only Test That Estimates Weeks Since
Ovulation*". The asterisk linked to the Indications for Use Statement on the side
panel. The four screens on the front of the package no longer contained the word
"weeks"; instead, "weeks along" was printed below the screens, as specified by the
FDA. (See image below.)

        Defendant stopped airing the TV Commercial and replaced it with an
Internet-Only Commercial. The Internet-Only Commercial was similar to the TV
Commercial, but the dialogue was changed to remove the discussion of a doctor
and Woman 1's declaration of how far along she was. Defendant also launched a
new webpage which essentially made the same changes as those made in the Revised

                                                    604
Package. The first paragraph on the webpage was also modified to read: "Clearblue
Advanced Pregnancy Test with Weeks Estimator is the FIRST and ONLY pregnancy
test that not only tells you if you are pregnant but also estimates the number of
weeks since ovulation. It's like 2 tests in 1!"

        . . . .
        [Litigation commenced on Plaintiff's false advertising claim.] At the parties'
request, the district court bifurcated trial, as between liability and damages. It then
conducted a two-week bench trial on liability in April 2015. The court issued an
opinion on July 1, 2015 finding Defendant liable for falsely advertising in the
Launch Package and its associated advertising, as well as in the Revised Package.
The court also determined that, at least around the time the Launch Package was
created, Defendant had deliberately set out to deceive consumers into believing that
the Product could provide a measure of weeks-pregnant consistent with what
doctors provide. . . .
        The district court concluded that Plaintiff was entitled to an injunction
because, among other things, it had demonstrated irreparable harm--the parties
were clearly competitors and there was a logical causal connection between
Defendant's false advertising and Plaintiff's sales.
        On August 26, 2015, the district court entered a permanent injunction. The
court's order: (a) enjoined Defendant from communicating in any advertising that
the Product provides an estimate of weeks pregnant that is the same as a doctor's
estimate; (b) enjoined Defendant from distributing or communicating any of the
Launch or Revised Packaging or advertising and required Defendant to remove all
current products from points of sale within forty-five days; (c) required Defendant to
include with the Product a specified forty-one-word statement clarifying the
difference in the estimates, in a particular position and font size; (d) prohibited
Defendant from using several phrases in its advertising, such as "weeks pregnant,"
"weeks along," or "Weeks Estimator"; (e) required Defendant to deliver within
seven days to all retailers and distributors a specified written notice ("Corrective
Notice") with a copy of the injunction; (f) required Defendant, for one year, to
make available copies of the Corrective Notice with copies of the injunction in
prominent locations at all U.S. trade shows and professional meetings attended by
Defendant or any of its representatives; (g) required Defendant within seven days to
set up and maintain for a year a stand-alone page on its website with a specified
messaging about the lawsuit and what the court found to be Defendant's history of
providing misleading information about the Product; (h) required Defendant to
publish a statement in retailer circulars to the same effect; (i) required Defendant to
publish Internet-banner advertising prominently displaying its logo and stating that

                                                    605
a federal court has determined that Defendant "engaged in false advertising"; (j)
required Defendant to publish in three parenting magazines full-page
advertisements including a statement similar to the one on the standalone webpage;
and (k) required Defendant to produce a video explaining the difference between
the Product's and medical profession's pregnancy length estimates and stating that
"a federal court found the manufacturer ... to have engaged in false advertising,"
and to make it prominently available on Defendant's webpages, YouTube channels,
and Facebook page.

                                         DISCUSSION
        . . . .
        II. Lanham Act Liability

                                             a. Falsity
        Defendant contends that the district court erred in finding falsity in its
packaging and advertising. To prevail on a Lanham Act false advertising claim, a
plaintiff must establish that the challenged message is (1) either literally or impliedly
false, (2) material, (3) placed in interstate commerce, and (4) the cause of actual or
likely injury to the plaintiff.
        A plaintiff may establish falsity in two different ways. To establish literal
falsity, a plaintiff must show that the advertisement either makes an express
statement that is false or a statement that is "false by necessary implication,"
meaning that the advertisement's "words or images, considered in context,
necessarily and unambiguously imply a false message." Time Warner Cable, Inc. v.
DIRECTV, Inc., 497 F.3d 144, 158 (2d Cir. 2007). A message can only be literally
false if it is unambiguous. If an advertising message is literally false, the "court may
enjoin the use of the message without reference to the advertisement's impact on
the buying public." Tiffany (NJ) Inc. v. eBay Inc., 600 F.3d 93, 112 (2d Cir. 2010)
(quoting McNeil-P.C.C., Inc. v. Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., 938 F.2d 1544, 1549 (2d
Cir. 1991)).
        If a message is not literally false, a plaintiff may nonetheless demonstrate that
it is impliedly false if the message leaves "an impression on the listener or viewer
that conflicts with reality." Time Warner Cable, 497 F.3d at 153 (quoting Schering
Corp. v. Pfizer Inc., 189 F.3d 218, 229 (2d Cir. 1999), as amended on reh'g (Sept. 29,
1999) (brackets omitted)). Courts have, at times, required a claim of implied falsity
to be supported by extrinsic evidence of consumer confusion. Alternatively, courts
have allowed implied falsity to be supported by evidence that the defendant
intended to deceive the public through "deliberate conduct" of an "egregious
nature," in which case a rebuttable presumption of consumer confusion arises.
Merck Eprova, 760 F.3d at 255-56.

                                                    606
        The district court engaged in separate falsity analyses as between the Launch
Package, together with its associated TV Commercial and additional advertising,
and the Revised Package. As the district court relied on the same theories with
respect to the Launch Package, TV Commercial, and additional advertising, we
address those together before turning to the Revised Package.

      i. The Launch Package, Television Commercial, and Other Advertising
        The district court found that the Launch Package, TV Commercial, and

other associated advertising were literally false by necessary implication, as well as
impliedly false. The court found that although none of these materials expressly
stated that the Product estimates weeks-pregnant using a metric consistent with the
metric doctors would use, these materials included statements and images, which,
when considered in context, unambiguously implied that false message.

        Defendant primarily argues that the district court erred in finding literal
falsity because these materials were "susceptible to more than one reasonable
interpretation" and thus not unambiguous. Appellant's Br. at 45 (quoting Time
Warner Cable, 497 F.3d at 158). Defendant argues that a reasonable ordinary person
in the market for a home pregnancy test could understand Defendant's advertising
regarding the Product's ability to measure "weeks" as weeks-since-
ovulation/fertilization without forming a belief about whether that measure is the
same or different from the convention used by doctors.

        This argument is not persuasive. The issue is not whether Defendant's
measure of weeks could have been understood to measure from LMP versus from
ovulation/fertilization. The issue is whether Defendant's measurement of weeks
would be understood by reasonable consumers to measure by a different metric
than used by the medical profession. If an advertising message means something
different from what reasonable consumers would understand it to mean, that
message can be considered false. Time Warner Cable, 497 F.3d at 158 (citing Novartis
Consumer Health, Inc. v. Johnson & Johnson-Merck Pharm. Co., 290 F.3d 578, 586-87
(3d Cir. 2002) ("A `literally false' message may be either explicit or `conveyed by
necessary implication when, considering the advertisement in its entirety, the
audience would recognize the claim as readily as if it had been explicitly stated.' ")).
The district court found that the medical profession has a "standard--indeed
universal--convention for expressing pregnancy duration." It was undisputed that
Defendant's Product does not utilize the medical profession's standard, universal
convention. The crucial point is that a reasonable consumer would have assumed
from the text of the Launch Package, TV Commercial, and other associated
advertising that the Product was not giving a different number than a medical

                                                    607
professional would give. The district court concluded that message was false. We
can see no error in the court's reasoning.

        The Launch Package did not indicate in any visible or clear way that the
Product provides a different measurement from a doctor's. The packaging referred
to the Product as a "Weeks Estimator" and included sample windows listing
possible results such as "Pregnant / 2-3 Weeks." No reference to ovulation was
included on the front of the packaging. The only mention of ovulation and of the
difference in dating conventions was contained in the small Indications for Use
Statement on the side of the box, which, the district court found, was too wordy
and "minuscule" to render ambiguous the Launch Package's message that the
Product provides an estimate of weeks-pregnant that is consistent with the
measurement provided by doctors.

        Similarly, the TV Commercial unambiguously implied the false message that
the Product provides a measurement of weeks-pregnant that is consistent with the
metric used by medical professionals. Like the Launch Package, the commercial
discussed the Product's ability to estimate "weeks" without clarifying that it
measures weeks since ovulation--and, more importantly, without clarifying that it
measures weeks differently from how a doctor would measure. A voiceover in the
commercial states, "The new Clearblue pregnancy test also estimates how many
weeks." The commercial also includes shots of the misleading digital screens from
the Launch Package. Its references to ovulation in the disclaimers were too fleeting
and small to affect a consumer's understanding, and, furthermore, made no
reference to the fact that the Product uses a different metric from the medical
profession's universal standard.

        Finally, the additional associated advertising--including, among other things,
the website, web banners, and in-store advertising--utilized the same misleading
"weeks" language as the Launch Package and TV Commercial without revealing in
any meaningful way that the number of weeks differs from the number a doctor
would provide.

        As the Launch Package, TV Commercial, and other advertising all
unambiguously implied the false message that the Product provides a measurement
of weeks-pregnant that is consistent with the measurement a doctor would provide,
we find no error in the district court's findings of literal falsity.

        It makes no difference, however, whether the Defendant's messages were
literally false, because the district court also correctly found the messages to be

                                                    608
impliedly false.8 The court's finding of implied falsity was supported by actual
evidence of consumer confusion (to the effect that consumers understood from the
Defendant's messaging that the Product gives the same number of weeks as a doctor
would give), and by evidence of Defendant's intent to deceive, which the court
found sufficient to give rise to a presumption of consumer confusion. The court
found that Defendant engaged in intentional deception because Defendant's "staff
recognized and understood that the Weeks Estimator's result did not align with
how doctors express pregnancy duration and that this misalignment could confuse
consumers." The court cited to extensive evidence in the record supporting this
conclusion. We briefly highlight some of the more significant evidence credited by
the district court.

        Some of this evidence showed that Defendant was clearly aware that LMP is
the metric used by doctors. Dr. Sarah Johnson, Defendant's Head of Clinical and
Medical Affairs, stated in a peer-reviewed article that pregnancy was historically
dated in reference to LMP. Several studies and documents that Defendant
submitted to the FDA stated that this was the traditional or conventional practice.
Defendant's witnesses at trial, including Dr. Joanna Pike, Defendant's Senior
Global Pregnancy Product Manager, and Mark Gittens, Defendant's Chief
Compliance Officer, acknowledged the LMP convention. Some evidence also
indicated that Defendant was aware that consumers would likely become confused
if the distinction between the Product's ovulation metric and the conventional LMP
metric was not made explicit. For example, Dr. Pike stated in an email: "I think
FDA would NOT approve if we used `Weeks Pregnant' in any materials and we are
very likely to also confuse consumers and might end up with challenge/complaint."
Similarly, one of Defendant's board members raised concerns at a board meeting
about the digital display, and expressed that the Defendant "[n]eed[ed] to be clearer
what this means i.e. from time of conception NOT LMP, we are Not saying what we
are doing." [The court noted additional evidence supporting the finding of intent.]

          8 Implied falsity should not be confused with literal falsity by necessary implication. A court may

find a statement literally false by necessary implication, without considering extrinsic evidence, when the

advertisement's "words or images, considered in context, necessarily and unambiguously imply a false

message." Time Warner Cable, 497 F.3d at 158. A message--even a message that is ambiguous--is impliedly

false if it leaves "an impression on the listener or viewer that conflicts with reality." Id. at 153. Implied falsity

is often demonstrated through extrinsic evidence of consumer confusion, id. or through evidence of the

defendant's deliberate deception, which creates a rebuttable presumption of consumer confusion. Merck

Eprova, 760 F.3d at 255-56.

                                                    609
        This evidence, together with other evidence noted by the district court,
S.P.A. 19-27, supports the district court's finding that the Defendant, at least at the
time the Launch Package, TV Commercial, and additional associated advertising
were under development, intended to deceive the public into believing that the
Product provides a measurement of weeks-pregnant consistent with the metric used
by doctors. This evidence was sufficient to support a presumption of consumer
confusion supporting a finding of implied falsity.

                                   ii. The Revised Package
        Defendant also challenges the district court's finding that the Revised
Package was impliedly false. In the Revised Package, Defendant set forth more
clearly that the Product measures weeks since ovulation. Among other things, the
Revised Package added the phrase "Only Test That Estimates Weeks Since
Ovulation*" (with the asterisk directing to the Indications for Use Statement on the
side) at the corner. The package also replaced the windows that said "Pregnant" and
"1-2 weeks," "2-3 weeks," or "3+ weeks" with windows that said "Pregnant" and "1-
2," "2-3," or "3+," with the phrase "Weeks Along" placed below the windows.
        To support its finding of implied falsity, the district court relied, in part, on
the consumer surveys of Plaintiff's expert witness, Hal Poret. With respect to the
Revised Package, "Poret concluded that 16.0% or 17.3% of participants ... answered
both that the [P]roduct estimates the number of weeks a woman is pregnant and
that the [P]roduct's estimate of weeks is the same as a doctor's estimate of weeks-
pregnant." The district court found this to be sufficient evidence of consumer
confusion to support finding the Revised Package impliedly false.
        Defendant's most forceful argument is that the Poret survey was flawed
because the main survey questions at issue failed to test whether survey respondents
were confused into thinking that the Product's measurements were the same as a
doctor's because of the Product's packaging or because of the survey respondents'
preexisting erroneous beliefs about the way pregnancy is measured.
        We agree that the consumer confusion revealed by the survey could have
been attributable to preexisting consumer ignorance about the conventional
medical practice of dating the beginning of pregnancy from LMP. Poret derived his
16.0% or 17.3% deception rate by looking at the number of survey respondents
who expressed the belief that the Product measures the number of weeks a woman
is pregnant and also answered that "the [P]roduct's estimate of weeks is telling you
... [t]he same thing as when a doctor gives you an estimate of weeks." J.A. 6680
(emphases omitted); see also J.A. 1576. A survey respondent might have given this
answer not because the Revised Package confused her into believing that the
Product provides the same measurement as provided by a doctor, but because she

                                                    610
was already under the preexisting mistaken belief that a doctor measures pregnancy
from the date of ovulation, rather than LMP, and, therefore, any product that
purports to "Estimate[ ] Weeks Since Ovulation" would provide the same estimate
as a doctor.

        However, in light of the ample evidence that Defendant was aware of this
widespread consumer ignorance and took no effective steps to guard against
misunderstanding of Defendant's messages attributable to that ignorance, we find
no error in the court's use of the Poret survey. Considering the counterintuitive
nature of the LMP pregnancy measurement used by doctors (which includes about
two weeks prior to ovulation, during which it is biologically impossible for a woman
to be pregnant), it must have been obvious to Defendant, a seasoned manufacturer
of home pregnancy tests, that many women are not aware that the medical
profession measures pregnancy as starting approximately two weeks prior to
ovulation and fertilization. The record demonstrates furthermore that Defendant
was in fact aware that most consumers do not understand the nature of ovulation
and its relation to pregnancy duration. For example, in an email exchange, Brand
Manager Suarez stated that "American women just aren't that in tune" with the
concept of ovulation, that the concept "doesn't really make sense to them," and that
American women "don't have a knowledge of the right days, poor understanding of
the details, etc. and it's not common vernacular of how we would talk [sic]
anything." J.A. 4709-10. Similarly, a document summarizing a meeting involving
Dr. Johnson, notes as an "[a]dditional discussion point[ ]" that the "[o]verall lack of
consumers' understanding of ovulation may cause confusion" and points to the
"[n]eed to address the reason why [doctor]s use [a] different method." J.A. 4506.

        Defendant misses the point in its argument that the court should not have
relied on Poret's survey because the survey failed to test for whether consumer
confusion resulted from preexisting ignorance, rather than Defendant's message.
Widespread consumer ignorance as to how the medical profession measures the
advancement of a pregnancy was the fact--a fact that was known by the Defendant.
In the face of consumer ignorance as to how the medical profession measures the
advancement of a pregnancy, Defendant's message that the Product estimates weeks
since ovulation did nothing to tell ignorant consumers that weeks since ovulation is
a different measurement from that used by doctors. It makes no difference whether
the widespread consumer ignorance predated the Defendant's Revised Package or
was caused by it. The message of the Revised Package--that the Product tells you the
degree of advancement of your pregnancy in terms of "weeks since ovulation"--
implies a message that this is how the advancement of a pregnancy is measured by
medical professionals. The Revised Package did not adequately communicate that

                                                    611
its measurement was not consistent with the metric used by doctors. We therefore
conclude that the evidence, including the Poret Survey, amply supported the district
court's finding of falsity.

                                   b. Materiality and Injury
        Defendant contends the district court failed to make findings necessary to
support the court's conclusion that Defendant's misrepresentations were material to
Plaintiff's claim. Defendant also contends that the district court failed to find a
logical causal connection between any falsity in Defendant's messages and injury to
Plaintiff.
        Plaintiff and Defendant disagree about what exactly is required to satisfy the
materiality requirement for a Lanham Act false advertising claim. They agree that
for a false message to be material, the defendant must have at least "misrepresented
an inherent quality or characteristic of the product." Merck Eprova, 760 F.3d at 255.
Defendant argues, however, that, according to our precedents, there is an additional
requirement that the deception be "likely to influence [consumer] purchasing
decisions," citing NBA v. Motorola, Inc., 105 F.3d 841, 855 (2d Cir. 1997). The
district court expressly found that "[t]he Weeks Estimator's ability to estimate weeks
is, as the [P]roduct's name conveys, an inherent quality or characteristic of the
[P]roduct as it is the key feature that differentiates it from the many other home
pregnancy tests on the market." Defendant points out, however, that, in its
discussion of the materiality element, the court made no express finding that
Defendant's misrepresentation was likely to influence purchasing decisions.
        Although the essential elements of the materiality standard indeed appear to
be somewhat unsettled in our circuit,10 we need not resolve the issue now.11 We
assume for purposes of this ruling that a defendant's false advertising is not material
to a plaintiff's Lanham Act claim unless that falsity had the capacity to adversely
affect the plaintiff's business by influencing consumer purchasing decisions. While

          10 In NBA, we defined "material" as "an inherent quality or characteristic of the product." 105 F.3d

at 855 (internal quotation marks omitted). In so doing, we cited three other circuits and a treatise, and

included parentheticals for each citation that defined "material" as "likely to influence purchasing decisions."

Id. However, our post-NBA cases do not mention this "likely to influence purchasing decision" feature of the

standard; they focus instead on the "inherent quality or characteristic" descriptor.

          11 Apotex Inc. v. Acorda Therapeutics, Inc., 823 F.3d 51 (2d Cir. 2016), recently settled the materiality

standard in this Circuit, explaining that the standard is whether the deception is "likely to influence

purchasing decisions." Id. at 63. Consideration of the Apotex decision has no effect on our determination, as

our analysis above assumes that the standard is exactly as Apotex decided.

                                                    612
the materiality of the falsity and the likelihood of injury to the plaintiff resulting
from the defendant's falsity are separate essential elements, in many cases the
evidence and the findings by the court that a plaintiff has been injured or is likely to
suffer injury will satisfy the materiality standard--especially where the defendant and
plaintiff are competitors in the same market and the falsity of the defendant's
advertising is likely to lead consumers to prefer the defendant's product over the
plaintiff's. See Johnson & Johnson v. Carter-Wallace, Inc., 631 F.2d 186, 190 (2d Cir.
1980) (In Lanham Act claims, the injury "standard is whether it is likely that
[defendant]'s advertising has caused or will cause a loss of [plaintiff's] sales," which
can be established when defendant and plaintiff "are competitors in a relevant
market" and plaintiff demonstrates a "logical causal connection between the alleged
false advertising and its own sales position."). In discussing the essential element of
likelihood of harm to Plaintiff's business resulting from Defendant's false
advertising, the district court expressly found that Plaintiff "lost sales on account of
[Defendant's] false advertising." S.P.A. The court concluded its discussion of
likelihood of injury stating, "[Plaintiff] established a logical causal connection
between [Defendant]'s false advertising and its market harm that is sufficient to
establish [Defendant]'s liability for false advertising under the Lanham Act."

        In our view, the district court's conclusion, although uttered in connection
with the element of likely injury, also constituted a finding that Defendant's
misrepresentations were likely to influence purchasing decisions and were therefore
material to Plaintiff's claim. If consumers, faced with the choice to purchase either
the plaintiff's product or the defendant's, are likely to prefer the defendant's
product by reason of the defendant's false advertising, the falsity of the defendant's
advertising is material to the plaintiff's Lanham Act claim.

        The evidence furthermore amply supported the conclusion that the falsity of
Defendant's advertising was both material and likely to cause injury to Plaintiff. It is
entirely reasonable to expect that, for a significant number of women interested in
learning whether they are pregnant--especially those who have not previously been
pregnant or are otherwise ignorant of the details of the reproductive cycle--the
information that Defendant's Product will tell them something different from what
a doctor would provide would make them less likely to trust Defendant's Product,
and more likely to purchase from Plaintiff, Defendant's closest competitor. The
district court's finding is further supported by the evidence that this was precisely
the risk that motivated Defendant to avoid making clear to consumers that its
Weeks Estimator gave information different from what a doctor would give.

        We conclude that both the evidence and the district court's findings, to the
effect that Plaintiff likely suffered a loss of sales by reason of Defendant's false

                                                    613
advertising, adequately supported both the materiality element and the likely injury
element. With respect to the injury element, Defendant argues that the district
court's reasoning was fallacious because the court relied in part on statistics showing
that Plaintiff's share of the market decreased, while the Defendant's share increased
upon Defendant's introduction of the Product. Defendant argues that this
redistribution of consumer preference was attributable to the important new feature
Defendant was offering, and that there is no reason to attribute any diminution in
Plaintiff's market share to the falsity of Defendant's advertising. Even assuming,
however, that Defendant is correct in discrediting an aspect of the district court's
reasoning, the district court's finding that Plaintiff likely lost market share to
Defendant attributable to the falsity of Defendant's concealment was amply
supported by the evidence, as explained above. . . .

                        Notes

Remedy. You may have noticed that one of the remedies above was corrective

advertising.  Here  is  the    corrective  ad  (from

http://tushnet.blogspot.com/2017/03/clearblues-corrective-advertising-not.html):

                        614
        "[A]n exceptionally well argued case." Clearblue was represented by Seth
Waxman, who was Solicitor General for Bill Clinton. The plaintiff was represented
by Paul Clement, who served in the same role for George W. Bush.

        False by necessary implication. As you can tell, a lot rides on whether the
advertisement is alleged to be false or impliedly false, as the latter requires a
substantially greater showing from the plaintiff. The shift to recognizing "false by
necessary implication" claims blurs the line separating the categories. The Second
Circuit adopted the doctrine in Time Warner Cable, Inc. v. DIRECTV, Inc., 497
F.3d 144 (2d Cir. 2007), a case involving ads by DirecTV touting the superiority of
satellite television over cable. The opinion describes one such ad:

        DIRECTV debuted another commercial in October 2006, featuring actor
        William Shatner as Captain James T. Kirk, his character from the popular
        Star Trek television show and film series. The following conversation takes
        place on the Starship Enterprise:

        Mr. Chekov: Should we raise our shields, Captain?

        Captain Kirk: At ease, Mr. Chekov.

        Again with the shields. I wish he'd just relax and enjoy the amazing picture
        clarity of the DIRECTV HD we just hooked up.

        With what Starfleet just ponied up for this big screen TV, settling for cable
        would be illogical.

        Mr. Spock: [Clearing throat.]

        Captain Kirk: What, I can't use that line?

        The original version ended with the announcer saying, "For picture quality
        that beats cable, you've got to get DIRECTV.".

Id. at 150. The court upheld the conclusion that the ad was false by necessary
implication:

        [We] now formally adopt what is known in other circuits as the "false by
        necessary implication" doctrine. Under this doctrine, a district court
        evaluating whether an advertisement is literally false must analyze the
        message conveyed in full context,, i.e., it must consider the advertisement in

                                                    615
        its entirety and not ... engage in disputatious dissection. If the words or
        images, considered in context, necessarily imply a false message, the
        advertisement is literally false and no extrinsic evidence of consumer
        confusion is required. See Novartis Consumer Health, Inc. v. Johnson & Johnson-
        Merck Pharm. Co., 290 F.3d 578, 586-87 (3d Cir.2002) ("A `literally false'
        message may be either explicit or `conveyed by necessary implication when,
        considering the advertisement in its entirety, the audience would recognize
        the claim as readily as if it had been explicitly stated.' " (quoting Clorox Co.
        Puerto Rico, 228 F.3d at 35)). However, only an unambiguous message can be
        literally false. Therefore, if the language or graphic is susceptible to more
        than one reasonable interpretation, the advertisement cannot be literally
        false. See Scotts Co., 315 F.3d at 275 (stating that a literal falsity argument fails
        if the statement or image "can reasonably be understood as conveying
        different messages"); Clorox Co. Puerto Rico, 228 F.3d at 35 ("[A] factfinder
        might conclude that the message conveyed by a particular advertisement
        remains so balanced between several plausible meanings that the claim made
        by the advertisement is too uncertain to serve as the basis of a literal falsity
        claim...."). There may still be a basis for a claim that the advertisement is
        misleading, but to resolve such a claim, the district court must look to
        consumer data to determine what "the person to whom the advertisement is
        addressed find[s] to be the message," Am. Home Prods., 577 F.2d at 166
        (citation omitted). In short, where the advertisement does not
        unambiguously make a claim, "the court's reaction is at best not
        determinative and at worst irrelevant." Id.

        Here, the District Court found that Shatner's assertion that "settling for
        cable would be illogical," considered in light of the advertisement as a whole,
        unambiguously made the false claim that cable's HD picture quality is
        inferior to that of DIRECTV's. We cannot say that this finding was clearly
        erroneous, especially given that in the immediately preceding line, Shatner
        praises the "amazing picture clarity of DIRECTV HD." We accordingly
        affirm the District Court's conclusion that TWC established a likelihood of
        success on its claim that the Revised Shatner Commercial is literally false.

Id. at 158 (multiple citations and quotations omitted).

        Statutory standing. Who may sue under § 43(a)(1)(B)? The plain language of
the text seems to suggest that a consumer injured by misleading advertising may sue,
but most courts to consider the issue reject consumer standing. See, e.g., Serbin v.

                                                    616
Ziebart Int'l Corp., 11 F.3d 1163, 1179 (3d Cir. 1993) ("[W]e join the Second
Circuit in holding that Congress, when authorizing federal courts to deal with
claims of false advertising, did not contemplate that federal courts should entertain
claims brought by consumers.").

        What about those with a commercial interest? For a time, the courts were
divided on the precise test for statutory standing, some of them incorporating
prudential and antitrust law considerations. The Supreme Court reset everything by
issuing Lexmark Intern., Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc., 572 U.S. 118 (2014).
The Court declared that "a plaintiff must plead (and ultimately prove) an injury to a
commercial interest in sales or business reputation proximately caused by the
defendant's misrepresentations." Id. at 140.

        Materiality. Courts require materiality as an element of the false advertising
cause of action. As you know, this is not similarly a requirement for a trademark
infringement suit. Is there a reason to require materiality for false advertising claims,
but not trademark infringement? Does it have to do with the traditional scope of
the infringement action (i.e., that it is reasonable to presume materiality in the
passing off context?). What effect does the expansion of the trademark infringement
action have?

        Can you think of advertising claims that are false, not material, but still in
the interest of advertisers to make?

        "Tests prove" claims. An advertiser may invite trouble when claiming that tests
prove the superiority of its products, as that may shift the attention of litigation not
to the claim of superiority, but to whether objective tests establish it. As the Second
Circuit has explained:

        A plaintiff's burden in proving literal falsity thus varies depending on the
        nature of the challenged advertisement. Where the defendant's
        advertisement claims that its product is superior, plaintiff must affirmatively
        prove defendant's product equal or inferior. Where, as in the current case,
        defendant's ad explicitly or implicitly represents that tests or studies prove its
        product superior, plaintiff satisfies its burden by showing that the tests did
        not establish the proposition for which they were cited. We have held that a
        plaintiff can meet this burden by demonstrating that the tests were not
        sufficiently reliable to permit a conclusion that the product is superior.

        Puffery. Is it false advertising to claim that your product is the "best" if a
competitor can establish that by certain criteria it is not? No. Such statements are
classified as non-actionable "puffery." "Puffery exists in two general forms: (1)
exaggerated statements of bluster or boast upon which no reasonable consumer
would rely; and (2) vague or highly subjective claims of product superiority,
including bald assertions of superiority." Am. Italian Pasta Co. v. New World Pasta
Co., 371 F.3d 387, 390-91 (8th Cir. 2004). The question is sometimes whether
puffery is juxtaposed with objective statements that take it into the realm of a factual
claim.

        The plaintiff in the above-cited case made that claim of the following: "For
over 130 years, pasta lovers have enjoyed the great taste of Mueller's. Our pasta
cooks to perfect tenderness every time because it's made from 100% pure semolina
milled from the highest quality durum wheat. Taste why Mueller's is America's
favorite pasta." The Second Circuit rejected the claim:

        The Paragraph does not suggest a benchmark by which the veracity of
        American's statement can be verified. The Paragraph generally declares the
        brand has existed for 130 years, Mueller's tastes great, cooks to perfect
        tenderness, and is manufactured from high quality grain. We assume,
        arguendo, the sentence "Taste why Mueller's is America's favorite pasta"
        incorporates the attributes listed in the Paragraph into American's claim.
        Two attributes listed in the Paragraph are subject to verification: Mueller's is
        made from 100% pure semolina, and the brand is more than 130 years old.
        New World does not contend these claims are false. The remaining
        attributes listed in the Paragraph are unquantifiable and subject to an
        individual's fancy.

Id. at 392. Likewise, "the Phrases do not convey a benchmark for `America's
Favorite Pasta.' The term `quality' is vague, entirely subjective, and a bare assertion
of product superiority." Id.

        "Fresh. Local. Quality." The quoted tagline was used for bread. A jury
concluded the use of the word "local" was false advertising because the bread
purchased by the defendant's customers was often baked outside the state of
purchase. The Tenth Circuit reversed.

                                29 F.4th 630 (10th Cir. 2022)

Eid, Circuit Judge.

. . . .
        The problem for Bimbo Bakeries is that the word "local" cannot be

"adjudged true or false in a way that ... admits of empirical verification." Am. Italian
Pasta Co, 371 F.3d at 391 (quoting Pizza Hut, 227 F.3d at 496). The word is not
reducible to the unambiguous factual message that, as Bimbo Bakeries argues, the
underlying product is made locally, let alone that "local" refers to "the state of sale."
For one thing, using the word "local" in a marketing campaign, without anything
more, can connote a host of ideas. It might mean that a company hires local
workers, that it uses local materials, that it is locally based, that it participates in
outreach efforts with local organizations, or that it donates money to local causes.
Even assuming that "local" refers to where a product was made, however, the word
lacks any specific objective meaning beyond the general concept it conveys.
Definitions of "local" and views about whether something is "local" vary wildly, so
the word's usage in marketing can only communicate U.S. Bakery's position that its
products are local. The same ambiguity haunts every rival interpretation of the
word. Without more, then, the veracity of a locality claim cannot be judged in an
empirically verifiable way. Locality is fundamentally subjective.

        Without any consensus definition of what "local" objectively means, we are
unable to conclude that a claim of locality admits of being proven true or false.
Dictionary definitions of "local" offered by Bimbo Bakeries focus on a relationship
to a particular area or place, but do not explain how large that area or place can be,
or how to demarcate it. An entirely reasonable application of such definitions
would account for something being local despite being from just across state
borders, but not account for something being local despite being from the opposite
end of the state. The same line-drawing problem emerges with international
borders. And there is no principled, universal, or intuitive magic number of miles at
which something stops being "local." In the absence of mile markers, literal or
figurative, we are unable to assess a locality claim as a factual matter. We are left
with the conclusion that "local" is simply a statement of opinion with which others
may agree or disagree without generating legal liability. The word "does not contain
the kind of detailed or specific factual assertions that are necessary to state a false
advertising cause of action." See Cook, Perkiss and Liehe, Inc. v. N. Cal. Collection Serv.
Inc., 911 F.2d 242, 246 (9th Cir. 1990). . . .

                                                    619
        Bimbo Bakeries' survey, which asked consumers about the meaning of
"local," cannot somehow convert the word into a statement of fact. All it can do is
juxtapose U.S. Bakery's own opinion about when something qualifies as "local"
with the opinions of its customers. And while they may often differ, it is the very
essence of opinions that they differ. The survey thus illustrates just how unworkable
survey evidence is in this context. Under Bimbo Bakeries' theory of the case, a
bakery selling "local" bread in a supermarket one block away from its production
line would be liable for false advertising whenever customers interpret "local" as
baked in-store, as several survey respondents did here. That is a difference of
opinion, not commercial deception . . . .

        If a statement is not one of fact, it is legally irrelevant whether consumers
agree with it. Consumer surveys in Lanham Act cases are properly limited to
proving that factual claims that are not literally false nonetheless mislead
consumers. . . .

        It is possible that, as Bimbo Bakeries argues, some segment of consumers (1)
interpreted the "Fresh. Local. Quality." tagline's use of the word "local" as an
assertion that U.S. Bakery's products were locally baked, (2) determined that locally
baked meant baked within the state of sale, and (3) found that false fact material to
the decision to purchase the product. But not every subjective interpretation of
ambiguous language is actionable false advertising. When the language in question
is incapable of objective verification as to truth or falsity, it is not a statement of
fact, and no amount of misunderstanding will give rise to an action under the
Lanham Act. U.S. Bakery's tagline was a mere expression of its opinion . . . .

                                              Notes

        Why advertise? Why advertise falsely? What is the point of advertising? And
what is the point of deceptive advertising? How does it help the advertiser? Consider
three types of attributes for which the advertising might be targeted. A search good is
a good whose attributes can be determined by the consumer before purchase. So,
for example, a store may advertise Coca-Cola for $0.50 per can. The consumer is
able to verify the claim before purchase, so there is an incentive for the advertiser to
tell the truth about the attribute. An experience good is one whose attributes can only
be determined with use. So Coca-Cola may advertise that it tastes great, but a
consumer will be able to verify that only upon trying the drink. Here, too, there is a
disincentive to waste money on false advertising as the false advertiser will not have
the benefit of repeat business. Finally a credence good is one whose attributes are

                                                    620
hard to verify, even with use.* For example, suppose a soda advertises the ability to
strengthen tooth enamel, or a lawyer promises the best legal representation possible.
Consumers have no way to verify whether the claimed effect is real. On the one
hand, this might seem to give advertisers an incentive to lie, but wouldn't rational
consumers have an equal incentive to discount any unverifiable claims? Are you
rational in this way?

        If an extreme version of this account is correct, it casts the existence of false
advertising actions in a different light. Instead of being about protecting consumers,
the suits seem instead to be a form of competition via litigation.

        But in fact we see advertising of credence goods all the time, just as we see
false advertising. Why? What's missing from the above account? See generally, e.g.,
Richard Craswell, Interpreting Deceptive Advertising, 65 B.U. L. REV. 657 (1985).

Federal Trade Commission. The FTC also plays a role in policing deceptive

advertising. 15 U.S.C. § 45 prohibits "[u]nfair methods of competition in or

affecting commerce, and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting

commerce" and authorizes the FTC to prevent such activities. The statute contains a

provision calling on the commission to balance the harms of challenged activities

against their benefits to consumers as the FTC is not to declare a practice unlawful

"unless the act or practice causes or is likely to cause substantial injury to consumers

which is not reasonably avoidable by consumers themselves and not outweighed by

countervailing benefits to consumers or to competition." 15 U.S.C. § 45(n).

The FTC may bring administrative complaints against its targets, or it may

bring a direct federal action (that is, without first proceeding administratively).

Although the commission also has rulemaking power, it is somewhat limited as

compared to most other federal agencies. 15 U.S.C. § 57a. The agency also will

recommend best practices in certain areas. See, e.g., See, e.g., "FTC Issues Revised

`Green Guides': Will Help Marketers Avoid Making Misleading Environmental

Claims,"  (Oct.  1,  2012),                       available                  at

          * The Search, Experience, Credence framework is traced to a pair of articles from the early 1970s.
See Phillip Nelson, Information and Consumer Behavior, 78 J. Pol. Econ. 311 (1970) (distinguishing search and
experience goods), and Michael R. Darby & Edi Karni, Free Competition and the Optimal Amount of Fraud, 16

        Recall the requirement that an advertiser have some basis for touting that
"tests prove" something or other. The FTC has a similar expectation regarding
evidentiary claims:

        Many ads contain express or implied statements regarding the amount of
        support the advertiser has for the product claim. When the substantiation
        claim is express (e.g.., "tests prove", "doctors recommend", and "studies
        show"), the Commission expects the firm to have at least the advertised level
        of substantiation. Of course, an ad may imply more substantiation than it
        expressly claims or may imply to consumers that the firm has a certain type
        of support; in such cases, the advertiser must possess the amount and type of
        substantiation the ad actually communicates to consumers.

        State law. Note that false advertising is also subject to state law regimes.

        NAD. Market participants wishing to challenge false advertising by
competitors may also avail themselves of a private option. The National Advertising
Division of BBB National Programs offers voluntary arbitration of false advertising
disputes. Though the arbitration is non-binding, the NAD notes that "pursuant to
the NAD's procedures, if an advertiser refuses to participate (or does not respond to
NAD's opening letter) or refuses to comply with NAD's recommendations, NAD
will refer the matter to the appropriate regulatory agency, usually the Federal Trade
Commission (FTC), and issue a press release." Details of NAD procedures can be
found at https://bbbprograms.org/programs/all-programs/national-advertising-
division. For a popular account, see http://www.slate.com/id/2221968/.

Problems

        1. Papa John's engages in advertising with the slogan "Better Ingredients,
Better Pizza." Suppose Pizza Hut convinces a fact finder that Papa John's
purportedly better ingredients do not, in fact, lead to better pizza. Would a violation
of section 43(a) be established?

        2. Consider the following:

                                                    622
"In August 1999, Clorox introduced a 15-second and a 30-second television
commercial ("Goldfish I"), each depicting an S.C. Johnson Ziploc Slide-Loc
resealable storage bag side-by-side with a Clorox Glad-Lock bag. The bags are
identified in the commercials by brand name. Both commercials show an
animated, talking goldfish in water inside each of the bags. In the
commercials, the bags are turned upside-down, and the Slide-Loc bag leaks
rapidly while the Glad-Lock bag does not leak at all. In both the 15- and 30-
second Goldfish I commercials, the Slide-Loc goldfish says, in clear distress,
"My Ziploc Slider is dripping. Wait a minute!," while the Slide Loc bag is
shown leaking at a rate of approximately one drop per one to two seconds. In
the 30-second Goldfish I commercial only, the Slide-Loc bag is shown leaking
while the Slide-Loc goldfish says, "Excuse me, a little help here," and then,
"Oh, dripping, dripping." At the end of both commercials, the Slide Loc
goldfish exclaims, "Can I borrow a cup of water!!!"
Competitor S.C. Johnson sued for false advertising. Its outside expert
"conducted `torture testing,' in which Slide-Loc bags were filled with water,
rotated for 10 seconds, and held upside-down for an additional 20 seconds."
He testified that "37 percent of all Slide-Loc bags tested did not leak at all.
Of the remaining 63 percent that did leak, only a small percentage leaked at
the rate depicted in the Goldfish I television commercials. The vast majority
leaked at a rate between two and twenty times slower than that depicted in
the Goldfish I commercials."
Is this actionable false advertising?

27. The Right of Publicity

        The right of publicity is a right to one's commercial identity. The Sixth
Circuit describes it as "an intellectual property right of recent origin which has been
defined as the inherent right of every human being to control the commercial use of his or
her identity." ETW Corp. v. Jireh Publ'g, Inc., 332 F.3d 915, 928 (6th Cir. 2003)
(emphases added). Whoa. Saying this is a matter of inherent human rights raises the
stakes a bit, doesn't it? Especially for what is acknowledged to be a recent
development. As you read on, think about whether a right to publicity is worth
having and, if so, why. Think in particular about what it gives us that trademark law
does not.

        Roots of the right and its scope. The right of publicity has its origins in judge-
made law, particularly in the privacy torts. Development of a right to privacy is often
traced to the famous law review article The Right to Privacy, 4 Harv. L. Rev. 193
(1890), by (future Supreme Court Justice) Louis Brandeis and Charles Warren. The
privacy tort generally takes one of four forms. As § 652A of the RESTATEMENT
(SECOND) OF TORTS explains:

        The right of privacy is invaded by

        (a) unreasonable intrusion upon the seclusion of another, as stated in §
        652B; or

        (b) appropriation of the other's name or likeness, as stated in § 652C; or

        (c) unreasonable publicity given to the other's private life, as stated in §
        652D; or

        (d) publicity that unreasonably places the other in a false light before the
        public, as stated in § 652E.

        According to Professor McCarthy, the first mention of a distinct right of
publicity came in Haelan Laboratories, Inc. v. Topps Chewing Gum, Inc., 202 F.2d 866,
868 (2d Cir. 1953). Judge Frank wrote:

        We think that, in addition to and independent of that right of privacy
        (which in New York derives from statute), a man has a right in the publicity
        value of his photograph, i.e., the right to grant the exclusive privilege of
        publishing his picture, and that such a grant may validly be made `in gross,'

                                                    624
        i.e., without an accompanying transfer of a business or of anything else.
        Whether it be labelled a `property' right is immaterial; for here, as often
        elsewhere, the tag `property' simply symbolizes the fact that courts enforce a
        claim which has pecuniary worth.

        This right might be called a `right of publicity.' For it is common knowledge
        that many prominent persons (especially actors and ball-players), far from
        having their feelings bruised through public exposure of their likenesses,
        would feel sorely deprived if they no longer received money for authorizing
        advertisements, popularizing their countenances, displayed in newspapers,
        magazines, busses, trains and subways. This right of publicity would usually
        yield them no money unless it could be made the subject of an exclusive
        grant which barred any other advertiser from using their pictures.

        We think the New York decisions recognize such a right.[*]

        The view and terminology spread quickly. Today, the right of publicity is
recognized in many jurisdictions as something distinct from the right of privacy.

        Elements. Section 46 of the Restatement of Unfair Competition provides for
liability for "[o]ne who appropriates the commercial value of a person's identity by
using without consent the person's name, likeness, or other indicia of identity for
purposes of trade." Many states have codified the right. As the home of much of the
television and movie business, the California rules (like New York's) are particularly
important. California Civil Code § 3344 provides:

        Any person who knowingly uses another's name, voice, signature,
        photograph, or likeness, in any manner, on or in products, merchandise, or
        goods, or for purposes of advertising or selling, or soliciting purchases of,
        products, merchandise, goods or services, without such person's prior
        consent, or, in the case of a minor, the prior consent of his parent or legal
        guardian, shall be liable for any damages sustained by the person or persons
        injured as a result thereof.

          * New York courts have since clarified that the state right is statutory and lacks a common law basis.
Stephano v. News Group Publications, Inc., 474 N.E.2d 580, 584 (N.Y. 1984) ("Since the `right of publicity'
is encompassed under the Civil Rights Law as an aspect of the right of privacy, which, as noted, is exclusively
statutory in this State, the plaintiff cannot claim an independent common-law right of publicity.").

                                                    625
        The California statutory right is cumulative of other rights. California
common law also recognizes a (broader) publicity right. Its elements are: "(1) the
defendant's use of the plaintiff's identity; (2) the appropriation of plaintiff's name or
likeness to defendant's advantage, commercially or otherwise; (3) lack of consent;
and (4) resulting injury." White v. Samsung Electronics America, Inc., 971 F.2d
1395, 1397 (9th Cir. 1992).

        What is the right of publicity for? Why do we need a right of publicity? To the
extent the appropriation is of an authored work, copyright may protect the
rightsholder. To the extent the complaint is that the use suggests sponsorship or
endorsement of a product or service, Lanham Act remedies of false advertising or
trademark infringement may apply. On the latter point, recall that section 43(a)
prohibits any "false or misleading description of fact, or false or misleading
representation of fact, which . . . is likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or
to deceive as to the affiliation, connection, or association of such person with
another person, or as to the origin, sponsorship, or approval."**

        Courts have addressed false endorsement claims under the framework for
trademark infringement. Waits v. Frito-Lay, Inc., 978 F.2d 1093, 1110 (9th Cir.
1992) ("[U]nauthorized use of a celebrity's identity is a type of false association
claim, for it alleges the misuse of a trademark ...."). At times, this means
shoehorning claims into the multifactor test. See, e.g., Abdul-Jabbar v. General
Motors Corp., 85 F.3d 407, 413 (9th Cir. 1996) ("In considering celebrities' claims
of violation under the Lanham Act, we have considered the following factors to
determine whether a plaintiff has raised a genuine issue of material fact as to
likelihood of confusion over endorsement: `(1) strength of the plaintiff's mark; (2)
relatedness of the goods; (3) similarity of the marks; (4) evidence of actual
confusion; (5) marketing channels used; (6) likely degree of purchaser care; (7)
defendant's intent in selecting the mark.'"). As you can tell from the quote, this
means treating the celebrity's identity as akin to a trademark, and the problems we
have discussed previously about trying to adapt a test for source confusion
concerning trademarks into other settings--in this case sponsorship involving
names.

        The case raises another issue. If a celebrity image is like a trademark, does
that mean the whole of trademark law applies? To illustrate, Abdul-Jabbar involved
an ad in which

          ** Use of false advertising remedies have generally not fared as well for a variety of doctrinal reasons,

including a stricter requirement that there be a false representation.

                                                    626
        A disembodied voice asks, "How 'bout some trivia?" This question is
        followed by the appearance of a screen bearing the printed words, "You're
        Talking to the Champ." The voice then asks, "Who holds the record for
        being voted the most outstanding player of this tournament?" In the screen
        appear the printed words, "Lew Alcindor, UCLA, '67, '68, '69." Next, the
        voice asks, "Has any car made the `Consumer Digest's Best Buy' list more
        than once? [and responds:] The Oldsmobile Eighty-Eight has." A seven-
        second film clip of the automobile, with its price, follows. During the clip,
        the voice says, "In fact, it's made that list three years in a row. And now you
        can get this Eighty-Eight special edition for just $18,995." At the end of the
        clip, a message appears in print on the screen: "A Definite First Round Pick,"
        accompanied by the voice saying, "it's your money." A final printed message
        appears: "Demand Better, 88 by Oldsmobile."

Abdul-Jabbar, 85 F.3d at 409. As you may know, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was once
named Lew Alcindor; he changed his name in 1971. If trademark principles apply,
does that mean that the mark was abandoned? The court said no. Id. at 411 ("One's
birth name is an integral part of one's identity; it is not bestowed for commercial
purposes, nor is it `kept alive' through commercial use."). Here, then we have
potential for the breadth of trademark's powers, but without some of its limitations.

        What does the viability of claims of this sort tell us about the need for the
right of publicity? What does the latter give us that the former does not? Professor
McCarthy's treatise notes several important doctrinal differences. For example,
trademarks require use for protection; personas do not. Trademark infringement is
established by likely confusion; a publicity claim, identification of the plaintiff's
"persona." 5 MCCARTHY § 28:9. But do these differences justify a separate tort? If
the right of publicity is here to stay, should the extension of trademark law to false
endorsement claims be scaled back?

        How long? Should the right to publicity survive death? The law varies from
state to state, creating interesting choice-of-law and forum-shopping issues. For
example, Hebrew University of Jerusalem v. General Motors LLC, 903 F. Supp. 2d 932
(C.D. Cal. 2012), considered how long the right in Albert Einstein's persona should
last. Although the case was in California, which provides for a statutory 70-year post-
mortem right, the court interpreted state law as not providing rights to those not
domiciled in the state. Because Einstein died in New Jersey, the court held that
Einstein's post-mortem rights, if any, arise under New Jersey law. It then predicted
that New Jersey courts would not recognize a post-mortem right greater than 50

                                                    627
years (the plaintiff had argued for an indefinite period or, alternatively, a 70-year
period). Einstein died in 1955. See also Milton H. Greene Archives, Inc. v. Marilyn
Monroe LLC, 692 F.3d 983 (9th Cir. 2012) (concerning Marilyn Monroe's publicity
right).

        How famous? Do you have to be famous to have your publicity right
infringed? The majority view appears to be that fame is not a requirement.
RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF UNFAIR COMPETITION § 49 cmt. b.

        Famous for the part? A performer's fame may be hard to separate from the role
that made them famous. Sometimes a court will see the two as so intertwined that
the publicity right may extend to evocations of a character rather than its actor. See,
e.g., McFarland v. Miller, 14 F.3d 912 (3d Cir. 1994) (evocation of character may
violate actor's right of publicity where role had become "inextricably intertwined"
with actor's identity). But compare, e.g., Lugosi v. Universal Pictures, 603 P.2d 425,
432 (Cal. 1979) (Mosk, J., concurring) ("Here it is clear that Bela Lugosi did not
portray himself and did not create Dracula, he merely acted out a popular role that
had been garnished with the patina of age, as had innumerable other thespians over
the decades. His performance gave him no more claim on Dracula than that of
countless actors on Hamlet who have portrayed the Dane in a unique manner.").

        The problem of cumulating regimes. Suppose you want to use a famous song with
your commercial. You negotiate with the copyright holder of both the composition
and sound recording. Is that enough? Do you also have to find the singer and secure
their permission? See, e.g., Midler v. Ford Motor Co., 849 F.2d 460 (9th Cir. 1988).
The problem often triggers the argument that copyright law preempts publicity
claims.

        Limits. Taken too far, the right of publicity threatens any number of
referential uses of a celebrity's identity. Publicity law has a number of doctrinal tools
to ameliorate this concern, particularly as they relate to the First Amendment. They
are discussed below. One way of avoiding the problem is definitional. Many statutes
contain explicit limitations on the right from interfering with activities like news
reporting. See, e.g., Cal. Civ. Code § 3344(d) ("For purposes of this section, a use of
a name, voice, signature, photograph, or likeness in connection with any news,
public affairs, or sports broadcast or account, or any political campaign, shall not
constitute a use for which consent is required under subdivision (a)."); see also
RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF UNFAIR COMPETITION § 45 (noting that "use `for

                                                    628
purposes of trade' does not ordinarily include the use of a person's identity in news
reporting, commentary, entertainment, works of fiction or nonfiction, or in
advertising that is incidental to such uses").

                                 Hart v. Electronic Arts, Inc.
                                 717 F.3d 141 (3d Cir. 2013)

GREENAWAY, JR., Circuit Judge.
        . . . . Hart was a quarterback, player number 13, with the Rutgers University

NCAA Men's Division I Football team for the 2002 through 2005 seasons. As a
condition of participating in college-level sports, Hart was required to adhere to the
National Collegiate Athletic Association's ("NCAA") amateurism rules as set out in
Article 12 of the NCAA bylaws. See, e.g., NCAA, 2011-12 NCAA Division I Manual
§ 12.01.1 (2011) ("Only an amateur student-athlete is eligible for inter-collegiate
athletics participation in a particular sport."). In relevant part, these rules state that
a collegiate athlete loses his or her "amateur" status if (1) the athlete "[u]ses his or
her athletics skill (directly or indirectly) for pay in any form in that sport," or (2) the
athlete "[a]ccepts any remuneration or permits the use of his or her name or picture
to advertise, recommend or promote directly the sale or use of a commercial
product or service of any kind." In comporting with these bylaws, Hart purportedly
refrained from seizing on various commercial opportunities. On the field, Hart
excelled. At 62, weighing 197 pounds, and typically wearing a visor and armband
on his left wrist, Hart amassed an impressive list of achievements as the Scarlet
Knights' starting quarterback. As of this writing, Hart still holds the Scarlet Knights'
records for career attempts, completions, and interceptions. . . .

        Hart's participation in college football also ensured his inclusion in EA's
successful NCAA Football videogame franchise. EA, founded in 1982, is "one of the
world's leading interactive entertainment software companies," and "develops,
publishes, and distributes interactive software worldwide" for consoles, cell phones,
and PCs. EA's catalogue includes NCAA Football, the videogame series at issue in
the instant case. . . .

        A typical play session allows users the choice of two teams. "Once a user
chooses two college teams to compete against each other, the video game assigns a
stadium for the match-up and populates it with players, coaches, referees, mascots,
cheerleaders and fans."5 In addition to this "basic single-game format," EA has

          5 Appellee licenses, from the Collegiate Licensing Company (the NCAA's licensing agent), "the right

to use member school names, team names, uniforms, logos, stadium fight songs, and other game elements."

                                                    629
introduced a number of additional game modes that allow for "multi-game" play.
Thus, with the release of NCAA Football 98, EA introduced the "Dynasty Mode,"
which allows users to "control[ ] a college program for up to thirty seasons,"
including "year-round responsibilities of a college coach such as recruiting virtual
high school players out of a random-generated pool of athletes." Later, in NCAA
Football 2006, EA introduced the "Race for the Heisman" (later renamed "Campus
Legend"), which allows users to "control a single [user-made] virtual player from
high school through his collegiate career, making his or her own choices regarding
practices, academics and social activities."

        In no small part, the NCAA Football franchise's success owes to its focus on
realism and detail--from realistic sounds, to game mechanics, to team mascots. This
focus on realism also ensures that the "over 100 virtual teams" in the game are
populated by digital avatars that resemble their real-life counterparts and share their
vital and biographical information. Thus, for example, in NCAA Football 2006,
Rutgers' quarterback, player number 13, is 62 tall, weighs 197 pounds and
resembles Hart. Moreover, while users can change the digital avatar's appearance
and most of the vital statistics (height, weight, throwing distance, etc.), certain
details remain immutable: the player's home state, home town, team, and class year.

        Appellant filed suit against EA in state court for, among other things,
violation of his right of publicity. . . .

        We begin our analysis by noting the self-evident: video games are protected
as expressive speech under the First Amendment. . . . [G]ames enjoy the full force of
First Amendment protections. As with other types of expressive conduct, the
protection afforded to games can be limited in situations where the right of free
expression necessarily conflicts with other protected rights.

         The instant case presents one such situation. Here, Appellee concedes, for
purposes of the motion and appeal, that it violated Appellant's right of publicity; in
essence, misappropriating his identity for commercial exploitation. However,
Appellee contends that the First Amendment shields it from liability for this
violation because NCAA Football is a protected work. To resolve the tension
between the First Amendment and the right of publicity, we must balance the
interests underlying the right to free expression against the interests in protecting
the right of publicity. See Zacchini v. Scripps-Howard Broad. Co., 433 U.S. 562 (1977).
. . .

(App. at 532.) Unlike certain of its other videogame franchises, EA does not license the likeness and identity

rights for intercollegiate players.

                                                    630
        [Over time, courts developed "more systematized balancing tests for resolving
conflicts between the right of publicity and the First Amendment."] Of these, three
tests are of particular note: the commercial-interest-based Predominant Use Test,
the trademark-based Rogers Test, and the copyright-based Transformative Use Test.
The Rogers and Transformative Use tests are the most well-established, while the
Predominant Use Test is addressed below only because Appellant argues in favor of
its adoption. We consider each test in turn, looking at its origins, scope of
application, and possible limitations. For the reasons discussed below, we adopt the
Transformative Use Test as being the most appropriate balancing test to be applied
here.

                                   a. Predominant Use Test
        Appellant urges us to adopt the Predominant Use Test, which first appeared
in Doe v. TCI Cablevision, 110 S.W.3d 363 (Mo.2003) (en banc), a case that
considered a hockey player's right of publicity claim against a comic book
publishing company. In TCI, Anthony "Tony" Twist, a hockey player, brought suit
against a number of individuals and entities involved in producing and publishing
the Spawn comic book series after the introduction of a villainous character named
Anthony "Tony Twist" Twistelli.
        In balancing Twist's property interests in his own name and identity against
the First Amendment interests of the comic book creators, the TCI court . . . .
applied what it called a "sort of predominant use test":
        If a product is being sold that predominantly exploits the commercial value
        of an individual's identity, that product should be held to violate the right of
        publicity and not be protected by the First Amendment, even if there is some
        `expressive' content in it that might qualify as `speech' in other
        circumstances. If, on the other hand, the predominant purpose of the
        product is to make an expressive comment on or about a celebrity, the
        expressive values could be given greater weight.

(quoting Mark S. Lee, Agents of Chaos: Judicial Confusion in Defining the Right of
Publicity-Free Speech Interface, 23 LOY. L.A. ENT. L. REV. 471, 500 (2003)). The TCI
court considered this to be a "more balanced balancing test [particularly for] cases
where speech is both expressive and commercial." After applying the test, the court
ruled for Twist, holding that "the metaphorical reference to Twist, though a literary
device, has very little literary value compared to its commercial value."

        We decline Appellant's invitation to adopt this test. By our reading, the
Predominant Use Test is subjective at best, arbitrary at worst, and in either case calls
upon judges to act as both impartial jurists and discerning art critics. These two
roles cannot co-exist. . . . Such reasoning, however, leads down a dangerous and

                                                    631
rightly-shunned road: adopting Appellant's suggested analysis would be tantamount
to admitting that it is proper for courts to analyze select elements of a work to
determine how much they contribute to the entire work's expressiveness. Moreover,
as a necessary (and insidious) consequence, the Appellant's approach would suppose
that there exists a broad range of seemingly expressive speech that has no First
Amendment value. . . .

                                    b. The Rogers Test
        The Rogers Test looks to the relationship between the celebrity image and the
work as a whole.17 As the following discussion demonstrates, however, adopting this
test would potentially immunize a broad swath of tortious activity. We therefore
reject the Rogers Test as inapposite in the instant case.

                         i. Origins and Scope of the Rogers Test
        Various commentators have noted that right of publicity claims--at least
those that address the use of a person's name or image in an advertisement--are
akin to trademark claims because in both instances courts must balance the interests
in protecting the relevant property right against the interest in free expression. It is
little wonder, then, that the inquiry championed by Appellee originated in a case
that also focused upon alleged violations of the trademark-specific Lanham Act.
Rogers v. Grimaldi, 875 F.2d 994 (2d Cir.1989).
        In that case, Ginger Rogers brought suit against the producers and
distributors of, Ginger and Fred, a film that was alleged to infringe on Rogers' right of
publicity and confuse consumers in violation of the Act. (Despite its title, the film
was not about either Ginger Rogers or Fred Astaire.) In analyzing the right of
publicity claim under Oregon law, the Second Circuit noted Oregon's "concern for
the protection of free expression," and held that Oregon would not "permit the
right of publicity to bar the use of a celebrity's name in a movie title unless the title
was wholly unrelated to the movie or was simply a disguised commercial
advertisement for the sale of goods or services." After applying this test, the Rogers
court concluded that the right of publicity claim merited dismissal because "the title
`Ginger and Fred' is clearly related to the content of the movie and is not a
disguised advertisement for the sale of goods and services or a collateral commercial
product."

          17 The various cases and scholarly sources refer to this test in three different ways: the Relatedness

Test, the Restatement Test, and the Rogers Test. The "Relatedness" moniker should be self-explanatory even

at this early point in our discussion; the propriety of the other two names will become clear shortly. For our

purposes, we will refer to the test as the Rogers Test.

                                                    632
        But while the test, as articulated in Rogers, arguably applied only to the use of
celebrity identity in a work's title, Appellee suggests that the test can--and should--
be applied more broadly. For support, Appellee looks to the Restatement (Third) of
Unfair Competition, released in 1995, which characterizes the tort as follows:

        One who appropriates the commercial value of a person's identity by using
        without consent the person's name, likeness, or other indicia of identity for
        purposes of trade is subject to liability for [appropriate relief].

RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF UNFAIR COMPETITION § 46. In explaining the
term "use for purposes of trade," the Restatement notes that it does not "ordinarily
include the use of a person's identity in news reporting, commentary,
entertainment, works of fiction or nonfiction, or in advertising that is incidental to
such uses." Id. § 47.

        Moreover, the comments to Section 47 of the Restatement also note that:
        [t]he right of publicity as recognized by statute and common law is
        fundamentally constrained by the public and constitutional interest in freedom of
        expression. The use of a person's identity primarily for purpose of
        communicating information or expressing ideas is not generally actionable as
        a violation of the person's right of publicity.... Thus the use of a person's
        name or likeness in news reporting, whether in newspapers, magazines, or
        broadcast news, does not infringe the right of publicity. The interest in
        freedom of expression also extends to use in entertainment and other
        creative works, including both fiction and nonfiction. The use of a celebrity's
        name or photograph as part of an article published in a fan magazine or in a
        feature story broadcast on an entertainment program, for example, will not
        infringe the celebrity's right of publicity. Similarly, the right of publicity is
        not infringed by the dissemination of an unauthorized print or broadcast
        biography. Use of another's identity in a novel, play, or motion picture is
        also not ordinarily an infringement.... However, if the name or likeness is used
        solely to attract attention to a work that is not related to the identified person, the
        user may be subject to liability for a use of the other's identity in advertising.

Id. at § 47 cmt. c (emphasis added). Appellee argues that the above language adopts
the Rogers Test and applies it to right of publicity claims dealing with any part of a
work, not only its title. . . .

                              ii. Analysis of the Rogers Test
        Ultimately, we find that the Rogers Test does not present the proper
analytical approach for cases such as the one at bar. While the Test may have a use
in trademark-like right of publicity cases, it is inapposite here. We are concerned

                                                    633
that this test is a blunt instrument, unfit for widespread application in cases that
require a carefully calibrated balancing of two fundamental protections: the right of
free expression and the right to control, manage, and profit from one's own
identity.

        The potential problem with applying the Rogers Test in this case is
demonstrated by the following statement from Appellee's brief:

        Because, as a former college football player, Hart's likeness is not `wholly
        unrelated' to NCAA Football and the game is not a commercial advertisement
        for some unrelated product, Hart ... does not try to meet the ... test.

(Appellee's Br. at 24.) Effectively, Appellee argues that Appellant should be unable
to assert a claim for appropriating his likeness as a football player precisely because
his likeness was used for a game about football. Adopting this line of reasoning
threatens to turn the right of publicity on its head.

        Appellant's career as a college football player suggests that the target
audience for his merchandise and performances (e.g., his actual matches) would be
sports fans. It is only logical, then, that products appropriating and exploiting his
identity would fare best--and thereby would provide ne'er-do-wells with the greatest
incentive--when targeted at the sports-fan market segment. Given that Appellant
played intercollegiate football, however, products targeting the sports-fan market
would, as a matter of course, relate to him. Yet under Appellee's approach, all such
uses would be protected. It cannot be that the very activity by which Appellant
achieved his renown now prevents him from protecting his hard-won celebrity. We
decline to endorse such a conclusion and therefore reject the Rogers test as
inapplicable.

         On the other hand, we do agree with the Rogers court in so far as it noted
that the right of publicity does not implicate the potential for consumer confusion
and is therefore potentially broader than the protections offered by the Lanham
Act. Indeed, therein lies the weakness of comparing the right of publicity to
trademark protections: the right of publicity is broader and, by extension, protects a
greater swath of property interests. Thus, it would be unwise for us to adopt a test
that hews so closely to traditional trademark principles. Instead, we need a broader,
more nuanced test, which helps balance the interests at issue in cases such as the
one at bar. The final test--the Transformative Use Test--provides just such an
approach.

                               c. The Transformative Use Test
        Looking to intellectual property law for guidance on how to balance property
interests against the First Amendment has merit. We need only shift our gaze away
from trademark, to the broader vista of copyright law. Thus, we come to the case of

                                                    634
Comedy III Prods., Inc. v. Gary Saderup, Inc., which imported the concept of
"transformative" use from copyright law into the right of publicity context. 106
Cal.Rptr.2d 126 (2001). . . .

                         i. Genesis of the Transformative Use Test
        The Transformative Use Test was first articulated by the Supreme Court of
California in Comedy III. That case concerned an artist's production and sale of t-
shirts and prints bearing a charcoal drawing of the Three Stooges. The California
court determined that while "[t]he right of publicity is often invoked in the context
of commercial speech," it could also apply in instances where the speech is merely
expressive. The court also noted, however, that when addressing expressive speech,
"the very importance of celebrities in society means that the right of publicity has
the potential of censoring significant expression by suppressing alternative versions
of celebrity images that are iconoclastic, irreverent or otherwise attempt to redefine
the celebrity's meaning." Thus, while the "the right of publicity cannot, consistent
with the First Amendment, be a right to control the celebrity's image by censoring
disagreeable portrayals," the right, like copyright, nonetheless offers protection to a
form of intellectual property that society deems to have social utility.
        After briefly considering whether to import the "fair use" analysis from
copyright, the Comedy III court decided that only the first fair use factor, "the
purpose and character of the use," was appropriate. Specifically, the Comedy III court
found persuasive the Supreme Court's holding in Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.
that
        the central purpose of the inquiry into this fair use factor `is to see ...
        whether the new work merely "supercede[s] the objects" of the original
        creation, or instead adds something new, with a further purpose or different
        character, altering the first with new expression, meaning, or message; it asks,
        in other words, whether and to what extent the new work is "transformative."

        Going further, the court explained that works containing "significant
transformative elements" are less likely to interfere with the economic interests
implicated by the right of publicity. For example, "works of parody or other
distortions of the celebrity figure are not, from the celebrity fan's viewpoint, good
substitutes for conventional depictions of the celebrity and therefore do not
generally threaten markets for celebrity memorabilia that the right of publicity is
designed to protect." The court was also careful to emphasize that "the
transformative elements or creative contributions" in a work may include--under
the right circumstances--factual reporting, fictionalized portrayal, heavy-handed
lampooning, and subtle social criticism. ("The inquiry is in a sense more

                                                    635
quantitative than qualitative, asking whether the literal and imitative or the creative
elements predominate in the work.").

         Restating its newly-articulated test, the Supreme Court of California held
that the balance between the right of publicity and First Amendment interests turns
on

        [w]hether the celebrity likeness is one of the "raw materials" from which an
        original work is synthesized, or whether the depiction or imitation of the
        celebrity is the very sum and substance of the work in question. We ask, in
        other words, whether the product containing a celebrity's likeness is so transformed
        that it has become primarily the defendant's own expression rather than the celebrity's
        likeness. And when we use the word "expression," we mean expression of
        something other than the likeness of the celebrity.

(emphasis added).

        Applying this test, the court concluded that charcoal portraits of the Three
Stooges did violate the Stooges' rights of publicity, holding that the court could
"discern no significant transformative or creative contribution" and that "the
marketability and economic value of [the work] derives primarily from the fame of
the celebrities depicted."

                     ii. Application of the Transformative Use Test
        Given its relative recency, few courts have applied the Transformative Use
Test, and consequently there is not a significant body of case law related to its
application. Nonetheless, a handful of cases bear mention as they help frame our
inquiry.
        In 2003, the Supreme Court of California revisited the Transformative Use
Test when two musicians, Johnny and Edgar Winter, who both possessed long
white hair and albino features, brought suit against a comic book company over
images of two villainous half-man, half-worm creatures, both with long white hair
and albino features, named Johnny and Edgar Autumn. Winter v. DC Comics, 134
Cal.Rptr.2d 634 (2003). As the brothers' right of publicity claims necessarily
implicated DC Comics' First Amendment rights, the Winter court looked to the
Transformative Use Test. In summarizing the test, the court explained that "[a]n
artist depicting a celebrity must contribute something more than a `merely trivial'
variation, [but must create] something recognizably `his own,' in order to qualify for
legal protection." Thus, in applying the test, the Winter court held that
        [a]lthough the fictional characters Johnny and Edgar Autumn are less-than-
        subtle evocations of Johnny and Edgar Winter, the books do not depict
        plaintiffs literally. Instead, plaintiffs are merely part of the raw materials from

                                                    636
        which the comic books were synthesized. To the extent the drawings of the
        Autumn brothers resemble plaintiffs at all, they are distorted for purposes of
        lampoon, parody, or caricature. And the Autumn brothers are but cartoon
        characters--half-human and half-worm--in a larger story, which is itself quite
        expressive.

        The court therefore found that "fans who want to purchase pictures of [the
Winter brothers] would find the drawing of the Autumn brothers unsatisfactory as a
substitute for conventional depictions." Consequently, the court rejected the
brothers' claims for a right of publicity violation. . . .

                      iv. Analysis of the Transformative Use Test

         Like the Predominant Use and Rogers tests, the Transformative Use Test aims

to balance the interest protected by the right of publicity against those interests

preserved by the First Amendment. In our view, the Transformative Use Test

appears to strike the best balance because it provides courts with a flexible--yet

uniformly applicable--analytical framework. Specifically, the Transformative Use

Test seems to excel precisely where the other two tests falter. Unlike the Rogers Test,

the Transformative Use Test maintains a singular focus on whether the work

sufficiently transforms the celebrity's identity or likeness, thereby allowing courts to

account for the fact that misappropriation can occur in any market segment,

including those related to the celebrity.
        On the other hand, unlike the Predominant Use Test, applying the

Transformative Use Test requires a more circumscribed inquiry, focusing on the
specific aspects of a work that speak to whether it was merely created to exploit a
celebrity's likeness. This test therefore recognizes that if First Amendment
protections are to mean anything in right of publicity claims, courts must begin by
considering the extent to which a work is the creator's own expression. . . .

                                         C. Application
        In applying the Transformative Use Test to the instant case, we must
determine whether Appellant's identity is sufficiently transformed in NCAA
Football. As we mentioned earlier, we use the term "identity" to encompass not only
Appellant's likeness, but also his biographical information. It is the combination of
these two parts--which, when combined, identify the digital avatar as an in-game
recreation of Appellant--that must be sufficiently transformed.
        Having thus cabined our inquiry to the appropriate form of Appellant's
identity, we note that--based on the combination of both the digital avatar's
appearance and the biographical and identifying information--the digital avatar
does closely resemble the genuine article. Not only does the digital avatar match
Appellant in terms of hair color, hair style and skin tone, but the avatar's accessories

                                                    637
mimic those worn by Appellant during his time as a Rutgers player. The
information, as has already been noted, also accurately tracks Appellant's vital and
biographical details. And while the inexorable march of technological progress may
make some of the graphics in earlier editions of NCAA Football look dated or overly-
computerized, we do not believe that video game graphics must reach (let alone
cross) the uncanny valley to support a right of publicity claim. If we are to find some
transformative element, we must look somewhere other than just the in-game digital
recreation of Appellant.39. . .

        Considering the context within which the digital avatar exists--effectively,
looking at how Appellant's identity is "incorporated into and transformed by"
NCAA Football, (Dissent Op.)--provides little support for Appellee's arguments.
The digital Ryan Hart does what the actual Ryan Hart did while at Rutgers: he plays
college football, in digital recreations of college football stadiums, filled with all the
trappings of a college football game. This is not transformative; the various digitized
sights and sounds in the video game do not alter or transform the Appellant's
identity in a significant way. . . .

         Even here, however, our inquiry is not at an end. For as much as the digital
representation and context evince no meaningful transformative element in NCAA
Football, a third avatar-specific element is also present: the users' ability to alter the
avatar's appearance. . . . We must therefore consider to what extent the ability to
alter a digital avatar represents a transformative use of Appellant's identity.

         At the outset, we note that the mere presence of this feature, without more,
cannot satisfy the Transformative Use Test. True, interactivity is the basis upon
which First Amendment protection is granted to video games in the first instance.
See Brown, 131 S.Ct. at 2733. However, the balancing test in right of publicity cases
does not look to whether a particular work loses First Amendment protection.
Rather, the balancing inquiry looks to see whether the interests protected by the
right of publicity are sufficient to surmount the already-existing First Amendment
protections. . . .

        . . . . [W]e consider whether the type and extent of interactivity permitted is
sufficient to transform the Appellant's likeness into the Appellee's own expression.
We hold that it does not.

          39 It is no answer to say that digitizing Appellant's appearance in and of itself works a transformative

use. Recreating a celebrity's likeness or identity in some medium other than photographs or video cannot,

without more, satisfy the test; this would turn the inquiry on its head--and would contradict the very basis for

the Transformative Use Test.

                                                    638
        In NCAA Football, Appellee seeks to create a realistic depiction of college
football for the users. Part of this realism involves generating realistic
representations of the various college teams--which includes the realistic
representations of the players. . . . Appellee seeks to capitalize on the respective fan
bases for the various teams and players. . . . Moreover, the realism of the games--
including the depictions and recreations of the players--appeals not just to home-
team fans, but to bitter rivals as well. Games such as NCAA Football permit users to
recreate the setting of a bitter defeat and, in effect, achieve some cathartic
readjustment of history; realistic depictions of the players are a necessary element to
this. . . . Given that Appellant's unaltered likeness is central to the core of the game
experience, we are disinclined to credit users' ability to alter the digital avatars in
our application of the Transformative Use Test to this case.

        We are likewise unconvinced that NCAA Football satisfies the Transformative
Use Test because Appellee created various in-game assets to support the altered
avatars (e.g., additional hair styles, faces, accessories, et al.). In the first instance, the
relationship between these assets and the digital avatar is predicated on the users'
desire to alter the avatar's appearance, which, as we have already noted, is
insufficient to satisfy the Test. The ability to make minor alterations--which
substantially maintain the avatar's resemblance to Appellant (e.g., modifying only
the basic biographical information, playing statistics, or uniform accessories)--is
likewise insufficient, for "[a]n artist depicting a celebrity must contribute something
more than a `merely trivial' variation." Winter, 134 Cal.Rptr.2d 634. Indeed, the
ability to modify the avatar counts for little where the appeal of the game lies in
users' ability to play "as, or alongside" their preferred players or team. Thus, even
avatars with superficial modifications to their appearance can count as a suitable
proxy or market "substitute" for the original. For larger potential changes, such as a
different body type, skin tone, or face, Appellant's likeness is not transformed; it
simply ceases to be. Therefore, once a user has made major changes to the avatar, it
no longer represents Appellant, and thus it no longer qualifies as a "use" of the
Appellant's identity for purposes of our inquiry. Such possibilities therefore fall
beyond our inquiry into how Appellant's likeness is used in NCAA Football. That the
game may lend itself to uses wholly divorced from the appropriation of Appellant's
identity is insufficient to satisfy the Transformative Use Test.

        In an attempt to salvage its argument, Appellee suggests that other creative
elements of NCAA Football, which do not affect Appellant's digital avatar, are so
numerous that the videogames should be considered transformative. We believe this
to be an improper inquiry. Decisions applying the Transformative Use Test
invariably look to how the celebrity's identity is used in or is altered by other aspects

                                                    639
of a work. Wholly unrelated elements do not bear on this inquiry. Even Comedy III,
in listing potentially "transformative or creative contributions" focused on elements
or techniques that affect the celebrity identity. To the extent that any of these cases
considered the broader context of the work (e.g., whether events took place in a
"fanciful setting"), this inquiry was aimed at determining whether this context acted
upon the celebrity identity in a way that transformed it or imbued it with some
added creativity beyond providing a "merely trivial variation." Thus, while we
recognize the creative energies necessary for crafting the various elements of NCAA
Football that are not tied directly to reality, we hold that they have no legal
significance in our instant decision.

        To hold otherwise could have deleterious consequences for the state of the
law. Acts of blatant misappropriation would count for nothing so long as the larger
work, on balance, contained highly creative elements in great abundance. This
concern is particularly acute in the case of media that lend themselves to easy
partition such as video games. It cannot be that content creators escape liability for
a work that uses a celebrity's unaltered identity in one section but that contains a
wholly fanciful creation in the other, larger section.

        For these reasons, we hold that the broad application of the Transformative
Use Test represents an inappropriate application of the standard. Consequently, we
shall not credit elements of NCAA Football that do not, in some way, affect the use
or meaning of Appellant's identity.

         As a final point, we note that the photograph of Appellant that appears in
NCAA Football 2009 does not bear on our analysis above. On that subject, we
agree with the District Court that the photograph is "but a fleeting component part
of the montage" and therefore does not render the entire work
nontransformative. . . .

                                        IV. Conclusion
        We therefore hold that the NCAA Football 2004, 2005 and 2006 games at
issue in this case do not sufficiently transform Appellant's identity to escape the
right of publicity claim and hold that the District Court erred in granted summary
judgment in favor of Appellee. . . .

AMBRO, Circuit Judge, dissenting.
        . . . . Were this case viewed strictly on the public's perception of fairness, I

have no doubt Hart's position would prevail.2 . . .

(lambasting NCAA "amateurism" and "student-athlete" policies as "legalistic confections propagated by the

                                                    640
        To determine whether an individual's identity has been "transformed" for
purposes of the Transformative Use Test, I believe it is necessary to review the
likeness in the context of the work in its entirety, rather than focusing only on the
individual's likeness. . . .

        The infirmity of [the majority's] approach is highlighted by ETW Corp. v. Jireh
Publishing, Inc., 332 F.3d 915 (6th Cir.2003), in which the Sixth Circuit Court of
Appeals concluded that an artist's use of several photographs of Tiger Woods in a
commemorative collage was "transformative," and thus shielded from Woods' right-
of-publicity suit. My colleagues do not--and, in my view, cannot--explain how the
photographic images of Woods were transformed if they limit their analysis to "how
the celebrity's identity is used." . . .

        To me, a narrow focus on an individual's likeness, rather than how that
likeness is incorporated into and transformed by the work as a whole, is a flawed
formulation of the transformative inquiry. The whole--the aggregate of many parts
(including, here, many individuals)--is the better baseline for that inquiry. . . .

        Transformative use must mesh with existing constitutional protections for
works of expression. The First Amendment extends protection to biographies,
documentaries, docudramas, and other expressive works depicting real-life figures,
whether the accounts are factual or fictional. . . .

        The protection afforded by the First Amendment to those who weave
celebrities into their creative works and sell those works for profit applies equally to
video games. See Brown v. Entm't Merchs. Ass'n, 131 S.Ct. 2729, 2733 (2011). Thus
EA's use of real-life likenesses as "characters" in its NCAA Football video game
should be as protected as portrayals (fictional or nonfictional) of individuals in
movies and books. I do not suggest that all digital portrayals of an individual are
entitled to First Amendment protection. Rather, the work should be protected if
that likeness, as included in the creative composition, has been transformed into
something more or different than what it was before. And in any event the profit
that flows from EA's realistic depiction of Hart (and the myriad other college

universities so they can exploit the skills and fame of young athletes," and discussing lawsuits challenging
these policies); see also Alexander Wolff, When Worlds Collide, Sports Illustrated, Feb. 11, 2013, at 18; Joe
Nocera, Pay Up Now, N.Y. Times Mag., Jan. 1, 2012, at 30-35 (advocating payment of college athletes to
alleviate "[t]he hypocrisy that permeates big-money college sports" arising from amateurism rules).

football players portrayed in NCAA Football ) is not constitutionally significant, nor
even an appropriate consideration, when applying the Transformative Use Test.7

        My colleagues' understanding of the Transformative Use Test underplays the
creative elements of NCAA Football by equating its inclusion of realistic player
likenesses to increase profits with the wrongful appropriation of Hart's commercial
value. This approach is at odds with the First Amendment protection afforded to
expressive works incorporating real-life figures. That protection does not depend on
whether the characters are depicted realistically or whether their inclusion increases
profits. See Guglielmi, 160 Cal.Rptr. 352, 603 P.2d at 460-62 (Bird, C.J., concurring)
(concluding that acceptance of this argument would chill free expression and mean
"the creation of historical novels and other works inspired by actual events and
people would be off limits to the fictional author").

        In sum, applying the Transformative Use Test in the manner done by my
colleagues creates a medium-specific metric that provides less protection to video
games than other expressive works. Because the Supreme Court's decision in Brown
forecloses just such a distinction, see 131 S.Ct. at 2740, my colleagues' treatment of
realism and profitability in their transformative use analysis puts us on a different
course. . . .

        With this understanding of the Transformative Use Test, I conclude EA's
use of avatars resembling actual players is entitled to First Amendment protection.
NCAA Football transforms Hart's mere likeness into an avatar that, along with the
rest of a digitally created college football team, users can direct and manipulate in
fictional football games. With the many other creative features incorporated

          7 In devising the Transformative Use Test, the California Supreme Court borrowed from "the
purpose and character of the use" factor relevant to a copyright fair use defense, see 17 U.S.C. § 107(1), yet it
rejected "a wholesale importation of the fair use doctrine into right of publicity law," Comedy III, 106
Cal.Rptr.2d 126, 21 P.3d at 807. Nonetheless, it appears my colleagues permit another fair use factor to
creep into their transformative analysis. Namely, their focus on the marketability of NCAA Football seems
colored by the factor considering "the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the
copyrighted work," see 17 U.S.C. § 107(4), notwithstanding that this element was expressly excluded from
Comedy III's articulation of the Transformative Use Test, see 106 Cal.Rptr.2d 126, 21 P.3d at 808 n. 10.
Further, even if consideration of "market effect" were appropriate in a transformative analysis, I do not
believe this factor would weigh in favor of finding an infringing use here because . . . there is no contention
that EA's inclusion of Hart's likeness in NCAA Football has caused a decline in the commercial value of his
identity or persona.

                                                    642
throughout the games, sufficient expressive transformation takes place to merit First
Amendment protection.

        NCAA Football involves myriad original graphics, videos, sound effects, and
game scenarios. These artistic aspects permit a user to direct the play of a college
football team whose players may be based on a current roster, a past roster, or an
entirely imaginary roster comprised of made-up players. Users are not reenacting
real games, but rather are directing the avatars in invented games and seasons.
Further, the "Campus Legend" and "Dynasty Mode" features permit users to
control virtual players and teams for multiple seasons, creating the means by which
they can generate their own narratives. Such modes of interactive play are, I submit,
imaginative transformations of the games played by real players.

        As noted by the District Court, it is not only the user that contributes to the
interactivity; EA has created "multiple permutations available for each virtual player
image." This furthers the game's transformative interactivity. . . .

        By limiting their inquiry to the realistic rendering of Hart's individual image,
my colleagues misapply the Transformative Use Test. Contrary to their assertion
that the other creative elements of NCAA Football are "[w]holly unrelated", those
elements are, in fact, related to EA's use of Hart's likeness. If and when a user
decides to select the virtual 2005 Rutgers' football team as a competitor in a game,
and to the extent that user does not alter the characteristics of the avatar based on
Hart's likeness, the numerous creative elements of the video games discussed above
are part of every fictional play a user calls. Any attempt to separate these elements
from the use of Hart's likeness disregards NCAA Football's many expressive features
beyond an avatar having characteristics similar to Hart. His likeness is transformed
by the artistry necessary to create a digitally rendered avatar within the imaginative
and interactive world EA has placed that avatar.

        I am thus convinced that, as used in NCAA Football, Hart's "likeness is one
of the `raw materials' from which [the] original work is synthesized ... [rather than]
the very sum and substance of the work in question." Comedy III, 106 Cal.Rptr.2d
126, 21 P.3d at 809. EA bases its NCAA Football characters on countless real-life
college football players, and it certainly seeks to depict their physical and
biographical characteristics realistically. Yet these "are not just conventional
depictions of [Hart] but contain significant expressive content other than [his] mere
likeness[ ]." Winter, 134 Cal.Rptr.2d 634, 69 P.3d at 479. NCAA Football uses
creative means to achieve its overall goal of realistically replicating a college football
experience in which users may interact, direct, and control the players' avatars,
including the one based on Hart's likeness. I find this use transformative.

        The Transformative Use Test I support would prevent commercial
exploitation of an individual's likeness where the work at issue lacks creative
contribution that transforms that likeness in a meaningful way. I sympathize with the
position of Hart and other similarly situated college football players, and understand
why they feel it is fair to share in the significant profits produced by including their
avatar likenesses into EA's commercially successful video game franchise. I
nonetheless remain convinced that the creative components of NCAA Football
contain sufficient expressive transformation to merit First Amendment protection.
Thus I respectfully dissent, and would affirm the District Court's grant of summary
judgment in favor of EA.

        1. After Michael Jordan was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame,
the grocery retailer Jewell Osco produced the following ad:

                The text reads:
        After six NBA Championships, scores of rewritten record books and
        numerous buzzer beaters, Michael Jordan's elevation in the Basketball Hall
        of Fame was never in doubt! Jewel-Osco salutes #23 on his many
        accomplishments as we honor a fellow Chicagoan who was `just around the
        corner' for so many years.

        Does the ad violate Jordan's right of publicity?
        2. Wheel of Fortune is a long-running game show in which contestants try
to guess sentences and phrases based on a limited amount of revealed letters (e.g., if
a contestant correctly guesses that the letter "D" appears in the puzzle, all the Ds will
be revealed throughout the problem phrase). Vanna White is one of the co-stars of
the show. She is the one who incrementally reveals letters in the puzzle.
        Samsung is an electronics company. In an effort to claim that its products
will stand the test of time, it produced an ad campaign built around the conceit that
things will be different in the future, but Samsung's products will remain the choice
of consumers. The campaign ran in the late 1980s and produced the following
image. It evokes Wheel of Fortune and suggests that in 2012, Vanna White's part
would be played by a robot.

        It's amusing in retrospect how wrong the campaign was. In 2012, Vanna
White was still on the show, and the VCR was a largely obsolete technology. As the
saying goes, predictions are hard, especially about the future. But does the campaign
infringe White's right of publicity?
