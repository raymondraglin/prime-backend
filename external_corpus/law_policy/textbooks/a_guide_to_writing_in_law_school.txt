 Introduction

  This book is intended to help law students to develop their writing skills. Writing clearly and
  effectively is a vital legal skill. Lawyers use this skill daily. Law graduates need, therefore, to have
  a solid competency in clear and effective writing. Even if you do not become a lawyer or do not
  want to become a lawyer, the skill of writing is still a valuable asset in many professions and types
  of work.

  Unfortunately, many students enter law school with notable weaknesses in this area. Indeed, for many
  students, poor writing is the main problem holding them back from attaining higher grades. The good
  news is that, with effort and practice, virtually everyone can improve their writing. If you invest time
  in working on improving your writing, it will repay you.

  There are certainly other skills that law students need to develop, but writing well remains at the core.
  Law students who develop good writing skills early in their law studies - and continue to hone them
  throughout their course - will be laying a valuable foundation for their legal careers.

  This book aims to help students improve their writing by presenting various pieces of advice, tips,
  warnings and encouragement. Once you master the basic ideas behind clear writing, you will know
  when and how to adapt them and even diverge from them when appropriate. Of course, this guide is
  not only for students experiencing difficulty in communicating effectively. Those who already write
  well will find ideas here that will help them become even better writers.

  Legal writing is infamous for its frequently complex sentence structure and obscure vocabulary.
  Unfortunately, many students seem to feel that they must emulate this if they are to `sound like
  a lawyer'. This is not true. Good legal writing is clear and effective, rather than ostentatious or
  rhetorical. Since the 1970s, the legal profession has made a concerted effort to promote the use of
  plain English in legal writing.

  In 1987, the Law Reform Commission of Victoria (as it was then called) published its report Plain
  English and the Law. The Commission gave this succinct overview of `Plain English':

        `Plain English' involves the use of plain, straightforward language which ... conveys its meaning
        as clearly and simply as possible, without unnecessary pretension or embellishment. It is to be
        contrasted with convoluted, repetitive and prolix language. The adoption of a plain English style
        demands simply that a document be written in a style which readily conveys its message to its
        audience. However, plain English is not concerned simply with the forms of language. Because
        its theme is communication, it calls for improvements in the organisation of the material and the
        method by which it is presented. It requires that material is presented in a sequence which the
        audience would expect and which helps the audience absorb the information.1

  It would be a mistake, however, to think that plain English writing will solve all problems. As Justice
  Tadgell, of the Supreme Court of Victoria, once observed, `Plain English alone achieves nothing. To
  be useful it must run in tandem with clear thought.'2 Good legal writing, then, aims to be clear in

both expression and thought. This not only helps the legal writer to meet the needs of their audience;
it also helps the legal writer to achieve their own purpose in writing to that audience.

The first four chapters of this book give general advice on writing in law school, and then chapters
5 through to 8 provide advice on specific kinds of writing tasks that you will be asked to perform in
law school.

Chapter 1 gives some general advice on what you need to know before you start writing: who you
are, who your audience is, what your subject matter is, and what your task is. It is vital to understand
these four things to deliver what your writing task requires.

Chapter 2 discusses the importance of planning your document. Many students produce weak
documents, or cause themselves unnecessary delays, because of a failure to plan.

Chapter 3 provides practical advice about the task of writing itself. Sentences are the building blocks
of all written documents, and this chapter gives advice on how to construct clear and connected
sentences. It also stresses the importance of reviewing and revising your document as part of the
writing process.

Chapter 4 provides guidance on how to reference your work properly and avoid plagiarism. This is
an essential part of maintaining academic integrity in your work.

Chapter 5 provides a guide to writing case briefs. Case briefs are a kind of expository or informative
writing. Such writing seeks primarily to inform its audience about something, neutrally and
objectively. In case briefs, the task is to summarise the key elements of a legal case so that the
audience can understand its basic legal significance.

Chapter 6 focuses on legal problem-solving, which is where you are asked to apply the law to a given
set of facts to work out the legal position of one or more of the people appearing in the scenario.
This is perhaps the most common type of written task you will perform in law school. It usually
constitutes the major part of the assessment in `black-letter law' subjects, such as criminal law, torts
and contracts.

Chapter 7 provides advice on writing essays, another very common form of assessment in law school.
Essays usually require you to present a persuasive argument in favour of a position, not simply
inform your audience about some facts.

Chapter 8 looks briefly at law reform submissions. You may sometimes be asked in law school to
write a law reform submission. This is a submission to an inquiry or law reform body in which you
present recommendations for how and why the law should change or indeed remain unchanged. This
writing task is very similar to writing an essay, but it has a more specific focus and is more readily
aligned with what you will encounter in the real world outside the academy.

                                                          DISCLAIMER

       This book is only a general guide. In any specific piece of writing in a particular law subject, you
       must always ensure that you follow the assessment instructions from the subject coordinator. In
       particular, pay close attention to the assessment criteria applicable to any specific piece of
                                                                                                                                                       3

assessment. This book contains general advice intended to supplement those specific instructions,
but the instructions for your specific subject must take precedence in any given case. You need,
therefore, to use this book with due caution.
Also, this book is not intended to contain any reliable expositions of the law. All examples of laws
provided in this book are purely for illustrative purposes and do not purport to be accurate
statements of the law.

Chapter 1: What you need to know before you start
writing

1.1 Introduction

In law school you will be asked to write various kinds of documents, including legal advice,
academic essays, legislative provisions, law reform submissions, ministerial briefings, legal
documents (such as contracts and wills), and so on. Each will require a different approach and you
may find yourself overwhelmed by the different tasks, but if you follow the advice in this guide,
you will soon get the hang of what you need to do. In any event, and regardless of what you have
been asked to write, if you ask yourself these four very important foundational questions about your
writing task before you start, your task will be much more manageable:

       1. Who am I, as the author of this document?
       2. Who is my audience?
       3. What is my purpose in writing this document?
       4. What am I writing about?
The more clearly you understand your role, audience, purpose and subject matter, and how they
interrelate, the better you will understand your task. This will in turn help you choose the most
appropriate forms of language. Note that there is not just one form of legal writing. Different
tasks can involve different styles of writing. In all tasks, however, it is crucial to write clearly and
effectively.
This chapter will cover:
          knowing your role and audience
          knowing your purpose
          knowing your subject matter
          the importance of drafts.

                                                                  4
                                                                                                                                                                5

1.2 Know your role and audience

Among the roles you might play as a writer in law school are solicitor, barrister, judge, public servant,
law reform commissioner, representative of a professional organisation or a lobby group, or academic
researcher. Sometimes you will also just be asked to write as yourself, a private citizen. In each of
these roles you will have a different perspective, reflecting the function you are fulfilling in that role.
This can shape how you write your document.
Knowing your audience is equally important. You might be writing for lawyers, clients, judges,
government ministers, law reform commissioners or the general public. The identity and nature of
your audience can have a very significant effect on how you should write your document and will
help you decide when to use clear, simple language or more technical language to make your work
most effective.

                                                                  5

1.3 Know your purpose in writing

When you write a document addressed to a particular audience, you will have a particular purpose.
For example, when studying criminal law, you may be asked to play the role of a newly qualified
solicitor writing a memorandum to one of the partners of your firm, informing them of the strength
of the prosecution case against your client who has been charged with the criminal offence of use
of a drug of dependence. How you write this memorandum will be different from how you, as a
representative of a lobby group, would write a submission to the government urging the creation of
supervised drug-injecting centres.

While there are various specific purposes in writing documents, there are, generally speaking, two
basic kinds of purpose you might have when writing a document: informing your audience about
something or persuading your audience to do something. It is possible, and indeed quite common,
for a document to do both, but they are still distinct purposes.

1.3.1 Informative writing

The goal of informative writing is to give the reader information about some particular subject matter.
The task is simply to provide that information so that the reader can gain an understanding of the
subject matter. Neutrality and objectivity are usually important features of such writing; it is not
designed to convince the reader of a particular view, just to inform.

Very often in law school (and in legal contexts more broadly), you will be asked to inform your
audience about a particular text or document, such as a judge's decision in a legal case, a statutory
provision, a law reform inquiry report, or an academic journal article or book. Informing your
audience about what was said in the `target' document can be described as an expository or
interpretive task.

Expository writing
Expository writing is a particular kind of informative writing which expounds - or lays out - another
piece of writing. It must be accurate and fair to that other writer or document and enable the audience
to have an accurate and reliable understanding of that other document without having to read it
themselves.

Key generic questions to address when planning your expository writing include:

          What is the purpose of the writer I am to expound?
          What question or issue is their document addressing?
          Who is the intended audience of the writer?
          What is the structure of the document, and how does that structure fit its purpose?
          What positions does the writer take on the relevant issues?
          What arguments does the writer put forward for their position?
          What is central or essential in the document and what is peripheral or inessential?

                                                                  6
                                                                                                                                                                7

Importantly, in expository writing, you do not critique, judge or evaluate what the author wrote or
give your own views on the topic. It is similar to a `comprehension' exercise, but with an important
difference. You are not just showing how much you know. Instead, you are creating a document that
enables someone else to understand the text you are expounding. This is an essential legal skill that
sounds simple but can be quite challenging.

For example, imagine you are a first-year solicitor in a large law firm and one of the partners has
asked you to write for her a two-page memorandum summarising yesterday's 86-page High Court
decision on insider trading. She does not want a document that shows her that you understand the
case. She wants a short document that will enable her to understand the essence of the case in three
minutes.

                                                 TIP: READ THREE TIMES

       Read or skim the document you are expounding at least three times. The first time, just read it to
       get an idea of what you are working with. On the second reading, highlight key words or passages
       and make some notes as you go. It is not until the third reading that you should really start to think
       about how you can expound the contents.
       Once you have read the document three times, you will be in a better position to ask yourself the
       key question your exposition will need to answer: what exactly does my reader need to know from
       the original document?

When reading the original document, do not just look for key words to restate in your piece. Quoting
a text is not expounding it. You need to explain what the document means, not reproduce the best
bits of it. Sometimes selective quotation of small passages may be appropriate, but do not overdo it.
The best expository writing will have minimal quotations. Some may have none at all. Ultimately, if
you capture the essence of the original document and put it in your own words in a way that helps
your reader to understand it, you will have drafted a good exposition.

1.3.2 Persuasive writing

In contrast, persuasive writing, as the name suggests, seeks to persuade or convince the reader to
agree with what the writer is saying. The writer wants to convince the audience of something and is,
therefore, not taking a neutral stance in relation to the subject matter. There is often some issue to be
decided or a problem to be solved, and the writer is seeking to persuade the audience that the best
or preferred way of deciding the issue or solving the problem is what the writer is putting forward
as the answer. This means that the writer must take a clear position, rather than neutrally describing
positions that may be put forward by others.

As you can see, this is different to informative/expository writing and is sometimes described as
critical or argumentative writing. `Critical' in this context does not mean that the writing simply
seeks to say negative things about something. Rather, it is more a matter of a careful, reasoned
analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of some position in order to reach a decision about it. What
the writer seeks to do is persuade the reader that the analysis and argument put forward justify the
decision or judgment expressed.
8

Similarly, `argumentative' here does not mean quarrelsome, belligerent or rude. It means that the
writing puts forward logical arguments, or reasons, for its conclusions. In this context, an argument
is a set of statements that are logically related such that the earlier statements (the premises) provide
logical support for the concluding statement. The support may make the conclusion certain (in the
case of deductive arguments) or make the conclusion more likely to be true (in the case of inductive
arguments). (See Chapter 7 for more on arguments.)

                           TIP: USE ARGUMENT AND EVIDENCE, NOT EMOTIONS
       In law, the means of persuasion should be reasoned argument and evidence, and not appeals to
       prejudice or emotional manipulation. Plenty of other kinds of persuasive writing (such as
       advertising or political election speeches) can adopt emotional rhetoric, but persuasive writing in
       law should only ever be reasoned and supported with evidence.

While it is true that to persuade one must also inform, there is a clear distinction between the goals
of informative writing versus persuasive writing. If you identify the type of writing you need to do at
the outset and apply the principles discussed in this section, your task will be much easier.
                                                                                                                                                                9

1.4 Know your subject matter

1.4.1 Knowing your subject and writing clearly about it are connected

Whenever you write in a particular role, to a particular person and for a particular purpose, you will
also be writing about something. That is your subject matter. When you have a solid grasp of your
subject matter, your next task is to write about that subject clearly and effectively. If you do not know
what you are talking about, then clear writing will not help you, and bad writing will only exacerbate
your problem.
There is, of course, a direct connection between understanding some subject matter and being able
to write clearly about it: it is easier to write clearly about a topic if you are able to think clearly
about it, and vice versa. So, the process of writing (and revising your writing) about a topic will very
often help you develop your understanding of the subject matter, and, in turn, as your understanding
deepens, your writing on that topic should also improve.

1.4.2 The importance of research

When you receive any writing task in law school, ask yourself:

      What do I need to know about this subject matter in order to do the job?

Then ask:

      What do I already know about it, and what do I need to find out?

The first question is about getting your bearings. The second question is all about research, which is
an essential component of most writing tasks. Often you will find that, as you do the research, you
do not know as much as you thought, or your focus needs to be on different things than what you
originally thought. So, research is an ongoing, dynamic and evolving activity.
For some writing tasks, such research will be extensive. For other writing tasks, not much more may
be needed than what you already know or what you have already covered in class. It will depend on
the task. Exactly what research steps are needed in any particular case will vary. (This book is not a
guide to how to conduct research in law school, but a few pointers are given in Chapter 2 and Chapter
3.)

                                                                  9
10

1.5 The importance of drafts

The writing quality in your first draft will never be the best you can deliver. This is partially because
you may still be working out your thoughts when you first start writing, and your priority is getting
words on the page. But if you have a firm grasp of the subject matter you are writing on, it will be
significantly easier to write a good first draft.

                                     TIP: NEVER SUBMIT YOUR FIRST DRAFT
       The way to improve the quality of your writing is by generating several drafts of your work. In
       other words, never submit your first draft. Always review and rewrite your work a few times
       before submission. You will be glad you did.

                                                                 10
                                                                                                                                                              11

Chapter 2: Planning your document

2.1 Introduction

Once you know your role, audience, purpose and subject matter, you need to plan your document.
Planning involves identifying the key tasks your document will perform in order to achieve its overall
purpose and working out a suitable structure for your document. These are really two sides of the
same coin: the different parts of the document should be identifiable mainly through the distinct
tasks they perform. This means that when you plan your document, you should first work out your
document's purpose, and then work out what are the most appropriate steps to take to achieve the
purpose. Those steps can then form the main sections or parts of your document.

                                                     TIP: PLAN TO PLAN
       Always start with a plan.
       A plan helps you to ensure that all important topics are covered and that they are covered in a
       logical order. It can also help you to avoid repetition and to avoid writing too many words or too
       few. Good planning also shortens the time you will need later to revise and edit your document.

This chapter will cover:
          the importance of structure
          using distinct sections
          using distinct paragraphs
          using headings and signposting
          creating effective introductions
          the value of distinct conclusions.

                                                                 11
12

2.2 The importance of structure

Good structure can make a document significantly more readable. Structure is all about making
the different parts of the document work together to enable the document to achieve its goal. Each
sentence in the document should be clearly constructed and the ways in which you connect your
sentences should be clear. There should also be a clear overall structure to your document.
A clear structure is one that is easily understood by the reader. Of course, it is possible that a structure
could be clear but not very logical. But most of the time a clear structure is clear because it is logical
- it makes sense for your document to proceed the way it does.
The first draft of a document's structure is figured out as part of the initial planning stage. But be
aware that your structure may change during the writing and editing processes. That is okay! This
does not mean that planning the structure at the beginning is pointless. The plan provides you with a
starting point and an important guide for the writing process because it tells you where you are and
where you are going at any point. It will help you with task management as well because you will
be able to focus on one section at a time, and, if necessary, out of order without getting confused. If,
after you have created a first draft, you decide to alter the original planned structure, that is usually a
sign that you are improving the document.

                                                                 12
                                                                                                                                                              13

2.3 Using distinct sections

If your document is more than a couple of pages long, it will be very important to give it structure by
organising it into distinct sections or parts. Almost every legal document can and should be divided
into sections. These are the basic parts of your document and should correspond to the main basic
tasks your document is to perform. Again, this is something that helps both you and your reader: you
develop a clearer idea of what you are trying to do, and your reader gets a clearer idea of what they
are reading.

                          TIP: TABLE OF CONTENTS USUALLY NOT NECESSARY
       Unless instructed to do so, you should not feel the need to include a table of contents. Using
       headings and dividing your paper into sections will be enough to enhance the clarity of your
       document.

As already noted, your original structure can evolve or be amended, but you should start writing
your document with a planned sequence of sections, and your completed document should comprise
a sequence of clearly identified sections.
Sections can be further subdivided into subsections and even sub-subsections. But be careful not to
go overboard. It is possible for a document to be divided into too many sections and subsections, in
the sense that the text and ideas become disjointed and underdeveloped.
There is no simple, or set, formula for how a document should be structured, as there are many
different kinds of documents. The old formula of `have an introduction, a main body and a
conclusion' is not wrong, but it leaves open just how that main body is itself to be structured, and
that will depend on the document you are writing.
An example of how to structure a document might help here.

                                                          Example 2.1

       Imagine you are writing an essay in which your purpose is to persuade your reader that jury trials
       should be abolished. A possible structure could be:

                 1. Introduction

                                                                 13
14

                 2. History and rationale of jury trials
                 3. Current problems with jury trials
                 4. Why abolition of jury trials would solve those problems
                 5. Possible objections to abolition
                 6. Responses to those objections
                 7. Conclusion.

       The main body consists of sections 2 to 6.
       You can see the logic behind these sections. First, you provide relevant background information.
       Then you set up the problem to be solved and provide your solution to that problem. You show
       balance by considering objections to your position, but you are then able to rebut those objections
       and defend your position.
       This is not a universal structure to apply indiscriminately. Moreover, this possible structure could
       well be varied in the final version. For example, you might find that it is more effective to
       combine sections 3 and 4 and propose the solution to the problem while explaining what the
       problem is. You might also find that it is more effective, and avoids repetition, to combine
       sections 5 and 6, so that you respond to each objection as you present it.
       The key thing is that your reader should be able quickly to see, without having to look very hard,
       that this is indeed what you are doing.
                                                                                                                                                              15

2.4 Using distinct paragraphs

Within each section, you should also organise your ideas into distinct paragraphs. A paragraph is a
group of sentences that deal with a particular topic or point. Moreover, those sentences work together
to deal with that common topic or point in an integrated way. As you plan your document (and when
you are writing and revising it), work out what the distinct ideas and issues are that you want to
address and dedicate a distinct paragraph to each one. This will help present your ideas logically and
clearly. Exactly how you decide what particular topics or points need distinct treatment in a separate
paragraph is something to be worked out in each case; there is no fixed rule for this. You will need to
think through what points you want to make and decide how best to present those points.

If your document needs to be short, then it may be that distinct sections with headings are not needed.
In such cases, distinct paragraphs will be the sole key to providing your document with structure.

If your document has long passages of text without paragraph breaks, this is usually a sign that
the ideas and themes are jumbled together, rather than an indication that the idea or theme you are
dealing with is large and complicated. Even large and complicated ideas and themes can be broken
down into smaller ideas and themes with distinct paragraphs. At the very least, it is a courtesy to your
reader to break up large slabs of unbroken text into paragraphs.

To make your paragraphs clear on the page, you should start a new paragraph on a new line and either
indent the first line of the new paragraph, or insert a whole line break between the previous paragraph
and the new one (so that there is a whole line of white space between them). It is not enough simply
to start a new line.

                   TIP: PARAGRAPHS SHOULD BE ABLE TO STAND ON THEIR OWN

       A paragraph should be substantive enough to stand on its own. Avoid single sentence paragraphs.
       As a rule of thumb, aim for at least three to five sentences in a paragraph. But be flexible if the
       content demands a different number of sentences. Try to avoid dividing up an idea across two
       paragraphs when that idea should be discussed in just one paragraph.

The opening sentence of your paragraph (often called a `topic sentence') should usually introduce
the topic to be explored or articulate the main point to be made. It does not have to do so explicitly:

      The topic of this paragraph is whether barristers' wigs should be abolished.

Indeed, that would be rather odd. But your paragraph's opening sentence should serve to introduce
your reader to what is to come:

      The debate about whether barristers' wigs are an anachronism or a valuable link to tradition
      seems to recur every few years.

It can also let your reader know the position being taken:

                                                                 15
16

      Barristers' wigs have become an embarrassing anachronism in our contemporary justice
      system.

The paragraph's following sentences should then go further into the substance of your topic or
point, perhaps explaining your position or noting the various views on the issue. Your paragraph's
concluding sentence should usually round things off but does not need to contain the substantive
conclusion to the paragraph's argument. Indeed, it will often be best to have your main point at the
start of your paragraph. (See the `point first' approach in section 3.3.8 in Chapter 3.)

To connect your paragraphs it is often useful to include a bridging sentence or two, either at the end
of the current paragraph or at the start of the next one. A bridging sentence explains the connection
between one paragraph and the next, or, indeed, explains the contrast between the paragraphs:

      Not only barristers' wigs, but also some barristers' tendency to use anachronistic jargon when
      plain speaking is best has been the subject of much complaint. Such jargon ... [and the
      paragraph then goes on to discuss jargon]
                                                                                                                                                              17

2.5 Using headings and signposts

The final version of your document should have a clear and logical structure that is easily discernible
to the reader. It should not only be clear what the document's structure is, it should also be clear
how each part contributes to achieving the document's overall purpose. At any point while reading
your document, your reader should be able to discern without much effort exactly how the current
sentence, paragraph and section of the document fits into the document's overall structure.
Headings are the most direct and useful way to identify where different sections begin and end. Do
not be shy about using headings that expressly mark out distinct sections of your document. Headings
and subheadings will often help you when planning your document and help your reader to follow
your structure.
The wording of your headings can provide useful information about what is to be found in the
sections to follow but they should be brief. Even so, avoid using generic headings like `Background'
or `Main discussion' because that does not tell your reader much about what that section is about. The
heading usually works better if it describes the key content of the relevant section or communicates
the section's main idea. This allows you to make the flow of your document's points or argument
explicit even in the headings, which can be a great help to your reader.
You can make your structure even clearer by telling the reader, directly and explicitly, what you are
doing at key points in your document. For example, you might write:

      This section examines the main arguments for why the concept of law should be viewed as
      inescapably value-laden and not neutral.

This sort of signposting helps the reader to follow your text. It can also be very helpful to you, the
writer, in working out just what it is that you are doing at any given point in your document.
If you are using more than one level of heading, be clear about which heading belongs to which
level. That is, you should clearly identify what is a main heading, what is a subheading, what is a
sub-subheading, and so on. You can do this by numbering or lettering the headings, or using different
fonts, bold text, italics and so on, or both. (The Australian Guide to Legal Citation, 4th edition, rule
1.12.2 provides one model for heading levels and styles.)

                                                                 17
18

2.6 Introductions are almost always essential

Introductions are necessary in most, if not all, the writing tasks you will perform in law school. The
particular purpose and detail of your introduction will depend on the purpose of your document,
but in most kinds of legal writing, a good introduction seeks to introduce the reader not just to the
subject of the document but also to the document itself. It will orient the reader by letting them know
what the document is about and what the document is doing in relation to the subject matter. An
introduction is somewhat like the on-ramp of a motorway: it enables your reader to get up to speed
so that they can make headway into the rest of the document.

                                  TIP: LEAVE MYSTERY TO MYSTERY NOVELS

       The main purpose of the introduction is to introduce your reader to your document and to prepare
       them for what follows. Your document is not a mystery novel where you need to keep crucial
       things hidden for the surprise ending. Outline your purpose and the structure as clearly as you can,
       with sufficient specificity to enable the reader to know where your document is going and to
       correctly anticipate how your document will end.

In a professional context, such as writing legal advice, it is common to put your conclusion in
the introduction. This is because you are providing information as a service, and making the most
important information easily accessible to your client is good service. On other occasions, the role
of the introduction may be more about drawing the reader into the document and making them want
to read the rest of what you wrote. For example, if you were writing to persuade someone that a
law should be reformed, your introduction should start by pointing this out clearly and could set the
scene with a vivid illustration of problems with the current law and a suggestion, if not an outright
statement, of what the solutions (if any) may be. In all cases, the introduction needs to be useful to
the reader.

Depending on the length and complexity of your document, it may be appropriate for your
introduction to provide a short roadmap of the rest of the document, by briefly identifying the
sections that are to come and what they do. This makes the most important information easy to access
by letting the reader know what is in store. You should, of course, make sure that your document
does go on to deliver what you have promised.

The length of a good introduction will vary. Most often it will be a matter of proportionality: the
shorter the document, the shorter the introduction. If you are only writing a paragraph, then the
topic sentence of that paragraph will serve as an introduction. If you are writing a page, then you
might only need a few sentences of introduction. If you are writing a 3,000-word piece, then a few
paragraphs is usually enough.

                                                                 18

2.7 The value of a distinct conclusion section

It is important to know when to draw things to an end. It is also important to let your reader know
that things have come to an end and remind them what it is you want them to take away from the
document. This applies when you are ending particular discussions within your document as well as
ending the document as a whole.
If you are delivering the conclusion to an argument or just ending your discussion of some issue,
it will usually help your reader if you use words that clearly indicate this. Conclusions can be
signposted in various ways.

      From the preceding arguments, it can be seen that Kwong's position on the issue is the most
      plausible one.
      In conclusion, it is clear that the most plausible position is that of Kwong.

                                 TIP: BE EXPLICIT ABOUT YOUR CONCLUSION
       Whether you are concluding a section or the whole document, make sure you bring things to a
       finish before moving on. Do not just leave thoughts or points hanging. Do not assume that your
       reader will do the work of inferring your conclusion from your discussion - state it explicitly to
       avoid any confusion about what you mean. This helps your reader move through the different
       sections of your document and glean the meaning you are trying to communicate.

                                                                 19

Chapter 3: Writing your document

3.1 Introduction

This is where the fun really starts! Once you have worked out who you are, who your audience is,
what you are writing about, what your purpose is and what your planned document will look like,
it is time to start writing. What you will write will be sentences. Clear, well-written sentences are
the foundation of good writing. Good writing also involves connecting your sentences clearly and
effectively so that your document is a well-integrated whole. You also need to review and revise your
writing. Good writing is polished writing.
This chapter will cover advice on:

          how to write clear sentences
          ways to make your writing clearer
          reviewing and revising your work before submission.

                                                                 20
                                                                                                                                                              21

3.2 Writing clear sentences

Clear writing starts with constructing clear sentences. A sentence is a basic unit of language that
expresses a complete or self-contained thought. A clear sentence is one whose meaning is readily
understood by its audience. This section briefly explains what a sentence is, before going on to
provide some advice on how to write a clear sentence.

3.2.1 Constructing a sentence

To construct a good sentence, you need to know what sentences do and how they are built. In English
there are four basic types of sentences: declarative, imperative, interrogative and exclamative.

                                                  TYPES OF SENTENCES

       A declarative sentence makes a statement:
             The lawyer was rude to the judge.

       An imperative sentence commands that something be done:
             Stop smirking!

       An interrogative sentence asks a question:
             Did that lawyer just smirk at the judge?

       An exclamative sentence expresses a sudden emotion or attitude:
             What a fool!

In this chapter we focus on declarative sentences, which do most of the work in legal writing. The
key grammatical point to note here is that a declarative sentence consists of a subject and a predicate.
In every declarative sentence, something is said to perform some action or to have some feature or
attribute. The subject of the sentence is the thing that performs that action or has that feature. The
predicate of the sentence is the action or feature that is attributed to the subject.
In the sentence `The barrister smirked at the judge', the subject is the barrister, and the predicate
tells us what the barrister did, namely that they smirked at the judge.
In the sentence `The barrister is a rude buffoon', the barrister is again the subject, but the predicate
now tells us what the barrister is or what feature they have, rather than what they did.

                                                                 21
22

In the sentence `The judge was smirked at by the barrister', the judge is the subject (even though
the judge does not perform the action of smirking) and the predicate tells us that the judge has the
feature of having been smirked at. It is also written in the passive voice, which is generally better to
avoid in legal writing. See 3.2.1(d) for more about the active versus passive voices.

This brief grammar lesson leads us to the first piece of practical advice about writing clear sentences.

                                     (a) Make your subject and predicate clear

A clearly written declarative sentence will enable the reader to know straight away what the subject
of the sentence is and what is said about that subject. A good way to help you make these things clear
is to formulate your sentence as an answer to two questions:

       1. What or who is the subject of your sentence?
       2. What is the key action or feature of that subject that you want to convey?

If your answers are `the barrister' and `he smirked at the judge', you could write your sentence as
`The barrister smirked at the judge'. If your answers are `the judge' and `she was annoyed', you
could write your sentence as `The judge was annoyed'.

In this way, you can build your sentence from the basic building blocks of subject and predicate.
Keep your main focus on the nouns, verbs and adjectives you will need to identify the subject and
predicate.

Once you have made that core information clear, you may sometimes want to add further information
to the sentence. For example, you might want to also tell the reader that the barrister had arrived late
to court. So you might add:

      The barrister, who had arrived late to court, smirked at the judge.

Or you might want to add that the judge had already chastised the barrister and add some explanatory
information:

      The judge had already chastised the barrister for his lateness and so was annoyed by his further
      rudeness.

You might then want to put all of this information into one sentence:

      The barrister, who had arrived late to court and had already been chastised by the judge for his
      tardiness, smirked at her, so she was annoyed by his further rudeness.

However, as you can see, the longer and more complex your sentence becomes, the harder it is for
your reader to follow. Be careful not to overload your sentence with extra words and clauses. This
brings us to the next piece of practical advice.

                                (b) Express just one main idea in each sentence

Your sentence will usually be much clearer if it expresses one main idea. This will often be a matter
of the sentence having just one main subject and one main predicate. When you have made these
clear, stop and think whether your sentence will be improved by adding more ideas to it. Very often,
it will not. So, add more information to your sentence only if the new information is integral to the
main idea. If you have another, distinct idea to convey, then put it in a new sentence. Avoid piling
                                                                                                                                                              23

up multiple ideas in one sentence and then leaving it to your reader to sort out what you are trying to
say.

                                         TIP: PRESENT ONE IDEA AT A TIME
       Simpler sentences that deal with one idea at a time are easier to read (and understand) than longer,
       complicated sentences with lots of components.
       Recall the example from above:

             The barrister, who had arrived late to court and had already been chastised by the
             judge for his tardiness, smirked at her, so she was annoyed by his further
             rudeness.
       This sentence is probably too complex. It could be better to write it as two sentences:
             The barrister, who had arrived late to court, smirked at the judge. The judge had
             already chastised the barrister for his tardiness and so was annoyed by this further
             rudeness.
       There is usually no limit on how many sentences you can use to build a document so there is no
       advantage in using long, complicated sentences over short, clear sentences.

                                                 (c) Use short sentences

Short sentences are usually much clearer than long ones. Keep your sentences short if you can do so
without compromising the meaning of what you want to say. To help you write short sentences, be
direct. Have a point and get to it. Add extra information only when necessary. This practice is closely
connected to the value of expressing one main idea per sentence. If you express just one main idea in
each sentence, then it will be easier to keep your sentences short.

Avoid trying to appear smart or more `lawyerly' by using roundabout, longwinded ways of getting
to your point. Unfortunately, there are many real-world examples of legal writing that use long and
complex sentences. Law students do need to be able to read such writing, but this is not what is
expected or desired of students in their own writing. Resist the temptation to mimic this verbose style.

                               TIP: IF THE CAT SAT ON THE MAT, JUST SAY SO
       If the basic idea that you want to convey to your reader is that the cat sat on the mat, then just
       write:

             The cat sat on the mat.
       It is not more `lawyerly' to write something like:

             With regard to the domesticated feline mammal, it can be asserted that, inter alia,
24

             the postural relationship of the said creature vis--vis the woven floor covering was
             one involving the placing of the lower part of its body upon the latter in a resting
             configuration.

Of course, if every sentence in your document is no more than 10 words long, your prose may risk
appearing abrupt and disconnected. As a matter of style, it is usually desirable to have a mix of
shorter, medium and longer sentences so that your text flows more smoothly. A good test is to read
your text aloud to hear how it flows. (This does not mean that written text should read as a transcript
of spoken words. If you write merely as you speak, your text will be very hard to read.) As you
develop your writing skills and gain experience and confidence in constructing sentences, you will
be better able to judge what sort of mix works best in the document you are writing.

                 (d) Consider whether the active voice is better than the passive voice

Writing in the active voice is often clearer than writing in the passive voice. In the active voice, the
subject of the sentence is the agent or performer of the main action.

In the sentence `The barrister smirked at the judge', the barrister is the subject, smirking is the action
and it is the barrister who is doing the smirking. This is the active voice.

In contrast, in the passive voice, the subject of the sentence is the recipient of the action, or the
person or thing affected by the action.

In the sentence `The judge was smirked at by the barrister', the judge is the subject of the sentence
and is the one who `receives' the action of smirking. This is the passive voice.

The active voice is often (but not always) better to use than the passive voice. For example, `The
junior solicitor lost the summons' is clearer and more direct than `The summons was lost by the
junior solicitor' or, even more vaguely, `The summons was lost'. A feature of the passive voice that
can create problems is that the agent of the action is not always stated (as in the last example here),
so the reader gets only half of the picture.

Sometimes your purpose may be best served by using the passive voice because it might be
appropriate to focus the sentence on the thing that is affected by the action.

For example, in the sentence `The junior solicitor was sacked' the subject is `the junior solicitor' and
they were on the receiving end of the action of sacking, but we are not told who did the sacking. But
that may be what writer wanted, in order to focus on the junior solicitor and leave it to the context
to identify the agent (e.g. `the senior partner'), who is not central to the story the writer wants to
tell. For this reason, the passive voice is sometimes used by speakers or writers who want to avoid
identifying the agent of the action, or where the agent is unknown.

          (e) Make sure each sentence is grammatically correct and properly punctuated

Always reviews each sentence to, makes sure that it are grammatical correct and properly;
punctuated. (Yes, that sentence contains examples of what not to do.)

Grammar is not a matter of linguistic snobbery or pedantry. It is a matter of the basic rules that
                                                                                                                                                              25

enable words to be used together in ways that make sense. Having a good grasp of how to write a
grammatical sentence is an essential foundation for clear writing. Of course, some rules of grammar
are more fundamental than others, some rules change over time, and there are some purported rules
(such as the rule against splitting infinitives or ending a sentence with a preposition) whose value can
be disputed. But there are some basic agreed points of grammar that it helps to know if you are to
improve your writing.

The punctuation of your sentence should work hand in hand with its grammatical structure.
Punctuation helps to show the internal structure of the sentence. Incorrect placement of punctuation
marks can make a sentence very hard to read. Learn what the different punctuation marks are for and
how to use them.

Common problem areas in punctuation include semicolons and apostrophes. Semicolons (;) are not
colons (:). Colons introduce what is to follow. Semicolons have two main functions: they can be
used to join independent clauses (i.e. sentences) to form one sentence; they can also be used to
separate longer items in a list, especially one that has been introduced by a colon. Apostrophes
indicate ownership (e.g. the writer's pen, the writers' pens) or the missing letters in a contraction
(e.g. the contraction it's expands to it is and the contraction can't expands to cannot). Apostrophes
have nothing to do with plurals (e.g. one ATM and two ATMs, not two ATM's).
26          A full stop ends a sentence.
                     The judge was clearly irritated by the barrister.
 Full stop

Comma       A comma can have many uses. Some examples include separating items in a
            list, connecting two related ideas in a sentence or distinguishing qualifying
            information within a sentence.

                     The lawyer was late, dishevelled and cranky.

                     If the accused doesn't show, she will be sent to prison.

                     The lawyer, who was originally from Canada, had to retrain in
                        Australia.

Semicolon   A semicolon is used to join independent clauses or separate longer items in a
            list.

                     The courtroom was deserted; everyone was on holiday.

                     The judge was angry; the barrister was embarrassed.

                     There are four things a good criminal defence barrister needs to
                        know before going into court: the law; the expected evidence against
                        their client; how to apply the law to that evidence; and, most
                        importantly, how to put all that together and explain to the jury,
                        clearly and persuasively, that the evidence does not prove their
                        client's guilt beyond reasonable doubt.

Colon       A colon introduces what is to follow. It is often used at the start of a list.

                     I will tell you what makes me angry: rude people!
                     In your first year, you will study three subjects: introduction to law,

                        contracts and torts.

Quotation   Quotation marks are used to show what someone else has said or words that
marks       you have taken from other sources. They are also used when you want to
            draw attention to the words themselves.

                     The judge said, `If you interrupt me one more time, you'll be facing a
                        contempt of court charge.'

                     According to Aristotle, `the law is reason unaffected by desire'.

                     What exactly do we mean by `the rule of law'?

                     `Legal positivism' is the name given to a range of views that are
                        opposed to natural law theory.

Hyphen  Hyphens join words.

         The lawyer was quick-witted.

 Apostrophe Apostrophes are used for showing ownership of something or an action and
                     for contractions. They are not used for plurals.

                              The judge's wig slipped off.
                              I didn't see that.

3.2.2 Choosing words to make your meaning clear

Sentences are made up of words. The words you choose will profoundly affect the clarity of your
sentence. Even if your sentence is short, contains one main idea and is perfectly grammatically
correct, a poor choice of words can render it incomprehensible.

                (a) When simpler, shorter words and phrases will do the job, use them
      With respect to the issue of the optimum verbal form for effective communication, it is submitted
      that an overly extensive and conspicuously polysyllabic vocabulary whose contribution to the
      attempted communicative act would appear to be principally an increase in the likelihood of
      obscurantism is best decommissioned and substituted with terminology of a less complicated
      nature in those contexts where there is practicability attending upon such a strategy.

Or:

      Long and complex words and phrases that obscure your meaning should be replaced with
      simpler and shorter words and phrases where possible.

As noted above, legal writing unfortunately contains many examples of needlessly complex and
obscure vocabulary. Some students mistakenly believe they must emulate this style if they are to
`sound like a lawyer'. What often makes this worse is that students who do this often do a poor job
of it, so that what emerges is clumsy and unclear. It is much safer, especially for the beginning legal
writer, to choose simpler, shorter words and phrases when they will do the job just as well. It is best
to avoid decorating your writing with supposedly lawyerly words and phrases such as `hereunto', `in
the event that' or `inter alia'.

Sometimes it is necessary to use certain technical words and phrases, such as `prima facie evidence',
`involuntary manslaughter', `autrefois acquit' or `testamentary trust', which you should not replace
with more familiar English words. In fact, when referring to cases or legislation, it is important to use
the same language. But, apart from such instances, it is usually best to use simple and familiar words
and phrases, particularly if your task is to explain complex legal concepts to a client who may not be
familiar with technical language. As you learn more about the law, you will learn to recognise when
a technical legal term needs to be used and when it does not. You can also use a legal dictionary to
help you identify technical terms to make sure you are using them in the correct context.
28

                                 TIP: BE CHEAP -- USE THE FIFTY-CENT WORD

       Mark Twain once said: `Don't use a five-dollar word when a fifty-cent word will do.'
       What this means is that, outside of those circumstances where you need to use the technical legal
       term, often, a simpler word will be clearer than a more sophisticated word. For example, the word
       `car' is simpler than the term `motor vehicle' but they could both be used to refer to the same
       object. Here, `motor vehicle' is the five-dollar word, while `car' is the fifty-cent word. Of course,
       you need to use your discretion and consider the context of your words and whether `car'
       adequately covers what you need to communicate.

                                               (b) Cut unnecessary words

If a word is unnecessary, redundant or superfluous, it will probably extraneously get in the way of
the essential and important words that are actually necessary. Delete such unnecessary words from
your sentence.

                                               (c) Use words consistently

Clarity needs consistency. The clear expression of fundamental principles requires consistent
language. Also, some technical words need to be used consistently. While having a wide vocabulary
can be useful, it will often be more helpful to your argument (and your reader) to be consistent where
you are referring to the same thing. Writing with style does not always mean having to think up
different ways of saying the same thing.

                                           TIP: SYNONYMS CAN BE A TRAP

       A thesaurus is not always your friend. Not every synonym is interchangeable, and law is very
       context-specific. Be careful when using synonyms in legal writing.

                                    (d) Use appropriate words of qualification

A common writing problem is the failure to properly qualify claims that are being made. For
example, consider the sentence `Lawyers are greedy'. This sentence is telling us, or at least implying,
that all lawyers are greedy, but can this be true? Or is it more accurate to say that only some lawyers
are greedy? Most? Many? By failing to qualify the claim, the sentence is unclear, even though
grammatically it is very simple.

Another example: `Greed causes ulcers'. Can we tell from this whether greed always causes ulcers
or just sometimes causes ulcers? Is it saying that greed is the only cause of ulcers or just a cause?

Often the broader context will provide the missing information, but you should always check the
context to see whether it really does provide the necessary clarification. If you are leaving too much
to context and requiring your reader to do most of the work in sorting out your sentence's meaning,
then you will probably need to make the qualification explicit. Try to avoid being verbose when you
                                                                                                                                                              29

do so, but very often the right extra word of qualification saves your reader from having to work it
out for themselves.

                           (e) Use the first-person pronoun when it is appropriate

Should you ever use the first-person pronoun (i.e. `I', `me', `mine') in legal writing? It all depends
on what you are writing. Recall the importance of knowing your role, audience and purpose.

When you are writing as a lawyer, you are not writing as yourself. You are playing a professional role
in which you will, ideally, write what any competent lawyer would write. So, your identity should be
in the background. However, this need not always mean that the first-person singular pronoun must
be banished. Read judges' reasons for their decisions and you will often see them writing `I have' or
`in my view'. Still, when writing as a lawyer, it is generally best to keep the focus away from you
and use `I' and `my' sparingly.

                                  TIP: BE CLEAR ABOUT WHO IS DOING WHAT

       It will often be better to write things like `this essay argues that' rather than `I argue that', or `the
       third section of this paper concerns' rather than `my third section concerns', or `it was found
       earlier that' rather than `I found earlier that'.
       But at all times, ensure that your reader can tell straight away who is doing the arguing or making
       the findings. Clarity remains the main goal.

The indirect, passive phrase `it is submitted that' or `it is argued that' is often used by barristers when
presenting arguments in court on behalf of clients. This is because the arguments are not necessarily
what the lawyer personally believes (indeed it could be the complete opposite). Rather, it is the best
argument that can be put on behalf of the client. However, when this formulation appears in other
legal contexts or in academic writing, it can sometimes sound stilted and confusing. Some might
think it is the badge of a true lawyer to say `it is submitted that' wherever possible, but if your reader
has to stop and try to work out who is doing the submitting, then you are losing clarity.

In contrast, if you are writing a standard academic essay, you usually are writing as yourself and
presenting your ideas and arguments with the purpose of informing or persuading your audience. It
is true that you are, in a sense, playing the role of `an academic writer', but even in that role you are
still presenting your views and arguments. In this context, most law teachers view it as acceptable
(and usually clearest) for you to use the first person singular (`I', `my' etc.). (If you are in any doubt
about what your teacher prefers, ask them.)

Using the first-person pronoun need not make your essay subjective. A subjective essay is one
that merely expresses the writer's opinions and preferences, without substantiating their claims with
supporting evidence or reasoned arguments. An academic essay aims to be objective in the sense that
it seeks to persuade its audience by appealing to some common ground in the form of evidence and
argument. It does not seek to persuade merely by the sincerity or passion with which it maintains its
position. The presence of `I', `my' and so on does not prevent you from substantiating your claims,
and the absence of `I' or `my' does not itself supply any substantiating evidence or argument. That is,
merely avoiding the word `I' does not make your essay objective and merely using the word `I' does
30

not make your essay subjective. Nonetheless, in making your case, stick more closely to `I argue',
`I suggest', `my definition' and so on than to `I wish', `I hate' or `my feeling'. Your goal is still to
persuade your audience, not just to express your feelings or to display your personality.

3.3 Ways to make your writing clearer

Clear writing needs clear sentences, but your document needs to be more than a collection of clear
sentences. There need to be relationships between your sentences if your writing is to make sense.
You need to choose your words carefully to show these relationships. There are many ways in which
sentences can be related to each other. We identify some of them below. The key theme is the
importance of using the right words to signal to the reader how a sentence relates to other sentences.
Remember that a sentence needs to be able to stand on its own, but it is just as important that it fits
in with the sentences around it.

3.3.1 Signposting

It will most often help your reader if you provide some `signposts' to help them keep track of where
they are going while reading your document. Signposts are words and phrases at particular points
that tell the reader what the document is doing or where it is going. Be clear about changes in topic,
so that your reader knows a change is being made. If you have finished discussing a topic or issue
and are moving on to a new one, it will usually help if you flag this to your reader.

                                                         EXAMPLE 3.1

                   This paper will consider the importance of signposting, before moving on to examine
                     the most effective ways to signpost in legal writing.

                   Turning now to consider the question of whether supervised injecting centres should
                     be established in Victoria, I will argue that ...

                   The next aspect of the liberal account of religious freedom to be analysed is ...
                   Having examined the background to the presumption of innocence, we now turn to

                     survey ...
                   It has now been established that to be defamation, an imputation must damage a

                     person's reputation. Next, we will explore what damage to a person's reputation
                     means.

3.3.2 Numbering your points

If you have, say, three arguments for your position that animals should be given legal rights, then it
will probably be helpful to your reader to say so.

      In this section I will present three arguments in favour of giving animals legal rights. First,

                                                                 31
32

      animals' sentience means that ... Second, animal rights follow from human duties toward
      animals ... Third, recognition of animal rights will increase the overall welfare of animals ...

Here you are telling your reader to expect three arguments, and then you flag each argument as you
get to it. This way you clearly deliver what was promised. Sometimes the flow of the arguments will
make this flagging unnecessary, but do not be afraid that this sort of thing is prosaic or stating the
obvious. Usually, it is very helpful to your reader.

3.3.3 Elaborating meaning

When one sentence elaborates the preceding sentence, it expands, elucidates or explains the meaning
of that sentence. That is, it restates the meaning or part of the meaning of the preceding sentence in a
different way and builds on it. In other words, an elaborative sentence seeks to draw out and clarify
the meaning of the sentence being elaborated. This can be helpful when you are discussing a difficult
or dense subject that might need several descriptions for it to become clear. This kind of elaborative
sentence can often be flagged by using introductory words such as `that is' or `in other words'. (See
the second and third sentences of this paragraph for examples.) Such words can help the reader to
appreciate what is going on, but they can be overdone, so use them judiciously.

3.3.4 Providing examples

Examples often help to make your meaning clear. If you are presenting an example, say so. Imagine
you are writing an essay on whether a compassionate motive should be a defence to murder. You
might write:

      If a person intentionally kills another person, it is no defence in law that they did so on merciful
      grounds. For example, if a man is dying painfully from a disease and asks his wife to kill him to
      put him out of his misery, and she does so out of compassion for her husband, then she will still
      be guilty of murder.

Other phrases that flag examples include `a case in point is', `for instance' and `this is illustrated by'.

3.3.5 Accumulating information

Often in a series of declarative sentences, each sentence will be adding a further, independent
statement. The effect of the series is an accumulation of distinct statements. This can be flagged using
words and phrases such as `moreover', `furthermore' or `in addition'.

      Capital punishment is a cruel and barbaric practice that no civilised nation should allow.
      Furthermore, capital punishment, rather than deterring potential criminals, merely vents the
      community's anger. Moreover, it can lead to grave injustice where a person is put to death but
      later found to be innocent.

However, such linguistic flags are not always necessary, and they can be overdone. Only use them if
it is not clear that your sentences are accumulating discrete statements or items of information.

Even though the accumulative sentences are providing distinct items of information, it will usually
still be possible and desirable to present them in a meaningful or logical order, rather than just
randomly. For example, if you were describing the High Court building in Canberra, you would not
just list its features randomly:
                                                                                                                                                              33

      The High Court building is asymmetrical. It is in Canberra. It has a caf. It stands near a lake. It
      has three courtrooms. Its interior design is a bit dated now.

Instead, you might start with one aspect, such as the building's location, and provide all the desired
information about that aspect before moving on to another aspect, such as its structure.

      The High Court building, standing on the shore of Lake Burley Griffin in Canberra, was built
      between 1976 and 1980 and was opened by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II on 26 May 1980.
      Though the building is quite dated now, it still has the necessary facilities any courthouse needs.
      In particular, it has three courtrooms, each with viewing galleries so the public can view the
      course of justice. Moreover, it provides barristers with rooms in which to prepare for court. In
      addition to the practical facilities, it also has couches in the lobby and a caf for visitors to relax
      in.

3.3.6 Making a contrast

It can often help to clarify the meaning of a sentence by making a contrast. That is, you can explain
or highlight the meaning of one thing by pointing out something different.

                                                         EXAMPLE 3.2

                   It is a mistake to think each human right is perfectly compatible with every other
                     human right. Nonetheless, many different human rights are mutually supportive of
                     each other.

                   Justice Donner supported a liberal interpretation of section 80 of the Constitution.
                     Justice Blitzen, however, argued for a conservative interpretation. In contrast, Justice
                     Rudolph held that section 80 was not relevant to the issue in the case.

                   It is difficult to determine whether compulsory voting has improved Australian
                     democracy. On the one hand, it seems very undemocratic to force people to vote. On
                     the other hand, voting can be seen as a citizen's civic duty and not merely their civil
                     right.

Contrasts like these can be seen as a particular kind of accumulation (see section 3.3.5). Extra
information is being provided with each sentence, but the contrastive nature of the new information
is being noted by use of words like `in contrast', `however' or `nonetheless'.

3.3.7 Drawing an inference

There is a very important relationship between sentences where one sentence follows logically from
some of the preceding sentences. That is, one sentence might be the logical conclusion to be drawn
from other sentences which form the premises to that conclusion. (The premises and conclusion
together constitute a logical argument.) Where one sentence follows logically from the preceding
34

sentences, we can flag that as a conclusion by using words such as `therefore', `thus' or `it follows
that'.

Some conclusions follow from their premises with certainty, while other conclusions are simply well-
supported by their premises.

      All Victorian barristers are bound by the Victorian Bar's rules of professional conduct. Anika
      is a Victorian barrister. Therefore, Anika is bound by the Victorian Bar's rules of professional
      conduct.

In this argument, the conclusion that Anika is bound by the Victorian Bar's rules of professional
conduct follows with logical certainty from the premises.

In contrast:

      Only about 10 per cent of Victorian barristers are King's Counsel. Anika is a Victorian barrister.
      It follows that she is probably not a King's Counsel.

In this argument, the conclusion is well supported by the premises, but it is not certain and may yet
prove to be false.

When you draw an inference, be careful to note, at least to yourself, how strong the degree of logical
support is. Sometimes, if it is important, you should also indicate to the reader what that level of
support is. Other times, if it is not central to your discussion or is reasonably obvious, you can leave
it to the reader to note.

                                     TIP: KNOW YOUR (LOGICAL) STRENGTH

       Be careful not to overstate your case by claiming your conclusion follows with certainty when it
       does not or is logically well supported when it is not. If you try to present matters as certain when
       they are merely well supported, it can undermine the persuasiveness of your argument. A
       persuasive argument presents a realistic assessment of the strength of its conclusions.

Also, avoid adding words like `thus', `therefore' or `so' to your writing for rhetorical effect or to
make it seem more logically integrated than it is. Therefore, simply using such words will not create
logical connections that are not actually there. (Yes, the `therefore' at the start of that last sentence is
an example of this sort of phantom logical connection.)

3.3.8 Justifying a statement

When an inference is drawn, the conclusion is supported by the preceding premises. It is also possible
(and often desirable) to present things the other way around: present your conclusion first and then
justify it by laying out the premises that support it.

For example, we could present the earlier argument about Anika's professional obligations the other
way around:
                                                                                                                                                              35

      Anika is bound by the Victorian Bar's rules of professional conduct. This is because all Victorian
      barristers are bound by the Victorian Bar's rules of professional conduct and Anika is a Victorian
      barrister.

Here we make the statement and then, by using the word `because', flag that the words to follow will
justify that statement.

`Because' is perhaps the most common term to use in these situations. Other appropriate terms
include `as' and `since'.

      Anika is bound by the Victorian Bar's rules of professional conduct, as all Victorian barristers
      are bound by those rules and Anika is a Victorian barrister.

      Anika is probably not a KC since only about 10 per cent of Victorian barristers are KCs and all
      we know about Anika is that she is a Victorian barrister.

The `point first' approach

It is often a good idea to present your conclusion or main point first and then lay out your justification
for it. Presenting all the premises first and drawing the conclusion at the end sometimes risks losing
your reader's attention, especially if the argument is a long one. If you let your reader know right at
the start where you are heading, that can help them follow your argument. This is called the `point
first' approach to presenting arguments. You tell your reader up-front what your key point is and
then provide the detail that explains or justifies that point. This does not `spoil the story' because in
legal writing you are not writing a mystery novel in which `whodunnit' is to be revealed only at the
very end.

The point first approach is often used by advocates in drafting submissions to courts. Here your
audience (the judge) is busy, is professionally required not to sympathise with you and wants to know
quickly what your basic position is, so that they can start orienting themselves in the debate between
the advocates appearing before them. If at any point the judge is not sure where you are headed, you
are losing them. If you lose the judge's attention and then their understanding, you run a grave risk
of losing your case as well.

It can also be useful when drafting legal advice to state your conclusion at the start and then tell the
reader why that conclusion is justified, using key words such as `because', `since' and `as'.

If you do use the point first approach, you must make sure that you do go on, after stating your point
first, to justify or explain that point. Do not just state your point and then move on to the next one.
Many students, when writing legal advice, simply state the relevant legal test in general terms and
then baldly state that the client satisfies (or does not satisfy) that test, with little or no reference to the
material facts that support that conclusion.
36

                                                         EXAMPLE 3.3

             Intentional murder is defined as intentionally killing a human being by way of a
             conscious, voluntary and deliberate act, without lawful justification or excuse.
             Therefore, Jintana is guilty of murder.
       Here the writer is implying that the elements of the crime of murder are met, but there is no
       reference to the particular facts which satisfy those elements. Writing in a point first style and
       using terms such as `because' can help you to connect the law to the material facts of the case.
       In this case, we could write:

             Jintana is guilty of murder. This is because (i) she caused Kevin's death (by
             stabbing him in the heart with a kitchen knife), (ii) her actions were conscious,
             voluntary and deliberate, (iii) she intended to kill Kevin, and (iv) she acted without
             lawful justification or excuse. These four facts satisfy the four elements for
             intentional murder.

3.3.9 Flagging a preliminary discussion

Sometimes the point first approach will not work if there are certain preliminary ideas that need to
be stated in order to make sense of your ultimate conclusion. Where this is the case, make that clear
so that the reader knows you are not yet making your main point, but you are on your way to doing
so.

      Before presenting the main arguments in favour of abolishing the right to the presumption of
      bail, it is first necessary to note briefly the origins of the presumption. The presumption was first
      identified in ...

This is a way of flagging for your reader that your main point can only be fully understood with
reference to certain preliminary information, without causing your reader to feel like they are being
led down the garden path before you get to your main point.

3.3.10 Referring to points already made

Sometimes in a document you will want to refer to something you have already said. It usually helps
to be explicit about this. If you are repeating a point you have already made but do not convey to
your reader that you know you are doing so, it can weaken your document's sense of structure.
                                                                                                                                                              37

                                                         EXAMPLE 3.4

                   The office of Solicitor-General is independent of the government. However, as argued
                     in section 2 above, the actions of the Attorney-General were seen as putting
                     unreasonable fetters on the Solicitor-General.

                   The new Victorian provisions create an objective standard. However, as we saw
                     earlier, the creation of an objective form of fault element in the New South Wales
                     version of the offence led to difficulties.

3.3.11 Summarising what you have said

A particular kind of referring involves summarising earlier discussions. In longer documents it can
sometimes help the reader if you provide brief summaries of where the discussion has got to at certain
points.

                                                         EXAMPLE 3.5

             We have now completed a brief history of the jury trial. We saw that the jurors were
             first used in the 12th century as witnesses at trials rather than fact-finders. We also
             noted that it was only in later centuries that jurors came to be independent
             assessors of the evidence. We now move on to ...
       A variation:
             We have now surveyed the history of the jury trial. The main points noted were,
             first, that jurors initially served as witnesses and, second, that juries only slowly
             became fact-finders.

This sort of recapping can help reinforce your main points and keep your reader oriented as you move
on to your next topic of discussion. This can also act as a sort of signposting to help your reader keep
up.

3.3.12 Indicating who is saying what

When discussing or referring to other people's ideas, be clear which ideas are theirs and which are
yours. A very common problem in student writing is lack of clarity about who is saying what. It is
38

often not clear if the student, when presenting an idea, is presenting their own idea or expounding
someone else's idea. This can be a major impediment to comprehension of the document.

If you refer to a particular author's ideas and then go on to say something else, your reader needs to
know whether that something else is still the author's point or whether you have moved on and are
saying something of your own, or even from another author. Careful use of signposting words can
make all the difference here.

                                                         EXAMPLE 3.6

       Consider this short passage:

             Danowski presents a detailed account of the nature of the legal profession. She
             argues that as the law is a profession, it is governed by ethical principles and that it
             is self-regulating and independent of government. The law is also a lucrative
             profession for some.
       Who is saying that the law is also a lucrative profession for some? Is it Danowski or is it the author
       of the passage? If the author is still expounding Danowski, that third sentence could have been
       rewritten as:

             She further contends that the law is also a lucrative profession for some.
       However, if the author is intending to introduce their own idea with that third sentence, then it
       could be rewritten as:

             It can also be argued that the law is also a lucrative profession for some.
       Or, even more clearly:

             In addition, though Danowski does not say so, the law is also a lucrative profession
             for some.

This is not (yet) the same problem as plagiarism (which we will look at in Chapter 4), because it does
not appear that the student is trying to pass off someone else's words or ideas as their own. But it can
still lose you marks because it is unclear. You might also miss out on marks because you are failing
to show that you have original ideas.

Note also that merely providing a footnote does not say who says what. You still need a few well-
chosen words in your main text to indicate who is saying what. Your footnote should then simply
provide the source of the information.
                                                                                                                                                              39

3.4 Reviewing and revising

Once you have written your document, take the time to review and revise what you have written.
This will not be just a matter of `polishing things up a bit'. It involves stepping back and critically
and rigorously reviewing and, where necessary, rewriting your text.

                                    TIP: GOOD WRITING IS GOOD RE-WRITING
       Virtually all good writing involves rewriting. It is very rare for any writer to get things perfectly
       right (or even good enough) on the first attempt. A clear document should appear to have been
       effortlessly written. But to create such prose usually requires several stages of drafting.

A lot of student work suffers because of a failure to review and revise. For many students this will
be due to problems with time management. So, you should plan to include time for reviewing and
revising your work. Some students also do not seem to be in the habit of reviewing and revising their
work. If this applies to you, you should cultivate the habit. It will repay you.

3.4.1 What does reviewing and revising your work involve?

Reviewing and revising is more than just re-reading and editing your document, though those are
both essential parts of the reviewing and revising process. It involves reading your document to see
if it achieves what you want it to achieve and making any changes necessary to enable it to do so.
Always bear your reader in mind when you review your work. That is, think about how your reader
will approach your text. Will they understand what you have written? Will they be persuaded by it?
Try to avoid being content with having expressed yourself just how you want to express yourself.
That will be important, but it is only half the story, because it may yet be that your reader will
not understand or be sympathetic to how you see things. You need to aim at helping the reader to
understand, and even to be persuaded by, what you say.

3.4.2 Give yourself some distance

It can be hard to step back and detach yourself from your work. This can be because you have become
emotionally attached to your creation. But it can also be because you have simply become too used
to your text and your eyes `skate over' things. If you can give yourself that critical distance, and
reapproach your text with an objective and critical eye, it will help you. If possible, it is best to
give yourself a clear break between finishing a draft and then critically reviewing it, so that you can
approach things with `fresh eyes'.

                                                                 39
40

                        TIP: READING ALOUD IS ALLOWED (AND RECOMMENDED)
       Reading your draft document aloud to yourself can be a useful way of forcing yourself to read
       every single word. It is also a handy way to pick up grammatical errors or inconsistencies (like
       changes in tense) and long sentences (which leave you breathless when read aloud). Most word
       processors now have a `read aloud' function that can help with the editing stage.

3.4.3 Edit with depth

In reviewing your work, pay attention to both the big picture and the details. That is, make sure the
structure works and is clear, and everything hangs together well. But also go through each sentence
and make sure each one is grammatically correct and as clear as it can be.
Of course, you will never cash every typo, but the moor of these you can correct before submitting
your document, the beta.
Yes, that sentence contains examples of what to avoid. The words `cash', `moor' and `beta' are
correctly spelt but they are the wrong words in that sentence - and a spell check will not pick that up.

3.4.4 Your work may need several reviews

The revising process may need to be repeated, especially for longer documents. Be prepared to go
through a number of distinct drafts. Of course, there must be a point at which you let go of your
document. It is possible to keep on tinkering with a document with diminishing returns for your
efforts. But too many students let their work go too early. Err on the side of doing one too many
revisions rather than one too few.

                               TIP: GIVE YOURSELF TIME TO EDIT AND REVISE
       Never submit your first draft. Always build in time for editing and revision in your work plan to
       give yourself enough time to improve your work before submission.

3.4.5 Stage your revisions

When reviewing and revising your document there are various things to look for. For long
documents, it can often help to have different stages of revision. In the different stages you are
looking for different things.
                                                                                                                                                     41

                                              STAGED REVISION

Here is one approach to this sort of staged revision process:

            Finalise the basic content of the conclusion and the introduction.
            Check that your overall structure makes sense. Are the sections in a logical order? Do

              any sections need combining or splitting?
            Revise the draft to make sure your arguments do in fact establish the points you intend

              them to establish. Fill in logical gaps and remove repetition. Make sure your text
              addresses the audience it is intended to address.
            Revise your draft to ensure continuity. This is where you can provide appropriate flags
              and signposts.
            Revise your draft to make sure the individual paragraphs are clearly separated, and
              address distinct points.
            Revise your individual sentences to ensure your grammar and punctuation are correct
              and your expression is clear and engaging.
            Revise your draft to make sure the referencing is correct, the bibliography provided (if
              required) and the document is in the required or appropriate format.

Chapter 4: Acknowledging your sources

4.1 Introduction

This chapter lays down some general rules and gives you some practical advice on how to
acknowledge your sources. This will also help you to avoid plagiarism and inadequate referencing.
This is not just to help you to avoid the penalties applicable to plagiarism and inadequate referencing,
but also to help you gain a better understanding of the methods and purposes of good academic
writing.
It is perfectly legitimate (and sometimes essential) to quote or paraphrase other writers' words or
to use facts, information or ideas obtained from other sources - but only if proper acknowledgment
of your sources is given. But what is `proper acknowledgment' and, more importantly, how do you
properly acknowledge your sources?
In brief, proper acknowledgment means that when you reproduce or paraphrase another's words, or
when you use facts, information or ideas obtained from other sources, you:

          indicate that this is what you are doing
          provide sufficient information about your sources to allow your readers to consult those

            sources for themselves.
This chapter will give you some practical advice on:

          the nature and importance of referencing
          when to reference
          the nature of plagiarism and inadequate referencing
          citation styles
          direct copying or quoting
          paraphrasing
          using facts, information or ideas from other sources
          acknowledging your actual source
          note taking to avoid inadequate referencing.

                                                                 42
                                                                                                                                                                 43

 4.2 What is referencing and why is it important?

  It is very important first to appreciate what referencing is in general and why it is important. There
  are at least four main functions served by referencing:

            acknowledgment of one's sources
            supporting one's claims
            contextualising one's writing
            aiding the reader.1

  It is worth briefly explaining each of these four functions.

 4.2.1 Acknowledging your sources

  Whenever you assert some fact or make a claim about the truth of some matter, you are relying either
  on your own direct knowledge or on information supplied by someone else. If you have relied on
  someone else's information, then you need to tell the reader this by referring to that source. Failure
  to acknowledge your use of another's work will often mean that you are, in effect, claiming that you
  are the original source. This can mislead the reader and, in some cases, lead to charges of plagiarism.
  The consequences of a finding of plagiarism - in both academic and professional contexts - can be
  severe, for lawyers in particular. Proper referencing will show the reader your sources and protect
  you from allegations of plagiarism.

                                               TIP: DIVULGE YOUR SOURCES
          If you make an assertion, claim or statement with no citation, you are implying that you yourself
          are the source of that information. If you are not the source, you run the risk of plagiarism. Where
          you assert or imply some fact or information that is common knowledge (`notorious facts', `what
          everyone knows', e.g. that Canberra is the capital of Australia), then you do not need to cite a
          source. It can be a blurred line between what is and what is not common knowledge. If in doubt,
          err on the side of providing a citation.

 4.2.2 Supporting your claims

  In legal writing, whenever you make a claim or assert some fact or policy position, your reader may
  well think `But why should I accept that? What evidence is there for that claim? What authority is
  there for that assertion?'

1. Maurice Nevile, `Literacy Culture Shock: Developing Academic Literacy at University' (1996) 19 The Australian Journal of
      Language and Literacy 38, 47. See also Jeffrey Barnes, `Cite Seeing: Citation in Legal Writing' (Review Essay) (1998) 16(2) Law
      In Context 144, 150.

                                                                    43
44

If your purpose is to persuade your reader to accept what you say, then you should provide good
reasons for why your reader should agree with you. The logic of your own argument will play a
key role in persuading your reader, but you can support your claims by referring to other works and
materials that provide the evidence or the sources of authority that you need.

                    TIP: REFERENCES SAY WHO YOUR (REPUTABLE) FRIENDS ARE

       It is not enough to say, `This is my opinion and, trust me, it's right'.
       When you are giving references to support your claims, what you are effectively saying is `This is
       not just my opinion. Look at all these other very reputable people and organisations who back up
       this point!'

In legal writing in particular it is especially important to provide the legal authority for any
proposition of law (i.e. a statement of what the law is) that you put forward. Such legal authority
will ultimately be a particular decided case or legislative provision. If you say, for example, that it is
against the law in Victoria to disturb religious worship, but do not tell your reader the legal source or
authority for that claim, then your argument will be notably weakened. Indeed, in practice, a judge
would not accept assertions of the law that are not supported by legal authority. (The authority for
that claim is the Summary Offences Act 1966 (Vic) s 21(1).)

4.2.3 Contextualising your writing

Few of us write in isolation. It is almost always the case in academic and legal writing that the issues
and topics one writes about have already been written about by others, even if not directly. Often it
will be important that you be aware of the current discussions in the areas in which you are writing
and that you try to connect with them in your own contribution. Appropriate references in your work
to authors who have preceded you can therefore show that you are aware of the existing issues,
positions and arguments and that you are situating yourself in relation to them. This contextualising
also clarifies the strengths of your claims and allows you, sometimes, to cut out lengthy introductory
concepts and move on to the real substance of your discussion.

4.2.4 Helping your readers find things for themselves

Good referencing enables your readers to find the materials you have used in your work if they
want to. In professional and academic writing this is not merely generosity to the reader. Rather, it
is an essential part of the cooperative enterprise that is legal and academic work, in which it is to
be expected that your readers (who may include judges, other professionals or fellow researchers)
will not just read your words and accept them but will themselves look up the materials you refer to
as part of their own pursuit of the subject matter. This is particularly so in relation to primary legal
sources such as cases and legislation.

Inadequate referencing that prevents your reader from retrieving the relevant information efficiently
- or perhaps at all - is a professional and academic vice. If it happens in professional contexts such
                                                                                                                                                              45

as submissions to a court or negotiations with other lawyers, you can expect the judges and your
colleagues to view your contribution as lacking professionalism.
46

4.3 When to reference

Subject to instructions from your lecturer, you should assume that proper acknowledgment of your
sources is required for all forms of assessment, including examinations (both open and closed book),
essays and problem-solving assignments.
It is important to know when proper acknowledgment of sources is required. As a rule of thumb,
there are four basic occasions in legal writing when you should provide a citation:

          when you make a statement of law
          when you report another's word or ideas
          when you refer to other sources
          when you adopt information or opinions.

4.3.1 Statements of law

When you state what the law is on some topic, you must cite where that law is found, that is, in which
case and/or in which statutory provision. The case or statutory provision is the legal authority for the
statement of law that you have made. It is a mere assertion on your part if you do not back it up with
a reference to the relevant legal authority.

                                                         EXAMPLE 4.1

             In Victoria it is an offence to disrupt religious worship.1

               ________

             1 Summary Offences Act 1966 (Vic) s 21(1).

       Without the footnote providing the source of the law that makes disrupting religious worship an
       offence, your statement has no force.

4.3.2 Reports of another's words or ideas

When you say that someone said something (i.e. you attribute some particular words to someone),
you must cite who said it and where. This applies whether you are directly quoting someone (i.e.
reproducing their exact words) or paraphrasing them (changing their words but expressing the same
basic idea).

                                                                 46
                                                                                                                                                              47

                                                         EXAMPLE 4.2

             Henderson states that `law school is the appropriate forum to inculcate
             professional norms and a vision of law as a noble public profession'.8

             Law School?' (2003) 53(1) Journal of Legal Education 48, 49.
       Or:
             According to Henderson, it is appropriate for law schools to teach future lawyers
             professional norms and ideals.8

             Law School?' (2003) 53(1) Journal of Legal Education 48, 49.

4.3.3 Reporting an idea expressed by more than one source

Where you have seen the same idea expressed in a number of different sources and you want to make
a point of that, then you should make that clear.

                                                         EXAMPLE 4.3

             Many scholars have argued that the decriminalisation of cannabis will have a
             positive benefit on society.5

               ________

             5 See, for example, E Single, P Christie and R Ali, `The Impact of Cannabis
             Decriminalisation in Australia and the United States' (2000) 21(2) Journal of Public
             Health Policy 157. See also, N Donnelly, W Hall and P Christie, `The Effects of
             Partial Decriminalisation on Cannabis Use in South Australia, 1985-1993' (1995)
             19(3) Australian Journal of Public Health 281.

4.3.4 References to further sources

When you want to refer your reader to a further source (i.e. beyond what you are conveying in your
text), you should cite that source. Your reference may tell the reader to see that further source for
48

more information, as a source for a supporting view, as a source for a contrasting view, or because it
is not covered specifically by your work and so on.

                                                         EXAMPLE 4.4

             This paper focuses on the legality of certain artificially intelligent technology in war
             as it exists and will not review the ethical implications of the use of such technology
             in certain circumstances.13

               ________

             13 For a comprehensive discussion on the ethics of AI technology in war see
             Robert Sparrow, `Killer Robots' (2007) 24(1) Journal of Applied Philosophy 62;

             and-autonomous-weapon-systems-ethical-basis-human-control>; Ronald Sandler
             (ed), Ethics and Emerging Technologies (Palgrave Macmillan, 2013).

4.3.5 Adopted information or opinions

When you make or imply a statement, assertion or claim which contains information that you have
taken from someone else (whether wholly or in part), then you must cite that source. This still applies
if you are adding your own words or ideas into the mix.
If you are adopting an opinion or interpretation that you have taken from someone else (i.e. you are
not simply reporting another's view but are adopting it as your view as well), then you must cite that
source.
When you refer to another's information or view, be clear about whether you are just reporting it
or also adopting it as something you endorse. This is an important difference. Much student writing
is unclear on this important distinction. It is a common weakness that undermines otherwise good
work.

                                                         EXAMPLE 4.5

             There is clear evidence that recidivism rates remain unacceptably high in Victoria.
             For example, among males aged between 25 to 40 years who leave a Victorian
             prison after a term of 24 months or more, the recidivism rate (for indictable
             offences committed within 12 months of release) is 43%.5
                                                                                                                                                              49

               ________

             5 Juno Nakagawa, `Recidivism Rates Among Ex-Prisoners in Victoria, 2010-2020'
             (2022) 23(1) Australasian Journal of Comparative Criminological Studies 45, 47.

This style of citation implies that you have adopted the information or opinion provided by someone
else. That is, you have accepted Nakagawa's claim and are repeating it as a claim you yourself are
making. In contrast, if you simply wanted to report that Nakagawa says that 43 per cent of inmates
reoffend within 12 months of release, then you should cite Nakagawa as described in section 4.3.2.
That style of reporting does not imply that you adopt Nakagawa's claim as your own or one that you
endorse.
   50

 4.4 What are plagiarism and inadequate referencing?

 4.4.1 Plagiarism

  The Encyclopaedic Australian Legal Dictionary defines `plagiarism' as `the act of using in one's
  own work the written expression of another person's ideas and knowledge without acknowledging
  the authorship and source of the material used.'1
  Clearly, there can be different degrees of seriousness when it comes to plagiarism. Directly copying
  one sentence without acknowledgment is at the lower end of the spectrum compared with
  downloading an entire article from the internet, removing the author's name and presenting it as your
  own work. But be aware that all degrees of plagiarism are treated seriously. There can be various
  academic penalties (e.g. loss of marks, failing an assessment, failing a subject). For law students,
  a finding of plagiarism can have added negative consequences when you apply for admission to
  practice as a lawyer.2

 4.4.2 Unintentional inadequate referencing

  Inadequate referencing can be problematic, even where a student has not engaged in plagiarism.
  While you are still studying, it is highly unlikely that you will be an authority on whatever you are
  being asked to write about, so you will rely heavily on other people's ideas. When you do your
  research, take detailed notes - including the referencing data such as author, publication and specific
  page number - so that you can make sure that you correctly attribute your idea to the original source.
  Always ensure that you are aware of the requirements concerning referencing and check your work
  for any instances of inadequate referencing.

                          TIP: INADEQUATE REFERENCING CAN RESULT IN FAILURE
          Plagiarism is not merely inadequate citation. Nonetheless, many students cite poorly or
          inadequately even when they are not (or it appears that they are not) trying to pass off another's
          work as their own. Such students lose marks for their sloppiness. It is possible to fail because of
          inadequate citation of sources, even where there is no allegation or finding of plagiarism. Make
          sure you reference every time you use someone else's ideas, conclusions or work.

4.5 Citation styles

A citation style is a particular method or style of providing references. There are numerous different
citation styles. Whichever citation style is used in any particular work, you should be consistent in
following it.
The Australian Guide to Legal Citation: Fourth edition (AGLC4) is the style most commonly
adopted in Australian law schools and Australian legal academic journals. It is the default citation
style for the La Trobe Law School. You should get to know it well. It can be freely downloaded in
full. The La Trobe Library website has useful summaries of the AGLC4. The examples in this book
follow the AGLC4 but are not intended to be a comprehensive guide. Please refer to the AGLC for
the specific rules.

                                                                 51

 4.6 Direct copying or quoting

  Direct copying is where you reproduce exactly another person's (or other persons'1) words. It is also
  known as quoting another person.
  To acknowledge properly that you are directly copying, you must:

            indicate in your text (using single quotation marks) exactly which words you have taken
              from another person, and

            provide information about the source of those quoted words (in a footnote).

 4.6.1 Quotation marks for short quotations

  Where the quoted words amount to only three lines or less, then the words should be kept within the
  current paragraph of your text and enclosed within single quotation marks.
  An example follows. (The examples in this chapter are all made up. Imagine they are extracts from
  student assignments.)

                                                           SHORT QUOTE

                ... to maintain and promote individuals' freedom. As the American legal scholar
                Lon Fuller put it, `[t]he desideratum of clarity represents one of the most essential
                ingredients of legality.'8 Indeed, it is almost impossible to ...
                ________
                8 Lon L. Fuller, The Morality of Law (Yale University Press, rev ed, 1969) 63.

  Note how Fuller's words are reproduced exactly as they appear in the original source and are clearly
  indicated by using single quotation marks (` '), which set them apart from your own words. (If you
  have a `quotation within a quotation', use double quotation marks (" ") for the inner quote.)
  The relevant information about the source of the quotation is contained in the footnote (here it is
  the eighth footnote in your assignment). The footnote tells the reader that the quoted words are from
  page 63 of the revised edition of Lon Fuller's book The Morality of Law, published in 1969 by Yale
  University Press.
  Note also how a few introductory words (`As the American legal scholar Lon Fuller put it') preface
  the actual quotation. This is preferable to going straight into reproducing Fuller's words without

1. For the rest of this chapter, read the singular as including the plural in this sort of context.

                                                                    52
                                                                                                                                                              53

saying anything to alert the reader that Fuller is about to be quoted. It is generally better to let the
reader know you are about to quote someone (or that you have done so, after the quotation). It also
helps to integrate their words into yours.
Finally, note also that the first letter of the quoted words from Fuller has been put into lower case and
placed in square brackets. This indicates that you have altered it from upper case (in the original) in
order to make the quoted words fit into the grammatical structure of your own sentence.
As a law student, you will often need to quote from cases and statutes. The method for doing so is
the same as above.

                                                   QUOTE FROM A CASE

             ... in criminal justice. This principle is perhaps most famously articulated in R v
             Williscroft, in which Adam and Crockett JJ said that `every sentence imposed

4.6.2 Indented paragraphs for long quotations

Where the words to be quoted are longer than three lines (in your text), identify them by putting them
in a distinct indented paragraph within your own paragraph. `Indented' here just means the first word
of each line is moved in from the left margin.
54

                                                      INDENTED QUOTE

Note that here the indented paragraph appears in a smaller font size and no quotation marks are used.
The same sort of information about the source of the quoted words appears in a footnote.
Alternatively, quotes can be introduced in a way that splits the quoted words into a first part which
appears in quotation marks in the text and a second part which appears in an indented paragraph.
                                                                                                   55

4.6.3 A common error: quotations without either quotation marks or
an indented paragraph

If you reproduce another person's words exactly but do not use quotation marks or an indented
paragraph, then you are effectively claiming that the words are yours - and that is fundamentally
misleading. An example of what not to do follows.

                                             EXAMPLE OF BAD PRACTICE

             ... to maintain and promote individuals' freedom. The desideratum of clarity
             represents one of the most essential ingredients of legality.8 Indeed, it is almost
             impossible to conceive of a legal system where such a criterion was ...

               ________

             8 Lon L. Fuller, The Morality of Law (Yale University Press, rev ed, 1969) 63.

Here it is not possible to tell which are your words and which are Fuller's. It is not sufficient to put the
footnote reference after the quoted words and leave out the quotation marks or indentations, because
that does not indicate that the words are not yours. By merely putting in the footnote reference to
Fuller, you are effectively only indicating, at best, that you are paraphrasing Fuller's text or that
                                                                                                                                                              57

Fuller's text was the source of the ideas. As Fuller's text was the source of the very words themselves,
you are therefore misleading the reader. This is a common error and a good way to lose marks.
58

4.7 Paraphrasing

Paraphrasing is rewriting another person's words in your own words, while still presenting them as
expressing that other person's ideas. Just how you might phrase your paraphrase will depend on a
great variety of things; there is no fixed set of rules governing this art. Explaining or interpreting
someone else's text in your own words can sometimes be difficult, but being able to paraphrase well
is a very important skill and worth working hard at developing.
It is often better to paraphrase instead of quoting because paraphrasing requires you to understand
the original idea in order to communicate it adequately to your reader. It demonstrates your
understanding more clearly if the text is in your own words, rather than a direct recitation of someone
else's words.

                                       TIP: PARAPHRASING IS RE-PHRASING
       Good paraphrasing helps you to convey to your reader that you have not just located some relevant
       passage from another person's work but have also actually understood it. Note, however, that
       paraphrasing is not just changing some key words but leaving the rest intact. It involves a full
       restatement - or re-phrasing - of the ideas underpinning the original quote.

It is still necessary, when paraphrasing, to indicate that this is what you are doing and to provide
proper information about the source of the paraphrased content both in the text and in the footnote.
However, indicating that you are paraphrasing cannot be done by way of quotation marks or indented
paragraphs. It is a more subtle matter of using your own words to indicate that you are paraphrasing
another. This can be done in many ways.

4.7.1 How to paraphrase

Because paraphrasing is a much more creative art than simple quotation, it is probably best to
provide several examples of how a short passage may be paraphrased. The paraphrased passage in
the examples below is from the Fuller text used above. Remember that the original quote is: `The
desideratum of clarity represents one of the most essential ingredients of legality.'

                                                                 58
                                                                                                                                                              59

             ... to maintain and promote individuals' freedom. Fuller maintains that this desired
             clarity is a necessary element for something to count as law.8 Indeed, it is almost
             impossible to conceive of a legal system where such a criterion ...

             ... to maintain and promote individuals' freedom. It is a requirement for any legal

             8 Lon L. Fuller, The Morality of Law (Yale University Press, rev ed, 1969) 63.

In these first two examples, you are making it explicit in your text that you are paraphrasing Fuller's
words, and your footnote gives the reader the source of the original text.

             8 Lon L. Fuller, The Morality of Law (Yale University Press, rev ed, 1969) 63.

In this third example, you have not referred to Fuller explicitly in your text, but you have more
obliquely indicated that you are expounding someone else's idea. It is only in the footnote that you
expressly mention Fuller. This is acceptable as this still indicates the ideas come from Fuller.

             ... to maintain and promote individuals' freedom. Indeed, clarity is so important that
             laws that lack sufficient clarity may not qualify as laws at all.8 Indeed, it is almost
             impossible to conceive of a legal system where ...

               ________

             8 Lon L. Fuller, The Morality of Law (Yale University Press, rev ed, 1969) 63.

This last example is acceptable but close to the borderline (and very common among early law
students). The text gives no indication that you are paraphrasing another; only the provision of the
footnote indicates this. This style is acceptable, so long as it is clear from the context that this is
what you are doing. It is usually safer to include some textual indication as well, as in the first two
examples in this section.

4.7.2 A common weakness: overly thin paraphrases

Because it can sometimes be hard to think of your own way of expressing someone else's words
(especially when the other person says it so well already), there is a temptation to `rewrite' the
original passage by substituting only one or two words. This sort of `thin' paraphrase is really more
like a quotation than a proper paraphrase - and if you have thereby effectively quoted the original but
not used quotation marks or an indented paragraph, then you will be courting trouble. This is because
it will look like an inadequately referenced, and indeed inaccurate, quotation.
A bad example of a paraphrase (using Fuller's text again) follows.
                                                                                                                                                              61

             ... to maintain and promote individuals' freedom. The desirable clarity is one of the
             most essential ingredients of legality.8 Indeed, it is almost impossible to conceive
             of a legal system where such a criterion was not made central to ...

               ________

             8 Lon L. Fuller, The Morality of Law (Yale University Press, rev ed, 1969) 63.

The above example looks like a paraphrase when it is in fact such a thin paraphrase that it is almost
a direct quotation.

                          TIP: EITHER PARAPHRASE PROPERLY OR JUST QUOTE
       If you are paraphrasing, make a proper job of it and recast the whole passage being paraphrased,
       making your words sufficiently different from the original passage.
       If you really are unable to put an idea into different words, just quote it.
       A good essay, or other piece of work, will have a combination of quotes and paraphrasing but the
       balance should be in favour of paraphrasing. Again, putting information into your own words is
       the best way to show you have understood it.

It can sometimes be difficult to judge whether your rewritten version of the original is a proper
paraphrase. Moreover, what counts as `too thin' can vary according to whether you are paraphrasing
an original work by an author, a judgment or a statute. Again, there are no fixed rules for determining
this.

                                          TIP: PARAPHRASE ACCURATELY
       When trying to avoid an overly thin paraphrase, be careful not to be too creative and make your
       words so different from the original text that you end up misrepresenting it. A paraphrase should
       still aim to present an accurate picture of the paraphrased text.
       You should also put down the thesaurus: do not simply look for synonyms to replace words in the
       original phrase. Often in the law, not all synonyms are created equal.
62

4.7.3 Paraphrasing legal authorities

It will sometimes be appropriate to paraphrase legal authorities such as cases and statutes.
Paraphrasing such texts is usually more constrained than paraphrasing original works by private
authors, because you must be even more careful not to misrepresent what the terms of the law are.
This is especially so for legislation, which, unlike the common law, is in fixed written form.

                           TIP: BE WARY OF PARAPHRASING TECHNICAL TERMS
       Law can be technical and a word in law can have a different meaning to the same word in a non-
       law context. A good rule of thumb is that when dealing with law from cases or statutes, you should
       adopt the language of the original source rather than change it to something that means essentially
       the same thing.

It will often be safer to quote directly the specific words of a statutory provision or a judicial
decision rather than risk a misleading paraphrase by straying too far from the actual text. Sometimes,
though, the demands of space or the nature of the task you are engaged in make paraphrasing the
law appropriate instead. As always, one needs to exercise good judgment in particular cases about
whether it is best to paraphrase or to quote directly.
Here is an example of an acceptable paraphrase of the passage from R v Williscroft quoted earlier.
(To get a sense of what makes it acceptable, you will need to know the context of the original. This
point goes for virtually all paraphrasing.)

                                             PARAPHRASE FROM A CASE

             Williscroft. In this case, Adam and Crockett JJ held that all sentences involve the
             judge intuitively bringing together the different purposes of punishment in order to
             settle upon a particular sentence.8 Whether this is ...

When paraphrasing legislation, it is usually best to stick even more closely to the text than when
paraphrasing academic authors or even legal judgments.
The following acceptable paraphrase is of the statutory provision quoted earlier.
                                                                                                                                              63

4.8 Using facts or information from another

When you make factual claims or present any sort of information, it is essential that you indicate the
source(s) of your information. This is primarily to allow your readers to go to the original source to
confirm the facts or information for themselves. In turn, this helps to bolster the credibility of your
own assertion of these facts.
Here is part of an original passage from Aitken and Orr to allow you to see how it was presented in
the original.

                                                            ORIGINAL

       From Guy Aitken and Robert Orr, Sawer's The Australian Constitution (Australian Government
       Solicitor, 3rd ed, 2002) 155-6:

             The history of constitutional reform in Australia is littered with failed attempts. Of
             the 44 proposals put, only the following eight proposals were carried:

                         Section 13 was amended in 1907 ...
                         Section 105 was amended in 1910 ...
             ...
             The 44 proposals were put at 19 separate referendums. Referendums can be held
             at the same time as general elections, and on nine of the 19 occasions this has
             occurred.

The next example shows how that information could be paraphrased.

                                                        PARAPHRASE

             ... efforts at constitutional reform. There have been 44 proposals to amend the

             coincided with general elections.8 Australians have mostly been ...

                                                                                                                                                              65

             Government Solicitor, 3rd ed, 2002) 155-6.

Remember, if you fail to indicate the source(s) of your information, you are effectively claiming to
be the source of that information yourself. If this is not the case, then you are misleading the reader.
Making factual claims with no reference to your sources is, then, another good way to lose marks. Of
course, there will sometimes be things that are commonly known or easily confirmed and so do not
usually need to be referenced, like the name of the current Chief Justice of Australia or the fact that
Australia is a federation. But there may be occasions when it is wise to provide references even for
such matters as these. As always, much depends on the context and nature of your writing task.

                                         TIP: CREDIT WHERE CREDIT IS DUE
       Whenever you give information to your reader which you have found from some place other than
       your own experience, always provide a source.
66

4.9 Using ideas directly from another

If you take an idea from someone else but you are neither quoting them nor paraphrasing any
particular text of theirs, you must still indicate where you got the idea from. If you do not, you will
appear to be claiming that the idea is your own, and if that is not so, then you will run the risk of
plagiarism. Ideas can be plagiarised just as easily as words.

             govern conduct, but if a society is to be recognised as having a legal system as

It is sometimes permissible to drop the reference to the other person in your text, and simply indicate
with a footnote that you are taking the idea from someone else.

             8 H. L. A. Hart, The Concept of Law (Oxford University Press, 2nd ed, 1994)
             91-99.

In both examples, the idea about primary and secondary rules has been taken from the English legal

                                                                 66

philosopher H. L. A. Hart, but there is no specific passage of his that is being quoted or paraphrased.
Rather, the text in the examples is a summary statement of Hart's much longer and more complex
discussion in his book The Concept of Law.

If you fail to indicate that this is so (whether explicitly in the text with accompanying footnote or
by footnote only), then you run the risk of committing plagiarism. Again, this is because you will be
presenting these ideas about primary and secondary rules as your ideas when they are in fact Hart's.

What if you think of an idea yourself but later find that someone else, say Bloggs, has already written
about it? As Bloggs is not in fact your source for the idea, then it is not appropriate to cite Bloggs
as if they were your source. However, it can be good scholarship to make reference to Bloggs as a
further source for the idea. But where Bloggs is in fact your source, do not be tempted to pretend that
your thought was merely congruent with, rather than derived from, Bloggs. That is plagiarism. The
best way to avoid the risk of failing to cite an authority you did not even know about is to make sure
you conduct thorough research at the outset.

4.10 Advice on note taking to avoid inadequate referencing

It is important that your study methods help you to maintain good referencing practices and avoid
plagiarism and inadequate referencing.
One well-known trap is to make poor notes from your reading which you later use when writing up
your essay or writing in an examination. For example, if you copy a text verbatim when you are
studying but do not indicate this in your notes, then there is a real risk that you may later go to those
notes when writing an assignment or sitting an exam and write out `your' notes - without adequate
or even any acknowledgement of the original source. That will lead to allegations of plagiarism or,
at best, inadequate referencing.
If you are making notes when studying a text (whether a legal authority, a commentary or any other
material), give yourself sufficient information to enable you to use those notes later without fear of
transgressing the rules on referencing. Whether you are copying material verbatim or paraphrasing a
text or noting information gathered from some sources, always note to yourself what you are doing
and take down the relevant information you will need later. If you make the right notes at the right
time, you will save yourself time and effort later trying to find the original sources and references.

                                       TIP: KEEP TRACK OF PAGE NUMBERS
       Always record the page number in your notes so that you can include it in your footnote. This
       helps you and your reader trace the original inspiration for your work to the exact source. It also

Chapter 5: Case briefs

5.1 Introduction

The previous four chapters have provided general advice about writing in law school. This and the
next three chapters turn to advice on specific kinds of documents you will be asked to write in law
school. In this chapter we focus on case briefs, a common task for law students and one which helps
to provide a firm foundation for other legal writing skills.
This chapter is intended to help students understand what is involved in writing case briefs. In
particular, this chapter explores:

          what a case brief is
          when a case brief can and/or should be used
          what a case brief must contain.
An annotated sample case brief is also included at the end of the chapter.

                                                                 69

5.2 What is a case brief?

A case brief is a concise summary of a judge's reasons for a decision in a particular case. It is a
lawyer's summary; that is, it is a summary intended to help a lawyer understand the case. This means
that the case brief picks out the key things that a lawyer needs to know about the case. It also means
that a case brief is likely to be different to how an historian or a psychologist might summarise a
case.
To non-lawyers, judges' reasons for their decisions will often appear to be arcane pieces of writing
that are difficult to understand. As a lawyer, you must be able to understand, analyse and use these
technical documents. Preparing a case brief is a useful way to unlock the value in a legal judgment.
Generally, a case brief is a neutral or objective summary of the case. It does not provide criticism of
the case or an opinion about the merits or demerits of the decision or reasoning. The goal is simply to
understand the case in its own, legal terms. There may be occasions where you are asked to provide a
critique of a case, or find a way to distinguish it (i.e. not follow it as a precedent), or suggest ways to
reform and improve the law as stated in that case. But a case brief as such does not have that purpose.
You should assume that if you are asked to write a case brief, it is to be objective and neutral and just
focused on the case itself.
Note that terminology can vary, but generally `case brief' and `case summary' are used to refer to
this kind of descriptive, informative writing about a legal case. In contrast `case note' is often used
to refer to writing about a case that covers much of what a case brief covers but also goes on to
provide some analysis. That analysis may involve going deeper into the background, significance or
implications of the case and may involve a critical assessment or evaluation of the case. In this way,
a case note involves persuasive as well as descriptive writing. In this chapter we are concerned with
the more descriptive task. If you are in doubt about which you are being asked to write, always seek
confirmation before beginning.

                                                                 70
                                                                                                                                                              71

5.3 What is a case brief for?

There are various contexts in which you will want or need to prepare a case brief. First, writing case
briefs will help you with your own study of the law. We recommend that you prepare case briefs for
all the prescribed reading cases in your law subjects. This will help you to understand the law much
better than just reading the cases and will come in handy when it is time to revise for exams.
Second, you may find that when you enter the legal profession you will be asked to provide a case
brief (or case summary or case note). This could happen in various professional contexts. You may be
asked to provide a case brief as part of assisting a more senior lawyer in relation to a particular case.
Or your supervisor might ask for a case brief to help them keep up to date with recent developments
in the law. You may also be asked to provide case summaries for educational material for clients in
your law firm's client newsletter. (Note that the different audiences would entail different approaches
to style and content, since you would not want to present a lawyer's summary to a lay client.)

                                                                 71

5.4 What must a case brief contain?

Case briefs can vary in form and length, depending on the context. The following table shows one
commonly used template for case briefs.

1 Name of case Give the correct name of the case, which is usually the parties' names.

2 Citation Give the correct citation(s) for the case.

3 Court                Identify the name of the court and the names of the particular judge(s)
                       giving the judgment.

4 Material facts       Outline very briefly the factual circumstances which give rise to the issues
                       ultimately adjudicated on and material to the court's holdings.

                       Outline very briefly how the dispute got to the court, including, where

5 Procedural relevant, the nature of the action, the remedy sought, the process by which the case was commenced (e.g. writ, application, police charges) and
history
                       (if the matter is on appeal) any lower court decisions already made in the

                       matter.

6 Issues               Identify clearly and precisely the legal or factual issue(s) addressed by the
                       court in the judgment.

                       Identify the decision of the court on each of those issues. Those decisions
                       are known as `holdings' or `held points'. They are what the court decided
                       or held on those issues. These will usually form the key legal principles
                       for which the case will stand as authority.

7 Holdings             The holdings of the court will necessarily be those of the majority judges.
                       Sometimes there is no clear majority holding on a particular issue, even
                       though a majority of the court agreed on the practical outcome of the
                       case. In such cases, identify the holdings of each of the majority judges.

8 Reasons              Where a court makes a decision about a factual issue (i.e. it decides what
                       actually happened), that decision is called a `finding' of fact. In most case
9 Additional comments  briefs, you will be concerned primarily with the court's decision on legal
10 Order(s)            issues; i.e. its holdings on the legal issues.

                       Expound concisely the court's reasons for reaching those decisions or
                       held points. This is the ratio decidendi: any `indispensable factor' in the
                       court's reasoning to its conclusion. These should be taken directly from
                       the judgment with care. Some degree of paraphrase may be needed, but
                       be accurate. Where there is more than one judge, be clear as to who stated
                       the reasons and whether other judges concurred with those reasons.

                       Identify and expound comments or observations made by the court that
                       are not essential to the final decision, but which are worth noting. These
                       are `obiter dicta' (remarks made in passing). The holdings and reasoning
                       of dissenting or minority judges should be included here if they are of
                       interest or are important.

                       Identify what the court's final order(s) were; i.e. what it ordered to be done,
                       or not done, to dispose of the matter.

                                72
                                                                                                                                                              73

This template may need to be adapted to the particular case you are reading, especially where you
are asked to read only particular judges' reasons or selected passages rather than the whole case.
Nonetheless, the basic format can be followed in such cases.

Identifying these various aspects of a case is not always easy. Not every judgment is written clearly
or in a way that makes it straightforward to identify the main issues, or the ratio, or the held points.
In such cases, you will need to work harder at interpreting the case. This can involve making explicit
what is reasonably implicit in the text. That can sometimes involve some degree of reconstruction of
the judgment as you try to make clear what is implicit or inherent in the judgment. Interpretations
should, however, still be objective and neutral. Be careful not to state things as implied just because
you think they ought to have been considered.

It is acceptable to quote short passages from the judgment, especially when it comes to the key legal
principles being articulated. But keep it simple and keep it short. The task is not to find the `juicy
bits' of a judgment and just repeat them at length. Nor is the task simply to replicate the judgment
in miniature. Instead, the task is to understand, and communicate the essence of, the judgment in
concise terms. If you are quoting several sentences at a time, you are probably quoting too much.

The length of a case brief will depend on the task that you have been set and the detail of the
judgment you are dealing with. Some case briefs will be longer than others.

                                       TIP: BE CLEAR, CONCISE AND DIRECT

       Aim first for clarity and simplicity - the language used in a case brief should be clear, concise and
       direct. Write in a plain, direct manner. Do not think that because it is a legal document it must be
       written in `legalese', with complex sentence structure and lots of pretentious words and phrases.
       There will often be a need to use specific technical legal terminology. Use the relevant terms
       clearly and precisely, but try to keep them to a minimum where possible.

Chapter 6: Legal problem-solving

6.1 Introduction

One of the most common forms of assessment in law school is legal problem-solving. In very general
terms, this task usually involves giving students a hypothetical factual scenario to which they must
apply the law and reach a conclusion about the legal position of a person described in the scenario.
This application of the law to a factual scenario is a core part of legal work, whether it takes the
form of advising clients of their legal liabilities and rights, making submissions to a court or writing
judgments as a judge. The `problem to be solved' in these situations is the question `How does the
law apply to this particular situation?'
This chapter is intended to help students understand what is involved in legal problem-solving. In
particular, this chapter will:

          explain what legal problems are, both in legal practice and in law school, to give you a
            clearer sense of what the task of `solving' them can involve

          give you an overview of the main tasks most commonly performed in solving legal
            problems in law school

          provide various tips and warnings to help you develop your skills in legal problem-
            solving.

This chapter will not be enough on its own to give you those skills. Practice and experience in
tackling legal problems in your specific law subjects will be more useful. Studying examples of good
answers to legal problems will also help. (Your teacher should be able to provide or direct you to
such examples.)

                                         TIP: PUT THIS ADVICE IN CONTEXT
       As you read this chapter you may also want to have before you some legal problems from your
       current law subjects so that you can see the advice in context.

It is important to note that this chapter does not provide a rule book for legal problem-solving; it does
not lay down fixed rules to govern every answer to all legal problems. But, hopefully, it will give you
a starting point.

                                                                 75

6.2 What are legal problems?

Studying in law school is meant, among other things, to help prepare you for legal practice. This
means that it is important to see how some of the tasks you perform in law school relate to what
lawyers do in real-life legal practice. In this section, we will briefly consider legal problems in legal
practice before looking at legal problems in law school.

6.2.1 Legal problems in legal practice

                                         (a) Clients and their legal positions

A legal problem usually involves a question about a person's legal position. Accordingly, answering
or solving a legal problem usually involves identifying and making clear what that person's legal
position is. `Legal position' refers to how a person in a particular factual situation `stands in the eyes
of the law' and thus which legal rights, liabilities, obligations and so on apply to them.

Note that this is a technical conception of what a legal problem is. Some people might think they
have a legal problem when their problem has something to do with the law, such as having a tax bill
for which they had not budgeted. To a lawyer there may not be much of a legal problem here if the
law is clear that the person is obliged to pay the tax. This lay person's sense of `legal problem' is
perfectly legitimate, but it is important to note that lawyers usually mean something more specific by
this term.

In legal practice, legal problems are usually provided by lawyers' clients. Clients commonly see a
lawyer when they find themselves in situations in which their legal rights, liabilities or obligations are
unclear or somehow problematic. One of the lawyer's tasks is to work out the client's legal position,
given the facts of the client's situation.

                                                            (b) Facts

It is not always simple or easy to determine just what a client's factual situation is. Initially, the
lawyer will need to rely on what the client tells them about their situation, usually prompted by
questions from the lawyer. Sometimes what a client says about their factual situation may not be
enough or is inaccurate and further information and investigation is needed on the part of the lawyer,
such as examining relevant documents or speaking to other people with relevant knowledge.

Different people will often perceive situations and events differently. This means that `the facts'
concerning the client are rarely a complete and uncontested narrative that falls ready-made out of the
sky but will often need to be constructed from a number of sources. This is one reason why lawyers
usually make clear that their advice to clients is based on the information they have been given or
had confirmed by the client.

                                                    (c) Applying the law

Having ascertained the relevant facts, the lawyer then needs to apply the law to the client's situation
and work out what legal rights, liabilities, obligations and so on the client has. This process is meant
to be objective; the lawyer is here trying to work out what the law would most likely say about the

                                                                 76
                                                                                                                                                              77

client. It is something like predicting how a fair and reasonable judge would apply the law to the
client. What the lawyer is doing is more or less putting themselves in the shoes of a judge faced with
deciding the case. Thus, at this stage, the task is not one of advocating for a favourable outcome for
one's client, but is, rather, an impartial way of seeing how the law is likely to apply to those relevant
facts in the first instance. It will not be until later that an advocate may try to persuade a court that
the correct application of the law to the client is one that is favourable to the client. Such advocacy
does, however, build on the prior, predictive task of objectively applying the law.

                                                           (d) Advice

Sometimes a lawyer will ask another lawyer to work out the client's legal position. Thus, solicitors
sometimes ask (`brief') barristers to prepare a document (`an advice' or `an opinion') which will
explain the client's legal position. Barristers are often briefed to prepare an advice where the problem
is complex, or requires more specialist knowledge, or involves litigation. On other occasions, a senior
solicitor may ask a more junior solicitor within their firm to prepare an advice, for example, when
the senior solicitor needs to spend time on some other matter or the matter is not too complex or
specialised. Advice from lawyer to lawyer usually looks very different to advice from lawyer to
client, but the basic principles will be the same.

                                               SOME ADVICE ON `ADVICE'

       The word `advice' is a little ambiguous in law. In ordinary English, it perhaps most often means a
       recommendation of some course of action to another person. However, in the legal context it also
       has an older sense of `information'. So `to advise' someone in this sense is more a matter of giving
       them information, rather than a recommendation.
       If a lawyer does recommend a course of action to a client, then it will normally be in a conditional
       form:

               If you are not prepared to risk the costs of losing the case, then I'd recommend trying to
               settle it outside court.
       Alternatively, it may simply involve explaining what the client's various lawful options are, and
       what their consequences may be, and leaving it to the client to decide what to do.

Having worked out the client's legal position, the lawyer then needs to explain this to the client.
This explanation is also called `legal advice', and it can be quite a difficult task where the client has
trouble understanding the details of the law. The lawyer must take great care to not misrepresent the
law in order to please their client.

Of course, advising on legal problems is not the only thing that lawyers can do for clients. But it is
one of the most important ones, and it often provides the basis for many other services that lawyers
perform for clients.

6.2.2 Legal problems in law school

Given the importance of giving advice on legal problems in legal practice, learning how to do it is a
core skill to be learned in law school. This is why so much of your `black-letter law' subjects have
problem-based assessment - to get you to think like a lawyer.

In legal practice, real clients' factual situations provide the legal problems, but in law school the
factual situations are usually fictional. That is, we pretend that some factual situation has arisen
and that a make-believe client needs legal advice. Sometimes law school problems are based on
real situations (or variations of them), but the point is that students are not normally asked to give
real legal advice (indeed they are not allowed to do so). In any case, whether the facts are real or
hypothetical, given by a client or by a law teacher, the basic task is essentially much the same: to
apply the law to the given factual situation to determine a person's legal position.

                       (a) In what contexts do law students answer legal problems?

There are three main contexts in which students are asked to answer legal problems as part of their
assessment:

          legal problems in exams

          legal problems in assignments

          legal problems in moots.

                                       Legal problems in written examinations

This is perhaps the most commonly encountered context for answering legal problems in law
school - the traditional written examination where students are given a limited time to answer legal
problems they have not seen beforehand. Such examinations are usually open book (i.e. you may
consult notes and textbooks) and do not involve conducting legal research (in the library or via the
internet), as the relevant law should normally have already been covered in the subject materials.
Much of the advice in this chapter will have this traditional style of time-restricted examination in
view.

It is sometimes suggested that examinations are artificial environments that are not good simulations
of real-life legal practice. There are, for example, the stresses of working under strict time limits and
coping with material not seen before, the inability to speak to the client to get further information and
perhaps the need for further legal research to fully answer the question. However, many lawyers will
tell you that this just as accurately describes much of their experience of legal practice. The academic
context differs from legal practice in many ways, but learning to handle exams is a genuine skill that
will stand you in good stead in legal practice and, indeed, elsewhere.

                                            Legal problems in assignments

Here students are given one or more legal problems to take away and answer in their own time. This
gives you more time to plan, draft and polish your answer. This sort of assessment may sometimes
also involve conducting legal research to find the relevant law before you apply it.
                                                                                                                                                              79

                             TIP: DOES THE TASK REQUIRE LEGAL RESEARCH?

       If legal research is set as part of your legal problem-solving assignment, you should start with the
       subject materials (prescribed cases, statutory provisions, reading guide, provided case notes/
       judgments, lectures) and only do further research outside the subject materials if instructed to do
       so. It is extremely rare that a lecturer will set a problem-solving assignment where `the answer' is
       hidden somewhere out there in other cases and statutes, and your task is to go and find it by
       searching through those cases and statutes.
       Instead, in most legal problem-solving assignments, you are being assessed on your ability to
       problem-solve, not to research, and the lecturer will often be looking for an analysis using the
       materials they have provided for the subject. When in doubt, always seek clarification.

                                                 Legal problems in moots

In some subjects in law school, assessment can be by moot. This involves an oral presentation of
argument as an advocate on behalf of a pretend client before an imaginary court. As mentioned
above, advocacy is a special type of response to a legal problem, where one tries to persuade the
court that the correct application of the law is one that is favourable to one's client. In requiring
advocacy, mooting is different to the more usual type of legal problem, which calls for a more
impartial application of the law. To perform advocacy well you need to have first gone through the
more impartial task of predicting how the law will probably apply to the case. Only then can you
develop good arguments for one side or the other.

                       (b) What particular questions are posed by legal problems?

So far it may sound as if legal problems (whether in law school or in legal practice) all have the
same form. While it is true that most legal problems are variations on the generic question of `how
does the law apply to these facts?', there are, in reality, many variations on this general theme. This
means that the specific questions posed by particular legal problems can be very different in form
and content. It is essential to be alert to the differences, since answering any question well requires
knowing just what the question is. For example:

      Would it be appropriate for the police to charge Deshi with murder?

      Is Wei's hearsay evidence admissible on behalf of the prosecution case against Deshi?

      Could Deshi successfully raise the defence of self-defence?

All these questions concern the `legal position' of Deshi, understood widely. But it is essential to
appreciate that they are asking very different, specific questions.

Some law school legal problems give you guidance as to the particular issues in question, as in the
Deshi questions above. At other times the problem may simply give you a factual scenario about
some person, for example, Dinusha, and then tell you to `advise Dinusha', with no hint as to the
issues other than what is in the facts. Here you need to work out the particular issues yourself. This
takes a bit longer and you need to make sure you have identified each relevant issue before starting
to solve any legal problems.

Other problems might tell you, for example, to `discuss Vin's rights against the police'. Here the
80

`discussion' is not usually meant to be a general discussion about Vin's rights from, say, a political
science or philosophical perspective; the focus should still be on applying the law to Vin's situation
to elucidate Vin's legal position.

                                               (c) Communicative context

Learning a new kind of writing can be harder when you are unsure of what style or tone to adopt.
You can `find the right voice' in writing answers to legal problems if you can get clear on the
`communicative context' that is often assumed in legal problems in law school.

As noted in Chapter 1, there are at least four basic aspects to the context for any communication:

          the identity or role of the speaker or writer

          the identity or role of the audience or reader

          the subject matter of the communication

          the purpose of the speaker or writer.

Successful communication requires the speaker or writer to have a good understanding of each of
these four aspects of the communicative context.

At one level the communicative context in law school is quite clear: you are a student, writing for
a marker, about the law, with the (probable) purpose of getting the best mark possible. At another
level, in setting and answering legal problems in law school, we usually also adopt a fictional
communicative context. In this context, the student writes as a lawyer, for another lawyer, about a
person's situation, with the purpose of giving a reasoned and objective account of the person's legal
position.

In terms of a legal practice analogy, it may be helpful to imagine that the facts have been given to
you as a barrister in a `brief to advise' from a solicitor or as a junior solicitor in a memorandum
from a senior solicitor within your firm. At this stage, you have not spoken to the client and are not
in a position to ask the client or the solicitor for further information before submitting your advice.
But you can note in your advice where you think further information is needed, why, and what the
possibilities may be, depending on what those further facts are.

You should regard the reader of your advice as a generic lawyer. Lawyers' professional writing
for other lawyers should generally be the same no matter who the lawyer is. Further, because you
are writing to another lawyer, you should use correct legal terminology and a relatively formal or
professional style. That does not mean that you should write in a verbose, convoluted, `legalese'
style. Clarity and concision remain essential features of good legal writing. But it does mean that
you should avoid the informality and simplification that may sometimes be appropriate when directly
speaking to a client with a limited understanding of legal matters.

Finally, a couple of points should be made on the communicative style usually required by the
`advise David' kind of question. First, as noted earlier, here you are really being asked to inform
the audience of David's legal position, not primarily to make practical recommendations regarding
possible courses of action. Sometimes it can be appropriate to conclude an answer with a short,
conditional sort of recommendation (e.g. `therefore David is highly likely to be found liable in
negligence. If he wishes to minimise his financial losses, he should consider settling at the earliest
opportunity'). A conditional form of recommendation is usually best, as we cannot always say
what a client's real preferences would be (e.g. David may care more about what he sees as a
                                                                                                                                                              81

matter of principle than about his money). Moreover, unless the task asks you to present options,
any recommendations should be delivered as briefly as possible so that you can use most of your
discussion for the substantive analysis.

Second, despite the apparent grammar of the phrase `advise David', you are not normally being asked
to speak directly to the client, David, which could well require a quite different communicative style
in real life. Instead, you are usually being asked to inform an imaginary legal audience about David's
legal position. So, you should use the third person (`He is likely to be found liable to pay damages')
rather than the second person (`You are likely to be found liable to pay damages').

                                   (d) `Answering' or `solving' legal problems?

Is an answer to a legal problem a `solution' to the problem? It is very common to speak of `solving'
legal problems rather than `answering' them. However, it does run a couple of risks. First, talk
of `solving' legal problems can encourage the limiting idea that there must always be one correct
solution to a legal problem. Second, what for the lawyer is a `solution' to a problem may be a disaster
for the client. For example, your advice about a client may be that they are likely to be found guilty of
blackmail and face the prospect of up to 15 years in jail. That may be the best answer to the question
posed by the client, but the client is not likely to see it as a `solution' to their problem. Nonetheless,
the terms `solving' and `solution' are very commonly used in this context and so we will use them,
as well as using `answering' and `answer'.

6.3 How do I answer a legal problem?

This section gives a brief overview of the different basic tasks that are most commonly required when
preparing an answer to a legal problem in law school. These tasks or functions are described only
very generically here. Various aspects of these tasks will be elaborated on in section 6.4.

It cannot be over-emphasised that there is no fixed formula for answering legal problems. For one
thing, problems differ, so even if there were a formula for one kind of problem, that may well not
apply to other kinds of problems. In any case, even if there were just one kind of problem, there is
no fixed rule book applying to that one kind. So do not take the following as providing a fixed set of
steps that must be rigidly followed in all cases.

Moreover, as you consider each of these tasks in relation to particular problems, you should bear in
mind all the other steps as you go. That is to say, working out the answer to a legal problem is not
a linear process whereby one step can be completed in isolation from the other steps. Instead, each
stage is influenced by the other stages. You need to be aware of the whole as you attend to particular
steps, while also being aware that the whole is ultimately made up of particular steps.

This also means that, though your preparations might follow the same structure, the way you actually
go about writing your answer may not follow the same structure. In any event, the steps below will
assist significantly in your preparations, even if they do not exactly match the structure of your final
written answer.

Below we explore the process of answering a legal problem following a basic six-step structure
(more or less extracted from the IRAC method, which is summarised at the end):

          Step 1: Read the facts
          Step 2: Read the task you have been set
          Step 3: Identify the legal issues
          Step 4: Identify the relevant legal rules
          Step 5: Apply the rules to the facts
          Step 6: Reach a conclusion

Step 1: Read the facts

First you need to know the facts of the situation, as given to you. Read them carefully and thoroughly,
a couple of times if necessary. Identify the main people or entities in the scenario and their
relationships to each other. (It can sometimes help to do a rough sketch map of these.) Think about
what these people and entities are likely to want (e.g. compensation, the return of their property, an
acquittal). Note any gaps and areas where more information is needed to give a fuller answer.

As you read the facts, also consider whether they remind you of any of the factual scenarios in
the relevant cases (precedents) you have studied. As you study the precedents in various areas (e.g.
medical negligence, confessions), you will often see similar types of factual scenarios. When some
new set of facts sufficiently resembles the fact patterns of precedents, the relevant rules found in
those precedents will normally apply to the new facts.

                                                                 82
                                                                                                                                                              83

Whether some new set of facts really does fit the pattern or whether the new facts are
`distinguishable' (i.e. the new facts do not fit the pattern) is often one of the key threshold issues to be
worked out. Grappling with whether the facts of an apparent precedent case are properly analogous
to those of a current case or whether the precedent can in fact be distinguished from the new case is
a key part of the case-law reasoning that is central to the common law.

                                  TIP: DO THE NEW FACTS SOUND FAMILIAR?

       With this sort of thing in mind, lecturers will often draw from established cases that you have been
       studying to create new factual scenarios. They will change key facts that create a novel twist,
       which will then usually raise the question of whether the new facts fit any patterns found in the
       precedents and so bring the case under the scope of those precedents.

In short, do not just read the facts as if you were reading a short story. Read them with a lawyer's eyes
to see what resemblances and what differences can be discerned in relation to existing precedents.
This also means that the more familiar you are with existing precedents, the better will be your legal
reading of the new facts.

Step 2: Read the task you have been set
What is your specific task? Regardless of what you think the question might be about or should be
about, what are you actually being asked to do? The question may not always be asking how a client
can get what they ultimately want. Read the question very carefully. For example, have you been
asked simply to `advise Dorothy' or have you been asked to `advise on the admissibility of Dorothy's
recorded confession to the police at 7 am on 3 April 2021'?

As already stressed, while the generic task is often similar across legal problems, the particular
question asked is vitally important. It does not matter how amazing your legal analysis is if it does
not answer the specific question posed.

Step 3: Identify the legal issues raised
What legal issues are raised by the facts as given? What questions or potentially disputed legal points
could be raised? For example, in relation to the admissibility of Dorothy's confession, is the issue
whether Dorothy's confession to the police was voluntary, or whether the police have satisfied the
statutory recording requirements, or indeed are both (and even other) issues raised?

                                                        (a) Sub-issues

Within each main issue, what sub-issues, if any, are raised? To put it another way, what smaller
questions do you need to answer to be able to answer the bigger, overarching question raised by
the scenario. The sub-issues raised will often correspond to the elements of a particular cause of
action or criminal offence. For example, if the question asks whether Vivian has a claim in the tort of
negligence, then you will often have a clear set of sub-issues to be addressed, matching the elements
of negligence: was there a duty of care, was the duty breached and was material damage caused by
the breach?
84

In other problems there may be alternative ways in which a main issue could be settled. For example,
if the main issue regarding Dorothy's confession is whether it was voluntary, is the sub-issue whether
Dorothy was subject to oppressive conduct or whether she was induced by a person in authority? Do
not assume that a particular issue is raised in a problem simply because your notes include that issue
under the relevant general heading. Look at the facts to see whether they do in fact raise that issue.

                                                   (b) Spotting the issue

`Spotting the issue' is a key skill, but there is no simple, generic formula for how to do this. Often
you will be better able to identify the relevant issues if you are familiar with the relevant precedents
and the relevant rules of law (statutory or case law). Through recognising resemblances and having a
sense of how the reasoning of precedents would be extended to the new case, you will find spotting
the issues in the new case easier. In this way, it can be really helpful to draw up checklists, tables or
flowcharts from the facts and materials you have been given to aid issue spotting.

Also, where you are asked a specific question about the facts (as in law school problems, but not
always in legal practice), that question may provide a guide to what the relevant issues are.

In identifying issues, bear in mind all the other aspects of answering legal problems: the facts, the
question posed, the relevant rules of law and how those rules might apply to the facts. This reinforces
the point made earlier: the process of preparing answers to legal problems is non-linear, as each part
of the process influences the other.

How is it best to phrase issues? It will often depend on the context, but usually it will help to pose
issues by putting `whether' in front of the relevant proposition (e.g. `whether Dorothy's confession
was voluntary' or `whether the police satisfied the recording requirements') or by phrasing the issue
in terms of a question (e.g. `Was Dorothy's confession voluntary?' or `Did the police satisfy the
recording requirements?'). You can also use these questions, or a phrase indicating the issue, as
headings to make the document even clearer.

                                        TIP: LEAVE EMOTION AT THE DOOR

       You should avoid emotive language when identifying the issues. There will often be important
       value questions raised by the facts, and it can be tempting to bring out those aspects. But you need
       to focus on the legal issues and identify them as legal issues, clearly, precisely and neutrally.

Step 4: Identify the relevant legal rules

What are the relevant rules of law that apply to the identified issues? What, for example, are the legal
requirements for recording a confession, and what exceptions, if any, are there to these requirements?
What cases (with what ratio decidendi) are the applicable precedents? What statutory laws are
applicable? Note that you will draw on your knowledge of the law in identifying the issues in the
first place.

Identifying the relevant rule is not always a simple or straightforward task. It can sometimes involve
a significant degree of interpretation and argument. Thus, sometimes one of the issues to be decided
in your answer is the very question of just what the law is that is applicable to the facts. For example,
                                                                                                                                                              85

the current authority in Victoria of a 40-year-old English case on police searches may be in doubt, or
the correct verbal formulation of a legal rule may be unsettled.

                                      TIP: USE THE LAW TO IDENTIFY ISSUES
       Sometimes the issues will not be clear from a hypothetical scenario alone and you will need to
       refer to the relevant law to identify all of the issues raised.
       For example, if you are dealing with a provision from legislation, you can often tease out the
       words of the provision and create a checklist of elements that need to be established/satisfied. The
       same can be said for the ratio decidendi (reasons for decision) from precedents. Sometimes your
       lecture notes or readings will give you an idea of the elements you need to look for.
       Wherever possible, use the existing law to help identify the issues or, at least, where to look for
       the issues.

Step 5: Apply the rules to the facts
How exactly should the relevant legal rules be applied to the facts of the case? Which bits of
which rules apply to which bits of which facts? For example, do the facts given satisfy each of the
requirements for an admissible recorded confession? If not, are the exceptions satisfied by the facts?

This is usually the hardest and trickiest part in answering legal problems, for, among other
difficulties, it may not be clear-cut how a general and perhaps vaguely formulated rule applies to
the particular facts in front of you. Rules that sound clear and sensible in the abstract can often
become frustratingly vague and uncooperative when brought face to face with the nitty-gritty of
factual situations.

                                   TIP: DO NOT SIMPLY RE-STATE THE FACTS
       It is important that you do not simply restate or summarise facts in your analysis. The reader will
       have had access to the problem question and will largely be familiar with the facts. Restating them
       will waste your limited word count and you need that for your analysis. To the extent that you
       need to refer to the facts, make sure they are vital to your analysis (directly applicable to the issues
       and rules you have identified) and communicated succinctly.

Not every factual situation given in a legal problem (either in law school or in legal practice) will fit
neatly into the existing categories of the law. Do not expect the facts always to be readily captured by
the existing rules. Indeed, as noted above, the facts in law school problems are very often constructed
precisely to pose a problem in this regard. Dealing with such mismatches is a key part of common law
reasoning, as the development of the common law has for centuries thrived on mismatches between
new facts and existing rules. It is one of the main ways in which new precedents are developed.

Despite the difficulties you may encounter in connecting rules and facts, bringing the law to bear on
86

the facts is crucial in answering legal problems. Do not just state the relevant law and then shy away
from applying it to the facts in the hope that the rules will apply themselves or the reader will finish
the task for you. That task is yours, and if you do not apply the law to the facts, you will probably
fail the question.

                                TIP: APPLY THE LAW, DON'T JUST ANALYSE IT
       Students sometimes stumble when answering problem questions by providing only an analysis of
       the facts, or only an analysis of the law, when what they need to do is go on to apply the law to the
       facts. This leads to an incomplete response that does not adequately answer the issues identified.

Step 6: Reach a conclusion
What is the result of applying the rules to the facts? How are the issues you have identified actually
answered? What is the relevant resulting legal position of the person (or people) whose factual
situation you have been considering? Will the law provide the remedy that the person seeks?

As always, the conclusion should answer the question asked. For example, if the original question
was `advise on the admissibility of Dorothy's recorded confession to the police at 7 am on 3 April
2021', your conclusion may be that Dorothy's confession is unlikely to be found to be involuntary
and so will be admissible on that point but is likely to be found to be inadmissible due to the breach
of the statutory recording requirements by police.

If a conclusion can only be tentative (e.g. because the evidence is not certain, or the law is
undeveloped or unclear), give an appropriately qualified conclusion. Conclusions must be clear, but
they need not always be certain. Sometimes the best answer is one that is appropriately tentative or
qualified.

                                                    TIP: FINISH THE JOB
       Never leave it to your reader to work out your conclusion, no matter how obvious you think you
       have made it. Always state explicitly the conclusion that you want your reader to take away from
       your analysis. This is useful from a persuasion point of view but also prevents misinterpretation or
       misunderstanding of your conclusion.

Summary: IRAC
To summarise the above processes, it can be useful to remember the acronym `IRAC' for `issues,
rules, application and conclusion'. There are various acronyms in the literature on legal problems.
They all point in more or less the same direction.

This acronym does not provide a formula or fixed structure for answering legal problems. It is more a
heuristic device; that is, a tool to help you work through a problem but which will need to be adapted
                                                                                                                                                              87

and developed as you use it in particular cases. IRAC should at least help to remind you of the main
basic tasks that most legal problems require you to perform in some way in properly answering them.
A good answer demonstrates that each of these tasks has been performed.

                                    TIP: CONSIDER STARTING WITH THE END

       Think of IRAC as your `working out'. Before you start to construct your full sentences and multi-
       paragraph answers, IRAC can help you identify the relevant answers to make the whole process
       significantly easier.
       Sometimes it can be useful to adopt a `CIRAC' approach in which you state your conclusion at the
       start and at the end of your answer so that your reader knows the context in which your answer
       sits from the beginning.
       For example, instead of starting with:

             The issue is whether Dorothy's recorded confession to the police at 7 am on 3 April
             2021 is admissible

       you could start with

             Dorothy's recorded confession to the police at 7 am on 3 April 2021 is likely
             inadmissible. This is because [identify the sub-issues here that will lead your
             reader to your conclusion].

       Note that you should add this part in after you are satisfied with your analysis. Do not construct
       an analysis to suit the conclusion you want before you have established that the law and the facts
       work together to support that conclusion.
88

6.4 Tips and warnings

This section contains tips and warnings which elaborate on some of the points made in section 6.3.
They mainly concern answering legal problems in time-restricted examinations.

6.4.1 Plan your answer

It is essential that you take time to plan your answers. This is usually a key step in producing well-
structured answers. It may feel counterintuitive but if you have one hour to answer a question, taking
five to 10 minutes to plan your answer is time very well spent. It is usually best to first identify the
main issues to be addressed and sketch a coherent overall plan based around those issues. You can
then `sub-plan' the sections within that bigger picture. However, you do not need to plan every step
of your answer before you write. A plan is not a rough draft of your answer.

                                 TIP: USE A PLAN TO KEEP TRACK OF THINGS
       Whether you have one hour under exam conditions or a week with research time, a plan will keep
       you on track while you are writing your answer and enable you to make sure that you address all
       of the points you want to make.

6.4.2 Answer the question

A quick way to lose marks is to fail to answer the question. There are at least three ways to fail to
answer the question. The first one is to fail to write anything at all. (That will get zero marks.) The
second way is to write something which does not answer the question actually asked. (Perhaps it
answers a question the student wishes had been asked.) A third way is to write something that is on
track to answering the question but ends before a conclusion is articulated in answer to the question.
While this third way is the lesser of these three failings, it is still best to finish your answer and state
your conclusion explicitly.
Do not avoid coming to a conclusion just because you are not sure that it is 100 per cent certain. If
the conclusion is not certain (and there is no reason to assume that all or even most answers to legal
problems must be certain), then still draw your conclusion and indicate how likely the result is that
you have identified.

                                                                 88
                                                                                                                                                              89

                            TIP: QUALIFY YOUR CONCLUSION APPROPRIATELY

       The facts and the law will not always lead you to a clear or certain conclusion. This is true both in
       law school and in legal practice. Sometimes the most reasonable conclusion can only be tentative
       or less than precise. Where this is the case, you should qualify your conclusion, noting the
       existence of the particular factors that you think are uncertain or unclear. If appropriate, use words
       like `likely' or `may' to qualify your answer without reducing its impact. Be clear about what
       aspects of your conclusion are not as clear or as certain as one might wish.

6.4.3 Give reasons for your claims

A good answer to a legal problem does not just present `the correct answer'; it shows why it is the
correct or preferable answer by presenting the arguments for it. This means that you should give
reasons why you think your answer is the right or best answer. Thus, though the conclusion reached
is very important, just as important (and sometimes more so, in terms of your assessment as a law
student) is the quality of the reasoning or argument by which you reach that conclusion. Indeed, a
large portion of the marks will be allocated to the discussion of the law's application to the facts so
an answer to a legal problem should not just provide a one-line response (e.g. `Wei's evidence is
inadmissible') but should also explain why that conclusion is the most reasonable one to draw. Never
assume that your reader will understand the reasoning for your conclusion without you having to lay
it out for them.

Significant weight is put on your reasoning because it is here that some of your most important skills
as a lawyer are shown. Over the long run, it is good legal reasoning skills, not memorising selected
areas of law, that will yield better answers.

Good reasoning skills are also usually linked to good communication skills. A finely modulated
speaking voice or a good eye for formatting a document are not worth much if what you convey
in your speech or your document is logically flawed or incoherent. Reasoning skills are essential in
enabling you to convey meaningful thoughts.

                            (a) Be explicit about the strength of your conclusions

Reasons for a conclusion should provide logical support for that conclusion. That support, however,
need not always be a matter of guaranteed certainty; it may often be more a matter of degrees of
support.

As noted above, good answers to legal problems are not always certain. The support they receive will
often be only a matter of `more likely than not' or `on the balance of probabilities'. It is important to
remember that law often does not have certain answers - indeed, that's why lawyers exist - and the
best answer one can come up with might be not at all certain. A good answer to a legal problem will,
therefore, demonstrate an awareness of the strength of its conclusion. If a tentative conclusion is the
most reasonable one, then be tentative. But be clear that that is what you are doing.

It is particularly important in law to be aware of the relative strengths of rival positions. Be alert to
alternative arguments and the degree of support they provide for rival conclusions. Sometimes there
may be almost equally good reasons for both sides of the question (or all three or four sides, for that

matter). On such occasions, one can be confident that the most reasonable conclusion is that there
is an even balance between the different arguments. However, avoid the easy way out of shrugging
one's shoulders and saying, in effect, `I do not know; the decision is up to the court'. If the arguments
are evenly balanced, you should say so.

                     TIP: CLEARLY ARTICULATED NUANCE IS STRONG, NOT WEAK

       Where there is a rival conclusion that would have a good chance of being accepted by the court,
       say so. You can say `The court will likely find X, but there is also a good chance that it will find
       Y.' Where there is important nuance, make sure to articulate it clearly and communicate not just
       why X will be the more likely outcome but also why there is a good chance that Y will be the
       outcome. An answer that fails to notice complexity and nuance when they are present is made
       weaker, not stronger, by that omission.

                                           (b) Is there no one right answer?

It is sometimes said that there is no one right answer to a legal problem, only better arguments
in support of a particular answer. A deeper point sometimes made is that there can be a `correct'
answer to a legal problem but that the correct answer is simply the conclusion to the best argument.
According to this view, the quality of the argument is the criterion for the correctness of the answer,
as there is no other mode of access to correct legal answers.

Regardless of how these theoretical questions are to be settled, it is at least clear that well-reasoned
arguments for one's conclusions are essential. You can still earn valuable marks in an exam on the
quality of your reasoning, even where your final conclusion is unfinished, or where you reach a
conclusion with which the examiner disagrees.

The converse is true, too: bad or weak arguments will lead to wrong or weak answers. Even if it is
true that there is ultimately no one right answer, not just any answer will be a good one - there can
still be plenty of bad ones. Planning your answer and following IRAC will bolster the strength of
your legal reasoning.

                                                    (c) Legal authorities

Giving reasons includes citing authorities in support of your assertions as to what the law is. This is
an essential part of the problem solving process. So, avoid merely stating a legal rule. You should
also cite the relevant case or statutory provision that is the source of the rule. Full citations are usually
not required in time-restricted examinations; abbreviated forms of citation are normally acceptable
(e.g. the case name or the statute name and section number).

Where the relevant legal rule is contentious or uncertain, it may be appropriate to critically analyse
the relevant cases or statutes and argue for a particular interpretation. For example, you could argue
that a recent statutory amendment changes the way in which an existing High Court case should be
applied. This critical analysis sometimes involves policy issues about what the law should be, but be
wary of getting too distracted by policy or interpretation issues or engaging in lengthy reviews of the
law when the question does not ask for it. Your discussion should always be directed to helping you
to answer the question.
                                                                                                                                                              91

Also, do not get too distracted by the facts of precedents. If you need to mention the facts of other
cases, stick to the relevant ones and state how they apply, or are to be distinguished, concisely. A
case brief is not required.

                             TIP: DON'T TRY QUOTING YOUR WAY TO SUCCESS

       Avoid copying out slabs of legal rules in your answer. Your skills as a textual transcriber are not
       being tested. Long quotations from cases or legislation, even where the quoted rules are relevant,
       will not advance you very far toward answering the question, especially if you do not then apply
       the rules to the facts to generate an answer. Paraphrasing the relevant principles and applying them
       directly to your scenario is much more effective.

6.4.4 Be objective and impartial

Unless you have expressly been given the task of being an advocate on behalf of one side or the other,
you should remain impartial. Legal advice is like a physician's diagnosis: an objective assessment of
the client's position (cf. a patient's medical condition), which may well not be what the client would
prefer to hear.

                                                 (a) Consider both sides

As part of being impartial and to ensure that your answer is comprehensive and well-founded, you
should consider the arguments for and against particular positions. Not every issue can be thrashed
out in detail in your written answer. Focus on the more important and more contentious issues. You
will need to judge which issues are important enough to warrant a fuller treatment.

                                                (b) Consider alternatives

Where the facts are uncertain or a legal decision could go either way and it is important which way
the matter is resolved, you should consider the alternative answers. For example, it would be a poor
answer that ran along the lines of:

      The facts do not say when Dilbert became bankrupt, so it is not possible to answer this question.

A better answer would examine the main alternatives and their consequences:

      If the date of Dilbert's bankruptcy is found to be 5 May 2003, then he may apply for an early
      discharge, and if successful he may then apply to the bank for the loan before the vendor's offer
      lapses. However, if the date of bankruptcy is found to be after that date, then he will not be able
      to apply for an early discharge and will therefore be unable to apply for the loan before the offer
      lapses.

6.4.5 Be relevant

A common weakness in student answers is failing to keep answers relevant to the issues. Read the
question closely and think carefully about what issues are raised. Make sure that your answer is
always in some way contributing to answering the issues raised. Students often go off on tangents by
92

mis-identifying the relevant issue and discussing matters at cross-purposes with the problem at hand.
This is why taking time to identify all of the issues at the beginning is so important - strong issue
spotting makes it easier to tell what is relevant.

Relevance is sometimes a matter of degree and there can be reasonable disagreement about it.
However, it is part of your legal training to develop a sense of legal relevance and, importantly, a
capacity to show how something is relevant to something else.

6.4.6 Cover all the main issues

Even if what you write is relevant, it may not be all that is relevant. In other words, there is the
problem of covering only some of the main issues and leaving others out. A common weakness in
student answers is to grab hold of the first issue spotted and dart off to write about that one issue,
without a backward glance to the other issues left by the wayside. If you do not spot all the relevant
main issues, your answer will be incomplete. This is a good way to lose significant marks. It is
usually worthwhile to take time to think carefully about what the issues are and to plan your answer
accordingly.

Not every conceivable issue is worth pursuing, and so you will often have to make a judgment as to
which issues are the `main' issues and should be addressed and which are the more peripheral ones
that you can afford to bypass. Being able to identify the difference is an essential legal skill.

                          TIP: COVER SMALL BUT NECESSARY ISSUES, BRIEFLY

       Just because you have decided an issue is not, on the facts, a central issue, you may still need to
       address it for your answer to be complete if the issue relates to a necessary part of the relevant
       legal test. You can often tell if an issue is `central' by its uncertainty or contentiousness within the
       particular problem. Where you need to address an issue that is not central, but is still necessary to
       your analysis, be brief.
       For example, imagine you are answering a question about whether a comment posted on social
       media is defamatory. It may be obvious on the facts that the element of `publication' is satisfied
       and there does not need to be a lengthy discussion about this issue. Do not take it for granted that
       your reader will know this. If you skip this part of the discussion, your reader may assume that you
       do not know that publication is an element of defamation.
       To deal with issues that are relevant but not controversial in your answer, you can say:

             The publication element is not controversial on these facts because the post was
             made on social media and seen by 73 people before it was removed. This satisfies
             the publication element pursuant to [cite the relevant rule].

6.4.7 Structure your answer clearly

Good structure is essential to a good answer. Many students' answers to legal problems suffer from
poor structure - they are rambling, repetitive, and do not progress clearly and logically from issue to
issue. An answer that is clearly and logically structured from the first paragraph will almost always
                                                                                                                                                              93

gain marks purely on that score, even if the arguments it contains are no more cogent than the
arguments discerned (eventually) from a poorly structured answer. A clear but weak argument is still
preferable to a jumbled and weak argument.

It is usually a good idea to identify distinct issues clearly and then go through the `RAC' process
(rules, application, conclusion) with each issue/sub-issue separately. Thus, in a problem where
several distinct issues are raised (which is the case in most problems), the RAC process will need
to be done repeatedly. This can sometimes mean that the same basic set of facts will need to be
addressed a number of times, from different angles, with respect to different issues. Even if you
are repetitive in your working out during the RAC stage, you will be able to tidy this up when you
construct, review and revise your final answer.

                                                         EXAMPLE 6.1

       Overarching issue: Whether Tania is liable for defamation for the comments she made about
       Peter.
       Sub-issue 1: Whether Tania published her comments.

               Rule? Application? Conclusion to sub-issue 1?
       Sub-issue 2: Whether Peter was identified in the comments.

               Rule? Application? Conclusion to sub-issue 2?
       Sub-issue 3: Whether the comments were defamatory.

               Rule? Application? Conclusion to sub-issue 3?
       Overall conclusion: Tania is / is not liable for defamation for the comments she made about Peter
       because [sum up the conclusions from sub-issues 1, 2 and 3].

                                    (a) Avoid being too rigid in your structure

While it is generally good to have some match between the structure of an answer and the various
functions the answer performs, sometimes students are overly rigid in their structuring of answers
to legal problems. This is especially common where IRAC is treated as a universal template for
structuring answers. Remember that the IRAC process is the working out stage of your preparation.
It identifies tasks to be performed or functions to be fulfilled in preparing your answer and need not
correspond to structurally distinct parts of the final written answer itself. The final written version
need not fixedly re-present each of the stages of your preparation.

A common rigidity in this regard is where students doggedly produce distinct sections with the
headings `issue', `rule', `application' and `conclusion' under which they, respectively, state the
relevant laws, apply them to the facts and then draw the relevant conclusions. While this is not an
error (indeed, for beginners it can be helpful to start practising by laying out answers in this sort of
way), it can be a rather plodding way to approach matters. It can sometimes be a little blinkered and
repetitive, and it can take up space and time that will often be better used in doing all three tasks more
or less at the same time, allowing you to move on to cover further ground. It is sometimes better to
94

identify the relevant legal rules at the same time as you apply them to reach a conclusion. That is,
you can show your understanding of the relevant rules when you apply them.

                                                         EXAMPLE 6.2

       A relatively pedestrian approach (using generic terms here to save space) would be:

             Issue: Whether Derrick is guilty of the offence of X.
             The next issue to consider is whether Derrick is guilty of the offence of X.
             Relevant rules of law:
             It is a criminal offence to do X. As contained in section 123 of the Miscellaneous
             Crimes Act 1999 (Vic), the offence of X comprises the following three elements:
             E1, E2 and E3.
             Application:
             On the facts given, Derrick satisfied E1 when he did A, satisfied E2 when he did B,
             and satisfied E3 when he did C.
             Conclusion:
             Having satisfied all the elements of X, Derrick is therefore very likely to be found
             guilty of X.

       There is no basic error here, but depending on the context, it may be quicker and no less revealing
       of your legal understanding to write something more concise:

             Is Derrick guilty of X? In doing A, B and C, Derrick clearly satisfied, respectively,
             the three elements of the offence of X under s 123 of Miscellaneous Crimes Act
             1999 (Vic) and so is likely to be found guilty.

This more concise kind of treatment may be more appropriate where the issue is not the most central
one or is not so controversial. It is a matter for your judgment based on what you think are the most
important points to be covered from the scenario. Part of the skill you are developing is knowing
when to be more concise and when to be more detailed in your arguments. The easiest way to figure
this out is by looking to the uncertainty or contention raised by the facts and paying more attention
to those issues. Be prepared to be flexible in your approach but your overall aim should be to leave
your reader in no doubt as to your reasoning for your ultimate conclusion.

Where time is not a constraint, it can sometimes be useful to follow the more structured approach
outlined above as part of an initial rough draft answer. Then, as you revise and edit your answer,
you will discern which parts of the answer can be profitably edited and streamlined, and when an
approach could be varied. In most exam situations this will not be feasible; you will only have time
for some basic planning and then writing just one draft. But by practising answering legal problems
beforehand, you will develop your capacity to judge when and how to streamline, vary, condense or
expand the structure of your answers.
                                                                                                                                                              95

                                                         (b) Headings

Good use of headings will usually help you to make the structure of your answer clearer. They will
normally help you in your writing and also help the reader (i.e. the examiner) in their reading by
giving them signposts. If you have a good structure, the headings should be easily inserted, as it will
be clear what each paragraph or group of paragraphs is doing.

                                  TIP: USE SPECIFIC, MEANINGFUL HEADINGS

       Make your headings specific, concise and relevant to the discussion. Avoid using headings like:
               `Issue', `Rule', `Application'

       Instead, prefer headings like:
               `Liability for defamation', `Publication', `Identification', `Defamatory material'

       Using headings like this means that your reader can know, at a glance, what each section is
       dealing with. The particular issues that you need to address will usually provide the main headings
       for your document. These can even be phrased as questions.

                                                      (c) Introductions

It is usually helpful to start your answer with a brief introductory paragraph. The main function of an
introduction should be to identify the main issues to be covered in the answer. It can also be helpful
to state the conclusion drawn at the end of your answer already in the introduction. This gives your
reader a context in which to process your answer.

But be concise. You do not need to spend half a page setting the scene, or reviewing academic debates
in the area, or previewing the arguments you will present in the main body. It is especially important
that you do not waste time summarising the facts. Some students fall into the trap of using their
introduction to outline their arguments in so much detail that they find their `outline' has taken up a
page or more and anticipates too much of their main presentation, while not yet being a full enough
treatment to stand as the main presentation itself.

It is usually enough simply to note the main issues raised by the problem and which are to be duly
addressed in the answer. For example, an entirely satisfactory introduction could run as follows:

      To advise whether Dorothy's recorded 7 am confession is admissible, the following issues need
      to be determined: (i) whether the confession was voluntary; (ii) whether the police complied
      with the statutory recording requirements under s 464H of the Crimes Act; (iii) whether it would
      be unfair to admit it pursuant to s 90 of the Evidence Act; and (iv) whether, under s 138 of
      the Evidence Act, the probative value of the confession outweighs the prejudicial effect of the
      manner in which it was obtained.

An example of an introduction which states the conclusion at the outset could say:

      Dorothy's recorded 7 am confession is inadmissible, despite being voluntary, because the
      police did not record the confession (s 464H, Crimes Act). Moreover, it would be unfair to
      admit the confession due to the police officers' conduct, pursuant to s 90 of the Evidence Act.
      The probative value of the confession does not outweigh the prejudicial effect of its manner of
      collection under s 138 of the Evidence Act.
96

In either case, the main body of the answer could then proceed by systematically going through each
issue, with each numbered point having its own heading: ie, (i) voluntary confession, (ii) recording
requirements, (iii) unfairness, (iv) probative value versus prejudicial effect.

6.4.8 Do not change the facts

It is rare for every relevant fact to appear in the scenario given in a legal problem. This is not a failure
on the part of the person setting the question. Gaps in the facts occur frequently in legal practice, and
learning to deal with such gaps is an essential skill.

If you think the facts as given to you do not provide a sufficient basis for drawing a conclusion,
say so, and indicate what facts would fill the gap and how they might do so. Do not get in touch
with your inner novelist and add to the facts to fill in perceived gaps. Where different results turn
on different possible but unknown facts, make that clear. There may even be inconsistencies in some
factual scenarios. Again, this happens in real life, especially where there is more than one witness
making a statement. Deal with such problems as they arise by noting the problem and what its effects
are. None of this grappling with uncooperative facts gets in the way of answering the problem; it is
part of what is assessed.

6.4.9 Be wary of questioning the question

It is true that sometimes a good answer can show that the original question makes a problematic
assumption or is misconceived in some way. For example, a question may ask `On what date
did Joanna start trading while insolvent?' After a rigorous analysis of the facts given, you may
legitimately find that at no stage did Joanna in fact trade while insolvent, because she was never in
fact insolvent. If so, then note this and present your arguments for this conclusion.

However, this is a very rare situation, so be wary of taking this route or, where you do, of going too
far in this direction. In answering legal problems you are not engaged in an intellectual debate with
the person who gives you the facts and sets the task (whether a client, senior solicitor, instructing
solicitor or your teacher). For example, let's say the question asks you to:

      Advise as to whether Wei's hearsay evidence is admissible.

It is not a good idea to respond by arguing:

      the question fails to consider the Victorian Law Reform Commission's recent report
      recommending that all hearsay evidence be prima facie admissible, which I shall now discuss.

This is a direct route to irrelevance. This warning is not intended to stifle your intellectual freedom
or to force you to be compliant. It is a matter of learning what the actual task in front of you is asking
for.

Moreover, if you think the question is wrong, or has an error within it, go back to your notes and
double-check that you have fully understood the lectures and readings before taking a contrary
stance. In essence, make sure you are confident about it before you outwardly disagree with the
premise of a question posed as an assessment task.
                                                                                                                                                              97

6.4.10 Do not repeat the facts or the question

This was mentioned briefly above but is so important that it is worth restating. Do not waste time
repeating large parts of the facts or repeating the whole text of the question at the beginning of your
answer. It will often be appropriate to refer to certain facts in the course of your answer, or to note
what question it is that you are answering at a particular point, but too many students pad out their
answers by needlessly repeating what is already written in the examination paper. This is a waste of
time and words and contributes nothing to your answer.

6.4.11 Write clearly and concisely

Clear, precise and concise English expression is essential to getting your ideas across to the reader.
Your marker can only assess what is on the page in front of them, so your document must stand on
its own feet and communicate effectively. A reader cannot be persuaded by that which they do not
understand.

Write clear, grammatically correct and properly punctuated sentences. Aim to be as clear and direct
as possible. Try to keep your sentences grammatically simple. Long, complex and convoluted
sentences rarely help to improve your writing, especially in exams. Use distinct paragraphs for
distinct stages of your answer (headings will help here). As you progress from sentence to sentence,
and from paragraph to paragraph, there should be a clear sense that the argument or analysis is
unfolding in a logical way.

6.4.12 Use of bulleted or numbered points

When done well, it is acceptable to use bulleted or numbered points to make sentences that are
grammatically correct but whose physical layout does not follow the traditional paragraph of running
text. Consider this passage:

      Dorothy's confession was not voluntary, because she was subject to oppressive conduct in not
      having received any food in the whole 12 hours she was in police custody and in not being given
      an adequate bed to sleep in. Moreover, she was induced to confess by Constable Doright's
      offers to let her friend Sharon go if she confessed to the crime herself and to `forget' her drugs
      charges from 2004.

You might instead lay the text out as:

      Dorothy's confession was not voluntary, because she was:

               subject to oppressive conduct in:
                           not having received any food in the whole 12 hours she was in police custody;
                              and
                           not being given an adequate bed to sleep in; and

               induced to confess by Constable Doright's offers to:
                           let her friend Sharon go if she confessed to the crime herself; and
                           `forget' her drugs charges from 2004.

Or you could even lay it out like this (with numbered points):
98

      Dorothy's confession was not voluntary, because she was:

              i. subject to oppressive conduct in:
                         a. not having received any food in the whole 12 hours she was in police custody;
                              and
                         b. not being given an adequate bed to sleep in; and

             ii. induced to confess by Constable Doright's offers to:
                         a. let her friend Sharon go if she confessed to the crime herself; and
                         b. `forget' her drugs charges from 2004.

This format can be a way to present your points clearly, but be wary of overdoing it. If a whole
answer consists mostly of bulleted or numbered points, it can become much harder to read.
Moreover, some students combine bullet points with an ungrammatical, truncated form of writing
which uses less ink but creates plenty of confusion and ambiguity. It might be quicker for you to
write, but it can often take longer for your reader to read than clear, concise, grammatically correct
sentences. Giving your reader more work to do rarely works in your favour.

                                  TIP: USE BULLET POINTS CONSERVATIVELY

       Use full sentences and full paragraphs for most of your analysis. Rely on bullet points only for
       lists, outlining elements of the law, or dealing with several relevant facts that apply to the same
       rule or issue.

6.4.13 Practise answering problems

The best way to learn how to answer legal problems is to practise doing it. In most of your black-
letter law subjects you will most likely be given problems to work on during semester. It can also be
very helpful to look at past exams, where available, and practise on those. When you do, it can be a
very good idea to do so under simulated exam conditions (e.g. limit your time and the materials you
use.)

Studying recent past examination papers can also give you ideas about the kinds of problems and
questions that may be posed in particular subjects and can be a guide to the sort of thing to expect in
future exams. However, proceed very carefully here, as the content of many subjects will evolve, as
will exam formats. Check with the relevant subject coordinator about what might be valuable in past
exam papers.

6.4.14 Be familiar with your exam notes

Most law examinations are `open book'; that is, you are allowed to bring in notes and books to use
in the exam. (But always check the rules for particular exams.) Take advantage of this and prepare
good notes for use in exams. Do this steadily throughout the semester and not just in the last week
or two before the exam. Give your notes practice runs by using them to answer legal problems from
class or from past exams, and then refine them in the light of that practice.
                                                                                                                                                              99

There is no one format for such notes, but most good sets of notes will contain, among other things,
summaries of the relevant rules of law, concise case notes on the important cases, and specific guides
and tips on answering problems relating to particular issues (e.g. a flowchart on how to answer a
problem about bail).

In producing your exam notes, do not just cut and paste your notes from class or from your reading.
(Still less should you cut and paste the lecturer's notes, brilliant as they may be.) Write a new
document, drawing on multiple sources and informed by your own experience in answering problems
in the relevant area. This is a great way to revise the subject materials. By writing your own notes
afresh, they will become more familiar to you and so will be much easier to use in an exam than
text just copied from somewhere else. Your notes should also be clearly indexed so that you can find
things quickly (consider using tabs or flags). It is highly desirable to be very familiar with your exam
notes, so that you may use them efficiently and effectively in the exam. It is too late to start reading
the law for the first time in the exam hall.

The main feature of exam notes is that they should help you to answer legal problems well in
exam conditions. This means that good exam notes are unlikely to be very long and do not need to
form a comprehensive textbook on the relevant subject matter. Indeed, often short, dot-pointed and
colour-coded checklists make the best exam notes. Some students seem to take comfort in producing
weighty tomes into which every last bit of material covered in the subject is jammed. Most such
students discover (too late) that equipping themselves with these unwieldy compilations is not very
helpful, primarily because they are not written for the purpose of being used as a tool in answering
legal problems under exam conditions, or they are too dense and cannot be easily navigated.

6.4.15 Learn from judgments

Note that the process of identifying issues, identifying and applying rules of law and coming to
a conclusion are essentially what judges do in their written judgments, which contain the reasons
for their decision. When law students apply the law to the facts in legal problem-solving, they are
effectively trying to predict how an impartial judge would decide the case. That is, they are thinking
like a judge. This means that you already have thousands of examples of answers to legal problems
available, in the judgments of the courts. So, it is a good idea to read cases carefully, not just to get
the rules of law from them, but also to see how judges go about answering legal problems.

Not every case will be a useful example and not all judgments display exemplary writing style. Some,
it must be (respectfully) said, are good examples of how not to write. Some judgments are wordy,
suffer from `legalese' or are poorly structured. Do not emulate those sorts of judgments - but you can
still learn from them. When you come across such a judgment, think how it could have been done
better.

6.4.16 Answering legal problems in assignments

The above tips and warnings have mostly been about answering legal problems in time-restricted
examinations. Most of them, however, are still relevant to answering legal problems in assignments,
which you can do in your own time. Nonetheless, it may be helpful to make a couple of points here
about legal problems in assignments in particular.

The questions posed in assignments are often likely to be a little more complex or involved than
those encountered in exams, so take the time to read all the relevant material even more carefully.
100

One of the main things to consider is whether any legal research is required to complete the
assignment. Assignments requiring legal research are sometimes set where you have not been taught
the relevant law in class before receiving the assignment. Thus, the task includes teaching yourself
the relevant law by starting from scratch. This can be more realistic, as real-life legal clients do not
walk into your office with `contract termination problem' written on their foreheads and a set of
presentation slides explaining the relevant law tucked under their arm. Where an assignment does
require legal research, you may be asked to give an account of your research and how you identified
the relevant law.

There may be a need in assignments to spend more time analysing and interpreting the law before
applying it. For example, it may be appropriate to spend more time analysing how a High Court
precedent case has been restricted by its interpretation in a subsequent High Court decision or
arguing how choices regarding a certain policy issue could lead to a statutory provision being applied
differently.

Another fairly obvious feature of assignments is that because you have more time, a fuller and more
polished answer is expected. This means you should draft your initial answer and then revise it.
Editing is vitally important; you may need to do this several times to produce a properly finished
work.
                                                                                                                                                            101

Chapter 7: Essays

7.1 Introduction

This chapter provides some guidance on writing essays in law school. Most law students will have
become familiar with writing essays during their secondary education, or as part of a University
course in a different discipline. However, there can be important differences between the essays you
wrote in other contexts and the type of essays required at law school. For a start, different academic
disciplines will have different expectations and standards - or `conventions' - regarding what an
essay must do or be. Moreover, because law is itself a somewhat inter- or multi-disciplinary field,
during your law course you will encounter different views on what an essay involves.
Perhaps the most important common point about academic essays is that they are persuasive (or
critical or argumentative) pieces of writing. That is, an essay presents arguments or reasons in support
of a position on some issue or a solution to a problem. In doing so, the essay seeks to persuade
the reader to accept that position or solution, or at least to take the position or solution as a serious
candidate in the relevant debate. This means that there are some core aspects to essay writing:

          What is the issue, problem or question posed?
          What is your position on that issue, or your solution to that problem, or your answer to

            that question?
          Why should your reader accept your position, solution or answer? What reasons can you

            give your reader to adopt your view? That is, what is your argument?
We shall examine these aspects of essay writing (and a couple more) below.
This chapter's structure is based on the four basic stages of essay writing:

          preparing the ground, which involves interpreting the question and planning your answer
          gathering the materials, which involves gathering relevant information and views, in order

            to build a solid essay
          constructing your essay, which involves presenting the content of your essay in a way that

            achieves its purpose
          tidying up, which involves revising and editing your draft before submission.

                                                                101
102

7.2 Preparing the ground: what to do before you start writing

7.2.1 Different kinds of essay questions

It is essential to start your essay writing by not writing anything at all. Your first step must always be
just reading the question. Read the question you have been set. Read it for the first time. Then read it
again. Then read it several more times. Go away and do something else for a while, then come back
and read it again. And read it once more for luck. Then, while writing your essay, read the question
repeatedly and several times again after you have finished writing. Reading - and understanding -
the question is fundamentally important. Many students get off on the wrong foot when answering
an essay question because they do not take the time to read the question carefully and understand
exactly what is being asked of them (and what is not being asked).

There are many kinds of essay question, and this book does not purport to offer any comprehensive
or definitive guide to them. However, one important thing to focus on is often a key directive
or command in the question. Generic terms and phrases such as `analyse', `discuss', `critique',
`evaluate, `do you agree?' and `explain', among many others, are often key to understanding the kind
of task you have been set. A sampling of these terms is provided and briefly explained below.

                                ESSAY QUESTION DIRECTIVES AND EXAMPLES

       Analyse: Break the issue or problem down into its component parts in order to show in depth and
       in detail what the issue or problem is and how it arises. Go beyond mere surface description or
       summary. Depending on the context, there may be no call for you to reach a final position of your
       own on the issues.

             Analyse Justice Schneider's argument against the Australian Constitution having
             any substantive implied freedom of political communication.
       Explain: This can mean either `identify the cause(s) of something' or `explicate the significance
       of something'. In the first sense, you are being asked to give a kind historical or causal explanation
       of how something (e.g. an event, an issue or problem, a position or statement) arose. In the second
       sense, you are being asked to interpret, or lay out, or elucidate the meaning or importance of some
       event, issue or position. These tasks can be a matter for expository writing in simpler cases, but
       where things are more complex or it is contentious as to what the causes or significance of
       something is, then this can be a matter for persuasive writing.

             Explain the impasse the High Court has reached on the interpretation of s 80 of the
             Constitution.
             Explain the significance of the recent reforms to the fault element of stalking.
       Evaluate, critically evaluate or critique: Assess the different aspects of some position, statement

                                                                102
                                                                                                                                                            103

       or claim in order to reach a judgment or decision on whether it is itself persuasive. Examine
       arguments for and against the position, statement or claim. Assess their strengths and weaknesses.

             Critically evaluate Professor Leon's proposal to create a third chamber in the
             Australian Parliament to represent Indigenous peoples.

       Do you agree or disagree? This asks you directly to state your position in relation to some stated
       position. It is asking for a yes or no answer, but, of course, that will not be enough. You must
       provide reasons for your answer, which may involve analysis, explanation or critical evaluation.

             `Decriminalisation of personal drug use is vital if we are to stem the tide of
             avoidable deaths from drug use.' Do you agree or disagree?

       Discuss: This remains a popular, if rather vague, essay directive. It could be asking you to do any
       or all of the above tasks of analysis, explanation, critical evaluation or arguing for your own
       position. The context should make it clear what is being asked of you.

             Discuss Justice Schneider's argument against the Australian Constitution having
             any substantive implied freedom of political communication.
             The High Court has reached an impasse on the interpretation of s 80 of the
             Constitution. Discuss.
             `Decriminalisation of personal drug use is vital if we are to stem the tide of
             avoidable deaths from drug use.' Discuss.

       Direct questions: Often an essay question will simply be a direct question, without a directive
       word such as `discuss' or `analyse'. Instead, the question just asks you directly why, who, what or
       where something is or whether something ought to be the case.

             Is there a substantial implied freedom of political communication under the
             Constitution of Victoria?
             Why has the High Court reached an impasse on recognising a tort of invasion of
             privacy?
             To what extent is the freedom of religion protected under the Australian
             Constitution?
             Should Parliament have a third chamber for Indigenous Australians?
             Ought the use of a drug of dependence be decriminalised?

When reading the question you have been set, examine it closely and identify its key terms. The
key terms are the words that indicate the essential content of the question and will help to determine
what you need to do to answer it. This way you can interpret the question in a way that enables
you to frame your answer. This can be especially important when the question is broad and can be
interpreted in different ways. When reviewing the draft of your essay, re-read the question to make
sure that you have indeed answered it.

7.2.2 Planning your essay

Having thought carefully about what the question requires of you, take some time to think carefully
about how you will go about answering the question. Students who take the time to plan their essay
almost always deliver a better product.
104

Plan what you want to say, how you will say it and what research you may need to do in order to be
able to say it persuasively. Often you will need to do the research first, in order to work out what you
think and what you want to say. But even that initial research needs planning.

When working out what your essay should cover, pay close attention to the terms of the question.
This includes the particular directives or commands in the question (as discussed above), but it also
involves focusing on the key terms used in the question. Use those terms in planning your essay. In
some cases it is safe to consider these terms to be the `elements' of the essay question, allowing you
to break them down as you would a legal principle. The terms are also useful in developing your
research strategy and the search terms you will use.

Your plan should include working out a structure for your essay. But, as always, be prepared to
review and revise your plan and your structure as you work on your essay. It is rare (and usually
a matter of luck, not intelligence) that a good essay will look exactly like the one you originally
planned. That is why it is a good idea to treat your initial essay plan as a working plan. It is something
that you work with, but which is open to revision as you go.

                                        TIP: PLAN YOUR ESSAY APPROACH

       The first steps you should take when approaching an essay are:

                   read the question several times before doing anything else
                   ascertain what the question is specifically asking you to do
                   identify the specific terms, or elements, of the question
                   draft a plan - both of research strategy and of essay structure.
                                                                                                                                                            105

7.3 Gathering the materials: researching for your essay

For most essays in law school, some degree of research is expected. Some essays will be more
research-intensive than others. Other essays can be reflections on material already covered in a
subject. However, most of the time the essay task you are set will require you to do some research of
your own.

`Research' is an ambiguous word. It can refer to original research, in which the researcher discovers
new facts or information about some aspect of the world. The term can also mean finding out what
other people have said (including their original research) about the issues you are concerned with.
`Research' in the context of writing undergraduate essays in law school usually means the latter,
not original empirical studies of your own. Therefore, here we will focus on the second sense of
`research'.

7.3.1 Why research?

The point of research is to help you gather support for the positions and arguments you present in
your essay. A well-researched piece will be better informed and have more impact than one that
contains a series of unsubstantiated or under-informed claims. A good research essay shows evidence
of its author having engaged with relevant and appropriate materials, following appropriate research
methods.

As part of your law course, you will be taught how to do specialised legal research in particular
subjects. It is important to stress that legal research skills are professional skills that you will (or
should) take with you into your legal careers. It is not just a skill for assessment purposes at
university.

                                             TIP: FRANKENSTEIN'S ESSAY

       The purpose of an academic essay is usually twofold: it tests your understanding of a specific topic
       and it tests your research skills.
       As such, you are unlikely to find an article, text or other source that perfectly answers your essay
       question. That would defeat the purpose of the exercise, since you would simply be finding out
       what someone else says is `the answer' to the question. Instead, your task is to develop your own
       understanding of the topic and issues by feeding your mind with a variety of sources.
       This means that you have to build your answer from multiple research sources, drawing together
       the different insights they offer and allowing you ultimately to make your final point. However,
       not every part of your essay has to come from someone or somewhere else. There will always be
       scope for you to use your own contributions and provide your own analysis. Indeed, better essays
       are rarely an assemblage of parts from others and instead digest and combine sources in original
       ways, with additional original thoughts. Like Dr Frankenstein, you should add your own
       mysterious spark to create something new from a collection of disparate parts.

                                                                105
106

7.3.2 Be careful with the research you rely on

Exactly what sorts of materials will be appropriate and relevant to research, and the particular
research methods you should follow, will depend on the issues you are addressing in your essay. Seek
guidance on these matters from your teachers. The library can also help, including maintaining and
providing you with various research tools.

Generally, where the research involves finding out what others have said on the topic, it is not just
anyone's views that matter here but people with some claim to knowledge or `epistemic authority',
or at least something useful to contribute to the debate and discussion. In short, what makes a source
credible in the context of your essay? In our online era, almost everyone can publish their views to
the world. This means being able to discern the epistemically valuable wheat from the ill-informed
chaff is particularly important and sometimes difficult.

When doing internet-based research, use your brain, not just your index finger. There is plenty of
excellent material available online - and there is also a lot of junk and second- and third-rate stuff.
You need to search intelligently and sort critically to figure out which is what. Many university
students still have difficulty sorting out the good, the bad and the ugly online. Many students' work
suffers because the online material they gather in their `research', while readily accessible, is low
quality, derivative or intellectually flimsy (e.g. a blog post by someone lacking expertise, a tabloid
newspaper article, a lobby group's biased media release). Finding something on the internet that is
connected to the topic is not sufficient reason to cite it or even use it in preparing your work.

                                       TIP: USE APPROPRIATE DATABASES

       Do not start your searches with Google or Wikipedia. Instead, start with your institution's library
       catalogue search function and databases. Enter key words or phrases. Using the filter tools, limit
       your search to peer-reviewed articles or books within an appropriate date range, and you will
       immediately find more useful, credible sources than Google or Wikipedia can deliver.

7.3.3 More is not always better

Students sometimes think that lots of quotations and references or a long bibliography are the
defining marks of a well-researched essay. But quantity is rarely enough and often not even
necessary. Instead, much depends on the question, the kind of answer you are giving to it, the state
of the relevant literature, the quality of the works referred to and what use you make of those works.
Depending how these factors play out in a given case, an essay with only five very good references
could be much better than an assignment on the same topic, and taking the same position, which has
25 references that are of low quality and which makes poor use of them. There is little to be gained
in just amassing references.

7.3.4 Evaluating the sources found through your research

Not everything that your research yields will be equally useful, and even relevant sources can be
useful in different ways. This means you will need to evaluate the sources you have found in your
                                                                                                                                                                107

  research. How do you do that? This is a large question, but here are a few questions to ask when you
  evaluate the fruits of your research.1

                                                   EVALUATING RESEARCH

          What kind of document is it? Is it a journal article or a chapter from a book? If from a book, is it
          an introductory textbook for students or an academic monograph that presents original, cutting-
          edge research? Is the document perhaps merely an online pamphlet published by an organisation
          with a particular agenda?
          Who is the author? What authority or reputation does the author have? What reputation does the
          publisher have? If you are looking at a journal article, what sort of reputation does the journal
          have?
          Who is the intended audience? Is the text addressed to the general public? Practicing lawyers?
          University students? Other academics? Is the text restricted in its jurisdictional relevance? That is,
          is it only concerned with the law of a particular jurisdiction, with little relevance beyond that
          jurisdiction?
          How current is the text? How up to date is the information within it? How accurate or reliable is
          the information?
          What are the arguments being put forward by the text? Are they clear, cogent and persuasive?
          Do you feel justified in relying on or deferring to them?

7.4 Constructing your essay: putting the pieces together

This is the most important part of the process - the stage where you start writing your essay. In order
to start writing you need to have a sense of what you want to say, what you need to say and how you
will say it. To unpack these tasks, in this section we discuss the importance of:

          relevance - answering the question
          structure - presenting your content in an orderly way
          using your research fairly but creatively
          independent thinking
          argument - giving clear and cogent reasons to support your answer.

7.4.1 Answering the question: the importance of relevance

Your essay must answer the question. Whatever that question is, you must answer it and not a
question that was not asked. This is the matter of relevance: what you say is relevant to the question
or topic when it answers the question posed or is part of the build-up to answering that question.
Answering the question actually posed (rather than the question that you wish had been posed or that
you mistakenly thought was posed) is essential to writing a successful essay. Doing so shows insight
into the scope and nature of what the question requires. It also shows that you are aware of, and
responding to, the needs of your audience. A document that does what is asked of it displays a clear
understanding of its audience and the relationship between the author and the audience. This means
your document is doing its communicative job effectively.

                                             QUESTION, PROMPT OR TASK
       It is best not to think of essay questions as `prompts', as that can encourage viewing the question
       as a nudge (or shove) to set you off on a writing adventure of your own. Such an approach can
       lead to written documents that lack relevance because they do not answer the question. Treat the
       question as setting you a specific task that you have to perform.

Do not assume that just because you have said something `in response to the question' or something
`on the topic of the question' you will have answered the question. Always reflect critically and
carefully on what you have actually said to see if it constitutes an answer to the question that was
actually asked. Of course, some questions will allow a wide variety of answers, while other questions
will be narrow and specific about what counts as an answer.

                                                                108
                                                                                                                                                            109

                                          EXAMPLES OF WHAT NOT TO DO

       Consider the question, `What are Hart's main contentions in his book The Concept of Law?'
       It would not be an answer to this question to say, `Hart was a very influential legal philosopher
       who reinvigorated 20th-century jurisprudence'. Nor would it be an answer to say, `Hart's legal
       positivism was blind to the issues of racial and gender injustice'.
       These may be answers that are sincerely believed (and perhaps even true). They are also `in
       response' to the question and are `on the topic' of Hart's thinking. But they do not answer the
       specific question that was asked.

Sometimes a question is not well-formed or makes false or misleading assumptions. In such cases,
you cannot really answer the question properly or in good conscience. If you have formed the view,
after careful thought, that the question is flawed in some way, ask your teacher for clarification. If
that is not feasible, you should make clear in your essay exactly what the problem with the question
is and how you think the problem is best resolved.

7.4.2 Answering the question in an orderly way: the importance of
structure

To present your answer to the question effectively, you need to do things in an orderly way.
This means that your document should have a clear, comprehensible and appropriate structure
that is quickly apparent to your reader. This way the different parts of the document have a clear
interrelationship and your reader is led in a logical way, stage by stage, through the various issues.
Exactly what structure is appropriate for any given essay depends on the particular case, so we
do not try to lay down even a generic suggested essay structure here. Nonetheless, most essays
will have clearly discernible parts, with each part performing a distinct function, such as providing
background, presenting an argument, laying out a rival position, mounting a defence and so on. It is
usually best if one basic function is being performed by each discernible part, so that the reader can
easily follow what is happening at any particular stage.

                            TIP: INCLUDE AN INTRODUCTION AND CONCLUSION
       Even though there is no one type of essay structure, it is best to assume that your essay should
       include an introduction and a conclusion, unless otherwise stated in the task instructions.

Generally it is better to avoid a simple `for and against' structure in which you present arguments for
a proposition and then present all the arguments against it. That will often lead to needless repetition.
110

It is usually better to address different themes and sub-issues and consider the arguments for and
against these in one place. This enables you to incorporate relevant counterarguments as you go.

                                            SAMPLE ESSAY STRUCTURES

       Here is an example of a possible essay structure in answer to the question:

             Critically evaluate Professor Leon's proposal to create a third chamber in the
             Australian Parliament to represent Indigenous peoples.

                 1. Introduction
                 2. The current structure of the Australian Parliament
                 3. The issue of better parliamentary representation of Indigenous Australians
                 4. Professor Leon's proposal for a third parliamentary chamber
                 5. Strengths and weakness in Professor Leon's proposal

                                a. Strengths
                               b. Weakness
                                c. Possible replies by Leon
                               d. Responses to the replies
                 6. Conclusion
       Here is an alternative structure for the same essay:
                 1. Introduction
                 2. Background: the current parliamentary structure and the problem of Indigenous
                     exclusion
                 3. Professor Leon's proposal for a third parliamentary chamber
                 4. The issue of the functions and powers of the new chamber
                 5. The issue of who may be a candidate for the new chamber
                 6. The issue of who may vote for members of the new chamber
                 7. Conclusion
       Both structures could underpin an A-grade essay, which highlights that there is no one way to
       structure an answer to this question. Moreover, pretty much the same content could be found in
       both structures - they could simply be different ways of dividing up the same material and
       arguments.

Of course, the structure of the final version of your essay may differ from the planned structure that
you started with. This is a common experience, but it is usually a sign that things have gone well.
It probably means that you have thought carefully and critically about your essay's initially planned
                                                                                                                                                            111

structure and reworked it as you came to grips with the material and your arguments. But it is still
important to begin with a working structure or plan, while being open to revising it as you progress.

7.4.3 Understanding the fruits of your research: the importance of
using your research fairly but creatively

It is not enough to just gather good quality materials in your research. You need to show that you
understand what you have gathered. This means it is essential that, where appropriate, you clearly,
accurately and fairly expound the relevant materials. This goes hand in hand with showing that you
understand what the essay's core and derivative issues are and how the various texts and sources
you have gathered connect with them. So, you show the breadth and depth of your insight into the
relevant issues at the same time as you show your understanding of materials you have researched,
including their contexts and implications.

This underscores the very important point that your essay is not a `research report' in which you tell
your reader about the things you found in the course of your research. You need to use the material
you find in your research in ways that advance your essay. This means deploying the material in
ways that serve your argument. Your primary goal is to persuade the reader of the position you adopt
in your work and that it is a position to be taken seriously. Research will be necessary to help you
persuade the reader. But that research is just a step toward this goal; it is a tool or a means to an end,
not the end itself. So, the fruits of your research need to be intelligently sorted and analysed, and
appropriately deployed to help the essay achieve its purpose. This means that you need to `put your
own stamp' on what you put into your essay. There will always be some level of creativity involved
in how you choose to deploy the material gathered in your research.

Note that the point of research is not simply to find documents that support what you want to say,
to be used as `back-up'. In your research you will usually find opposing views and views which
are simply different to the line you are presenting in your essay. Do not ignore such sources. Very
often these will be very helpful because they provide counterarguments to your position. How you
deal with such opposing views and arguments will often be a measure of the strength of your essay
as a whole. Do you rebut such arguments, concede some valid points, put the views in their proper
context and so on?

It is also much better if you can avoid over-reliance on just one or two sources. The weaker student
essays tend to latch on to one or two authoritative or sympathetic sources and just hitch a ride with
them. (This is often apparent in the footnotes where "ibid." recurs at length.) Try to make use of
multiple sources and points of view in relation to each issue, to demonstrate the breadth of your
research.

7.4.4 Thinking and speaking for yourself: the importance of
independent thinking

It will depend on the question, but most academic essays require you to engage in and display
independent thought. Most essay questions are asking you to give your answer to the question, not
someone else's answer. Weaker essays often show signs of being largely derivative of the work of
others. The weakness is compounded when poor research has yielded only mediocre or poor sources
to derive ideas from. It is important to be selective and discriminating when choosing the sources
you will use to support your arguments.
112

Persuasive, argumentative writing thus requires you to go beyond expounding others' views and to
start presenting your own. However, selective exposition of others' views may often be a stepping
stone in presenting your own position. Moreover, it is not as if exposition does not itself involve the
use of logical arguments.

In `taking a position' on the relevant issue, you can, of course, give your own personal view. You are
indeed encouraged to do so. (University is still a place where you are encouraged to develop your
own ideas about the world.) And if you are not really sure what you think, then you are free to adopt
a position for the purposes of the exercise, even if you are not personally convinced of the position
yourself. But the role you play in writing the essay is still the somewhat generic one of `the author'
of your piece.

Taking a position does not mean that you have to adopt a stark, extreme or uncompromising
stance. On the contrary, your position on a given issue may well be nuanced and subtle, or make
compromises where compromises are warranted, or be provisional and tentative. What matters most
is that, whatever position you take, it is articulated clearly and plausibly.

Giving your own opinion on an issue is not the same as telling the reader your feelings about the
issue. Unless you're writing a reflective essay in which you are asked to discuss your personal
responses, keep your focus on your reasons for the position you are defending, not on how it feels to
be in that position. This is not to assume that appeals to emotions have no role to play in reasoned
argument. But such appeals should be more than simply a matter of expressing your own emotions.
Remember that your job is not simply to `be yourself', but to be reasonable and persuasive in a
communicative exercise with your reader. You are being assessed not on your personal sincerity or
authenticity but primarily on the quality of your reasoning.

7.4.5 Why should anyone believe you? The importance of argument

Your essay is not merely giving expression to your thoughts. As a piece of persuasive writing, it
should also attempt to persuade your reader to share your view or, at least, to take your view seriously
as meriting a considered and reasoned reply. This means giving the reader reasons for the positions
you take. These should justify your position intellectually. That can include:

       1. arguments directly in support of your position

       2. arguments to defend your position against (possible or actual) criticisms

       3. arguments against opposed positions, or

       4. any appropriate combination of these three types of arguments.

Your critical arguments should aim to be fair and show the genuine strengths or weaknesses of the
relevant positions. You should certainly consider both sides of a case (or more, as appropriate) as part
of being fair and thorough. Of course, ultimately you should take a position - fairness does not entail
indecisiveness.

Who is your reader? Whom do you seek to persuade? In reality, your reader will be the lecturer or
tutor who is assessing your work and who knows a fair bit about the topic you are writing on. But
you should treat your assumed reader as someone who is reasonably well-informed generally about
the area you are writing on but who is not quite familiar with the particular issues or literature you
are engaging with and who has a reasonably open mind about which way they might be persuaded
to think. Your attempt to persuade them involves presenting reasons for the position you take. This
                                                                                                                                                            113

also means that it is not enough simply to identify with a particular position on some issue, without
presenting reasons for your position, expecting the reader to simply share your views. Try to avoid
`preaching to the converted' by simply repeating views you assume any right thinking reader will
already share with you. Try to engage with those who might disagree with you by assuming your
reader is mildly sceptical of your approach or is cautious about accepting your position (though do
not assume they are prejudiced against you, either).

In this respect, having a clearly laid out argument which flows logically is very effective in presenting
a persuasive essay. Often, a key part of what makes an argument persuasive is that the reader can
easily grasp what the argument is. Readers are much more inclined to be persuaded by what they
understand clearly. This underscores the importance of having a clear, coherent and cogent structure.

Some students worry about getting the correct answer, but for most law essay topics, there is often
no consensus as to what `the right answer' is. Your reader is not looking to see whether you have
reached the right conclusion but rather to see how you got there. That is a matter of having clear and
coherent arguments for your conclusion.

                                  TIP: TELL YOUR READER YOUR ARGUMENT

       An effective way to make sure your reader understands your arguments is to make sure you have a
       clear introduction that prepares your reader early on to be persuaded by the rest of your essay. The
       introduction should not just introduce the topic or issue but the whole of the essay by giving a
       concise preview of it. Do not be worried about spoiling the story by telling the reader up-front
       what your arguments will be. An essay is not a murder mystery in which the culprit is revealed at
       the end.
       If your reader does not know the basic gist of the argument by the end of the introduction, you will
       most likely be losing them, not building up a sense of anticipation. So, let the reader know early
       on what you are arguing and make sure that the subsequent structure of the essay's argument
       backs that up. You will often also benefit from concisely recapitulating the argument in your
       conclusion.

7.4.6 What is an argument?

It is all very well to be told to present a clear and cogent argument. But what actually is an argument,
and what format should the presentation of an argument take? Whole books are devoted to these
questions. We shall just present a very brief outline here.

(a) Argument as the reasons that support a conclusion

What we are concerned with here are the reasons you put forward that logically support the position
you want to maintain. Those reasons are what you present in answer to the question `Why should
I believe or accept your view?' Those reasons, then, are the premises which logically support your
conclusion. Your argument is, in effect, the reasons for your conclusion. (Note that logicians use the
word `argument' to refer to both the premises and the conclusion as a whole.)

The key idea is that the reasons or premises lead logically to the conclusion. The arrival of the
   114

  conclusion is signalled by words such as `therefore', `hence', `thus' or `so'. Consider the following
  statements:

               1. Parliament should take whatever steps lead to saving lives.
               2. Decriminalising the use of illicit drugs would save lives.
               3. Therefore, Parliament should decriminalise the use of illicit drugs.

  Statements 1 and 2 support or justify the conclusion (statement 3).
  We can also reverse the order by first making a claim which is then justified by the supporting
  statements. Here the signals are words such as `because', `since' and `as'. They signal that the
  justification for the claim is about to be presented.

               1. Parliament should decriminalise the use of illicit drugs, because
               2. Parliament should take whatever steps lead to saving lives, and
               3. Decriminalising the use of illicit drugs would save lives.

  There are two basic kinds of logical support that the premises of an argument can provide for the
  argument's conclusion: deductive and inductive.

                                                 TWO KINDS OF ARGUMENT

          In deductive arguments, the premises (if true) logically guarantee the truth of the conclusion.
          In inductive arguments, the premises (if true) do not logically guarantee the truth of the
          conclusion, but they do give the conclusion some appreciable degree of logical support, such that
          is it rational to accept it.

  (b) Deductive arguments
  In a deductive argument, the premises (if accepted as true) necessitate or guarantee the truth of the
  conclusion.

        If Ruritania1 uses the death penalty for drug trafficking, then it has an obligation to ensure its
        criminal trials observe the strictest procedures to ensure reliable guilty verdicts. Ruritania does
        use the death penalty for drug trafficking. Therefore, Ruritania has an obligation to ensure its
        criminal trials observe the strictest procedures to ensure reliable guilty verdicts.

  Or:

        No country that is serious about children's rights would set the minimum age of criminal
        responsibility at 10 years. Ruritania sets the minimum age of criminal responsibility at 10 years.
        Therefore, Ruritania is not serious about children's rights.

  In these two arguments, if the premises are accepted as true, then the conclusion must follow. In

1. Ruritania is a fictional country. For background, see Anthony Hope's 1894 novel, The Prisoner of Zenda.
                                                                                                                                                            115

assessing an argument as deductively valid, we assume the premises are true. This means that the
logic of an argument is an internal matter of how the premises and conclusion relate to each other.
However, the premises of an argument may turn out to be false, in which case the conclusion may
or may not be true even though it is the logical conclusion of the premises. Also, even where we
have good reason to accept the truth of the premises of an argument, it may be that those premises
are themselves only non-deductively supported, and so the conclusion is no more certain than the
weakest premise, even though it logically follows. (There is also the problem of the audience not
accepting the premises, but that is not strictly a problem in logic.) A deductive argument is said by
logicians to be a `valid' argument if the premises, if true, necessarily lead to the conclusion; it is said
to be a `sound' argument if it is valid and the premises are true.

(c) Inductive arguments

Inductive arguments provide logical support for their conclusions without guaranteeing their
conclusions in the way deductive arguments do. But they still provide good logical support that
makes it reasonable to accept the conclusion. An inductive argument is said by logicians to be
`strong' if the premises, if true, provide good support for the conclusion; it is said to be a `cogent'
argument if it is strong and the premises are true.

There are various kinds of inductive arguments. We will briefly outline three of the main ones here.

                                                  Inductive generalisation

Inductive generalisation is where the premises are (or summarise) particular statements and the
conclusion is a general statement.

             1. Of the 1500 Victorian lawyers surveyed this year, 85 per cent support decriminalising
                  the use of illicit drugs.

             2. Therefore, 85 per cent of all Victorian lawyers support decriminalising the use of illicit
                  drugs.

The idea is that from the observed specific cases of Victorian lawyers' support for the
decriminalisation of drug use, we can draw a more general conclusion about all Victorian lawyers'
support for the decriminalisation of drug use. The observation about the surveyed lawyers provides
a good reason for the conclusion, though the truth of the conclusion is not guaranteed.

There is much discussion as to what sorts of premises are needed to provide strong inductive support
for general conclusions. For example, in this case, how many lawyers need to be surveyed, and how
are they to be selected, before we can be confident that the sample is representative of all Victorian
lawyers?

                                           Inference to the best explanation

This is an inductive (non-deductive) form of argument where the conclusion is reached on the basis
that it is the best explanation of the facts described in the premises.

      Given that:

             a. the DNA on Vincenzo's corpse matches that of Darius
             b. Darius hated Vincenzo
             c. Darius was alone with Vincenzo just before Vincenzo's death
             d. Darius had taken out life insurance on Vincenzo a week before, and
   116

               e. there is no other plausible explanation for Vincenzo's death.

        It is therefore clear that the best explanation of those facts is that Darius murdered Vincenzo.

  This inductive argument does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion, but it is still rational to accept
  the conclusion because it is the simplest and most plausible explanation of the event (the death). This
  can often mean that if you are presenting an inference to the best explanation, you will need to show
  the weaknesses of rival explanations as well as the strengths of the `best' explanation.

                                                      Argument by analogy

  Another kind of inductive argument is argument by analogy. (Argument by analogy and the doctrine
  of precedent often work together in law.) An argument by analogy involves arguing that because two
  things are similar in some respect, they are likely to be also similar in some other respect.

        If a person is abused on the basis of their sexual orientation, the effect will often be much
        the same as being abused on the basis of their race. In both cases, something that can be
        integral to a person's sense of self is denigrated and this can be deeply wounding. Victoria's
        anti-vilification laws already protect people from racial vilification, so they should be amended
        to protect people from vilification based on sexual orientation as well.

  Exactly when an argument by analogy works can sometimes be contested; not all analogies are
  created equal. There is a need for an important connection between the established similarities and
  the new, asserted similarity. If you are presenting an argument by analogy, be careful and clear about
  why the established similarities support there being a new similarity.

  (d) Fallacies
  A fallacious argument is one that appears to be logically persuasive, but which, in reality, is not.
  Critical readers look out for fallacies and good writers try to avoid them. There are many kinds of
  fallacious arguments.2 We will note just a few here to illustrate.

                                                     Fallacy of equivocation

  This is where someone's argument relies on some term or concept that has two or more meanings
  and shifts from one meaning to another.

        It's the duty of the media to publish news that's in the public interest. There is great public
        interest in UFOs. Therefore the media has a duty to publish stories about UFOs.3

  This purported argument relies on treating two senses of `public interest' (public welfare and public
  curiosity) as if they were the same.

                                Fallacy of begging the question (circular reasoning)

  This is the fallacy of assuming the truth of the proposition that one is seeking to prove.

        We should believe that Derrick is innocent of murder because he denies he did it; we can trust
        his word because he's never done anything illegal.

2. An informative and user-friendly website on fallacies is Thou shalt not commit logical fallacies (http://yourlogicalfallacyis.com).
3. The example is taken from Theodore Schick, Jr. and Lewis Vaughn, How to Think About Weird Things: Critical Thinking for a New

      Age (McGraw Hill, 3rd ed, 2002) 300.
                                                                                                                                                                117

  This purported argument assumes that Derrick has no criminal past in order to prove that he has
  not committed a crime. That is, it assumes the truth of what is in issue, namely whether Derrick is
  innocent of murder. This is bad reasoning because the argument does not prove what it is supposed
  to prove; it just assumes it is true.

                                         The ad hominem fallacy (to the person)

  This is where the arguer brings in a personal criticism of someone in order to sway their audience not
  to be persuaded by that person.

        Professor Quin says her research indicates that the decriminalisation of drug use leads to
        an overall reduction in drug-related deaths, but don't believe her - she's stood as a Greens
        candidate at the last three elections.

  The professor's political activity is not relevant to issues relating to law reform and health statistics.

  Then again, perhaps in some cases, certain personal characteristics might be relevant. For example,
  what if someone's dishonesty might legitimately undermine the trust they should be accorded? If
  someone wanted to argue that Professor Quin should not be believed because she has recently been
  found guilty of plagiarism and fabrication of research data, then perhaps that is relevant? If so, then
  the relevance of the factor in question should be expressly stated and critically assessed.

 7.4.7 Presenting your arguments

  As a very generic way of presenting your argument, it is usually helpful to let the reader know at the
  start just what the issue or question is that you will be answering. Your position on that issue or your
  answer to that question is, then, the conclusion for which you will be arguing. Your argument for that
  conclusion will consist of reasons for that conclusion. It is also often helpful to consider objections
  to your position or argument, as well as rival or alternative positions, and respond to them.

                                                  PRESENTING ARGUMENTS

          In short, a generic way to present an argument in your essay is to follow this general structure:4

                   1. The issue: What is the question or issue in dispute?
                   2. Claim or position: Where do you stand on the issue? What is your answer to the

                        question?
                   3. Reasons: What reasons can you present in support of your claim or position? What

                        kind of logical support do those reasons give your conclusion? Is it a matter of logical
                        deduction (such that the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises)? Or do the
                        reasons provide inductive support (making the conclusion more likely than not)? In
                        turn, what other, more general principles or broader ideas support the reasons you

118

                     offer?
                 4. Objections and other positions: What objections might someone raise to your

                     position or argument? What other positions or claims are there, whether opposing,
                     rival or simply different to yours? What reasons are there for those positions or
                     claims?
                 5. Response: How do you respond to those positions and reasons?
                 6. Conclusion: What is your final position? It should usually be the same as at point 2
                     above, but now clarified and perhaps elaborated.

7.5 Tidying up: the importance of reviewing and revising your draft

A good piece of writing almost never emerges from the first draft. The very best writers review and
revise their work, often numerous times. Though you need to know generally what you want to say
before you start to write, you often do not know specifically what you want to say until you have
written it. This means that good writing very often involves writing followed by rewriting as one,
integrated practice.
Many student essays show every sign of not having been reviewed and revised, very much to their
detriment. This is a shame, because in many such cases significant improvements could easily have
been made if the time had been taken to review and revise the draft. Often the difference is worth a
whole grade or more.
We discussed the importance of reviewing and revising your draft in section 3.4. Refer to that section
for a reminder of this all-important but often neglected practice.

                                                                119

Chapter 8: Law reform submissions

8.1 Introduction

This chapter provides some advice on writing law reform submissions. These are documents that
argue that particular changes to the law ought to be made. This is another common form of
assessment in law school.
In this chapter we cover:

          the nature of law reform
          the nature and role of law reform submissions
          law reform submissions as a form of assessment
          writing on your own behalf or on behalf of an organisation
          what format should your law reform submission take
          what should go into a law reform submission.

                                                                120
                                                                                                                                                            121

8.2 What is law reform?

The law is continually changing. Statutes are frequently amended, and case law evolves and adapts.
Often the changes relate to more technical or formal matters and are intended to help the law
work more effectively or more efficiently. Sometimes the changes, especially to statutory law, can
be more substantive and reflect a change in the policy or values that the law is seeking to serve.
Unsurprisingly, there are often intense debates about how the law should be changed. Those debates
can take place in all sorts of forums, and the kinds of contributions to those debates can vary
considerably.
A very important part of the law reform process is the various bodies whose role includes making
recommendations for law reform. Most jurisdictions in Australia have their own law reform
commissions, such as the Victorian Law Reform Commission and the Australian Law Reform
Commission. These bodies stand at arm's length from the government of the day. There are also
many parliamentary committees, at state and federal level, that conduct inquiries into issues and
often make recommendations for law reform. There can also be specific inquiries, such as royal
commissions, created to review the law and practice in certain areas. The royal commission into the
banking sector by Kenneth Hayne, a former Justice of the High Court, which took place from 2017
to 2019, is one of many examples. Many of these reviews and inquiries produce reports which make
recommendations for changes to practice or the law or both.

                                                                121
122

8.3 What is a law reform submission?

A law reform submission is, as the name suggests, a document that takes a substantive position on
a law reform issue and seeks to persuade its target audience to agree with that position. The target
audience is usually an organisation with the power to make or formally recommend changes to the
law. A law reform submission is thus a submission to that organisation.

When a law reform inquiry or review starts, the organisation conducting it usually seeks submissions
from members of the public and interested organisations. In most such inquiries and reviews, anyone
is free to make a submission. It is part of the rights that mark out democracies that ordinary
members of the public may petition the government to make changes without fear of reprisal from
the government. Law reform submissions can be seen as coming within that broader right to petition
the government.

Law reform submissions can be wide-ranging or narrow. They can urge the relevant commission,
committee or commissioner to make certain recommendations, or simply offer information about the
issues. Depending on the degree of public interest, some inquiries and reviews can receive hundreds
of submissions.

Often, particular organisations or certain key office-holders make submissions to law reform bodies.
Many of these organisations and office-holders are referred to as `stakeholders' because they have
a professional or formal interest in the outcome of the inquiry. They are often expressly invited to
make submissions as to how they think the law should be changed or indeed whether it should be
changed at all.

                                              WHAT IS A STAKEHOLDER?

       A `stakeholder' in this context is some person, office or organisation with a particular interest
       (whether professional, financial, operational, political, personal or intellectual) in the outcome of a
       policy decision, often because it directly affects what they do. In that sense their interests can be
       said to be `at stake' in the decision. They often include lobby groups (organisations that work for
       change in government policy or legislation) as well as professional associations and relevant
       industry representative bodies. Examples include the Victorian Council for Civil Liberties, the
       Federation of Community Legal Centres, the Victorian Bar, the Law Institute of Victoria, Victoria
       Legal Aid, the Office of Public Prosecutions and the Judicial College of Victoria.

In short, then, a law reform submission is a document that outlines a position about an issue being
considered as part of a law reform inquiry or review. It can be long or short, broad or narrow. It can
focus on one issue in particular or on several at once. It can argue for or against a change in the law -
depending on the preferences of whichever stakeholder is drafting it. What makes a document a law

                                                                122
                                                                                                                                                            123

reform submission is the fact that it is submitted as part of an inquiry or review into matters of law
reform.
124

8.4 What is a law reform submission as an assessment task in law
school?

A common form of assessment in law school is writing a law reform submission to a law reform
commission, a parliamentary committee or similar official body or office-holder, such as the
Attorney-General. It might be that there is an actual inquiry or review being conducted at the time
the assessment is set, but most often the task is fictional. Your teacher might pretend, for example,
that the Victorian Law Reform Commission is conducting an inquiry into drug decriminalisation and
ask you to make a submission to that fictional review. The task thus involves a `role-playing' writing
exercise, modelled on real-world writing tasks. This can put the issues you are studying into more
concrete, practical contexts. It is a good form of assessment because it allows you to practice a lot
of lawyerly skills all at once: researching the issues, identifying the important points and delivering
a clear argument either way. It does not require you to come to a `correct answer'. The document is
simply presenting, and arguing for, a particular position.

                                                                124
                                                                                                                                                            125

8.5 Writing on your own behalf or on behalf of an organisation

You can write your submission in your own name but, depending on the subject, it can sometimes
be useful to write on behalf of an organisation (real or imaginary). If you are writing on behalf of an
organisation, you will need to adopt a certain role or perspective, and think through the issues from
that perspective. It is a vital skill, for lawyers and others, to be able to understand how to approach
various issues from different perspectives. Thinking from different perspectives can also help you in
the development of your own thinking about an issue, especially if, at the start, you are not sure what
you think yourself.
Simply adopting a perspective will not, however, generate all your arguments and thoughts. Still
less does it mean that your perspective should unduly limit what ideas, concepts and values you
can bring to bear on the issues. Much hard thinking and careful arguing is still necessary, no matter
what perspective you adopt, if you want to be persuasive. If you write as a representative of an
organisation, you may assume that you have the authority to formulate and state that organisation's
policy position.

                           TIP: YOU DON'T HAVE TO BELIEVE WHAT YOU WRITE
       With this type of writing you do not have to personally believe in it yourself. You are not
       representing your own opinion, but the perspective of the organisation you represent. This can free
       you up to explore new ideas that you might not personally hold. If you are not sure what you
       yourself believe with regard to a particular law reform issue, it can thus be easier to approach the
       task as a spokesperson for an organisation.

If you are representing an organisation, be clear which organisation it is. If you write `on behalf of'
a real organisation, you need to ensure that your submitted work does not appear to be a genuine
document from that organisation. So, if you adopt the role of spokesperson or representative of an
actual organisation or office, then you should make sure your submitted work cannot be mistaken
for an actual submission. For example, you could state on the front cover or as a header that the
document is fictional and prepared only for academic purposes. Discuss this with your teacher if in
any doubt.

                                                                125
126

8.6 What format should your law reform submission take?

Real-world law reform submissions take a variety of forms partly because they are not a formal legal
document (compared with, say, a lawyer's memorandum of advice) or a standard academic task (such
as an essay). It is also partly because anyone is free to make a submission to a law reform body
or the government. That does not mean that every submission is equally effective. Many are weak
documents indeed if we assess them in terms of whether they are taken seriously by their audience.
The best advice is to learn from actual examples, rather than follow them. Many law reform
commissions and committees make publicly available copies of the submissions they receive. As a
rule of thumb, be more inclined to learn from the examples of leading legal stakeholder groups, such
as the Federation of Community Legal Centres, the Victorian Bar, the Law Institute of Victoria and
the Law Council of Australia. Also, lobby groups such as Liberty Victoria often make valuable and
useful submissions.

                                        TIP: LEARN FROM GOOD EXAMPLES
       Most law reform submissions are publicly available and you can access examples with relative
       ease. Have a look at the different types of submissions and decide which ones you think are most
       effective and compelling. Pay attention to why that is and emulate that in your work (as long as
       you still abide by the specific assessment instructions).

While there is no standard or official format for law reform submissions, the following generic
format will be helpful for students who have not written a law reform submission before.

                            GENERIC FORMAT FOR LAW REFORM SUBMISSIONS

                 1. Introduction: State the purpose of your submission clearly and concisely. If your
                     submission is in response to a call for submissions in relation to a law reform inquiry,
                     make this clear. In your introduction, briefly summarise what you are recommending.

                 2. Background: This should include identifying the relevant issues and why they are
                     important. You might summarise the problems, as you see them, with the current
                     situation in the law. It may be useful to provide some history of the relevant law or its
                     problems, if this sheds light on the current problems. Your research will be important
                     in this section.

                 3. Recommendation(s): State fully what it is that you are recommending and set out

                                                                126
                                                                                                                                                            127

                     reasons why things should be changed or, if you are defending the status quo, why
                     things should not change. Be direct and clear about your recommendation(s) and your
                     reasons for them. If it is not clear what your submission is actually recommending, or
                     why that recommendation should be accepted, then its impact will be greatly
                     weakened. Present positive arguments in support of your position clearly and
                     rationally. It will usually also be useful to consider arguments against your position
                     and to make clear why they are not persuasive. As in the background section, your
                     research should provide support for your arguments here. It may be useful to use
                     subheadings in this part.
                 4. Conclusion: Very briefly conclude with a restatement of what it is you want your
                     audience to do.

This generic format can be adapted and revised for particular cases. Whichever format you use, aim
for clarity. You want your reader to know right from the start what your document is doing and
how each part serves that task. Be clear about what specific issues you are addressing, what your
recommendations are on those issues and what your arguments are for your recommended positions.
Your structure should reflect these different subtasks of your submission
128

8.7 What should go into a law reform submission?

In many respects, a law reform submission is similar to an academic essay that takes a reasoned
position in relation to some issue. So, much of the intellectual content of your submission will be
very similar to an academic essay (see Chapter 7). However, in a law reform submission you should
be even more clearly in favour of a specific position. Moreover, it is the reasons for your position that
will count. Also, you will most often need to consider alternative or opposing policy positions and the
reasons for them. So, be balanced and reasonable, not in the sense of being non-committal, but in the
sense of considering relevant and reasonable options and giving reasons for your recommendations.

                  TIP: WHAT THE LAW SHOULD BE MIGHT BE WHAT IT ALREADY IS
       Remember that the issue is not what the law is, but what it should be. Your submission needs to
       present a clear position on what the law should be, even if your argument is that it should remain
       unchanged - defending the status quo can be a perfectly respectable position.

Your aim in writing is ultimately to rationally persuade your reader (here a law reform commission or
similar body) to adopt the position you recommend. This means that the reasons you give for taking
that position should not merely be the reasons why you adopt that position but should be reasons that
your audience should adopt as theirs. Think carefully about how best to get your audience to agree
with you or at least to take your view seriously enough to warrant a considered response.

This means that logical arguments supported by credible evidence and appealing to shared or
common values and normative principles are likely to be your main tools of persuasion. Because
your concern is with what the law should be, not what it is, citing legal authorities to back up
your argument will often be of limited use. Of course, if you are saying something is the law, then
you should cite the authority for that. But law reform arguments are more likely to be grounded in
political, social and ethical principles such as justice, human rights or economic efficiency.

                                                TIP: IT'S NOT ABOUT YOU
       Your emotional convictions will be of little use in this persuasive task. Your goal is not to give full
       and satisfying expression to your feelings. Simply saying how strongly you are convinced of some
       matter is unlikely to give your audience a reason to share your conviction. Rather, your goal
       should be to persuade a reasonable person or group of people to agree with your position or at
       least take it seriously. You should aim to give your audience reasons for it to adopt your position.
       This means it might not be enough to articulate your own reasons for adopting the position you
       adopt. Think what reasons you can give your audience for it to adopt as its reasons for taking that
       position or at least taking it seriously.

                                                                128
                                                                                                                                                            129

A law reform submission should be informed by research. Many real-world submissions are under-
informed or ill-informed and weaker because of that. So do not follow those examples in particular.
Look for submissions that have strong referencing. Remember that the better support you have
backing up your submission, the more persuasive your arguments will be. As always, your research
should be properly cited.
