6 | LAW AND RISK MANAGEMENT

1.1 Introduction

Often, law for business students is taught as a sort of
compressed version of law school. Subjects are taught much
like they might be for law students, albeit at a simplified level.
This sort of training can be useful, but it ignores a crucial
difference between how lawyers and managers relate to the law:
lawyers are trained to argue for specific legal conclusions on
behalf of a client, while managers make decisions to manage
legal risk. Law is rarely black and white, such as "don't do
this or you'll go to jail." Rather, legal decisions often involve
questions such as "Our trademark is similar to several others. Is
it too similar?" Or, "Adding this statement to the label of our
product might expose us to liability, but it's not prohibited by
regulation. Should we proceed?" This leaves many managerial
decisions involving law up to the risk tolerance of the manager.
Compared to how attorneys operate, this requires a very
different approach to legal reasoning. In this sense, a business-
focused course on legal topics should essentially be a course
on business strategy related to legal issues. It should equip
managers with a broad overview of legal risks associated with
running a business, how their decisions alter those risks, and
how to minimize or otherwise use those risks to their
advantage.

   For these reasons, this text begins with a broad discussion of
how one might evaluate risk generally. In this chapter, we will
learn techniques for assessing, evaluating, and managing legal
                                             LAW AND RISK MANAGEMENT | 7

risks. Risk management is a topic for an entire course by itself,
so in this chapter we will only touch on several major points
and then apply them to the law. Throughout the course,
examples and exercises will relate back to these concepts.

1.2 An Approach to Evaluating
Risk

Risk management will be a major focal point of business and
societal decision making in the twenty-first century. Businesses
face an incredible variety of risks everyday, which range both
in severity and in frequency. Some risks are minor (e.g., an
employee might steal paperclips), and others may entail losing
the business (a pandemic arises which eliminates demand for
certain services). Some risks are frequent (bad weather for a
drive-in movie theater), and some are infrequent (new
government regulation alters the healthcare landscape). Legal
risks span these same spectrums. Some legal risks are constant
(potential slip and falls in a grocery store) and some are
infrequent (a major intellectual property lawsuit). Some are
minor (producing a product label well within regulatory
standards) and some are significant (criminal negligence results
in the death of customers).

   In this section, we will discuss legal risk, which is one of
a variety of these risks which businesses face everyday. As
business increasingly involves international management,
understanding legal risk has become more important than
   8 | LAW AND RISK MANAGEMENT

  ever, due to the bewildering number of international norms
  and regulations governing the modern legal environment of
  business. The types of legal risk a company faces can be
  roughly broken down into four categories:1

    1. Regulatory risk. If a company fails to have appropriate
        compliance methods, it risks regulatory violations which
        can have far-reaching civil and criminal penalties.

    2. Tort risk. Companies that fail to take reasonable care to
        ensure the safety of their customers, clients, and
        employees will inevitably face personal injury lawsuits.
        Individuals injured on premises, industrial accidents, or
        products that harm customers may all result in
        litigation.

    3. Contract risk. Contracts are the language of business,
        and failure to understand contractual complexities may
        result in harmful liability. Competitors may take
        advantage of ambiguous terms, damages provisions may
        disfavor the company, or there may be unforeseen
        consequences from contractual provisions.

    4. Intellectual property risk. Modern business
        increasingly relies on intellectual property, rather than

1. Adapted from Matthew Whalley and Chris Guzelian, The Legal Risk
  Management Handbook: An Interntional Guide to Protect Your
  Business from Legal Loss (2017).
                                             LAW AND RISK MANAGEMENT | 9

      real property, to create value. Infringing on others'
      intellectual property rights, or failure to protect one's
      own intellectual property rights, can have substantial
      impact on a company.

Reading a long list of potential legal harms may inspire some
trepidation, particularly for someone with responsibility over
these areas of company operations. If we wish to understand
and use the concepts of risk and uncertainty to manage these
risks, we need to be able to measure (at least roughly) these
concepts' outcomes. Psychological and economic research
shows that emotions such as fear, dread, ambiguity avoidance,
and feelings of emotional loss represent valid risks. Such
feelings are thus relevant to decision making under
uncertainty. Our focus here, however, will draw more on
financial metrics rather than emotional or psychological
measures of risk perception.

   We will discuss one particular approach to measuring risk
here, which is a useful model in the legal context. We will
not impose a mathematical framework on this model, for two
reasons. First, this is a course on business law, not a course on
statistics or probability models, and developing those models
together would exceed the time available in this course.
Second, and more foundational, assuming exact probabilities
for potential legal events implies a level of certainty that will
likely never exist in real life.

   We also emphasize from the start that measuring risk using
10 | LAW AND RISK MANAGEMENT

the model in this chapter is a multi-step process. We must
evaluate how appropriate the underlying model might be for
the specific occasion. Further, we need to evaluate each
question in terms of the risk level that each entity is willing
to assume for the gain each hopes to receive. Firms must
understand the assumptions behind worst-case or ruin
scenarios, since most firms do not want to take on risks that
"bet the house." To this end, knowing the severity of losses
that might be expected in the future is a first step (legal
consequences). However, financial decision making requires
that we evaluate severity levels based upon what an individual
or a firm can comfortably endure (attitudes towards risk, risk
tolerance, or risk appetite).

1.3 Legal Consequences

Mismanaging legal risk can have a variety of consequences,
from harm to reputation to imprisonment of company
officers. These consequences range dramatically from minor
to severe. Most of the consequences we will look at in this
textbook are civil in nature. Civil cases involve one party suing
another to seek compensation for a wrong. Damages can be
compensatory (to put someone in the same position as if they
had not been harmed) or punitive (intended to punish
wrongdoing). If you are sued, you should also expect to spend
a substantial amount on attorney fees, regardless of whether
                                                LAW AND RISK MANAGEMENT | 11

  you win or lose.2 On the civil side, courts can also impose
  injunctions, which is an order to perform, or not perform, a
  specific action.

      Lawyers may provide your management team detailed
      legal risk assessments.

  If the financial consequences are severe enough, the firm might
  risk bankruptcy. Bankruptcy law governs the rights of creditors
  and insolvent debtors who cannot pay their debts. In broadest
  terms, bankruptcy deals with the seizure of the debtor's assets
  and their distribution to the debtor's various creditors. In
  bankruptcy, the firm might be liquidated or reorganized. As we
  will see later in the text, bankruptcy provides debtors a fresh

  litigation in the United States.
12 | LAW AND RISK MANAGEMENT

start, but for many firms the consequences of bankruptcy are
severe enough that they will avoid actions that likely lead to
bankruptcy.

1.4 Attitudes Towards Risk

Different people and companies can view the legal risks above
very differently. Some individuals do not mind the prospect
of personal bankruptcy, for instance, and some companies are
structured to take substantial risk. Others view the prospect of
being sued with trepidation. In other words, different people
and firms have different attitudes toward the risk-return
tradeoff. People are risk averse when they shy away from risks
and prefer to have as much security and certainty as is
reasonably affordable in order to lower their discomfort level.
They would be willing to pay extra to have the security of
knowing that unpleasant risks would be removed from their
lives. Economists and risk management professionals consider
most people to be risk averse. So, why do people invest in
the stock market where they confront the possibility of losing
everything? Perhaps they are also seeking the highest value
possible for their pensions and savings and believe that losses
may not be pervasive--very much unlike the situation in the
financial crisis of 2008.

   A risk seeker, on the other hand, is not simply the person
who hopes to maximize the value of retirement investments by
investing the stock market. Much like a gambler, a risk seeker
                                            LAW AND RISK MANAGEMENT | 13

is someone who will enter into an endeavor (such as blackjack
card games or slot machine gambling) as long as a positive long
run return on the money is possible, however unlikely.

   Finally, an entity is said to be risk neutral when its risk
preference lies in between these two extremes. Risk neutral
individuals will not pay extra to have the risk transferred to
someone else, nor will they pay to engage in a risky endeavor.
To them, money is money. Economists consider most widely
held or publicly traded corporations as making decisions in a
risk-neutral manner since their shareholders have the ability
to diversify away risk--to take actions that seemingly are not
related or have opposite effects, or to invest in many possible
unrelated products or entities such that the impact of any one
event decreases the overall risk. Risks that the corporation
might choose to transfer remain for diversification.

1.5 A Model for Evaluating Legal
Risk

This section combines the ideas from the prior sections to
implement a simple, non-mathematical model for evaluating
legal risk. A "model" is a simplified framework for evaluating
a real-life situation. It will never capture all of the nuance
involved in a particular choice, but it may be useful to
decisionmakers. In particular, the model presented here is non-
mathematical. It relies on simple categorization of the
14 | LAW AND RISK MANAGEMENT

likelihood of an event, the consequences of that event, and the
decisionmaker's approach to evaluating risk.

   First, evaluate the likelihood of the event. For instance, what
are the chances of getting sued? We will categorize the
likelihood as "low", "medium", or "high". Much of this course
will aim to teach you how to categorize potential legal events in
this framework. For example, as we study intellectual property
law you will gain a sense of the likelihood of being sued based
on similarity of your trademark to existing trademarks, and
as we study tort law you will get a sense for which torts are
common and uncommon. We won't use specific probabilities
for these events in formal calculations, but you might think
of a low probability event as one that rarely occurs for similar
companies, a medium probability event as one that has
occurred several times in the last year for similar companies,
and a high probability event as one which will almost certainly
result in litigation.

   Next, categorize the severity of the outcome as "slight",
"manageable", or "severe". Again, much of this course aims
to teach you which events are which. As you did the Exercise
under "Legal Consequences" above, you likely started to see
some of the newsworthy severe events faced by firms in your
industry. For modeling purposes, a slight outcome is one
which would not harm the financial health of the company in
a significant way. An example might be a somewhat frivolous
lawsuit which is settled as a "nuisance suit" for a few thousand
                                               LAW AND RISK MANAGEMENT | 15

  dollars.3 A manageable outcome is one which would generate
  discussion among managers about potential budgets for a loss,
  such as a small-business customer injured in an accident with
  major medical bills. This kind of outcome might worry
  managers, but does not risk the future of the business. A severe
  outcome is one which risks bankruptcy, criminal charges, or
  other substantial long-term consequences for the existence of
  the firm.

     Finally, decide the correct attitude towards risk. Is the firm
  risk averse, risk neutral, or risk seeking? In our model, the
  attitude towards risk forms the shaded "danger zone" in the
  grid, dividing causes of little concern from significant concern.
  The more risk averse the individual or firm, the farther up and
  to the left we shift the dividing line, and the more risk-seeking
  the firm, the farther lower and to the right we shift the line.
  An extremely risk averse firm would avoid even low probability
  severe events (as shown in the first figure below), while an
  extremely risk-seeking firm might avoid only high probability
  severe events.

     Applying this model might look something like the
  following. We (1) classify the likelihood of the legal event, and
  (2) the severity of the consequence. Then (3), we identify the
  risk tolerance of the firm. Finally, (4) we analyze how those

3. 3A nuisance suit is one with little legal merit, which a company will
  pay a small sum to settle to avoid the costs of litigation.
16 | LAW AND RISK MANAGEMENT

three interact and offer a conclusion: is this a high risk decision,
in the legal danger zone, or a low risk decision, in the zone of
safety?

   A highly risk averse firm avoids the possibility of severe legal
                             outcomes.

     A risk seeking firm might avoid only the most likely and
                    severe legal consequences.

   For example, suppose the firm under consideration is a tech
startup like Uber. The firm consistently pushes legal
boundaries, such as in classifying workers as independent
contractors rather than employees, as it attempts to increase
                                                LAW AND RISK MANAGEMENT | 17

  market share in a quickly growing industry.4 Suppose also that
  the firm was considering whether to expand to a city that has
  somewhat hostile regulations for ride-sharing. At the same
  time, the consequences for entering the market and losing a
  legal challenge are simply to withdraw or pay an insubstantial
  fine. Let's apply the model:

          1. As the new market appears hostile, the likelihood
              of legal challenge is probably medium or high.

          2. Relative to the size of the firm, a modest fine is a
              relatively small consequence. We might then
              classify the severity of outcome as low.

          3. We might classify this firm as risk seeking based on
              its past attitude towards the law and the potential
              rewards at stake.

          4. Although the likelihood of legal action is moderate
              to high, the potential consequence is slight. This
              decision is likely a low-risk legal decision, in the
              legal safety zone for the firm.

4. They might also be classified as risk-neutral because the company
  simply finds it advantageous to engage in legally risky behavior.
18 | LAW AND RISK MANAGEMENT

1.6 Mitigating and Managing
Legal Risk

We conclude this chapter by highlighting methods to mitigate
legal risk. We will cover many of these topics in greater detail
later, but it is worth noting them in abbreviated form now,
both to round off this initial topic and to preview what we will
study throughout the semester.

   Insurance. Both individuals and businesses have
      significant needs for various types of insurance, to
      provide protection for health care, for their property,
      and for legal claims made against them by others.
      Insurance allows individuals to pay a certain amount
      today to avoid uncertain losses in the future. Businesses
      face a host of risks that could result in substantial
      liabilities. Many types of policies are available, including
      policies for owners, landlords, and tenants (covering
      liability incurred on the premises); for manufacturers
      and contractors (for liability incurred on all premises);
      for a company's products and completed operations (for
      liability that results from warranties on products or
      injuries caused by products); for owners and contractors
      (protective liability for damages caused by independent
      contractors engaged by the insured); and for contractual
      liability (for failure to abide by performances required by
      specific contracts). Some years ago, different types of
                                        LAW AND RISK MANAGEMENT | 19

   individual and business coverage had to be purchased
   separately and often from different companies. Today,
   most insurance is available on a package basis, through
   single policies that cover the most important risks. These
   are often called multiperil policies.
 Smart contracting. As we will study in contract law
   later in this text, in order to limit risk in contracts, many
   contractual drafters choose to include "liquidated
   damages" clauses. These are statements in the contract
   that spell out what damages will be if the contract is
   broken. This makes the damages certain, which lowers
   risk for the contracting parties. For example, in a
   contract for sale of a home, a party might lose their
   "ready money" if they back out of the agreement
   without cause.
 Regulatory review. Many firms find it worthwhile to
   preemptively hire an attorney to review products for
   regulatory and litigation risk before launching the
   product. For a fee, a specialized attorney can examine the
   product and provide a report on potential regulatory
   violations and lawsuit risks. Many firms might be
   surprised at the substantial increased risk of litigation
   based on innocuous statements on packaging, for
   instance. We will return to this theme when we cover
   administrative law (the law of government regulation of
   business).
 Preemptive tort defense. The liberal use of liability
20 | LAW AND RISK MANAGEMENT

      waivers, warning labels, caution signs, safety rails,
      handguards, and so on, can help prevent against tort
      litigation. Liability waivers reduce litigation risk by
      having individuals specifically agree they will not sue in
      case of injury during an activity. In other cases, often
      such litigation turns not on whether someone was
      injured from a product, but whether they were
      appropriately warned that such injury could occur.
      Physical safeguards against injury can help reduce the
      probability of potential negligence lawsuits by
      preventing injury in the first place. Businesses that
      practice prudent preemptive tort defense can lower their
      legal risks substantially.
   Limited liability forms When starting a new business,
      choosing a legal structure for the company that provides
      a personal liability shield substantially lowers legal risk
      for the proprietor. Then, performing business
      operations in a way that maintains that liability shield
      continues to lower legal risk. For corporations and
      franchisors, maintaining appropriate relationships with
      subsidiaries and franchisees provides the same benefit.
      For example, if a franchisor exercises excessive control
      over franchisee operations, it opens itself up to liability
      for the franchisee's actions.
   A risk-educated board In corporations, the board of
      directors has the primary legal responsibility to manage
      risk. If a board is risk-educated, it will incorporate legal
                                                LAW AND RISK MANAGEMENT | 21

        risk management into its overall strategy for the
        company. One path to strategic success is pursuing
        opportunities in which the corporation can manage legal
        risk better than competitors.5
      Knowing the law. Finally, a prime way to reduce legal
        risk is to simply be familiar with the law. An attorney
        will not always be around to consult, or it may be cost-
        prohibitive to use their services at times. Law is vast and
        complicated, but many legal concepts foundational to
        business are easy to understand. The more one knows
        about the law, the easier it is to avoid compromising legal
        situations, to be conversant with those that can offer
        legal counsel, and to make decisions that balance legal
        and ethical interests with other strategic concerns.

22 | LAW AND RISK MANAGEMENT

           Approaching law from a risk management
             approach is crucial to evaluate the legal
             environment of business.

           Evaluating legal risk requires understanding
             the likelihood of legal action, the
             severity of the consequences, and the risk
             tolerance level of the company. Even low
             probability legal events can be so severe that
             risk averse firms should take action
             to avoid them, while even high probability
             legal events may not bother risk seeking
             firms.

           Much of this text will offer ways to reduce
             legal risk associated with business decisions,
             such as preemptively avoiding tort liability
             and employing smart contracting
             principles. Insurance against legal claims can
             also reduce uncertainty, at a price.

             the US legal system and other legal systems.

Law has different meanings as well as different functions.
Philosophers have considered issues of justice and law for
centuries, and several different approaches, or schools of legal
thought, have emerged. In this chapter, we will look at those
different meanings and approaches and will consider how
social and political dynamics interact with the ideas that
animate the various schools of legal thought. We will also look
at typical sources of "positive law" in the United States and
how some of those sources have priority over others, and we
will set out some basic differences between the US legal system
and other legal systems.

2.1 What Is Law?

Law is a word that means different things at different times.
Black's Law Dictionary says that law is "a body of rules of
action or conduct prescribed by controlling authority, and
having binding legal force. That which must be obeyed and
                        INTRODUCTION TO LAW AND LEGAL SYSTEMS | 25

  followed by citizens subject to sanctions or legal consequence
  is a law."1

 2.1.1 Functions of the Law

  At the macro level, the law can serve to (1) keep the peace,
  (2) maintain the status quo, (3) preserve individual rights, (4)
  protect minorities against majorities, (5) promote social
  justice, and (6) provide for orderly social change. Conversely,
  the law may keep peace at the expense of individual rights,
  maintain an ugly status quo, be used to oppress minorities,
  and so on. In a democracy, law ultimately reflects how society
  wishes to order itself, while in authoritarian governments law
  is used to perpetuate existing power structures. In that sense,
  law and politics are deeply entwined. At the micro level, law
  provides the "rules of the game" for how businesses operate,
  restricting certain kinds of conduct and encouraging others.
  It can be used by businesses as a shield, giving them freedom
  to operate, and as a sword, such as when using litigation as a
  strategy against their competitors.

 2.1.2 Law and Politics

  In the United States, legislators, judges, administrative

1. Black's Law Dictionary, 6th ed., s.v. "law."
26 | INTRODUCTION TO LAW AND LEGAL SYSTEMS

agencies, governors, and presidents make law, with substantial
input from corporations, lobbyists, and a diverse group of
nongovernment organizations (NGOs) such as the American
Petroleum Institute, the Sierra Club, and the National Rifle
Association. In the fifty states, judges are often appointed by
governors or elected by the people. The process of electing
state judges has become more and more politicized in the past
fifteen years, with growing campaign contributions from those
who would seek to seat judges with similar political leanings.

     Our Overworked Supreme Court, Joseph Keppler,
     1838-1894, LOC

In the federal system, judges are appointed by an elected official
(the president) and confirmed by other elected officials (the
Senate). If the president is from one party and the other party
holds a majority of Senate seats, political conflicts may come
up during the judges' confirmation processes. Such a division
has been fairly frequent over the past fifty years.
                        INTRODUCTION TO LAW AND LEGAL SYSTEMS | 27

     In most nation-states2 (as countries are called in
  international law), knowing who has power to make and
  enforce the laws is a matter of knowing who has political
  power; in many places, the people or groups that have military
  power can also command political power to make and enforce
  the laws. Revolutions are difficult and contentious, but each
  year there are revolts against existing political-legal authority;
  an aspiration for democratic rule, or greater "rights" for
  citizens, is a recurring theme in politics and law.

        Key Takeaway

        Law is the result of political action, and the political
        landscape is vastly different from nation to nation.
        Unstable or authoritarian governments often fail to
        serve the principal functions of law.

2. The basic entities that comprise the international legal system.
  Countries, states, and nations are all roughly synonymous. State can
  also be used to designate the basic units of federally united states,
  such as in the United States of America, which is a nation-state.

2.2 Schools of Legal Thought

     Learning Objectives

     After reading this section, you should be able to do
     the following:

         1. Distinguish different philosophies of
             law--schools of legal thought--and explain
             their relevance.

         2. Explain why natural law relates to the rights
             that the founders of the US political-legal
             system found important.

         3. Describe legal positivism and explain how it
             differs from natural law.

         4. Differentiate critical legal studies and
             ecofeminist legal perspectives from both
             natural law and legal positivist perspectives.

There are different schools (or philosophies) concerning what
law is all about. Philosophy of law is also called jurisprudence.
There are many philosophies of law and thus many different
jurisprudential views, and the two main schools are legal
                        INTRODUCTION TO LAW AND LEGAL SYSTEMS | 29

  positivism3 and natural law.4 Although there are others, these
  two are the most influential in how people think about the law.

 2.2.1 Legal Positivism: Law as
 Sovereign Command

  We could examine existing statutes5--executive orders,
  regulations, or judicial decisions--in a fairly precise way to
  find out what the law says. For example, we could look at the
  posted speed limits on most city roads and conclude that the
  "correct" or "right" speed is no more than twenty-five miles per
  hour. Or we could look a little deeper and find out how the
  written law is usually applied. Doing so, we might conclude
  that thirty-one miles per hour is generally allowed by most
  state troopers, but that occasionally someone gets ticketed for
  doing twenty-seven miles per hour in a twenty-five miles per

3. A jurisprudence that focuses on the law as it is--the command of the
  sovereign.

4. A jurisprudence that emphasizes a law that transcends positive laws
  (human laws) and points to a set of principles that are universal in
  application.

5. Legislative directives, having the form of general rules that are to be
  followed in the nation-state or its subdivisions. Statutes are
  controlling over judicial decisions or common law, but are inferior to
  (and controlled by) constitutional law.
30 | INTRODUCTION TO LAW AND LEGAL SYSTEMS

hour zone. Either approach
is empirical, even if not
rigorously scientific. The
first approach, examining in
a precise way what the rule
itself says, is sometimes
known as the "positivist" school of legal thought. The second
approach--which relies on social context and the actual
behavior of the principal actors who enforce the law--is akin
to the "legal realist" school of thought.

   Positivism has its limits and its critics. New Testament
readers may recall that King Herod, fearing the birth of a
Messiah, issued a decree that all male children below a certain
age be killed. Because it was the command of a sovereign, the
decree was carried out (or, in legal jargon, the decree was
"executed"). Suppose a group seizes power in a particular place
and commands that women cannot attend school and can only
be treated medically by women, even if their condition is life-
threatening and women doctors are few and far between.
Suppose also that this command is carried out, just because it is
the law and is enforced with a vengeance. People who live there
will undoubtedly question the wisdom, justice, or goodness of
such a law, but it is law nonetheless and is generally carried
out. To avoid the law's impact, a citizen would have to flee the
country entirely. During the Taliban rule in Afghanistan, from
which this example is drawn, many did flee.

   The positive-law school of legal thought would recognize
                        INTRODUCTION TO LAW AND LEGAL SYSTEMS | 31

  the lawmaker's command as legitimate; questions about the
  law's morality or immorality would not be important. In
  contrast, the natural-law school of legal thought would refuse
  to recognize the legitimacy of laws that did not conform to
  natural, universal, or divine law. If a lawmaker issued a
  command that was in violation of natural law, a citizen would
  be morally justified in demonstrating civil disobedience. For
  example, in refusing to give up her seat to a white person, Rosa
  Parks believed that she was refusing to obey an unjust law.

 2.2.2 Natural Law

  The natural-law school of thought emphasizes that law should
  be based on a universal moral order. Natural law was
  "discovered" by humans through the use of reason and by
  choosing between that which is good and that which is evil.
  Here is the definition of natural law according to the
  Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy: "Natural law, also called
  the law of nature in moral and political philosophy, is an
  objective norm or set of objective norms governing human
  behavior, similar to the positive laws of a human ruler, but
  binding on all people alike and usually understood as involving
  a superhuman legislator."6

     Both the US Constitution and the United Nations (UN)

6. Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy, s.v. "natural law."
32 | INTRODUCTION TO LAW AND LEGAL SYSTEMS

Charter have an affinity for the natural- law outlook, as it
emphasizes certain objective norms and rights of individuals
and nations. The US Declaration of Independence embodies
a natural-law philosophy. The following short extract should
provide some sense of the deep beliefs in natural law held by
those who signed the document.

       The Unanimous Declaration of the Thirteen
       United States of America

       When in the Course of human events, it
       becomes necessary for one people to dissolve
       the political bands which have connected them
       with another, and to assume among the powers
       of the earth, the separate and equal station to
       which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God
       entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of
       mankind requires that they should declare the
       causes which impel them to the separation.

       We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all
       men are created equal, that they are endowed by
       their Creator with certain unalienable Rights,
       that among these are Life, Liberty and the
       Pursuit of Happiness. That to secure these rights,
       Governments are instituted among Men,
           INTRODUCTION TO LAW AND LEGAL SYSTEMS | 33

deriving their just powers from the consent of
the governed.

The natural-law school has been very influential in American

legal thinking. The idea that certain rights, for example, are

"unalienable" (as expressed in the Declaration of

Independence and in the writings of John Locke) is consistent

with this view of the law. Individuals may have "God-given"

or "natural" rights that government cannot legitimately take

away. Government only by consent of the governed is a natural

outgrowth of this view.

                         Civil disobedience--in the

                         tradition of Henry Thoreau,

                         Mahatma Gandhi, or Martin

                         Luther King Jr.--becomes a

                         matter of morality over

                         "unnatural" law. For example, in

                         his "Letter from Birmingham Jail,"

John Locke               Martin Luther King Jr. claims that

                         obeying an unjust law is not moral

and that deliberately disobeying an unjust law is in fact a moral

act that expresses "the highest respect for law": "An individual

who breaks a law that conscience tells him is unjust, and who

willingly accepts the penalty of imprisonment in order to
   34 | INTRODUCTION TO LAW AND LEGAL SYSTEMS

  arouse the conscience of the community over its injustice, is
  in reality expressing the highest respect for law..... One who
  breaks an unjust law must do so openly, lovingly, and with a
  willingness to accept the penalty."7

     Legal positivists, on the other hand, would say that we
  cannot know with real confidence what "natural" law or
  "universal" law is. In studying law, we can most effectively
  learn by just looking at what the written law says, or by
  examining how it has been applied. In response, natural-law
  thinkers would argue that if we care about justice, every law
  and every legal system must be held accountable to some
  higher standard, however hard that may be to define.

     It is easier to know what the law "is" than what the law
  "should be." Equal employment laws, for example, have
  specific statutes, rules, and decisions about racial
  discrimination. There are always difficult issues of
  interpretation and decision, which is why courts will resolve
  differing views. But how can we know the more fundamental
  "ought" or "should" of human equality? For example, how do
  we know that "all men are created equal" (from the Declaration
  of Independence)? Setting aside for the moment questions
  about the equality of women, or that of slaves, who were not
  counted as men with equal rights at the time of the

                    INTRODUCTION TO LAW AND LEGAL SYSTEMS | 35

declaration--can the statement be empirically proven, or is
it simply a matter of a priori knowledge? (A priori means
"existing in the mind prior to and independent of
experience.") Or is the statement about equality a matter of
faith or belief, not really provable either scientifically or
rationally? The dialogue between natural-law theorists and
more empirically oriented theories of "what law is" will raise
similar questions. In this book, we will focus mostly on the law
as it is, but not without also raising questions about what it
could or should be.

2.2.3 Other Schools of Legal Thought

The historical school of law believes that societies should base
their legal decisions today on the examples of the past.
Precedent would be more important than moral arguments.

   The legal realist school flourished in the 1920s and 1930s
as a reaction to the historical school. Legal realists pointed out
that because life and society are constantly changing, certain
laws and doctrines have to be altered or modernized in order to
remain current. The social context of law was more important
to legal realists than the formal application of precedent to
current or future legal disputes. Rather than suppose that
judges inevitably acted objectively in applying an existing rule
to a set of facts, legal realists observed that judges had their
own beliefs, operated in a social context, and would give legal
decisions based on their beliefs and their own social context.
   36 | INTRODUCTION TO LAW AND LEGAL SYSTEMS

     The legal realist view influenced the emergence of the
  critical legal studies (CLS) school of thought. The "Crits"
  believe that the social order (and the law) is dominated by
  those with power, wealth, and influence. Some Crits are clearly
  influenced by the economist Karl Marx and also by distributive
  justice theory. The CLS school believes the wealthy have
  historically oppressed or exploited those with less wealth and
  have maintained social control through law. In so doing, the
  wealthy have perpetuated an unjust distribution of both rights
  and goods in society. Law is politics and is thus not neutral or
  value-free. The CLS movement would use the law to overturn
  the hierarchical structures of domination in the modern
  society.8

        Key Takeaway

        Each of the various schools of legal thought has a

8. Related to the CLS school, yet different, is the ecofeminist school of
  legal thought. This school emphasizes--and would modify--the
  long-standing domination of men over both women and the rest of
  the natural world.
                    INTRODUCTION TO LAW AND LEGAL SYSTEMS | 37

     particular view of what a legal system is or what it
     should be. The natural-law theorists emphasize the
     rights and duties of both government and the
     governed. Positive law takes as a given that law is
     simply the command of a sovereign, the political
     power that those governed will obey. Recent
     writings in the various legal schools of thought
     emphasize long-standing patterns of domination of
     the wealthy over others (the CLS school) and of men
     over women (ecofeminist legal theory).

2.3 Basic Concepts and
Categories of US Positive Law

     Learning Objectives

     After reading this section, you should be able to do
     the following:
38 | INTRODUCTION TO LAW AND LEGAL SYSTEMS

         1. In a general way, differentiate contract law
             from tort law.

         2. Consider the role of law in supporting ethical
             norms in our society.

         3. Understand the differing roles of state law
             and federal law in the US legal system.

         4. Know the difference between criminal cases
             and civil cases.

Most of what we discuss in this book is positive law--US
positive law in particular. We will also consider the laws and
legal systems of other nations. But first, it will be useful to
cover some basic concepts and distinctions.

2.3.1 Law: The Moral Minimums in a
Democratic Society

The law does not correct (or claim to correct) every wrong that
occurs in society. At a minimum, it aims to curb the worst
kind of wrongs, the kinds of wrongs that violate what might
be called the "moral minimums" that a community demands
of its members. These include not only violations of criminal
law, but also torts, and broken promises. Thus it may be wrong
to refuse to return a phone call from a friend, but that wrong
                    INTRODUCTION TO LAW AND LEGAL SYSTEMS | 39

will not result in a viable lawsuit against you. But if a phone
(or the Internet) is used to libel or slander someone, a tort has
been committed, and the law may allow the defamed person to
be compensated.

   There is a strong association between what we generally
think of as ethical behavior and what the laws require and
provide. For example, contract law upholds society's sense that
promises--in general--should be kept. Promise-breaking is
seen as unethical. The law provides remedies for broken
promises (in breach of contract cases) but not for all broken
promises; some excuses are accepted when it would be
reasonable to do so. For tort law, harming others is considered
unethical. If people are not restrained by law from harming
one another, orderly society would be undone, leading to
anarchy. Tort law provides for compensation when serious
injuries or harms occur. As for property law issues, we
generally believe that private ownership of property is socially
useful and generally desirable, and it is generally protected
(with some exceptions) by laws. You can't throw a party at my
house without my permission, but my right to do whatever
I want on my own property may be limited by law; I can't,
without the public's permission, operate an incinerator on my
property and burn heavy metals, as toxic ash may be deposited
throughout the neighborhood.
     40 | INTRODUCTION TO LAW AND LEGAL SYSTEMS

  2.3.2 The Common Law: Property,
  Torts, and Contracts

   Even before legislatures met to make rules for society, disputes
   happened and judges decided them. In England, judges began
   writing down the facts of a case and the reasons for their
   decision. They often resorted to deciding cases on the basis of
   prior written decisions. In relying on those prior decisions, the
   judge would reason that since a current case was pretty much
   like a prior case, it ought to be decided the same way. This is
   essentially reasoning by analogy. Thus the use of precedent9
   in common-law cases came into being, and a doctrine of stare
   decisis10 (pronounced STAR-ay-de-SIGH-sus) became
   accepted in English courts. Stare decisis means, in Latin, "let
   the decision stand."

      Most judicial decisions that don't apply legislative acts
   (known as statutes) will involve one of three areas of
   law--property, contract, or tort. Property law deals with the
   rights and duties of those who can legally own land (real
   property), how that ownership can be legally confirmed and

 9. A prior judicial decision that is either binding or persuasive, and as
    such, provides a rule useful in making a decision in the case at hand.

10. Latin, for "let the decision stand." By keeping within the rule of a
    prior judicial decision, a court follows "precedent" by letting the
    prior decision govern the result in the case at hand.
                     INTRODUCTION TO LAW AND LEGAL SYSTEMS | 41

protected, how property can be bought and sold, what the
rights of tenants (renters) are, and what the various kinds of
"estates" in land are (e.g., fee simple, life estate, future interest,
easements, or rights of way). Contract law deals with what
kinds of promises courts should enforce. For example, should
courts enforce a contract where one of the parties was
intoxicated, underage, or insane? Should courts enforce a
contract where one of the parties seemed to have an unfair
advantage? What kind of contracts would have to be in writing
to be enforced by courts? Tort law deals with the types of cases
that involve some kind of harm and or injury between the
plaintiff and the defendant when no contract exists. Thus if
you are libeled or a competitor lies about your product, your
remedy would be in tort, not contract.

   The thirteen original colonies had been using English
common law for many years, and they continued to do so after
independence from England. Early cases from the first states
are full of references to already-decided English cases. As years
went by, many precedents were established by US state courts,
so that today a judicial opinion that refers to a seventeenth- or
eighteenth-century English common-law case is quite rare.

Courts in one state may look to common-law decisions from
the courts of other states where the reasoning in a similar case
is persuasive. This will happen in "cases of first impression," a
fact pattern or situation that the courts in one state have never
seen before. But if the supreme court in a particular state has
42 | INTRODUCTION TO LAW AND LEGAL SYSTEMS

already ruled on a certain kind of case, lower courts in that state
will always follow the rule set forth by their highest court.

2.3.3 State Courts and the Domain of
State Law

In the early years of our nation, federal courts were not as
active or important as state courts. States had jurisdiction (the
power to make and enforce laws) over the most important
aspects of business life. The power of state law has historically
included governing the following kinds of issues and claims:

   Contracts, including sales, commercial paper, letters of
      credit, and secured transactions

   Torts
   Property, including real property and intellectual

      property
   Corporations
   Partnerships
   Domestic matters, including marriage, divorce, custody,

      adoption, and visitation
   Securities law
   Environmental law
   Agency law, governing the relationship between

      principals and their agents.
   Banking
   Insurance
                    INTRODUCTION TO LAW AND LEGAL SYSTEMS | 43

Over the past eighty years, however, federal law has become
increasingly important in many of these areas, including
banking, securities, and environmental law.

2.3.4 Civil versus Criminal Cases

Most of the cases we will look at in this textbook are civil cases.
Criminal cases are certainly of interest to business, especially
as companies may break criminal laws. A criminal case involves
a governmental decision--whether state or federal--to
prosecute someone (named as a defendant) for violating
society's laws. The law establishes a moral minimum and does
so especially in the area of criminal laws; if you break a criminal
law, you can lose your freedom (in jail) or your life (if you
are convicted of a capital offense). In a civil action, you would
not be sent to prison; in the worst case, you can lose property
(usually money or other assets), such as when Ford Motor
Company lost a personal injury case and the judge awarded
$295 million to the plaintiffs or when Pennzoil won a $10.54
billion verdict against Texaco.
     44 | INTRODUCTION TO LAW AND LEGAL SYSTEMS

      Some of the basic differences between civil law11 and
   criminal law12 cases are illustrated in the table below.

11. In contrast to criminal law, the law that governs noncriminal
    disputes, such as in lawsuits (as opposed to prosecutions) over
    contract disputes and tort claims. In contrast to common law, civil
    law is part of the continental European tradition dating back to
    Roman law.

12. That body of law in any nation-state that defines offenses against
    society as a whole, punishable by fines, forfeitures, or imprisonment.

Proof     Plaintiff brings case;
Reason    defendant must answer    Prosecutor brings case;
          or lose by default       defendant may plea
Remedies  Preponderance of         guilty or go to trial

          To settle disputes       Beyond a reasonable
          peacefully, usually      doubt
          between private parties
                                   To maintain order in
          Money damages (legal     society
          remedy)
          Injunctions (equitable   To punish the most
          remedy)                  blameworthy
          Specific performance
          (equity)                 To deter serious
                                   wrongdoing

                                   Fines, jail, and forfeitures

Regarding plaintiffs and prosecutors, you can often tell a civil
case from a criminal case by looking at the caption of a case
going to trial. If the government appears first in the caption
of the case (e.g., U.S. v. Lieberman, it is likely that the United
States is prosecuting on behalf of the people. The same is true
of cases prosecuted by state district attorneys (e.g., State v.
Seidel). But this is not a foolproof formula. Governments will
also bring civil actions to collect debts from or settle disputes
with individuals, corporations, or other governments. Thus
46 | INTRODUCTION TO LAW AND LEGAL SYSTEMS

U.S. v. Mayer might be a collection action for unpaid taxes,
or U.S. v. Canada might be a boundary dispute in the
International Court of Justice. Governments can be sued, as
well; people occasionally sue their state or federal government,
but they can only get a trial if the government waives its
sovereign immunity and allows such suits. Warner v. U.S., for
example, could be a claim for a tax refund wrongfully withheld
or for damage caused to the Warner residence by a sonic boom
from a US Air Force jet flying overhead.

2.3.5 Substance versus Procedure

Many rules and regulations in law are substantive, and others
are procedural. We are used to seeing laws as substantive; that
is, there is some rule of conduct or behavior that is called for
or some action that is proscribed (prohibited). The substantive
rules tell us how to act with one another and with the
government. For example, all of the following are substantive
rules of law and provide a kind of command or direction to
citizens:

   Drive not more than fifty-five miles per hour where that
      speed limit is posted.

   Do not conspire to fix prices with competitors in the US
      market.

   Do not falsely represent the curative effects of your over-
      the-counter herbal remedy.
                    INTRODUCTION TO LAW AND LEGAL SYSTEMS | 47

   Do not drive your motor vehicle through an intersection
      while a red traffic signal faces the direction you are
      coming from.

   Do not discriminate against job applicants or employees
      on the basis of their race, sex, religion, or national origin.

   Do not discharge certain pollutants into the river
      without first getting a discharge permit.

   In contrast, procedural
laws are the rules of courts
and administrative agencies.
They tell us how to proceed
if there is a substantive-law
problem. For example, if
you drive fifty-three miles
per hour in a forty mile-per-
hour zone on Main Street
on a Saturday night and get
a ticket, you have broken a
substantive rule of law (the Fourteenth Amendment,
posted speed limit). Just National Archives
how and what gets decided
in court is a matter of procedural law. Is the police officer's
word final, or do you get your say before a judge? If so, who
goes first, you or the officer? Do you have the right to be
represented by legal counsel? Does the hearing or trial have to
take place within a certain time period? A week? A month?
48 | INTRODUCTION TO LAW AND LEGAL SYSTEMS

How long can the state take to bring its case? What kinds of
evidence will be relevant? Radar? (Does it matter what kind
of training the officer has had on the radar device? Whether
the radar device had been tested adequately?) The officer's
personal observation? (What kind of training has he had, how
is he qualified to judge the speed of a car, and other questions
arise.)

What if you unwisely bragged to a friend at a party recently
that you went a hundred miles an hour on Main Street five
years ago at half past three on a Tuesday morning? (If the
prosecutor knows of this and the "friend" is willing to testify, is
it relevant to the charge of fifty-three in a forty-mile-per-hour
zone?)

   In the United States, all state procedural laws must be fair,
since the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment
directs that no state shall deprive any citizen of "life, liberty,
or property," without due process of law. (The $200 fine plus
court costs is designed to deprive you of property, that is,
money, if you violate the speed limit.) Federal laws must also
be fair, because the Fifth Amendment to the US Constitution
has the exact same due process language as the Fourteenth
Amendment. This suggests that some laws are more powerful
or important than others, which is true. The next section looks
at various types of positive law and their relative importance.

     Key Takeaway

     In most legal systems, like that in the United States,
     there is a fairly firm distinction between criminal law
     (for actions that are offenses against the entire
     society) and civil law (usually for disputes between
     individuals or corporations). Basic ethical norms for
     promise-keeping and not harming others are
     reflected in the civil law of contracts and torts. In the
     United States, both the states and the federal
     government have roles to play, and sometimes
     these roles will overlap, as in environmental
     standards set by both states and the federal
     government.

2.4 Sources of Law and Their
Priority

     Learning Objectives
     50 | INTRODUCTION TO LAW AND LEGAL SYSTEMS

         After reading this section, you should be able to do
         the following:

             1. Describe the different sources of law in the US
                 legal system and the principal institutions that
                 create those laws.

             2. Explain in what way a statute is like a treaty,
                 and vice versa.

             3. Explain why the Constitution is "prior" and
                 has priority over the legislative acts of a
                 majority, whether in the US Congress or in a
                 state legislature.

             4. Describe the origins of the common-law
                 system and what common law means.

   In the United States today, there are numerous sources of law.
   The main ones are (1) constitutions--both state and federal,
   (2) statutes and agency regulations, and (3) judicial decisions.
   In addition, chief executives (the president and the various
   governors) can issue executive orders that have the effect of law.

      In international legal systems, sources of law include
   treaties13 (agreements between states or countries) and what is

13. Formal agreements concluded between nation-states.
                          INTRODUCTION TO LAW AND LEGAL SYSTEMS | 51

   known as customary international law (usually consisting of
   judicial decisions from national court systems where parties
   from two or more nations are in a dispute).

      As you might expect, these laws sometimes conflict: a state
   law may conflict with a federal law, or a federal law might be
   contrary to an international obligation. One nation's law may
   provide one substantive rule, while another nation's law may
   provide a different, somewhat contrary rule to apply. Not all
   laws, in other words, are created equal. To understand which
   laws have priority, it is essential to understand the relationships
   between the various kinds of law.

  2.4.1 Constitutions

   Constitutions14 are the foundation for a state or nation's other
   laws, providing the country's legislative, executive, and judicial
   framework. Among the nations of the world, the United States
   has the oldest constitution still in use. It is difficult to amend,
   which is why there have only been seventeen amendments
   following the first ten in 1789; two-thirds of the House and
   Senate must pass amendments, and three-fourths of the states
   must approve them.

      The nation's states also have constitutions. Along with
   providing for legislative, executive, and judicial functions, state

14. The founding documents of any nation-state's legal system.
     52 | INTRODUCTION TO LAW AND LEGAL SYSTEMS

   constitutions prescribe various rights of citizens. These rights
   may be different from, and in addition to, rights granted by
   the US Constitution. Like statutes and judicial decisions, a
   constitution's specific provisions can provide people with a
   "cause of action" on which to base a lawsuit. For example,
   California's constitution provides that the citizens of that state
   have a right of privacy. This has been used to assert claims
   against businesses that invade an employee's right of privacy. In
   the case of Virginia Rulon-Miller, her employer, International
   Business Machines (IBM), told her to stop dating a former
   colleague who went to work for a competitor. When she
   refused, IBM terminated her, and a jury fined the company for
   $300,000 in damages. As the California court noted, "While
   an employee sacrifices some privacy rights when he enters the
   workplace, the employee's privacy expectations must be
   balanced against the employer's interests. [T]he point here is
   that privacy, like the other unalienable rights listed first in our
   Constitution. . . is unquestionably a fundamental interest of
   our society."15

                    INTRODUCTION TO LAW AND LEGAL SYSTEMS | 53

2.4.2 Statutes and Treaties in
Congress

In Washington, DC, the federal legislature is known as
Congress and has both a House of Representatives and a
Senate. The House is composed of representatives elected
every two years from various districts in each state. These
districts are established by Congress according to population
as determined every ten years by the census, a process required
by the Constitution. Each state has at least one district; the
most populous state (California) has fifty-two districts. In the
Senate, there are two senators from each state, regardless of
the state's population. Thus Delaware has two senators and
California has two senators, even though California has far
more people. Effectively, less than 20 percent of the nation's
population can send fifty senators to Washington.

   Many consider this to be antidemocratic. The House of
Representatives, on the other hand, is directly proportioned
by population, though no state can have less than one
representative.

   Each Congressional legislative body has committees for
various purposes. In these committees, proposed bills are
discussed, hearings are sometimes held, and bills are either
reported out (brought to the floor for a vote) or killed in
committee. If a bill is reported out, it may be passed by
majority vote. Because of the procedural differences between
the House and the Senate, bills that have the same language
54 | INTRODUCTION TO LAW AND LEGAL SYSTEMS

when proposed in both houses are apt to be different after
approval by each body. A conference committee will then be
held to try to match the two versions. If the two versions differ
widely enough, reconciliation of the two differing versions
into one acceptable to both chambers (House and Senate) is
more difficult.

   If the House and Senate can agree on identical language,
the reconciled bill will be sent to the president for signature
or veto. The Constitution prescribes that the president will
have veto power over any legislation. But the two bodies can
override a presidential veto with a two-thirds vote in each
chamber.

   In the case of treaties, the Constitution specifies that only
the Senate must ratify them. When the Senate ratifies a treaty,
it becomes part of federal law, with the same weight and effect
as a statute passed by the entire Congress. The statutes of
Congress are collected in codified form in the US Code. The
code is available online at http://uscode.house.gov.

2.4.3 Delegating Legislative Powers:
Rules by Administrative Agencies

Congress has found it necessary and useful to create
government agencies to administer various laws. The
Constitution does not expressly provide for administrative
agencies, but the US Supreme Court has upheld the delegation
of power to create federal agencies.
                    INTRODUCTION TO LAW AND LEGAL SYSTEMS | 55

   Examples of administrative agencies would include the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Federal
Trade Commission (FTC).

   It is important to note that Congress does not have
unlimited authority to delegate its lawmaking powers to an
agency. It must delegate its authority with some guidelines
for the agency and cannot altogether avoid its constitutional
responsibilities.

   Agencies propose rules in the Federal Register, published
each working day of the year. Rules that are formally adopted
are published in the Code of Federal Regulations, or CFR.

2.4.4 State Statutes and Agencies:
Other Codified Law

Statutes are passed by legislatures and provide general rules for
society. States have legislatures (sometimes called assemblies),
which are usually made up of both a senate and a house of
representatives. Like the federal government, state legislatures
will agree on the provisions of a bill, which is then sent to the
governor (acting like the president for that state) for signature.
Like the president, governors often have a veto power. The
process of creating and amending, or changing, laws is filled
with political negotiation and compromise.

   On a more local level, counties and municipal corporations
or townships may be authorized under a state's constitution
     56 | INTRODUCTION TO LAW AND LEGAL SYSTEMS

   to create or adopt ordinances. Examples of ordinances include
   local building codes, zoning laws, and misdemeanors or
   infractions such as skateboarding or jaywalking. Most of the
   more unusual laws that are in the news from time to time are
   local ordinances. For example, in Logan County, Colorado, it
   is illegal to kiss a sleeping woman; in Indianapolis, Indiana, and
   Eureka, Nebraska, it is a crime to kiss if you have a mustache.
   But reportedly, some states still have odd laws here and there.
   Kentucky law proclaims that every person in the state must
   take a bath at least once a year, and failure to do so is illegal.

  2.4.5 Judicial Decisions: The
  Common Law

   Common law16 consists of decisions by courts (judicial
   decisions) that do not involve interpretation of statutes,
   regulations, treaties, or the Constitution. Courts make such
   interpretations, but many cases are decided where there is no
   statutory or other codified law or regulation to be interpreted.
   For example, a state court deciding what kinds of witnesses are
   required for a valid will in the absence of a rule (from a statute)
   is making common law.

INTRODUCTION TO LAW AND LEGAL SYSTEMS | 57

                                United States Law comes

                                primarily from the tradition

                                of English common law. By

                                the time England's

                                American colonies revolted

                                in 1776, English common-

                                law traditions were well

                                established in the colonial

                                courts. English common law

                                was a system that gave

Sir William Blackstone          written judicial decisions
(1723-1780) was a famous        the force of law throughout
legal jurist who helped codify  the country. Thus if an
the common law.                 English court delivered an

                                opinion as to what

constituted the common-law crime of burglary, other courts

would stick to that decision, so that a common body of law

developed throughout the country. Common law is essentially

shorthand for the notion that a common body of law, based on

past written decisions, is desirable and necessary.In England

and in the laws of the original thirteen states, common-law

decisions defined crimes such as arson, burglary, homicide, and

robbery. As time went on, US state legislatures either adopted

or modified common-law definitions of most crimes by

putting them in the form of codes or statutes. This legislative

ability--to modify or change common law into judicial

law--points to an important phenomenon: the priority of
58 | INTRODUCTION TO LAW AND LEGAL SYSTEMS

statutory law over common law. As we will see in the next
section, constitutional law will have priority over statutory law.

2.4.6 Priority of Laws

2.4.6.1 The Constitution as Preemptive Force in US
Law The US Constitution takes precedence over all statutes
and judicial decisions that are inconsistent. For example, if
Michigan were to decide legislatively that students cannot
speak ill of professors in state-sponsored universities, that law
would be void, since it is inconsistent with the state's
obligation under the First Amendment to protect free speech.
Or if the Michigan courts were to allow a professor to bring a
lawsuit against a student who had said something about him
that was derogatory but not defamatory, the state's judicial
system would not be acting according to the First
Amendment. (As we will see later, free speech has its limits;
defamation was a cause of action at the time the First
Amendment was added to the Constitution, and it has been
understood that the free speech rights in the First Amendment
did not negate existing common law.)

   2.4.6.2 Statutes and Cases Statutes generally have
priority, or take precedence, over case law (judicial decisions).
Under common-law judicial decisions, employers could hire
young children for difficult work, offer any wage they wanted,
and not pay overtime work at a higher rate. But various statutes
changed that. For example, the federal Fair Labor Standards
                    INTRODUCTION TO LAW AND LEGAL SYSTEMS | 59

Act (1938) forbid the use of oppressive child labor and
established a minimum pay wage and overtime pay rules.

   2.4.6.3 Treaties as Statutes: The "Last in Time" Rule
A treaty or convention is considered of equal standing to a
statute. Thus when Congress ratified the North American
Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), any judicial decisions or
previous statutes that were inconsistent--such as quotas or
limitations on imports from Mexico that were opposite to
NAFTA commitments--would no longer be valid. Similarly,
US treaty obligations under the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade (GATT) and obligations made later through the
World Trade Organization (WTO) would override previous
federal or state statutes.

   One example of treaty obligations overriding, or taking
priority over, federal statutes was the tuna-dolphin dispute
between the United States and Mexico. The Marine Mammal
Protection Act amendments in 1988 spelled out certain
protections for dolphins in the Eastern Tropical Pacific, and
the United States began refusing to allow the importation of
tuna that were caught using "dolphin-unfriendly" methods
(such as purse seining). This was challenged at a GATT
dispute panel in Switzerland, and the United States lost. The
discussion continued at the WTO under its dispute resolution
process. In short, US environmental statutes can be ruled
contrary to US treaty obligations.

   Under most treaties, the United States can withdraw, or take
back, any voluntary limitation on its sovereignty; participation
60 | INTRODUCTION TO LAW AND LEGAL SYSTEMS

in treaties is entirely elective. That is, the United States may
"unbind" itself whenever it chooses. But for practical
purposes, some limitations on sovereignty may be good for the
nation. The argument goes something like this: if free trade
in general helps the United States, then it makes some sense
to be part of a system that promotes free trade; and despite
some temporary setbacks, the WTO decision process will (it is
hoped) provide far more benefits than losses in the long run.
This argument invokes utilitarian theory (that the best policy
does the greatest good overall for society) and David Ricardo's
theory of comparative advantage.

Ultimately, whether the United States remains a supporter of
free trade and continues to participate as a leader in the WTO
will depend upon citizens electing leaders who support the
process. Had Ross Perot been elected in 1992, for example,
NAFTA would have been politically (and legally) dead during
his term of office.

2.4.7 Causes of Action, Precedent,
and Stare Decisis

No matter how wrong someone's actions may seem to you,
the only wrongs you can right in a court are those that can be
                          INTRODUCTION TO LAW AND LEGAL SYSTEMS | 61

   tied to one or more causes of action.17 The legal basis can be
   a Constitutional law, a statute, a regulation, or a prior judicial
   decision that creates a precedent to be followed. Positive law is
   full of cases, treaties, statutes, regulations, and constitutional
   provisions that can be made into a cause of action. If you have
   an agreement with Harold Hill that he will purchase seventy-
   six trombones from you and he fails to pay for them after
   you deliver, you will probably feel wronged, but a court will
   only act favorably on your complaint if you can show that his
   behavior gives you a cause of action based on some part of your
   state's contract law. This case would give you a cause of action
   under the law of most states; unless Harold Hill had some legal
   excuse recognized by the applicable state's contract law--such
   as his legal incompetence, his being less than eighteen years
   of age, his being drunk at the time the agreement was made,
   or his claim that the instruments were trumpets rather than
   trombones or that they were delivered too late to be of use to
   him--you could expect to recover some compensation for his
   breaching of your agreement with him.

      An old saying in the law is that the law does not deal in
   trifles, or unimportant issues (in Latin, de minimis non curat
   lex). Not every wrong you may suffer in life will be a cause to
   bring a court action. If you are stood up for a Saturday night
   date and feel embarrassed or humiliated, you cannot recover

17. In a complaint, a legal basis on which a claim is predicated.
     62 | INTRODUCTION TO LAW AND LEGAL SYSTEMS

   anything in a court of law in the United States, as there is no
   cause of action (no basis in the positive law) that you can use
   in your complaint.18 If you are engaged to be married and your
   spouse-to-be bolts from the wedding ceremony, there are some
   states that do provide a legal basis on which to bring a lawsuit.
   "Breach of promise to marry" is recognized in several states,
   but most states have abolished this cause of action, either by
   judicial decision or by legislation. Whether a runaway bride
   or groom gives rise to a valid cause of action in the courts
   depends on whether the state courts still recognize and enforce
   this now-disappearing cause of action.

      Your cause of action is thus based on existing laws, including
   decided cases. How closely your case "fits" with a prior decided
   case raises the question of precedent.

      Generally speaking, to plausibly allege a cause of action,
   courts look to three elements: (1) did the plaintiff suffer a non-
   hypothetical, concrete injury? (2) Was it plausibly caused by
   the defendant? (3) Is the problem one a court has the capacity
   to redress? If each of these elements is present, the plaintiff has
   legal "standing" to sue. For example, if my neighbor's house
   was robbed, it is my neighbor, not I, that has suffered an injury.
   I would not have standing to sue. Often businesses can get
   lawsuits dismissed by arguing that no real injury has occurred.

18. For a good example of this, see the last exercise problem at the end of
    this section!
                    INTRODUCTION TO LAW AND LEGAL SYSTEMS | 63

For instance, if a plaintiff slipped and fell at your business with
no obvious injury, but sought to recover the costs of future
medical monitoring to ensure they had not been injured, one
could argue they lack standing to sue. At the point an injury
manifested, the plaintiff would have a stronger case.

Causes of action developed through hundreds of years of legal
decisions building on each other. As noted earlier in this
chapter, the English common-law tradition placed great
emphasis on precedent and what is called stare decisis. A court
considering one case would feel obliged to decide that case in
a way similar to previously decided cases. Written decisions
of the most important cases had been spread throughout
England (the common "realm"), and judges hoped to establish
a somewhat predictable, consistent group of decisions.

   The English legislature (Parliament) was not in the practice
of establishing detailed statutes on crimes, torts, contracts, or
property. Thus definitions and rules were left primarily to the
courts. By their nature, courts could only decide one case at a
time, but in doing so they would articulate holdings, or general
rules, that would apply to later cases.

   Suppose that one court had to decide whether an employer
could fire an employee for no reason at all. Suppose that there
were no statutes that applied to the facts: there was no contract
between the employer and the employee, but the employee had
worked for the employer for many years, and now a younger
person was replacing him. The court, with no past guidelines,
64 | INTRODUCTION TO LAW AND LEGAL SYSTEMS

would have to decide whether the employee had stated a "cause
of action" against the employer. If the court decided that the
case was not legally actionable, it would dismiss the action.
Future courts would then treat similar cases in a similar way.
In the process, the court might make a holding that employers
could fire employees for any reason or for no reason. This rule
could be applied in the future should similar cases come up.

   But suppose that an employer fired an employee for not
committing perjury (lying on the witness stand in a court
proceeding); the employer wanted the employee to cover up
the company's criminal or unethical act. Suppose that, as in
earlier cases, there were no applicable statutes and no contract
of employment. Courts relying on a holding or precedent that
"employers may fire employees for any reason or no reason"
might rule against an employee seeking compensation for
being fired for telling the truth on the witness stand. Or it
might make an exception to the general rule, such as,
"Employers may generally discharge employees for any reason
or for no reason without incurring legal liability; however,
employers will incur legal liability for firing an employee who
refuses to lie on behalf of the employer in a court proceeding."

   In each case (the general rule and its exception), the
common-law tradition calls for the court to explain the reasons
for its ruling. In the case of the general rule, "freedom of
choice" might be the major reason. In the case of the perjury
exception, the efficiency of the judicial system and the
requirements of citizenship might be used as reasons. Because
                    INTRODUCTION TO LAW AND LEGAL SYSTEMS | 65

the court's "reasons" will be persuasive to some and not to
others, there is inevitably a degree of subjectivity to judicial
opinions. That is, reasonable people will disagree as to the
persuasiveness of the reasoning a court may offer for its
decision.

   Written judicial opinions are thus a good playing field for
developing critical thinking skills by identifying the issue in
a case and examining the reasons for the court's previous
decision(s), or holding. What has the court actually decided,
and why? Remember that a court, especially the US Supreme
Court, is not only deciding one particular case but also setting
down guidelines (in its holdings) for federal and state courts
that encounter similar issues. Note that court cases often raise
a variety of issues or questions to be resolved, and judges (and
attorneys) will differ as to what the real issue in a case is. A
holding is the court's complete answer to an issue that is critical
to deciding the case and thus gives guidance to the meaning of
the case as a precedent for future cases.

   Beyond the decision of the court, it is in looking at the
court's reasoning that you are most likely to understand what
facts have been most significant to the court and what theories
(schools of legal thought) each trial or appellate judge believes
in. Because judges do not always agree on first principles (i.e.,
they subscribe to different schools of legal thought), there are
many divided opinions in appellate opinions and in each US
Supreme Court term.
66 | INTRODUCTION TO LAW AND LEGAL SYSTEMS

     Key Takeaway

     There are different sources of law in the US legal
     system. The US Constitution is foundational; US
     statutory and common law cannot be inconsistent
     with its provisions. Congress creates statutory law
     (with the signature of the president), and courts will
     interpret constitutional law and statutory law.
     Where there is neither constitutional law nor
     statutory law, the courts function in the realm of
     common law. The same is true of law within the fifty
     states, each of which also has a constitution, or
     foundational law.
     Both the federal government and the states have
     created administrative agencies. An agency only has
     the power that the legislature gives it. Within the
     scope of that power, an agency will often create
     regulations, which have the same force and effect as
     statutes. Treaties are never negotiated and
     concluded by states, as the federal government has
     exclusive authority over relations with other nation-
     states. A treaty, once ratified by the Senate, has the
                    INTRODUCTION TO LAW AND LEGAL SYSTEMS | 67

     same force and effect as a statute passed by
     Congress and signed into law by the president.
     Constitutions, statutes, regulations, treaties, and
     court decisions can provide a legal basis in the
     positive law. You may believe you have been
     wronged, but for you to have a right that is
     enforceable in court, you must have something in
     the positive law that you can point to that will
     support a cause of action against your chosen
     defendant.

2.5 Legal and Political Systems
of the World

     Learning Objectives

     After reading this section, you should be able to do
     the following:
68 | INTRODUCTION TO LAW AND LEGAL SYSTEMS

         1. Describe how the common-law system differs
             from the civil-law system.

         2. Describe what the term international law
             means, and what it doesn't mean.

Other legal and political systems are very different from the
US system, which came from English common-law traditions
and the framers of the US Constitution. Our legal and political
traditions are different both in what kinds of laws we make and
honor and in how disputes are resolved in court.

2.5.1 Comparing Common-Law
Systems with Other Legal Systems

The common-law tradition is unique to England, the United
States, and former colonies of the British Empire. Although
there are differences among common-law systems (e.g., most
nations do not permit their judiciaries to declare legislative acts
unconstitutional; some nations use the jury less frequently),
all of them recognize the use of precedent in judicial cases,
and none of them relies on the comprehensive, legislative codes
that are prevalent in civil-law systems.
2.5.2      INTRODUCTION TO LAW AND LEGAL SYSTEMS | 69

       Civil-Law Systems

The main alternative to the common-law legal system was
developed in Europe and is based in Roman and Napoleonic
law. A civil-law or code-law system is one where all the legal
rules are in one or more comprehensive legislative enactments.
During Napoleon's reign, a comprehensive book of laws--a
code--was developed for all of France. The code covered
criminal law, criminal procedure, noncriminal law and
procedure, and commercial law. The rules of the code are still
used today in France and in other continental European legal
systems. The code is used to resolve particular cases, usually by
judges without a jury. Moreover, the judges are not required to
follow the decisions of other courts in similar cases. As George
Cameron of the University of Michigan has noted, "The law
is in the code, not in the cases." He goes on to note, "Where
several cases all have interpreted a provision in a particular way,
the French courts may feel bound to reach the same result in
future cases, under the doctrine of jurisprudence constante.
The major agency for growth and change, however, is the
legislature, not the courts."

   Civil-law systems are used throughout Europe as well as in
Central and South America. Some nations in Asia and Africa
have also adopted codes based on European civil law. Germany,
Holland, Spain, France, and Portugal all had colonies outside
of Europe, and many of these colonies adopted the legal
practices that were imposed on them by colonial rule, much
70 | INTRODUCTION TO LAW AND LEGAL SYSTEMS

like the original thirteen states of the United States, which
adopted English common-law practices.

   One source of possible confusion at this point is that we
have already referred to US civil law in contrast to criminal law.
But the European civil law covers both civil and criminal law.

   There are also legal systems that differ significantly from
the common-law and civil-law systems. The communist and
socialist legal systems that remain (e.g., in Cuba and North
Korea) operate on very different assumptions than those of
either English common law or European civil law. Islamic and
other religion-based systems of law bring different values and
assumptions to social and commercial relations.

2.5.3 International "Law"

The term "international law" is often used, which deserves
mention in this context. In the sense of a sovereign making
laws discussed above, there is no "international law". No
international sovereign musters an international police force
to enforce a series of international statutes. There are broad
principles, along natural law lines, that most nations and
people agree to, and which nations or coalitions of nations
may choose to use military power to enforce. This takes us
more into the realm of geopolitics than law. In a looser sense,
international law does exist through more informal means
such as excluding nations from elements of international
cooperation. In this sense, international principles or norms
                     INTRODUCTION TO LAW AND LEGAL SYSTEMS | 71

of conduct can be enforced. In this sense, international law
is much like canon or church law, whose enforcement
mechanism is excommunication from the body of believers.
We devote a chapter to international law later in the text, but
even there our focus will be on United States law applied in an
international context, such as how United States courts treat
decisions by courts of other countries, and whether a court
in the United States should rule on a dispute that occurred
outside the United States.

   To give practice on the principles discussed in this chapter,
we conclude with an example case that illustrates the law in
practice.

     Key Takeaway

     Legal systems vary widely in their aims and in the
     way they process civil and criminal cases. Common-
     law systems use juries, have one judge, and adhere
     to precedent. Civil law systems decide cases without
     a jury, often use three judges, and often render
     shorter opinions without reference to previously
     decided cases.

COURTS AND THE
LEGAL PROCESS

     Learning Objectives

     After reading this chapter, you should be able to do
     the following:

         1. Describe the two different court systems in
             the United States, and explain why some
             cases can be filed in either court system.

         2. Explain the importance of subject matter
             jurisdiction and personal jurisdiction and
             know the difference between the two.

         3. Describe the various stages of a civil action:
             from pleadings, to discovery, to trial, and to
             appeals.
74 | COURTS AND THE LEGAL PROCESS

         4. Describe two alternatives to litigation:
             mediation and arbitration.

In the United States, law and government are interdependent.
The Constitution establishes the basic framework of
government and imposes certain limitations on the powers
of government. In turn, the various branches of government
are intimately involved in making, enforcing, and interpreting
the law. Today, much of the law comes from Congress and
the state legislatures. But it is in the courts that legislation is
interpreted and prior case law is interpreted and applied.

   As we go through this chapter, consider the case of Harry
and Kay Robinson. In which court should the Robinsons file
their action? Can the Oklahoma court hear the case and make
a judgment that will be enforceable against all of the
defendants? Which law will the court use to come to a
decision? Will it use New York law, Oklahoma law, federal law,
or German law?

       Robinson v. Audi
                           COURTS AND THE LEGAL PROCESS | 75

Harry and Kay Robinson purchased a new Audi
automobile from Seaway Volkswagen, Inc.
(Seaway), in Massena, New York, in 1976. The
following year the Robinson family, who resided
in New York, left that state for a new home in
Arizona. As they passed through Oklahoma,
another car struck their Audi in the rear, causing
a fire that severely burned Kay Robinson and her
two children. Later on, the Robinsons brought a
products liability action in the District Court for
Creek County, Oklahoma, claiming that their
injuries resulted from the defective design and
placement of the Audi's gas tank and fuel
system. They sued numerous defendants,
including the automobile's manufacturer, Audi
NSU Auto Union Aktiengesellschaft (Audi); its
importer, Volkswagen of America, Inc.
(Volkswagen); its regional distributor, World-
Wide Volkswagen Corp. (World-Wide); and its
retail dealer, Seaway.

Should the Robinsons bring their action in state
court or in federal court? Over which of the
defendants will the court have personal
jurisdiction?

3.1 The Relationship between
State and Federal Court Systems
in the United States

     Learning Objectives

     After reading this section, you should be able to do
     the following:

         1. Understand the different but complementary
             roles of state and federal court systems.

         2. Explain why it makes sense for some courts
             to hear and decide only certain kinds of cases.

         3. Describe the difference between a trial court
             and an appellate court.

Although it is sometimes said that there are two separate court
systems, the reality is more complex. There are, in fact, fifty-
two court systems: those of the fifty states, the local court
system in the District of Columbia, and the federal court
system. At the same time, these are not entirely separate; they
all have several points of contact.
                                     COURTS AND THE LEGAL PROCESS | 77

   State and local courts must honor both federal law and the
laws of the other states. First, state courts must honor federal
law where state laws are in conflict with federal laws (under the
supremacy clause of the Constitution). Second, claims arising
under federal statutes can often be tried in the state courts,
where the Constitution or Congress has not explicitly required
that only federal courts can hear that kind of claim. Third,
under the full faith and credit clause, each state court is
obligated to respect the final judgments of courts in other
states. Thus a contract dispute resolved by an Arkansas court
cannot be relitigated in North Dakota when the plaintiff wants
to collect on the Arkansas judgment in North Dakota. Fourth,
state courts often must consider the laws of other states in
deciding cases involving issues where two states have an
interest, such as when drivers from two different states collide
in a third state. Under these circumstances, state judges will
consult their own state's case decisions involving conflicts of
laws and sometimes decide that they must apply another state's
laws to decide the case.

   As state courts are concerned with federal law, so federal
courts are often concerned with state law and with what
happens in state courts. Federal courts will consider state-law-
based claims when a case involves claims using both state and
federal law. Claims based on federal laws will permit the federal
court to take jurisdiction over the whole case, including any
state issues raised. In those cases, the federal court is said to
exercise "pendent jurisdiction" over the state claims. Also, the
   78 | COURTS AND THE LEGAL PROCESS

  Supreme Court will occasionally take appeals from a state
  supreme court where state law raises an important issue of
  federal law to be decided. For example, a convict on death row
  may claim that the state's chosen method of execution using
  the injection of drugs is unusually painful and involves "cruel
  and unusual punishment," raising an Eighth Amendment
  issue.

     There is also a broad category of cases heard in federal courts
  that concern only state legal issues--namely, cases that arise
  between citizens of different states. The federal courts are
  permitted to hear these cases under their so-called diversity of
  citizenship jurisdiction1 (or diversity jurisdiction). A citizen of
  New Jersey may sue a citizen of New York over a contract
  dispute in federal court, but if both were citizens of New
  Jersey, the plaintiff would be limited to the state courts. The
  Constitution established diversity jurisdiction because it was
  feared that local courts would be hostile toward people from
  other states and that they would need separate courts. In 2009,
  nearly a third of all lawsuits filed in federal court were based
  on diversity of citizenship. In these cases, the federal courts
  were applying state law, rather than taking federal question

1. Subject matter jurisdiction in federal court where the plaintiff is a
  citizen of one state, no defendant is also a citizen of that state, and
  the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000.
                                        COURTS AND THE LEGAL PROCESS | 79

  jurisdiction2, where federal law provided the basis for the
  lawsuit or where the United States was a party (as plaintiff or
  defendant).

     Why are there so many diversity cases in federal courts?
  Defense lawyers believe that there is sometimes a "home-court
  advantage" for an in-state plaintiff who brings a lawsuit against
  a nonresident in his local state court. The defense attorney
  is entitled to ask for removal3 to a federal court where there
  is diversity. This fits with the original reason for diversity
  jurisdiction in the Constitution--the concern that judges in
  one state court would favor the in-state plaintiff rather than
  a nonresident defendant. Another reason there are so many
  diversity cases is that sometimes plaintiffs' attorneys know that
  removal is common and that it will move the case along faster
  by filing in federal court to begin with.4 Federal court
  procedures are often more efficient than state court
  procedures, so that federal dockets are often less crowded. This
  means a case will get to trial faster, and many lawyers enjoy

  uses a federal statutory, regulatory, or constitutional law as a cause of

3. The right of a defendant to remove a case from state to federal court.

   80 | COURTS AND THE LEGAL PROCESS

  the higher status that comes in practicing before the federal
  bench. In some federal districts, judgments for plaintiffs may
  be higher, on average, than in the local state court. In short,
  not only law but also legal strategy factor into the popularity
  of diversity cases in federal courts.

 3.1.1 State Court Systems

  The vast majority of civil lawsuits in the United States are filed
  in state courts. Two aspects of civil lawsuits are common to
  all state courts: trials and appeals. A court exercising a trial
  function has original jurisdiction5--that is, jurisdiction to
  determine the facts of the case and apply the law to them. A
  court that hears appeals from the trial court is said to have
  appellate jurisdiction6--it must accept the facts as determined
  by the trial court and limit its review to the lower court's
  theory of the applicable law.

     3.1.1.1 Limited Jurisdiction Courts In most large
  urban states and many smaller states, there are four and

5. The jurisdiction that a judge has to hear witnesses and receive
  evidence in a trial proceeding.

6. The jurisdiction of an appellate court to review whether the parties
  received a fair trial in accordance with applicable law. Appellate
  jurisdiction does not include hearing witnesses or receiving new
  evidence.
                                     COURTS AND THE LEGAL PROCESS | 81

sometimes five levels of courts. The lowest level is that of the
limited jurisdiction courts. These are usually county or
municipal courts with original jurisdiction to hear minor
criminal cases (petty assaults, traffic offenses, and breach of
peace, among others) and civil cases involving monetary
amounts up to a fixed ceiling. Most disputes that wind up
in court are handled in the 18,000-plus limited jurisdiction
courts, which are estimated to hear more than 80 percent of all
cases.

   One familiar limited jurisdiction court is the small claims
court, with jurisdiction to hear civil cases involving claims for
amounts ranging between $1,000 and $5,000 in about half
the states and for considerably less in the other states ($500 to
$1,000). In Iowa, our small claims courts hear cases claiming
amounts up to $6,500. The advantage of the small claims
court is that its procedures are informal, it is often located in
a neighborhood outside the business district, it is usually open
after business hours, and it is speedy. Lawyers are not necessary
to present the case and in some states are not allowed to appear
in court.

   3.1.1.2 General Jurisdiction Courts All other civil and
criminal cases are heard in the general trial courts, or courts of
general jurisdiction. These go by a variety of names: superior,
circuit, district, or common pleas court (New York calls its
general trial court the supreme court). These are the courts
in which people seek redress for incidents such as automobile
accidents and injuries, or breaches of contract. These state
   82 | COURTS AND THE LEGAL PROCESS

  courts also prosecute those accused of murder, rape, robbery,
  and other serious crimes. The fact finder in these general
  jurisdiction courts is not a judge, as in the lower courts, but a
  jury of citizens. In Iowa, our general trial courts are referred to
  as District Courts, and we have one for each county.7

     Although courts of general jurisdiction can hear all types
  of cases, in most states more than half involve family matters
  (divorce, child custody disputes, and the like). A third were
  commercial cases, and slightly over 10 percent were devoted to
  car accident cases and other torts.

     Most states have specialized courts that hear only a certain
  type of case, such as landlord-tenant disputes or probate of
  wills. Decisions by judges in specialized courts are usually final,
  although any party dissatisfied with the outcome may be able
  to get a new trial in a court of general jurisdiction. Because
  there has been one trial already, this is known as a trial de novo.
  It is not an appeal, since the case essentially starts over.

     3.1.1.3 Appellate Courts The losing party in a general
  jurisdiction court can almost always appeal to either one or
  two higher courts. These intermediate appellate

7. For unusual historic reasons, one Iowa county, Lee, has two county
  seats and two county courthouses:

                                    COURTS AND THE LEGAL PROCESS | 83

courts--usually called courts of appeal--have been established
in forty states. They do not retry the evidence, but rather
determine whether the trial was conducted in a procedurally
correct manner and whether the appropriate law was applied.
For example, the appellant (the losing party who appeals)
might complain that the judge wrongly instructed the jury
on the meaning of the law, or improperly allowed testimony
of a particular witness, or misconstrued the law in question.
The appellee (who won in the lower court) will ask that the
appellant be denied--usually this means that the appellee
wants the lower-court judgment affirmed. The appellate court
has quite a few choices: it can affirm, modify, reverse, or reverse
and remand the lower court (return the case to the lower court
for retrial).

   The last type of appeal within the state courts system is to
the highest court, the state supreme court, which is composed
of a single panel of between five and nine judges and is usually
located in the state capital. (The intermediate appellate courts
are usually composed of panels of three judges and are situated
in various locations around the state.) In a few states, the
highest court goes by a different name: in New York, it is
known as the court of appeals. In certain cases, appellants to
the highest court in a state have the right to have their appeals
heard, but more often the supreme court selects the cases it
wishes to hear. For most litigants, the ruling of the state
supreme court is final. In a relatively small class of cases--those
in which federal constitutional claims are made--appeal to
   84 | COURTS AND THE LEGAL PROCESS

  the US Supreme Court to issue a writ of certiorari8 remains a
  possibility.

        Optional Viewing - The Iowa Supreme Court

        The Iowa Supreme Court consists of seven Justices.
        The finalists for an open position are chosen through
        a merit-based system, and then the Governor
        chooses from that slate to appoint a new Justice. In
        this video interview, Professor Dayton interviews
        Justice McDermott shortly after his appointment to
        the Iowa Supreme Court.

8. The writ issued by a higher court that grants review of the decision
  of a lower court. In the United States, the Supreme Court's writ of
  certiorari is highly sought by those who would have the court review
  a state supreme court judgment or that of a federal circuit court of
  appeals. Most of the cases heard by the Supreme Court are through
  the granting of a petitioner's appeal to have the writ issued.

3.1.2 The Federal Court System

3.1.2.1 District Courts The federal judicial system is
uniform throughout the United States and consists of three
levels. At the first level are the federal district courts, which
are the trial courts in the federal system. Every state has one or
more federal districts; the less populous states have one, and
the more populous states (California, Texas, and New York)
have four. The federal court with the heaviest commercial
docket is the US District Court for the Southern District of
New York (Manhattan). There are forty-four district judges
and fifteen magistrates in this district. The district judges
throughout the United States commonly preside over all
federal trials, both criminal and civil.
86 | COURTS AND THE LEGAL PROCESS

   3.1.2.2 Courts of Appeal Cases from the district courts
can then be appealed to the circuit courts of appeal, of which
there are thirteen. Each circuit oversees the work of the district
courts in several states. For example, the US Court of Appeals
for the Second Circuit hears appeals from district courts in
New York, Connecticut, and Vermont. The US Court of
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit hears appeals from district
courts in California, Oregon, Nevada, Montana, Washington,
Idaho, Arizona, Alaska, Hawaii, and Guam. The US Court
of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit hears appeals
from the district court in Washington, DC, as well as from
numerous federal administrative agencies. The US Court of
Appeals for the Federal Circuit, also located in Washington,
hears appeals in patent and customs cases. Appeals are usually
heard by three-judge panels, but sometimes there will be a
rehearing at the court of appeals level, in which case all judges
sit to hear the case "en banc."

   There are also several specialized courts in the federal
judicial system. These include the US Tax Court, the Court of
Customs and Patent Appeals, and the Court of Claims.

   3.1.2.3 United States Supreme Court Overseeing all
federal courts is the US Supreme Court, in Washington, DC.
It consists of nine justices--the chief justice and eight associate
justices. (This number is not constitutionally required;
Congress can establish any number. It has been set at nine
since after the Civil War.) The Supreme Court has selective
control over most of its docket. By law, the cases it hears
                                    COURTS AND THE LEGAL PROCESS | 87

represent only a tiny fraction of the cases that are submitted.
In 2008, the Supreme Court had numerous petitions (over
7,000, not including thousands of petitions from prisoners)
but heard arguments in only 87 cases. The Supreme Court
does not sit in panels. All the justices hear and consider each
case together, unless a justice has a conflict of interest and must
withdraw from hearing the case.

   Federal judges--including Supreme Court justices--are
nominated by the president and must be confirmed by the
Senate. Unlike state judges, who are usually elected and preside
for a fixed term of years, federal judges sit for life unless they
voluntarily retire or are impeached.

     Key Takeaway

     Trial courts and appellate courts have different
     functions. State trial courts sometimes hear cases
     with federal law issues, and federal courts
     sometimes hear cases with state law issues. Within
     both state and federal court systems, it is useful to
     know the different kinds of courts and what cases
     they can decide.

3.2 The Problem of Jurisdiction

     Learning Objectives

     After reading this section, you should be able to do
     the following:

         1. Explain the concept of subject matter
   90 | COURTS AND THE LEGAL PROCESS

                jurisdiction and distinguish it from personal
                jurisdiction.
            2. Understand how and where the US
                Constitution provides a set of instructions as
                to what federal courts are empowered by law
                to do.
            3. Know which kinds of cases must be heard in
                federal courts only.
           4. Explain diversity of citizenship jurisdiction and
                be able to decide whether a case is eligible for
                diversity jurisdiction in the federal courts.

  Jurisdiction is an essential concept in understanding courts
  and the legal system. Jurisdiction is a combination of two
  Latin words: juris (law) and diction (to speak). Which court
  has the power "to speak the law" is the basic question of
  jurisdiction.

     There are two questions about jurisdiction in each case that
  must be answered before a judge will hear a case: the question
  of subject matter jurisdiction9 and the question of personal
  jurisdiction. We will consider the question of subject matter
  jurisdiction first, because judges do; if they determine, on the

   basis of the initial documents in the case (the "pleadings"), that
   they have no power to hear and decide that kind of case, they
   will dismiss it.

  3.2.1 The Federal-State Balance:
  Federalism

   State courts have their origins in colonial era courts. After the
   American Revolution, state courts functioned (with some
   differences) much like they did in colonial times. The big
   difference after 1789 was that state courts coexisted with
   federal courts. Federalism10 was the system devised by the
   nation's founders in which power is shared between states and
   the federal government. This sharing requires a division of
   labor between the states and the federal government. It is
   Article III of the US Constitution that spells out the respective
   spheres of authority (jurisdiction) between state and federal
   courts.

      Take a close look at Article III of the Constitution. Article
   III makes clear that federal courts are courts of limited power
   or jurisdiction. Notice that the only kinds of cases federal
   courts are authorized to deal with have strong federal

10. The idea, originating with the Constitution's Founding Fathers, that
    the United States legal and political system would be one of
    governance shared between the states and the federal government.
92 | COURTS AND THE LEGAL PROCESS

connections. For example, federal courts have jurisdiction
when a federal law is being used by the plaintiff or prosecutor
(a "federal question" case) or the case arises "in admiralty"
(meaning that the problem arose not on land but on sea,
beyond the territorial jurisdiction of any state, or in navigable
waters within the United States). Implied in this list is the
clear notion that states would continue to have their own laws,
interpreted by their own courts, and that federal courts were
needed only where the issues raised by the parties had a clear
federal connection. The exception to this is diversity
jurisdiction, discussed later.

   The Constitution was constructed with the idea that state
courts would continue to deal with basic kinds of claims such
as tort, contract, or property claims. Since states sanction
marriages and divorce, state courts would deal with "domestic"
(family) issues. Since states deal with birth and death records,
it stands to reason that paternity suits, probate disputes, and
the like usually wind up in state courts. You wouldn't go to
the federal building or courthouse to get a marriage license, ask
for a divorce, or probate a will: these matters have traditionally
been dealt with by the states (and the thirteen original colonies
before them). Matters that historically get raised and settled
in state court under state law include not only domestic and
probate matters but also law relating to corporations,
partnerships, agency, contracts, property, torts, and
commercial dealings generally. You cannot get married or
divorced in federal court, because federal courts have no
                                    COURTS AND THE LEGAL PROCESS | 93

jurisdiction over matters that are historically (and are still)
exclusively within the domain of state law.

                                      In terms of subject matter
                                      jurisdiction, then, state
                                      courts will typically deal
                                      with the kinds of disputes
                                      just cited. Thus if you are
                                      Michigan resident and have
an auto accident in Toledo with an Ohio resident and you each
blame each other for the accident, the state courts would
ordinarily resolve the matter if the dispute cannot otherwise be
settled. Why state courts? Because when you blame one
another and allege that it's the other person's fault, you have
the beginnings of a tort case, with negligence as a primary
element of the claim, and state courts have routinely dealt with
this kind of claim, from British colonial times through
Independence and to the present. People have had a need to
resolve this kind of dispute long before our federal courts were
created, and you can tell from Article III that the founders did
not specify that tort or negligence claims should be handled by
the federal courts. Again, federal courts are courts of limited
jurisdiction, limited to the kinds of cases specified in Article
III. If the case before the federal court does not fall within one
of those categories, the federal court cannot constitutionally
hear the case because it does not have subject matter
jurisdiction.
     94 | COURTS AND THE LEGAL PROCESS

      Always remember: a court must have subject matter
   jurisdiction to hear and decide a case. Without it, a court
   cannot address the merits of the controversy or even take the
   next jurisdictional step of figuring out which of the defendants
   can be sued in that court. The question of which defendants
   are appropriately before the court is a question of personal
   jurisdiction.11

      Because there are two court systems, it is important for a
   plaintiff to file in the right court to begin with. The right
   court is the one that has subject matter jurisdiction over the
   case--that is, the power to hear and decide the kind of case that
   is filed. Not only is it a waste of time to file in the wrong court
   system and be dismissed, but if the dismissal comes after the
   filing period imposed by the applicable statute of limitations12,
   it will be too late to refile in the correct court system. Such

11. Each court must have subject matter jurisdiction and personal
    jurisdiction over at least one named defendant. If the defendant is a
    nonresident where the lawsuit is filed, there may be constitutional
    issues of personal jurisdiction arising from the due process clause of
    the Fourteenth Amendment. One state should not claim personal
    jurisdiction over a nonresident unless various tests are met, such as
    minimum contacts and the "purposeful availment" test.

12. Each state and the federal government has legislated certain time
    periods beyond which plaintiffs are not allowed to file civil lawsuits.
    (There are some statutes of limitations for some kinds of criminal
    offenses, as well.)
                                    COURTS AND THE LEGAL PROCESS | 95

cases will be routinely dismissed, regardless of how deserving
the plaintiff might be in his quest for justice. (The plaintiff's
only remedy at that point would be to sue his lawyer for
negligence for failing to mind the clock and get to the right
court in time!)

3.2.2 Exclusive Jurisdiction in Federal
Courts

With two court systems, a plaintiff
(or the plaintiff's attorney, most
likely) must decide whether to file
a case in the state court system or
the federal court system. Federal
courts have exclusive jurisdiction
over certain kinds of cases. The
reason for this comes directly from the Constitution. Article
III of the US Constitution provides the following:

       The judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in
       Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution,
       the Laws of the United States, and Treaties
       made, or which shall be made, under their
       Authority; to all Cases affecting Ambassadors,
96 | COURTS AND THE LEGAL PROCESS

       other public Ministers and Consuls; to all Cases of
       admiralty and maritime Jurisdiction; to
       Controversies to which the United States shall be
       a Party; to Controversies between two or more
       States; between a State and Citizens of another
       State; between Citizens of different States;
       between Citizens of the same State claiming
       Lands under Grants of different States, and
       between a State, or the Citizens thereof, and
       foreign States, Citizens or Subjects.

By excluding diversity cases, we can assemble a list of the kinds
of cases that can only be heard in federal courts. The list looks
like this:

 1. Suits between states. Cases in which two or more states
      are a party.

 2. Cases involving ambassadors and other high-ranking
      public figures. Cases arising between foreign ambassadors
      and other high-ranking public officials.

 3. Federal crimes. Crimes defined by or mentioned in the
      US Constitution or those defined or punished by federal
      statute. Such crimes include treason against the United
      States, piracy, counterfeiting, crimes against the law of
      nations, and crimes relating to the federal government's
                                    COURTS AND THE LEGAL PROCESS | 97

      authority to regulate interstate commerce. However,
      most crimes are state matters.
 4. Bankruptcy. The statutory procedure, usually triggered
      by insolvency, by which a person is relieved of most
      debts and undergoes a judicially supervised
      reorganization or liquidation for the benefit of the
      person's creditors.
 5. Admiralty. The system of laws that has grown out of the
      practice of admiralty courts: courts that exercise
      jurisdiction over all maritime contracts, torts, injuries,
      and offenses.
 6. Antitrust. Federal laws designed to protect trade and
      commerce from restraining monopolies, price fixing,
      and price discrimination.
 7. Other cases specified by federal statute. Any other cases
      specified by a federal statute where Congress declares
      that federal courts will have exclusive jurisdiction.

3.2.3 Concurrent Jurisdiction

When a plaintiff takes a case to state court, it will be because
state courts typically hear that kind of case (i.e., there is subject
matter jurisdiction). If the plaintiff's main cause of action
comes from a certain state's constitution, statutes, or court
decisions, the state courts have subject matter jurisdiction over
the case. If the plaintiff's main cause of action is based on
federal law (e.g., Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964),
     98 | COURTS AND THE LEGAL PROCESS

   the federal courts have subject matter jurisdiction over the case.
   But federal courts will also have subject matter jurisdiction
   over certain cases that have only a state-based cause of action;
   those cases are ones in which the plaintiff(s) and the
   defendant(s) are from different states and the amount in
   controversy is more than $75,000. State courts can have subject
   matter jurisdiction over certain cases that have only a federal-
   based cause of action. The Supreme Court has now made clear
   that state courts have concurrent jurisdiction13 of any federal
   cause of action unless Congress has given exclusive jurisdiction
   to federal courts.

      In short, a case with a federal question can be often be heard
   in either state or federal court, and a case that has parties with a
   diversity of citizenship can be heard in state courts or in federal
   courts where the tests of complete diversity and amount in
   controversy are met.

      Whether a case will be heard in a state court or moved to
   a federal court will depend on the parties. If a plaintiff files a
   case in state trial court where concurrent jurisdiction applies,
   a defendant may (or may not) ask that the case be removed to
   federal district court.

13. When both state and federal courts have subject matter jurisdiction
    of a case, there is concurrent jurisdiction. Only one court will hear
    the case between the parties and will hear all causes of action,
    whether based on state or federal law.
                                    COURTS AND THE LEGAL PROCESS | 99

                                         To better understand
                                      subject matter jurisdiction
                                      in action, let's take an
                                      example. Wile E. Coyote
                                      wants a federal judge to hear
                                      his products-liability action
                                      against Acme, Inc., even
though the action is based on state law. Mr. Coyote's attorney
wants to "make a federal case" out of it, thinking that the
jurors in the federal district court's jury pool will understand
the case better and be more likely to deliver a "high value"
verdict for Mr. Coyote. Mr. Coyote resides in Arizona, and
Acme is incorporated in the state of Delaware and has its
principal place of business in Chicago, Illinois. The federal
court in Arizona can hear and decide Mr. Coyote's case (i.e., it
has subject matter jurisdiction over the case) because of
diversity of citizenship. If Mr. Coyote was injured by one of
Acme's defective products while chasing a roadrunner in
Arizona, the federal district court judge would hear his
action--using federal procedural law--and decide the case
based on the substantive law of Arizona on product liability.
   But now change the facts only slightly: Acme is
incorporated in Delaware but has its principal place of
business in Phoenix, Arizona. Unless Mr. Coyote has a federal
law he is using as a basis for his claims against Acme, his
attempt to get a federal court to hear and decide the case will
100 | COURTS AND THE LEGAL PROCESS

fail. It will fail because there is not complete diversity of
citizenship between the plaintiff and the defendant.

       Robinson v. Audi

       Now consider Mr. and Mrs. Robinson and their
       products-liability claim against Seaway
       Volkswagen and the other three defendants.
       There is no federal products-liability law that
       could be used as a cause of action. They are
       most likely suing the defendants using products-
       liability law based on common-law negligence or
       common-law strict liability law, as found in state
       court cases. They were not yet Arizona residents
       at the time of the accident, and their accident
       does not establish them as Oklahoma residents,
       either. They bought the vehicle in New York from
       a New York-based retailer. None of the other
       defendants is from Oklahoma.

       They file in an Oklahoma state court, but how
       will they (their attorney or the court) know if the
       state court has subject matter jurisdiction?
       Unless the case is required to be in a federal
       court (i.e., unless the federal courts have
       exclusive jurisdiction over this kind of case), any
                          COURTS AND THE LEGAL PROCESS | 101

state court system will have subject matter
jurisdiction, including Oklahoma's state court
system. But if their claim is for a significant
amount of money, they cannot file in small
claims court, probate court, or any court in
Oklahoma that does not have statutory
jurisdiction over their claim. They will need to file
in a court of general jurisdiction. In short, even
filing in the right court system (state versus
federal), the plaintiff must be careful to find the
court that has subject matter jurisdiction.

If they wish to go to federal court, can they?
There is no federal question presented here (the
claim is based on state common law), and the
United States is not a party, so the only basis for
federal court jurisdiction would be diversity
jurisdiction. If enough time has elapsed since the
accident and they have established themselves
as Arizona residents, they could sue in federal
court in Oklahoma (or elsewhere), but only if
none of the defendants--the retailer, the
regional Volkswagen company, Volkswagen of
North America, or Audi (in Germany) are
incorporated in or have a principal place of
business in Arizona. The federal judge would
102 | COURTS AND THE LEGAL PROCESS

       decide the case using federal civil procedure but
       would have to make the appropriate choice of
       state law. In this case, the choice of conflicting
       laws would most likely be Oklahoma, where the
       accident happened, or New York, where the
       defective product was sold.

3.2.4 How a Case Proceeds

3.2.4.1 Complaint and Summons Beginning a lawsuit is
simple and is spelled out in the rules of procedure by which
each court system operates. In the federal system, the plaintiff
begins a lawsuit by filing a complaint--a document clearly
explaining the grounds for suit--with the clerk of the court.
An agent of the court, such as a sheriff or process server, will
then serve the defendant with the complaint and a summons.
If the defendant is out of state, it might be possible to serve
process through the mail. The summons is a court document
stating the name of the plaintiff and his attorney and directing
the defendant to respond to the complaint within a fixed time
period.

   The timing of the filing can be important. Almost every
possible legal complaint is governed by a federal or state statute
of limitations, which requires a lawsuit to be filed within a
                                   COURTS AND THE LEGAL PROCESS | 103

certain period of time. For example, in many states a lawsuit
for injuries resulting from an automobile accident must be
filed within two years of the accident or the plaintiff forfeits
his right to proceed. As noted earlier, making a correct initial
filing in a court that has subject matter jurisdiction is critical to
avoiding statute of limitations problems.

   3.2.4.2 Jurisdiction and Venue The place of filing is
equally important, and there are two issues regarding location.
The first is subject matter jurisdiction, as already noted. A
claim for breach of contract, in which the amount at stake is
$1 million, cannot be brought in a local county court with
jurisdiction to hear cases involving sums of up to only $1,000.
Likewise, a claim for copyright violation cannot be brought
in a state superior court, since federal courts have exclusive
jurisdiction over copyright cases.

   The second consideration is venue--the proper geographic
location of the court. For example, every county in a state
might have a superior court, but the plaintiff is not free to pick
any county. Again, a statute will spell out to which court the
plaintiff must go (e.g., the county in which the plaintiff resides
or the county in which the defendant resides or maintains an
office).

   3.2.4.3 Service of Process and Personal Jurisdiction
The defendant must be "served"--that is, must receive notice
that he has been sued. Service can be done by physically
presenting the defendant with a copy of the summons and
complaint. But sometimes the defendant is difficult to find
104 | COURTS AND THE LEGAL PROCESS

(or deliberately avoids the marshal or other process server).
The rules spell out a variety of ways by which individuals and
corporations can be served. These include using US Postal
Service certified mail or serving someone already designated
to receive service of process. A corporation or partnership, for
example, is often required by state law to designate a
"registered agent" for purposes of getting public notices or
receiving a summons and complaint.

   Again, recall that even if a court has subject matter
jurisdiction, it must also have personal jurisdiction over each
defendant against whom an enforceable judgment can be
made. Often this is not a problem; you might be suing a person
who lives in your state or regularly does business in your state.
Or a nonresident may answer your complaint without
objecting to the court's "in personam" (personal) jurisdiction.
But many defendants who do not reside in the state where the
lawsuit is filed would rather not be put to the inconvenience
of contesting a lawsuit in a distant forum. Fairness--and the
due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment--dictates
that nonresidents should not be required to defend lawsuits
far from their home base, especially where there is little or no
contact or connection between the nonresident and the state
where a lawsuit is brought.
                                   COURTS AND THE LEGAL PROCESS | 105

                                      Again, let's consider Mrs.
                                      Robinson and her children
                                      in the Audi accident. She
                                      could file a lawsuit anywhere
                                      in the country. She could file
                                      a lawsuit in Arizona after she
                                      establishes residency there.
                                      But while the Arizona court
                                      would have subject matter
                                      jurisdiction over any
                                      products-liability claim (or
                                      any claim that was not
                                      required to be heard in a
federal court), the Arizona court would face an issue of "in
personam jurisdiction," or personal jurisdiction: under the
due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, each state
must extend due process to citizens of all of the other states.
Because fairness is essential to due process, the court must
consider whether it is fair to require an out-of-state defendant
to appear and defend against a lawsuit that could result in a
judgment against that defendant.
   Almost every state in the United States has a statute
regarding personal jurisdiction, instructing judges when it is
permissible to assert personal jurisdiction over an out-of-state
resident. These are called long-arm statutes. But no state can
reach out beyond the limits of what is constitutionally
permissible under the Fourteenth Amendment, which binds
     106 | COURTS AND THE LEGAL PROCESS

   the states with its proviso to guarantee the due process rights
   of the citizens of every state in the union. In the 2010s, the
   Supreme Court established the current rules for personal
   jurisdiction under the Fourteenth Amendment. In a series of
   cases, the Court found that due process requires that personal
   jurisdiction arise in one of two ways: specific jurisdiction exists
   when the defendant's conduct in the forum state gave rise to
   the case, and general jurisdiction exists where the defendant is
   incorporated or essentially "at home."14 This generally limits
   the states in which one can sue a defendant to the home of
   the defendant or the state in which the defendant's conduct
   created the facts of the case. Corporations are typically
   regarded as home in their state of incorporation, or the state in
   which the company maintains its headquarters.

  3.2.5 Choice of Law and Choice of
  Forum Clauses

   In a series of cases, the Supreme Court has made clear that it
   will honor contractual choices of parties in a lawsuit. Suppose
   the parties to a contract wind up in court arguing over the
   application of the contract's terms. If the parties are from two

14. Walden v. Fiore, 134 S. Ct. 1115 (2014) and Daimler AG v.
    Bauman, 571 U.S. 20 (2014).
                                   COURTS AND THE LEGAL PROCESS | 107

different states, the judge may have difficulty determining
which law to apply.

   But if the contract says that a particular state's law will be
applied if there is a dispute, then ordinarily the judge will apply
that state's law as a rule of decision in the case. For example,
Kumar Patel (a Missouri resident) opens a brokerage account
with Goldman, Sachs and Co., and the contractual agreement
calls for "any disputes arising under this agreement" to be
determined "according to the laws of the state of New York."
When Kumar claims in a Missouri court that his broker is
"churning" his account, and, on the other hand, Goldman,
Sachs claims that Kumar has failed to meet his margin call and
owes $38,568.25 (plus interest and attorney's fees), the judge
in Missouri will apply New York law based on the contract
between Kumar and Goldman, Sachs.

   Ordinarily, a choice-of-law clause will be accompanied by
a choice-of-forum clause. In a choice- of-forum clause, the
parties in the contract specify which court they will go to in
the event of a dispute arising under the terms of contract.
For example, Harold (a resident of Virginia) rents a car from
Alamo at the Denver International Airport. He does not look
at the fine print on the contract. He also waives all collision
and other insurance that Alamo offers at the time of his rental.
While driving back from Telluride Bluegrass Festival, he has
an accident in Idaho Springs, Colorado. His rented Nissan
Altima is badly damaged. On returning to Virginia, he would
like to settle up with Alamo, but his insurance company and
108 | COURTS AND THE LEGAL PROCESS

Alamo cannot come to terms. He realizes, however, that he has
agreed to hear the dispute with Alamo in a specific court in
San Antonio, Texas. In the absence of fraud or bad faith, any
court in the United States is likely to uphold the choice-of-
form clause and require Harold (or his insurance company) to
litigate in San Antonio, Texas.

     Key Takeaway

     There are two court systems in the United States. It
     is important to know which system--the state court
     system or the federal court system--has the power
     to hear and decide a particular case. Once that is
     established, the Constitution compels an inquiry to
     make sure that no court extends its reach unfairly to
     out-of-state residents. The question of personal
     jurisdiction is a question of fairness and due process
     to nonresidents.

  3.3 Motions and Discovery

         Learning Objectives

         After reading this section, you should be able to do
         the following:

             1. Explain how a lawsuit can be dismissed prior
                 to any trial.

             2. Understand the basic principles and practices
                 of discovery before a trial.

   The early phases of a civil action are characterized by many
   different kinds of motions and a complex process of mutual
   fact-finding between the parties that is known as discovery. A
   lawsuit will start with the pleadings15 (complaint and answer in
   every case, and in some cases a counterclaim by the defendant
   against the plaintiff and the plaintiff's reply to the defendant's
   counterclaim). After the pleadings, the parties may make

15. The initial documents filed by parties in a lawsuit.
     110 | COURTS AND THE LEGAL PROCESS

   various motions16, which are requests to the judge. Motions in
   the early stages of a lawsuit usually aim to dismiss the lawsuit,
   to have it moved to another venue, or to compel the other
   party to act in certain ways during the discovery process.

  3.3.1 Initial Pleadings, and Motions to
  Dismiss

   The first papers filed in a lawsuit are called the pleadings. These
   include the plaintiff's complaint and then (usually after thirty
   or more days) the answer or response from the defendant.
   The answer may be coupled with a counterclaim against the
   plaintiff. (In effect, the defendant becomes the plaintiff for the
   claims she has against the original plaintiff.) The plaintiff may
   reply to any counterclaim by the defendant.

      State and federal rules of civil procedure require that the
   complaint must state the nature of the plaintiff's claim, the
   jurisdiction of the court, and the nature of the relief that is
   being asked for (usually an award of money, but sometimes an
   injunction, or a declaration of legal rights). In an answer, the

    to dismiss, motions for summary judgment, motions to direct an
    opposing party to divulge more in discovery, motions for a directed
    verdict, motions for judgment n.o.v., and many others.
                                         COURTS AND THE LEGAL PROCESS | 111

   defendant will often deny all the allegations of the complaint
   or will admit to certain of its allegations and deny others.

      A complaint and subsequent pleadings are usually quite
   general and give little detail. Cases can be decided on the
   pleadings alone in the following situations: (1) If the defendant
   fails to answer the complaint, the court can enter a default
   judgment, awarding the plaintiff what he seeks. (2) The
   defendant can move to dismiss the complaint on the grounds
   that the plaintiff failed to "state a claim on which relief can
   be granted," or on the basis that there is no subject matter
   jurisdiction for the court chosen by the plaintiff, or on the
   basis that there is no personal jurisdiction over the defendant.
   The defendant is saying, in effect, that even if all the plaintiff's
   allegations are true, they do not amount to a legal claim that
   can be heard by the court. For example, a claim that the
   defendant induced a woman to stop dating the plaintiff (a
   so-called alienation of affections cause of action) is no longer
   actionable in US state courts, and any court will dismiss the
   complaint without any further proceedings. (This type of
   dismissal is occasionally still called a demurrer.)

      A third kind of dismissal can take place on a motion for
   summary judgment.17 If there is no triable question of fact

17. As in a directed verdict, when a judge grants summary judgment, she
    has concluded that there are no matters of law or fact on which
112 | COURTS AND THE LEGAL PROCESS

or law, there is no reason to have a trial. For example, the
plaintiff sues on a promissory note and, at deposition (an oral
examination under oath), the defendant admits having made
no payment on the note and offers no excuse that would be
recognizable as a reason not to pay. There is no reason to have
a trial, and the court should grant summary judgment.

3.3.2 Discovery

If there is a factual dispute, the case will usually involve some
degree of discovery, where each party tries to get as much
information out of the other party as the rules allow. Until the
1940s, when discovery became part of civil procedure rules, a
lawsuit was frequently a game in which each party hid as much
information as possible and tried to surprise the other party in
court.

   Beginning with a change in the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure adopted by the Supreme Court in 1938 and
subsequently followed by many of the states, the parties are
entitled to learn the facts of the case before trial. The basic idea
is to help the parties determine what the evidence might be,
who the potential witnesses are, and what specific issues are
relevant. Discovery can proceed by several methods. A party

reasonable people would disagree. Summary judgment is a final
order, and it is appealable.
          COURTS AND THE LEGAL PROCESS | 113

may serve an interrogatory on his adversary--a written request

for answers to specific questions. Or a party may depose the

other party or a witness. A deposition is a live question-and-

answer session at which the witness answers questions put to

him by one of the parties' lawyers. His answers are recorded

verbatim and may be used at trial. Each party is also entitled

to inspect books, documents, records, and other physical items

in the possession of the other. This is a broad right, as it is

not limited to just evidence that is admissible at trial. Discovery

of physical evidence means that a plaintiff may inspect a

company's accounts, customer lists, assets, profit-and-loss

statements, balance sheets, engineering and quality-control

reports, sales reports, and virtually any other document.

The lawyers, not the

court, run the discovery

process. For example, one

party simply makes a written

demand, stating the time at

which the deposition will

take place or the type of

documents it wishes to

inspect and make copies of.

A party unreasonably

resisting discovery methods

(whether  depositions,

written interrogatories, or

requests for documents) can be challenged, however, and
114 | COURTS AND THE LEGAL PROCESS

judges are often brought into the process to push reluctant
parties to make more disclosure or to protect a party from
irrelevant or unreasonable discovery requests. For example, the
party receiving the discovery request can apply to the court
for a protective order if it can show that the demand is for
privileged material (e.g., a party's lawyers' records are not open
for inspection) or that the demand was made to harass the
opponent. In complex cases between companies, the discovery
of documents can run into tens of millions of pages and can
take years. Depositions can consume days or even weeks of an
executive's time.

     Key Takeaway

     Many cases never get to trial. They are disposed of
     by motions to dismiss or are settled
     after extensive discovery makes clear to the parties
     the strengths and weaknesses of the
     parties to the dispute.

3.4 The Pretrial and Trial Phase

     Learning Objectives

     After reading this section, you should be able to do
     the following:

         1. Understand how judges can push parties into
             pretrial settlement.

         2. Explain the meaning and use of directed
             verdicts.

         3. Distinguish a directed verdict from a judgment
             n.o.v. ("notwithstanding the verdict").

After considerable discovery, one of the parties may believe
that there is no triable issue of law or fact for the court to
consider and may file a motion with the court for summary
judgment. Unless it is very clear, the judge will deny a summary
judgment motion, because that ends the case at the trial level;
it is a "final order" in the case that tells the plaintiff "no" and
leaves no room to bring another lawsuit against the defendant
for that particular set of facts (res judicata). If the plaintiff
116 | COURTS AND THE LEGAL PROCESS

successfully appeals a summary judgment motion, the case will
come back to the trial court.

   Prior to the trial, the judge may also convene the parties in
an effort to investigate the possibilities of settlement. Usually,
the judge will explore the strengths and weaknesses of each
party's case with the attorneys. The parties may decide that it
is more prudent or efficient to settle than to risk going to trial.

3.4.1 Pretrial Conference

At various times during the discovery process, depending on
the nature and complexity of the case, the court may hold
a pretrial conference to clarify the issues and establish a
timetable. The court may also hold a settlement conference to
see if the parties can work out their differences and avoid trial
altogether. Once discovery is complete, the case moves on to
trial if it has not been settled. Most cases are settled before this
stage; more than 90 percent of all civil cases end before trial,
and more than 90 percent of criminal prosecutions end with a
guilty plea.

3.4.2 Trial

At trial, the first order of business is to select a jury. (In a
federal civil case claiming over $20 in damages, either party
can request one, based on the Seventh Amendment to the
US Constitution.) The judge and sometimes the lawyers are
                                    COURTS AND THE LEGAL PROCESS | 117

permitted to question the jurors to be sure that they are
unbiased. This questioning is known as the voir dire
(pronounced vwahr-DEER). This is an important process,
and a great deal of thought goes into selecting the jury,
especially in high-profile cases. A jury panel can be as few as
six persons, or as many as twelve, with alternates selected and
sitting in court in case one of the jurors is unable to continue.
In a long trial, having alternates is essential; even in shorter
trials, most courts will have at least two alternate jurors.

In both criminal and civil trials, each side has opportunities
to challenge potential jurors for cause. For example, in the
Robinsons' case against Audi, the attorneys representing Audi
will want to know if any prospective jurors have ever owned an
Audi, what their experience has been, and if they had a similar
problem (or worse) with their Audi that was not resolved to
their satisfaction. If so, the defense attorney could well believe
that such a juror has a potential for a bias against her client. In
that case, she could use a challenge for cause, explaining to the
judge the basis for her challenge. The judge, at her discretion,
could either accept the for-cause reason or reject it.
118 | COURTS AND THE LEGAL PROCESS

                                 Even if an attorney

                                 cannot articulate a for-cause

                                 reason acceptable to the

                                 judge, he may use one of

                                 several            peremptory

                                 challenges that most states

                                 (and the federal system)

                                 allow. A trial attorney with

                                 many years of experience

                                 may have a sixth sense about

                                 a potential juror and, in

                                 consultation with the client,

may decide to use a peremptory challenge to avoid having that

juror on the panel.

After the jury is sworn and seated, the plaintiff's lawyer

makes an opening statement, laying out the nature of the

plaintiff's claim, the facts of the case as the plaintiff sees them,

and the evidence that the lawyer will present. The defendant's

lawyer may also make an opening statement or may reserve his

right to do so at the end of the plaintiff's case.

The plaintiff's lawyer then calls witnesses and presents the

physical evidence that is relevant to her proof. The direct

testimony at trial is usually far from a smooth narration. The

rules of evidence (that govern the kinds of testimony and

documents that may be introduced at trial) and the question-

and-answer format tend to make the presentation of evidence

choppy and difficult to follow.
                                    COURTS AND THE LEGAL PROCESS | 119

   Anyone who has watched an actual televised trial or a
television melodrama featuring a trial scene will appreciate the
nature of the trial itself: witnesses are asked questions about a
number of issues that may or may not be related, the opposing
lawyer will frequently object to the question or the form in
which it is asked, and the jury may be sent from the room while
the lawyers argue at the bench before the judge.

   After direct testimony of each witness is over, the opposing
lawyer may conduct cross-examination. This is a crucial
constitutional right; in criminal cases it is preserved in the
Constitution's Sixth Amendment (the right to confront one's
accusers in open court). The formal rules of direct testimony
are then relaxed, and the cross-examiner may probe the witness
more informally, asking questions that may not seem
immediately relevant. This is when the opposing attorney may
become harsh, casting doubt on a witness's credibility, trying
to trip her up and show that the answers she gave are false or
not to be trusted. This use of cross-examination, along with
the requirement that the witness must respond to questions
that are at all relevant to the questions raised by the case,
distinguishes common-law courts from those of authoritarian
regimes around the world.

Following cross-examination, the plaintiff's lawyer may then
question the witness again: this is called redirect examination
and is used to demonstrate that the witness's original answers
were accurate and to show that any implications otherwise,
120 | COURTS AND THE LEGAL PROCESS

suggested by the cross-examiner, were unwarranted. The cross-
examiner may then engage the witness in re-cross-examination,
and so on. The process usually stops after cross-examination or
redirect.

        The judge acts as the trial's "referee".

During the trial, the judge's chief responsibility is to see that
the trial is fair to both sides. One big piece of that
responsibility is to rule on the admissibility of evidence. A
judge may rule that a particular question is out of order--that
is, not relevant or appropriate--or that a given document is
irrelevant. Where the attorney is convinced that a particular
witness, a particular question, or a particular document (or
part thereof) is critical to her case, she may preserve an
objection to the court's ruling by saying "exception," in which
case the court stenographer will note the exception; on appeal,
the attorney may cite any number of exceptions as adding up
                                         COURTS AND THE LEGAL PROCESS | 121

   to the lack of a fair trial for her client and may request a court
   of appeals to order a retrial.

      For the most part, courts of appeal will not reverse and
   remand for a new trial unless the trial court judge's errors are
   "prejudicial," or "an abuse of discretion." In short, neither
   party is entitled to a perfect trial, but only to a fair trial, one in
   which the trial judge has made only "harmless errors" and not
   prejudicial ones.

      At the end of the plaintiff's case, the defendant presents his
   case, following the same procedure just outlined. The plaintiff
   is then entitled to present rebuttal witnesses, if necessary, to
   deny or argue with the evidence the defendant has introduced.
   The defendant in turn may present "surrebuttal" witnesses.

   When all testimony has been introduced, either party may ask
   the judge for a directed verdict18--a verdict decided by the
   judge without advice from the jury. This motion may be
   granted if the plaintiff has failed to introduce evidence that
   is legally sufficient to meet her burden of proof or if the
   defendant has failed to do the same on issues on which she
   has the burden of proof. (For example, the plaintiff alleges

18. At the close of one party's evidence, the other party may move for a
    directed verdict, or renew that motion at the close of all parties'
    evidence. A judge will direct a verdict if there is no real issue of fact
    for reasonable jurors to consider and if the law as applied to the facts
    in evidence clearly favors the party who requests the directed verdict.
122 | COURTS AND THE LEGAL PROCESS

that the defendant owes him money and introduces a signed
promissory note. The defendant cannot show that the note is
invalid. The defendant must lose the case unless he can show
that the debt has been paid or otherwise discharged.)

   The defendant can move for a directed verdict at the close of
the plaintiff's case, but the judge will usually wait to hear the
entire case until deciding whether to do so. Directed verdicts
are not usually granted, since it is the jury's job to determine
the facts in dispute.

   If the judge refuses to grant a directed verdict, each lawyer
will then present a closing argument to the jury (or, if there
is no jury, to the judge alone). The closing argument is used
to tie up the loose ends, as the attorney tries to bring together
various seemingly unrelated facts into a story that will make
sense to the jury.

   After closing arguments, the judge will instruct the jury.
The purpose of jury instruction is to explain to the jurors
the meaning of the law as it relates to the issues they are
considering and to tell the jurors what facts they must
determine if they are to give a verdict for one party or the other.
Each lawyer will have prepared a set of written instructions
that she hopes the judge will give to the jury. These will be
tailored to advance her client's case. Many verdicts have been
overturned on appeal because a trial judge wrongly instructed
the jury. The judge will carefully determine which instructions
to give and often will use a set of pattern instructions provided
by the state bar association or the supreme court of the state.
                                        COURTS AND THE LEGAL PROCESS | 123

   These pattern jury instructions are often safer because they
   are patterned after language that appellate courts have used
   previously, and appellate courts are less likely to find reversible
   error in the instructions.

      After all instructions are given, the jury will retire to a
   private room and discuss the case and the answers requested by
   the judge for as long as it takes to reach a unanimous verdict.
   Some minor cases do not require a unanimous verdict. If the
   jury cannot reach a decision, this is called a hung jury, and the
   case will have to be retried. When a jury does reach a verdict, it
   delivers it in court with both parties and their lawyers present.
   The jury is then discharged, and control over the case returns
   to the judge. (If there is no jury, the judge will usually
   announce in a written opinion his findings of fact and how the
   law applies to those facts. Juries just announce their verdicts
   and do not state their reasons for reaching them.)

  3.4.3 Post-Trial Motions

   The losing party is allowed to ask the judge for a new trial
   or for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict (often called a
   judgment n.o.v.19, from the Latin non obstante veredicto). A

19. Judgment "notwithstanding the verdict" may be awarded after the
    jury returns a verdict that the judge believes no rational jury could
124 | COURTS AND THE LEGAL PROCESS

judge who decides that a directed verdict is appropriate will
usually wait to see what the jury's verdict is. If it is favorable
to the party the judge thinks should win, she can rely on that
verdict. If the verdict is for the other party, he can grant the
motion for judgment n.o.v. This is a safer way to proceed
because if the judge is reversed on appeal, a new trial is not
necessary. The jury's verdict always can be restored, whereas
without a jury verdict (as happens when a directed verdict is
granted before the case goes to the jury), the entire case must be
presented to a new jury. Ferlito v. Johnson & Johnson (Section
3.9 "Cases") illustrates the judgment n.o.v. process in a case
where the judge allowed the case to go to a jury that was overly
sympathetic to the plaintiffs.

     Key Takeaway

     The purpose of a trial judge is to ensure justice to all
     parties to the lawsuit. The judge presides, instructs
     the jury, and may limit who testifies and what they

have come to. Judgment n.o.v. reverses the verdict and awards
judgment to the party against whom the jury's verdict was made.
                                   COURTS AND THE LEGAL PROCESS | 125

     testify about what. In all of this, the judge will
     usually commit some errors; occasionally these will
     be the kinds of errors that seriously compromise a
     fair trial for both parties. Errors that do seriously
     compromise a fair trial for both parties are
     prejudicial, as opposed to harmless. The appeals
     court must decide whether any errors of the trial
     court judge are prejudicial or not.
     If a judge directs a verdict, that ends the case for the
     party who hasn't asked for one; if a judge grants
     judgment n.o.v., that will take away a jury verdict
     that one side has worked very hard to get. Thus a
     judge must be careful not to unduly favor one side
     or the other, regardless of his or her sympathies.

3.5 Judgment, Appeal, and
Execution

     Learning Objectives
126 | COURTS AND THE LEGAL PROCESS

     After reading this section, you should be able to do
     the following:

         1. Understand the posttrial process--how
             appellate courts process appeals.

         2. Explain how a court's judgment is translated
             into relief for the winning party.

3.5.1 Judgment or Order

At the end of a trial, the judge will enter an order that makes
findings of fact (often with the help of a jury) and conclusions
of law. The judge will also make a judgment as to what relief
or remedy should be given. Often it is an award of money
damages to one of the parties. The losing party may ask for
a new trial at this point or within a short period of time
following. Once the trial judge denies any such request, the
judgment--in the form of the court's order--is final.

3.5.2 Appeal

If the loser's motion for a new trial or a judgment n.o.v. is
denied, the losing party may appeal but must ordinarily post
a bond sufficient to ensure that there are funds to pay the
                                   COURTS AND THE LEGAL PROCESS | 127

amount awarded to the winning party. In an appeal, the
appellant aims to show that there was some prejudicial error
committed by the trial judge. There will be errors, of course,
but the errors must be significant (i.e., not harmless). The basic
idea is for an appellate court to ensure that a reasonably fair
trial was provided to both sides. Enforcement of the court's
judgment--an award of money, an injunction--is usually
stayed (postponed) until the appellate court has ruled. As
noted earlier, the party making the appeal is called the
appellant, and the party defending the judgment is the appellee
(or in some courts, the petitioner and the respondent).

   During the trial, the losing party may have objected to
certain procedural decisions by the judge. In compiling a
record on appeal, the appellant needs to show the appellate
court some examples of mistakes made by the judge--for
example, having erroneously admitted evidence, having failed
to admit proper evidence that should have been admitted, or
having wrongly instructed the jury. The appellate court must
determine if those mistakes were serious enough to amount to
prejudicial error.

   Appellate and trial procedures are different. The appellate
court does not hear witnesses or accept evidence. It reviews the
record of the case--the transcript of the witnesses' testimony
and the documents received into evidence at trial--to try to
find a legal error on a specific request of one or both of the
parties. The parties' lawyers prepare briefs (written statements
containing the facts in the case), the procedural steps taken,
128 | COURTS AND THE LEGAL PROCESS

and the argument or discussion of the meaning of the law
and how it applies to the facts. After reading the briefs on
appeal, the appellate court may dispose of the appeal without
argument, issuing a written opinion that may be very short
or many pages. Often, though, the appellate court will hear
oral argument. (This can be months, or even more than a year
after the briefs are filed.) Each lawyer is given a short period
of time, usually no more than thirty minutes, to present his
client's case. The lawyer rarely gets a chance for an extended
statement because he is usually interrupted by questions from
the judges. Through this exchange between judges and lawyers,
specific legal positions can be tested and their limits explored.

Depending on what it decides, the appellate court will affirm
the lower court's judgment, modify it, reverse it, or remand it
to the lower court for retrial or other action directed by the
higher court. The appellate court itself does not take specific
action in the case; it sits only to rule on contested issues of law.
The lower court must issue the final judgment in the case. As
we have already seen, there is the possibility of appealing from
an intermediate appellate court to the state supreme court in
twenty-nine states and to the US Supreme Court from a ruling
from a federal circuit court of appeal. In cases raising
constitutional issues, there is also the possibility of appeal to
the Supreme Court from the state courts.
                                   COURTS AND THE LEGAL PROCESS | 129

   Like trial judges, appellate
judges must follow previous
decisions, or precedent. But
not every previous case is a
precedent for every court.
Lower courts must respect
appellate court decisions,
and courts in one state are
not bound by decisions of
courts in other states. State
courts are not bound by
decisions of federal courts, except on points of federal law that
come from federal courts within the state or from a federal
circuit in which the state court sits. A state supreme court is
not bound by case law in any other state. But a supreme court
in one state with a type of case it has not previously dealt with
may find persuasive reasoning in decisions of other state
supreme courts.

   Federal district courts are bound by the decisions of the
court of appeals in their circuit, but decisions by one circuit
court are not precedents for courts in other circuits. Federal
courts are also bound by decisions of the state supreme courts
within their geographic territory in diversity jurisdiction cases.
All courts are bound by decisions of the US Supreme Court,
except the Supreme Court itself, which seldom reverses itself
but on occasion has overturned its own precedents.

   Not everything a court says in an opinion is a precedent.
130 | COURTS AND THE LEGAL PROCESS

Strictly speaking, only the exact holding is binding on the
lower courts. A holding is the theory of the law that applies
to the particular circumstances presented in a case. The courts
may sometimes declare what they believe to be the law with
regard to points that are not central to the case being decided.
These declarations are called dicta (the singular, dictum), and
the lower courts do not have to give them the same weight as
holdings.

3.5.3 Judgment and Order

When a party has no more possible appeals, it usually pays
up voluntarily. If not voluntarily, then the losing party's assets
can be seized or its wages or other income garnished to satisfy
the judgment. If the final judgment is an injunction, failure to
follow its dictates can lead to a contempt citation, with a fine
or jail time imposed.

     Key Takeaway

     The process of conducting a civil trial has many
     aspects, starting with pleadings and continuing with
     motions, discovery, more motions, pretrial
                                    COURTS AND THE LEGAL PROCESS | 131

     conferences, and finally the trial itself. At all stages,
     the rules of civil procedure attempt to give both
     sides plenty of notice, opportunity to be heard,
     discovery of relevant information, cross-
     examination, and the preservation of procedural
     objections for purposes of appeal. All of these rules
     and procedures are intended to provide each side
     with a fair trial.

3.6 When Can Someone Bring a
Lawsuit?

     Learning Objectives

     After reading this section, you should be able to do
     the following:

         1. Explain the requirements for standing to bring
             a lawsuit in US courts.
132 | COURTS AND THE LEGAL PROCESS

         2. Describe the process by which a group or
             class of plaintiffs can be certified to file a class
             action case.

3.6.1 Case or Controversy: Standing
to Sue

Article III of the US Constitution provides limits to federal
judicial power. For some cases, the Supreme Court has decided
that it has no power to adjudicate because there is no "case or
controversy." For example, perhaps the case has settled or the
"real parties in interest" are not before the court. In such a case,
a court might dismiss the case on the grounds that the plaintiff
does not have "standing" to sue.

       The "Case or Controversy" Clause in Article III,
       Section 2 of the Constitution
       The judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in
       Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution,
       the Laws of the United States, and Treaties
                                   COURTS AND THE LEGAL PROCESS | 133

       made, or which shall be made, under their
       Authority;-to all Cases affecting Ambassadors,
       other public ministers and Consuls;-to all Cases
       of admiralty and maritime Jurisdiction;-to
       Controversies to which the United States shall
       be a Party;-to Controversies between two or
       more States;-between a State and Citizens of
       another State;-between Citizens of different
       States;-between Citizens of the same State
       claiming Lands under Grants of different States,
       and between a State, or the Citizens thereof, and
       foreign States, Citizens or Subjects.

For example, suppose you see a sixteen-wheel moving van drive
across your neighbor's flower bed, destroying her beloved
roses. You have enjoyed seeing her roses every summer, for
years. She is forlorn and tells you that she is not going to raise
roses there anymore. She also tells you that she has decided
not to sue, because she has made the decision to never deal
with lawyers if at all possible. Incensed, you decide to sue on
her behalf. But you will not have standing to sue because your
person or property was not directly injured by the moving
van. Standing means that only the person whose interests are
directly affected has the legal right to sue.

   The standing doctrine is easy to understand in
     134 | COURTS AND THE LEGAL PROCESS

   straightforward cases such as this but is often a fairly
   complicated matter. For example, in California v. Texas, a
   group of states and several individuals challenged the
   constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act's healthcare
   enrollment mandate. The mandate imposed a tax on
   individuals who were not enrolled in a health plan. Prior to
   the lawsuit, Congress had already reduced the tax to $0 in an
   attempt to effectively eliminate the mandate. Can anyone be
   injured by a "mandate" if the penalty for non-compliance is
   $0?

      The individual plaintiffs claimed that, even with a $0 tax
   penalty, they still enrolled in a health plan because they wanted
   to comply with the law. Their injury, therefore, was having to
   enroll in a health plan when they would not have otherwise
   done so. The Supreme Court responded: "Their problem lies
   in the fact that the statutory provision, while it tells them to
   obtain that coverage, has no means of enforcement. With the
   penalty zeroed out, the IRS can no longer seek a penalty from
   those who fail to comply. Because of this, there is no possible
   Government action that is causally connected to the plaintiffs'
   injury."20

      Because the states were not subject to the individual
   mandate, they claimed to have suffered an even more indirect
   injury: that the mandate had caused increased enrollment in

20. California v. Texas, 141 S. Ct. 2104, 2115 (2021)
                                        COURTS AND THE LEGAL PROCESS | 135

   state-run health plans, which in turn increased their
   administrative costs. "[S]etting aside that pure issue of law, we
   need only examine the initial factual premise of their claim
   to uncover another fatal weakness: The state plaintiffs have
   failed to show that the challenged minimum essential coverage
   provision [the mandate], without any prospect of penalty, will
   harm them by leading more individuals to enroll in these
   programs."21. Thus, the Court did not address the provision's
   constitutionality because none of the plaintiffs had standing to
   challenge it.

  3.6.2 Class Actions

   Most lawsuits concern a dispute between two people or
   between a person and a company or other organization. But

21. California v. Texas, 141 S. Ct. 2104, 2117 (2021)
136 | COURTS AND THE LEGAL PROCESS

it can happen that someone injures more than one person at
the same time. A driver who runs a red light may hit another
car carrying one person or many people. If several people are
injured in the same accident, they each have the right to sue the
driver for the damage that he caused them. Could they sue as a
group? Usually not, because the damages would probably not
be the same for each person, and different facts would have to
be proved at the trial. Plus, the driver of the car that was struck
might have been partially to blame, so the defendant's liability
toward him might be different from his liability toward the
passengers.

   If, however, the potential plaintiffs were all injured in the
same way and their injuries were identical, a single lawsuit
might be a far more efficient way of determining liability and
deciding financial responsibility than many individual
lawsuits.

How could such a suit be brought? All the injured parties
could hire the same lawyer, and she could present a common
case. But with a group numbering more than a handful of
people, it could become overwhelmingly complicated. So how
could, say, a million stockholders who believed they were
cheated by a corporation ever get together to sue?

   Because of these types of situations, there is a legal
procedure that permits one person or a small group of people
to serve as representatives for all others. This is the class action.
The class action is provided for in the Federal Rules of Civil
                                   COURTS AND THE LEGAL PROCESS | 137

Procedure (Rule 23) and in the separate codes of civil
procedure in the states. These rules differ among themselves
and are often complex, but in general anyone can file a class
action in an appropriate case, subject to approval of the court.
Once the class is "certified," or judged to be a legally adequate
group with common injuries, the lawyers for the named
plaintiffs become, in effect, lawyers for the entire class.

   Usually a person who doesn't want to be in the class can
decide to leave. If she does, she will not be included in an
eventual judgment or settlement. But a potential plaintiff who
is included in the class cannot, after a final judgment is
awarded, seek to relitigate the issue if she is dissatisfied with the
outcome, even though she did not participate at all in the legal
proceeding.

     Key Takeaway

     Anyone can file a lawsuit, with or without the help
     of an attorney, but only those lawsuits where a
     plaintiff has standing will be heard by the courts.
     Standing has become a complicated question and is
     used by the courts to ensure that civil cases heard
     are being pursued by those with tangible and
138 | COURTS AND THE LEGAL PROCESS

     particular injuries. Class actions are a way of
     aggregating claims that are substantially similar and
     arise out of the same facts and circumstances.

3.7 Relations with Lawyers

             charge for services.

         2. Describe the contingent fee system in the
             United States.

         3. Know the difference between the American
             rule and the British rule with regard to who
             pays attorneys' fees.
3.7.1                      COURTS AND THE LEGAL PROCESS | 139

       Legal Fees

Lawyers charge for their services in one of three different ways:
flat rate, hourly rate, and contingent fee. A flat rate is used
usually when the work is relatively routine and the lawyer
knows in advance approximately how long it will take her to
do the job. Drawing a will or doing a real estate closing are
examples of legal work that is often paid a flat rate. The rate
itself may be based on a percentage of the worth of the
matter--say, 1 percent of a home's selling price.

   Lawyers generally charge by the hour for courtroom time
and for ongoing representation in commercial matters.
Virtually every sizable law firm bills its clients by hourly rates,
which in large cities can range from $300 for an associate's time
to $500 and more for a senior partner's time.

   A contingent fee is one that is paid only if the lawyer
wins--that is, it is contingent, or depends upon, the success of
the case. This type of fee arrangement is used most often in
personal injury cases (e.g., automobile accidents, products
liability, and professional malpractice). Although used quite
often, the contingent fee is controversial. Trial lawyers justify it
by pointing to the high cost of preparing for such lawsuits. A
typical automobile accident case can cost at least ten thousand
dollars to prepare, and a complicated products-liability case
can cost tens of thousands of dollars. Few people have that
kind of money or would be willing to spend it on the chance
that they might win a lawsuit. Corporate and professional
140 | COURTS AND THE LEGAL PROCESS

                                      defendants complain that
                                      the contingent fee gives
                                      lawyers a license to go big
                                      game hunting, or to file suits
                                      against those with deep
                                      pockets in the hopes of
forcing them to settle.
   Trial lawyers respond that the contingent fee arrangement
forces them to screen cases and weed out cases that are weak,
because it is not worth their time to spend the hundreds of
hours necessary on such cases if their chances of winning are
slim or nonexistent.

3.7.2 Costs

In England and in many other countries, the losing party must
pay the legal expenses of the winning party, including
attorneys' fees. That is not the general rule in this country.
Here, each party must pay most of its own costs, including
(and especially) the fees of lawyers. (Certain relatively minor
costs, such as filing fees for various documents required in
court, are chargeable to the losing side, if the judge decides it.)
This type of fee structure is known as the American rule (in
contrast to the British rule).

There are two types of exceptions to the American rule. By
statute, Congress and the state legislatures have provided that
                                    COURTS AND THE LEGAL PROCESS | 141

the winning party in particular classes of cases may recover
its full legal costs from the loser--for example, the federal
antitrust laws so provide and so does the federal Equal Access
to Justice Act. The other exception applies to litigants who
either initiate lawsuits in bad faith, with no expectation of
winning, or who defend them in bad faith, in order to cause
the plaintiff great expense. Under these circumstances, a court
has the discretion to award attorneys' fees to the winner. But
this rule is not infinitely flexible, and courts do not have
complete freedom to award attorneys' fees in any amount, but
only "reasonable" attorney's fees.

4 Alternative Means of
Resolving Disputes

     Learning Objectives

     After reading this section, you should be able to do
     the following:

         1. Identify the different methods of alternative
             dispute resolution.

         2. Decide when ADR is more appropriate than
             litigation to resolve a dispute.

Although this book primarily focuses on trials and litigation,
                                     ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION | 143

  Alternative Dispute Resolution ("ADR") methods offer
  parties a way to settle their disputes outside the courtroom.
  The umbrella term ADR includes any method of resolving
  disputes without litigation. ADR includes a range of conflict
  resolution processes and techniques that occur outside of any
  governmental authority. This chapter will focus on three
  common ADR methods: negotiation, mediation, and
  arbitration.

 4.1 Pitfalls of Litigation

  Litigation has many drawbacks and should be treated by
  businesses as a last resort. First, litigation can be incredibly
  expensive for all parties involved. For example, during the
  Deepwater Oil Spill in 2010, over 130 million gallons of oil
  leaked into the Gulf of Mexico.1 The spill caused immense
  harm to the environment and to individuals living nearby. BP
  Oil was held responsible for the spill and ultimately agreed to
  pay over $11 billion to injured parties. The settlement included
  a payment of almost $600 million in attorneys' fees to the
  lawyers representing the injured parties. This does not include
  the amount that BP Oil spent on its own attorneys, which is
  unknown. If the parties had resolved their disputes outside of

1. https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/how-is-
  wildlife-doing-now--ten-years-after-the-deepwater-horizon
   144 | ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION

  court - which is admittedly unlikely in this case - hundreds
  of millions of additional dollars could have gone to
  environmental clean-up and injured parties instead of to
  attorneys.

     Even in smaller-scale cases, attorneys' fees regularly cost tens
  or hundreds of thousands of dollars. The chart below shows
  the median litigation costs for various types of claims.2 Based
  on the chart below, if an employee sues for $50,000 in lost
  wages, would it make more financial sense to pay the employee
  or to go to court? Are there any other important
  considerations besides the cost of attorneys?

     In addition to the high costs of litigation, cases can go on for

  2013).

years and demand large amounts of a business's time. In 2011,

for example, Apple accused Samsung of copying the iPhone.

Seven years and a trip to the Supreme Court later, the parties
finally settled the case in 2018.3 Although major companies

can afford to be tied up in litigation for years, most businesses

would prefer to spend their time and money on other matters.

Finally, the adversarial

nature of litigation can

permanently  damage

relationships between the

parties. This may not have

mattered for two

competitors like Apple and Samsung. However, what if a

distributor of bicycles had a dispute with their largest supplier

of bicycle tires? Even a well-intentioned lawsuit may anger the

supplier and ruin the relationship between the two companies.

This would leave the bicycle distributor with a short-term win

in the lawsuit but a long-term problem of where to find tires.

It is therefore crucial to consider the risks to a business

relationship before filing a lawsuit against another party who

you may work with again in the future.

  24140%20million%20it%20owed%20Apple.
146 | ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION

   ADR methods address these issues by reducing the cost,
time, and animosity in a dispute.

   4.2 Negotiation
   Negotiation is the preeminent mode of dispute resolution.
While the two most commonly discussed forms of ADR are
arbitration and mediation, negotiation is almost always
attempted first to resolve a dispute. Negotiation allows the
parties to meet in order to settle a disagreement. The main
advantage of this form of dispute settlement is that it allows
the parties themselves to control the process and the solution.
Negotiation is much less formal than other types of ADRs and
allows for a lot of flexibility.
   Most businesses and individuals will naturally rely on
negotiation as a first step in a dispute. If a warehouse fails
to deliver a shipment of products on time to a store, that
store's manager will likely try to solve the problem through
negotiation as a first step. This could be as simple as calling the
warehouse and asking why the delay occurred and whether it
will happen again. Perhaps the manager would seek a discount
on the late products or a guarantee that there would be no
more delays. This approach would save the time, money, and
animosity associated with litigation. It would also be faster and
less expensive than other forms of ADR like mediation and
arbitration.
   What if the relationship between the store and warehouse
was already strained? Maybe it had delivered a number of items
late over the past year and had not kept its promises in past
                                  ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION | 147

negotiations. Negotiations are a great first step for resolving
problems, but they rely on the ability of the two parties to
reach an agreement without outside help. When this is not
possible, the parties may want to rely on mediation or
arbitration to resolve their disputes.

   4.3 Mediation
                                         Mediation is a slightly

                                      more formal type of ADR in
                                      which the parties rely on a
                                      neutral third person to help
                                      solve their dispute. This
                                      neutral third person - called
                                      a mediator - is selected by
                                      the parties. She serves as
                                      something like a referee in
                                      the disagreement. Like
                                      athletes, the parties have full
control over how they "play the game" and its outcome. They
can freely engage in discussion (within the scope of the agreed
upon rules) and accept or reject any proposed resolutions. As
the referee, the mediator's role is only to enforce the agreed
upon rules. These may include the length of meetings and the
general items to be addressed during them. However, the
mediator has no authority to bind the parties to an agreement,
even when she thinks it is in their best interests.
   Mediation can be effective when parties are unable to resolve
their disputes through direct negotiation. During a
   148 | ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION

  contentious divorce, for example, spouses may rely on a
  mediator to help divide their assets before going straight to
  trial. They may negotiate in the presence of a mediator
  ("conference mediation") or could even sit in separate rooms
  and speak to each other only through the mediator ("shuttle
  mediation"). Reaching an agreement before going to trial
  could save the spouses thousands of dollars as well as the
  headache of going to court.

     Mediation can be advantageous in a business setting due
  to its speed and affordability. For example, a jeweler sued a
  supplier for failing to deliver approximately $57,000 worth
  of jewelry. Before trial started, both parties agreed to use a
  mediator to try to settle the disagreement. They reached an
  agreement in which the supplier would pay back $39,000 and
  would continue to sell the jeweler items at a discounted rate.
  The mediation took four hours and cost each party $560.4 If
  Apple and Samsung had resolved their dispute in this way, they
  could have saved seven years and tens of millions of dollars in
  legal fees.

     The jeweler example demonstrates a third advantage of
  mediation over litigation: more room for creativity. Judges and
  juries are constrained in the types of remedies they may award
  at the end of a trial. In contrast, parties in a mediation can

  birmingham-mediation-contract-dispute
                                 ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION | 149

reach agreements tailored to their unique needs. The result
may include monetary awards or other creative solutions like
an ongoing discount on a product. Thus, creative mediation
agreements can both repair a harm and serve other needs like
encouraging a continued business relationship.

   4.4 Arbitration

Arbitration is a type of ADR in which the parties rely on
a private decision maker (an "arbitrator") to resolve their
disputes. Although the rules of procedure are considerably
more relaxed than those that apply in the courtroom, the
proceedings are closer to a trial than other forms of ADR.

   Arbitrators might be retired judges, lawyers, or anyone with
the kind of specialized knowledge and training that would be
useful in making a final, binding decision on the dispute. In
a contractual relationship, the parties can decide even before
a dispute arises to use arbitration when the time comes. They
will typically express this preference by including
an arbitration clause in the contract. In an arbitration clause
(often part of a larger contract), the parties can spell out the
rules of procedure to be used and the method for choosing the
arbitrator. Some arbitration clauses name a specific person as
the arbitrator; others identify a neutral third-party who then
selects the arbitrator. In practice, most parties adopt the
methods and procedures recommended by the American
Arbitration Association.
   150 | ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION

          Sample Arbitration Clause5
          In the event a dispute shall arise between the
          parties to this [contract, lease, etc.], it is hereby
          agreed that the dispute shall be referred to [a
          named arbitrator or arbitration organization] for
          arbitration in accordance with [a specified set of
          arbitration rules or guidelines]. The arbitrator's
          decision shall be final and binding and judgment
          may be entered thereon. In the event a party
          fails to proceed with arbitration, unsuccessfully
          challenges the arbitrator's award, or fails to
          comply with arbitrator's award, the other party
          is entitled of costs of suit including a reasonable
          attorney's fee for having to compel arbitration or
          defend or enforce the award.

  It is also important to familiarize yourself with state law
  governing arbitration clauses. For example, Missouri law
  requires that contracts with an arbitration clause include the
  following language in ten-point, capital font directly before
  the contract's signature line: "THIS CONTRACT

5. https://usam.com/arbitration/sample-arbitration-clauses/
                                     ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION | 151

  CONTAINS A BINDING ARBITRATION PROVISION
  WHICH MAY BE ENFORCED BY THE PARTIES."6

     Many arbitrations take place under the auspices of the
  American Arbitration Association, a private organization
  headquartered in New York, with regional offices in many
  other cities. The association uses published sets of rules for
  various types of arbitration (e.g., labor arbitration or
  commercial arbitration). When a contract specifies that
  arbitration will take place though this Association, the parties
  are agreeing to be bound by the Association's rules and
  procedures. Similarly, the National Association of Securities
  Dealers provides arbitration services for disputes between
  clients and brokerage firms. International commercial
  arbitration often takes place through the auspices of the
  International Chamber of Commerce. A multilateral
  agreement known as the Convention on the Recognition and
  Enforcement of Arbitral Awards provides that agreements to
  arbitrate--and arbitral awards-- will be enforced across
  national boundaries.

     An arbitration hearing resembles a trial in many ways. Each
  party will typically begin with an opening statement and will

6. Mo. Ann. Stat.  435.460. Note that this provision only applies
  when the arbitration clause is outside the scope of the Federal
  Arbitration Act. Duggan v. Zip Mail Servs., Inc., 920 S.W.2d 200,
  203 (Mo. Ct. App. 1996).
   152 | ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION

  then present their case to the arbitrator. Like in a trial, this
  presentation may include witnesses and the introduction of
  evidence. The parties conclude with closing arguments. An
  arbitrator usually reaches her decision (the "award") 30 or
  60 days after the hearing; the parties may also request an oral
  decision immediately following the hearing if that is required
  (a "bench decision").

     Arbitration has several advantages over litigation. First, it
  is usually much quicker, because the arbitrator does not have
  a backlog of cases and because the procedures are simpler.
  Second, in complex cases, the quality of the decision may be
  higher, because the parties can select an arbitrator with
  specialized knowledge. Finally, parties can keep the record
  from arbitration private if they desire to do so. In contrast,
  most records from litigation are available to the general public.

     Due in part to these
  advantages, arbitration is
  used in a broad range of
  settings. The MLB, for
  instance, relies on a unique
  form of arbitration to settle
  salary disputes.7 Players with between three and six years of
  MLB experience are eligible for salary arbitration. Typically,
  these players are still on their rookie contract but would like to

7. https://www.mlb.com/glossary/transactions/salary-arbitration
                                     ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION | 153

  be paid more than the league's minimum salary. If the player
  and his team cannot agree on a salary by a deadline, they must
  both submit a proposed salary to a panel of arbitrators. The
  arbitrators then hear each side's arguments and choose one of
  the two proposals; they may not average the two or choose
  a third salary. What incentives might this create to avoid
  arbitration? How could it impact the proposed salary each
  party submits to the arbitrator?

     In addition to MLB salary disagreements, arbitration is
  commonly relied on to resolve disputes about labor/
  employment, intellectual property, construction, real estate,
  and international business dealings.

  Congress "declared a national policy favoring arbitration"
  when it passed the Federal Arbitration Act in 1925.8 Under
  this law, parties must use arbitration to settle their disputes if
  their agreement contains an arbitration clause. This broadly
  applies to arbitration clauses in documents like supply
  contracts, employment agreements, and personnel policies. If
  a party subject to an arbitration clause tries to sue in court,
  the other party can seek an order compelling them to go to
  arbitration. Although an arbitration clause may seem like
  boilerplate language, it is therefore crucial for businesses to
  consider both whether to include one in a contract and what

8. Southland Corp. v. Keating, 465 U.S. 1, 10 (1984).
154 | ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION

specific provisions it contains (e.g., how to choose an
arbitrator, rules of arbitration, etc.).

   The arbitrator's decision is final and binding, even if the
arbitrator reaches an arguably incorrect legal decision, with
very few exceptions (such as fraud or a decision that violates
public policy). Saying that arbitration is favored means that
if you have agreed to arbitration, you can't go to court if the
other party wants you to arbitrate.

     After reading this chapter, you should be able to do
     the following:

         2. Understand the principal philosophies of

             model.
         4. Explain the difference between shareholder

             and stakeholder models of ethical corporate
             governance.
         5. Explain why it is difficult to establish and
             maintain an ethical corporate culture in a
             business organization.

Few subjects are more contentious or important as the role
of business in society, particularly, whether corporations have
social responsibilities that are distinct from maximizing
shareholder value. While the phrase "business ethics" is not
oxymoronic (i.e., a contradiction in terms), there is plenty of
evidence that businesspeople and firms seek to look out
primarily for themselves. How- ever, business organizations
ignore the ethical and social expectations of consumers,
employees, the media, nongovernment organizations (NGOs),
government officials, and socially responsible investors at their
peril. Legal compliance alone no longer serves the long-term
interests of many companies, who find that sustainable
profitability requires thinking about people and the planet as
well as profits.

   This chapter has a fairly modest aim: to introduce potential
businesspeople to the differences between legal compliance

                                                                            ETHICS | 157

and ethical excellence by reviewing some of the philosophical
perspectives that apply to business, businesspeople, and the
role of business organizations in society.

5.1 What Is Ethics?

     Learning Objectives

     After reading this section, you should be able to do
     the following:

         1. Explain how both individuals and institutions
             can be viewed as ethical or unethical.

         2. Explain how law and ethics are different, and
             why a good reputation can be more
             important than legal compliance.

Most of those who write about ethics do not make a clear
distinction between ethics and morality. The question of what
is "right" or "morally correct" or "ethically correct" or
"morally desirable" in any situation is variously phrased, but
all of the words and phrases are after the same thing: what
158 | CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND BUSINESS
ETHICS

act is "better" in a moral or ethical sense than some other
act? People sometimes speak of morality as something personal
but view ethics as having wider social implications. Others
see morality as the subject of a field of study, that field being
ethics. Ethics would be morality as applied to any number
of subjects, including journalistic ethics, business ethics, or
the ethics of professionals such as doctors, attorneys, and
accountants. We will venture a definition of ethics, but for our
purposes, ethics and morality will be used as equivalent terms.

   People often speak about the ethics or morality of
individuals and also about the morality or ethics of
corporations and nations. There are clearly differences in the
kind of moral responsibility that we can fairly ascribe to
corporations and nations; we tend to see individuals as having
a soul, or at least a conscience, but there is no general
agreement that nations or corporations have either. Still, our
ordinary use of language does point to something significant:
if we say that some nations are "evil" and others are "corrupt,"
then we make moral judgments about the quality of actions
undertaken by the governments or people of that nation. For
example, if North Korea is characterized by the US president
as part of an "axis of evil," or if we conclude that WorldCom
or Enron acted "unethically" in certain respects, then we are
making judgments that their collective actions are morally
deficient.

   In talking about morality, we often use the word good; but
that word can be confusing. If we say that Microsoft is a "good
                  CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND BUSINESS
                                                                            ETHICS | 159

company," we may be making a statement about the
investment potential of Microsoft stock, or their preeminence
in the market, or their ability to win lawsuits or appeals or to
influence administrative agencies. Less likely, though possibly,
we may be making a statement about the civic virtue and
corporate social responsibility of Microsoft. In the first set of
judgments, we use the word good but mean something other
than ethical or moral; only in the second instance are we using
the word good in its ethical or moral sense.

   A word such as good can embrace ethical or moral values but
also nonethical values. If I like Daniel and try to convince you
what a "good guy" he is, you may ask all sorts of questions:
Is he good-looking? Well-off? Fun to be with? Humorous?
Athletic? Smart? I could answer all of those questions with a
yes, yet you would still not know any of his moral qualities.
But if I said that he was honest, caring, forthright, and diligent,
volunteered in local soup kitchens, or tithed to the church,
many people would see Daniel as having certain ethical or
moral qualities. If I said that he keeps the Golden Rule as well
as anyone I know, you could conclude that he is an ethical
person. But if I said that he is "always in control" or "always at
the top of his game," you would probably not make inferences
or assumptions about his character or ethics.

   There are three key points here:

 1. Although morals and ethics are not precisely
      measurable, people generally have similar reactions
160 | CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND BUSINESS
ETHICS

      about what actions or conduct can rightly be called
      ethical or moral.
 2. As humans, we need and value ethical people and want
      to be around them.
 3. Saying that someone or some organization is law-abiding
      does not mean the same as saying a person or company is
      ethical.

Here is a cautionary note: for individuals, it is far from easy to
recognize an ethical problem, have a clear and usable decision-
making process to deal it, and then have the moral courage
to do what's right. All of that is even more difficult within a
business organization, where corporate employees vary in their
motivations, loyalties, commitments, and character. There is
no universally accepted way for developing an organization
where employees feel valued, respected, and free to openly
disagree; where the actions of top management are crystal
clear; and where all the employees feel loyal and accountable to
one another.

Before talking about how ethics relates to law, we can conclude
that ethics is the study of morality--"right" and "wrong"--in
the context of everyday life, organizational behaviors, and even
how society operates and is governed.

                                                                    ETHICS | 161

       How Do Law and Ethics Differ?

There is a difference between legal compliance and moral
excellence. Few would choose a professional service, health care
or otherwise, because the provider had a record of perfect legal
compliance, or always following the letter of the law. There
are many professional ethics codes, primarily because people
realize that law prescribes only a minimum of morality and
does not provide purpose or goals that can mean excellent
service to customers, clients, or patients.

   Business ethicists have talked for years about the
intersection of law and ethics. Simply put, what is legal is not
necessarily ethical. Conversely, what is ethical is not necessarily
legal. There are lots of legal maneuvers that are not all that
ethical; the well-used phrase "legal loophole" suggests as much.

   Here are two propositions about business and ethics.
Consider whether they strike you as true or whether you
would need to know more in order to make a judgment.

   Proposition 1 Individuals and organizations have
reputations. (For an individual, moral reputation is most often
tied to others' perceptions of his or her character: is the
individual honest, diligent, reliable, fair, and caring? The
reputation of an organization is built on the goodwill that
suppliers, customers, the community, and employees feel
toward it. Although an organization is not a person in the
usual sense, the goodwill that people feel about the
organization is based on their perception of its better qualities
162 | CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND BUSINESS
ETHICS

by a variety of stakeholders: customers or clients, suppliers,
investors, employees, government officials).

   Proposition 2 The goodwill of an organization is to a
great extent based on the actions it takes and on whether the
actions are favorably viewed. (This goodwill is usually
specifically counted in the sale of a business as an asset that
the buyer pays for. While it is difficult to place a monetary
value on goodwill, a firm's good reputation will generally call
for a higher evaluation in the final accounting before the sale.
Legal troubles or a reputation for having legal troubles will
only lessen the price for a business and will even lessen the
value of the company's stock as bad legal news comes to the
public's attention.)

   Another reason to think about ethics in connection with
law is that the laws themselves are meant to express some moral
view. If there are legal prohibitions against cheating the
Medicare program, it is because people (legislators or their
agents) have collectively decided that cheating Medicare is
wrong. If there are legal prohibitions against assisting someone
to commit suicide, it is because there has been a group decision
that doing so is immoral. Thus the law provides some
important cues as to what society regards as right or wrong.

   Finally, important policy issues that face society are often
resolved through law, but it is important to understand the
moral perspectives that underlie public debate--as, for
example, in the continuing controversies over stem-cell
research, medical use of marijuana, and abortion.
                  CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND BUSINESS
                                                                            ETHICS | 163

Some ethical perspectives focus on rights, some on social
utility, some on virtue or character, and some on social justice.
People consciously (or, more often, unconsciously) adopt one
or more of these perspectives, and even if they completely agree
on the facts with an opponent, they will not change their
views. Fundamentally, the difference comes down to
incompatible moral perspectives, a clash of basic values. These
are hot-button issues because society is divided, not so much
over facts, but over basic values. Understanding the varied
moral perspectives and values in public policy debates is a
clarifying benefit in following or participating in these
important discussions.

4.1.2 Why Should an Individual or a
Business Entity Be Ethical?

The usual answer is that good ethics is good business. In the
long run, businesses that pay attention to ethics as well as law
do better; they are viewed more favorably by customers. But
this is a difficult claim to measure scientifically, because "the
long run" is an indistinct period of time and because there are
as yet no generally accepted criteria by which ethical excellence
can be measured. In addition, life is still lived in the short run,
and there are many occasions when something short of perfect
conduct is a lot more profitable.

   Some years ago, Royal Dutch/Shell (one of the world's
largest companies) found that it was in deep trouble with the
164 | CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND BUSINESS
ETHICS

public for its apparent carelessness with the environment and
human rights. Consumers were boycotting and investors were
getting frightened, so the company took a long, hard look at its
ethic of short-term profit maximization. Since then, changes
have been made. The CEO told one group of business ethicists
that the uproar had taken them by surprise; they thought they
had done everything right, but it seemed there was a "ghost
in the machine." That ghost was consumers, NGOs, and the
media, all of whom objected to the company's seeming lack of
moral sensitivity.

   The market does respond to unethical behavior. In
"Corporations and Corporate Governance", you will read
about the Sears Auto Centers case. The loss of goodwill
toward Sears Auto Centers was real, even though the total
amount of money lost cannot be clearly accounted for. Years
later, there are people who will not go near a Sears Auto
Center; the customers who lost trust in the company will never
return, and many of their children may avoid Sears Auto
Centers as well.

   The Arthur Andersen story is even more dramatic. A major
accounting firm, Andersen worked closely with Enron in
hiding its various losses through creative accounting measures.
Suspiciously, Andersen's Houston office also did some
shredding around the clock, appearing to cover up what it
was doing for Enron. A criminal case based on this shredding
resulted in a conviction, later overturned by the Supreme
Court. But it was too late. Even before the conviction, many
                  CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND BUSINESS
                                                                            ETHICS | 165

clients had found other accounting firms that were not under
suspicion, and the Supreme Court's reversal came too late to
save the company. Even without the conviction, Andersen
would have lost significant market share.

   The irony of Andersen as a poster child for overly aggressive
accounting practices is that the man who founded the firm
built it on integrity and straightforward practices. "Think
straight, talk straight" was the company's motto. Andersen
established the company's reputation for integrity over a
hundred years ago by refusing to play numbers games for a
potentially lucrative client.

Maximizing profits while being legally compliant is not a very
inspiring goal for a business. People in an organization need
some quality or excellence to strive for. By focusing on pushing
the edge of what is legal, by looking for loopholes in the law
that would help create short-term financial gain, companies
have often learned that in the long term they are not actually
satisfying the market, the shareholders, the suppliers, or the
community generally.

     Key Takeaway
166 | CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND BUSINESS
ETHICS

     Legal compliance is not the same as acting ethically.
     Your reputation, individually or corporately, depends
     on how others regard your actions. Goodwill is hard
     to measure or quantify, but it is real nonetheless and
     can best be protected by acting ethically.

  There are several well-respected ways of looking at ethical
  issues. Some of them have been around for centuries. It is
  important to know that many who think a lot about business
  and ethics have deeply held beliefs about which perspective is
  best. Others would recommend considering ethical problems
  from a variety of different perspectives. Here, we take a brief
  look at (1) utilitarianism, (2) deontology, (3) social justice and
  social contract theory, and (4) virtue theory. We are leaving out
  some important perspectives, such as general theories of justice
  and "rights" and feminist thought about ethics and patriarchy.

 5.2.1 Utilitarianism (or, the
 Consequences Tradition)

  Utilitarianism1 is a prominent perspective on ethics, one that is
  well aligned with economics and the free-market outlook that
  has come to dominate much current thinking about business,
  management, and economics. Jeremy Bentham is often
  considered the founder of utilitarianism, though John Stuart
  Mill (who wrote On Liberty and Utilitarianism) and others
  promoted it as a guide to what is good. Utilitarianism
  emphasizes not rules but results. An action (or set of actions)
  is generally deemed good or right if it maximizes happiness or

1. The theory that the "right" moral act is the one that produces the
  greatest good for society.
168 | CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND BUSINESS
ETHICS

pleasure throughout society. Originally intended as a guide for

legislators charged with seeking the greatest good for society,

the utilitarian outlook may also be practiced individually and

by corporations. In the Four Traditions of Ethical Thought

we discuss in class, utilitarianism matches most closely with

the Consequences Tradition.

                                        Bentham believed that

                             the most promising way to

                             obtain agreement on the

                             best policies for a society

                             would be to look at the

                             various policies a legislature

                             could pass and compare the

                             good and bad consequences

                             of each. The right course of

                             action from an ethical point

                             of view would be to choose

Jeremy Bentham               the policy that would
                             produce the greatest

amount of utility, or usefulness. In brief, the utilitarian

principle holds that an action is right if and only if the sum of

utilities produced by that action is greater than the sum of

utilities from any other possible act.

This statement describes "act utilitarianism"--which

action among various options will deliver the greatest good to

society? "Rule utilitarianism" is a slightly different version; it
                  CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND BUSINESS
                                                                           ETHICS | 169

asks, what rule or principle, if followed regularly, will create the
greatest good?

Notice that the emphasis is on finding the best possible results
and that the assumption is that we can measure the utilities
involved. (This turns out to be more difficult than you might
think.) Notice also that "the sum total of utilities" clearly
implies that in doing utilitarian analysis, we cannot be satisfied
if an act or set of acts provides the greatest utility to us as
individuals or to a particular corporation; the test is, instead,
whether it provides the greatest utility to society as a whole.
Notice that the theory does not tell us what kinds of utilities
may be better than others or how much better a good today is
compared with a good a year from today.

Whatever its difficulties, utilitarian thinking is alive and well
in US law and business. It is found in such diverse places as
cost-benefit analysis in administrative and regulatory rules and
calculations, environmental impact studies, the majority vote,
product comparisons for consumer information, marketing
studies, tax laws, and strategic planning. In management,
people will often employ a form of utility reasoning by
projecting costs and benefits for plan X versus plan Y. But the
issue in most of these cost-benefit analyses is usually (1) put
exclusively in terms of money and (2) directed to the benefit
of the person or organization doing the analysis and not to the
benefit of society as a whole.
170 | CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND BUSINESS
ETHICS

   An individual or a
company that consistently
uses the test "What's the
greatest good for me or the
company?" is not following
the utilitarian test of the
greatest good overall.
Another common failing is
to see only one or two
options that seem
reasonable. The following
are some frequent mistakes John Stuart Mill
that people make in
applying what they think are utilitarian principles in justifying
their chosen course of action:

   Failing to come up with lots of options that seem
      reasonable and then choosing the one that has the
      greatest benefit for the greatest number. Often, a
      decision maker seizes on one or two alternatives without
      thinking carefully about other courses of action. If the
      alternative does more good than harm, the decision
      maker assumes it's ethically okay.

   Assuming that the greatest good for you or your
      company is in fact the greatest good for all--that is,
      looking at situations subjectively or with your own
      interests primarily in mind.
                  CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND BUSINESS
                                                                            ETHICS | 171

   Underestimating the costs of a certain decision to you or
      your company. The now-classic Ford Pinto case
      demonstrates how Ford Motor Company executives
      drastically underestimated the legal costs of not
      correcting a feature on their Pinto models that they
      knew could cause death or injury. General Motors was
      often taken to task by juries that came to understand
      that the company would not recall or repair known and
      dangerous defects because it seemed more profitable not
      to. In 2010, Toyota learned the same lesson.

   Underestimating the cost or harm of a certain decision
      to someone else or some other group of people.

   Favoring short-term benefits, even though the long-term
      costs are greater.

   Assuming that all values can be reduced to money. In
      comparing the risks to human health or safety against,
      say, the risks of job or profit losses, cost-benefit analyses
      will often try to compare apples to oranges and put
      arbitrary numerical values on human health and safety.

5.2.2 Rules and Duty: Deontology
(the Standards of Conduct Tradition)

In contrast to the utilitarian perspective, the deontological
view presented in the writings of Immanuel Kant purports
that having a moral intent and following the right rules is a
better path to ethical conduct than achieving the right results.
172 | CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND BUSINESS
ETHICS

A deontologist like Kant is likely to believe that ethical action

arises from doing one's duty and that duties are defined by

rational thought. Duties, according to Kant, are not specific

to particular kinds of human beings but are owed universally

to all human beings. Kant therefore uses "universalizing" as a

form of rational thought that assumes the inherent equality

of all human beings. It considers all humans as equal, not in

the physical, social, or economic sense, but equal before God,

whether they are male, female, Pygmy, Eskimoan, Islamic,

Christian, gay, straight, healthy, sick, young, or old.

               For Kantian thinkers, this

               basic principle of equality

               means that we should be

               able to universalize any

               particular law or action to

               determine whether it is

               ethical. For example, if you

               were to consider

               misrepresenting yourself on

               a resume for a particular job

Immanuel Kant  you really wanted and you
               were convinced that doing

               so would get you that job,

you might be very tempted to do so. (What harm would it be?

you might ask yourself. When I have the job, I can prove that I

was perfect for it, and no one is hurt, while both the employer

and I are clearly better off as a result!) Kantian ethicists would
                     CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND BUSINESS
                                                                               ETHICS | 173

  answer that your chosen course of action should be a universal
  one--a course of action that would be good for all persons at
  all times. There are two requirements for a rule of action to be
  universal: consistency and reversibility. Consider reversibility:
  if you make a decision as though you didn't know what role
  or position you would have after the decision, you would more
  likely make an impartial one--you would more likely choose a
  course of action that would be most fair to all concerned, not
  just you. Again, deontology2 requires that we put duty first, act
  rationally, and give moral weight to the inherent equality of all
  human beings.

  In considering whether to lie on your resume, reversibility
  requires you to actively imagine both that you were the
  employer in this situation and that you were another well-
  qualified applicant who lost the job because someone else
  padded his resume with false accomplishments. If the
  consequences of such an exercise of the imagination are not
  appealing to you, your action is probably not ethical.

     The second requirement for an action to be universal is the
  search for consistency. This is more abstract. A deontologist
  would say that since you know you are telling a lie, you must be

2. A theory that judges the morality of choices not by results (or
  "goods") but by adherence to moral norms. The duty to act in
  accord with these norms is one that bears no relation to the expected
  consequences of the action.
174 | CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND BUSINESS
ETHICS

willing to say that lying, as a general, universal phenomenon, is
acceptable. But if everyone lied, then there would be no point
to lying, since no one would believe anyone. It is only because
honesty works well for society as a whole and is generally
practiced that lying even becomes possible! That is, lying
cannot be universalized, for it depends on the preexistence of
honesty.

   Similar demonstrations can be made for actions such as
polluting, breaking promises, and committing most crimes,
including rape, murder, and theft. But these are the easy cases
for Kantian thinkers. In the gray areas of life as it is lived, the
consistency test is often difficult to apply. If breaking a promise
would save a life, then Kantian thought becomes difficult to
apply. If some amount of pollution can allow employment and
the harm is minimal or distant, Kantian thinking is not all that
helpful. Finally, we should note that the well-known Golden
Rule, "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you,"
emphasizes the easier of the two universalizing requirements:
practicing reversibility ("How would I like it if someone did
this to me?").

5.2.3 Social Justice Theory and Social
Contract Theory (Similarities to
relationships/Care Tradition)

Social justice theorists worry about "distributive justice"--that
is, what is the fair way to distribute goods among a group of
                     CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND BUSINESS
                                                                               ETHICS | 175

  people? Marxist thought emphasizes that members of society
  should be given goods to according to their needs. But this
  redistribution would require a governing power to decide who
  gets what and when. Capitalist thought takes a different
  approach, rejecting giving that is not voluntary. Certain
  economists, such as the late Milton Friedman also reject the
  notion that a corporation has a duty to give to unmet needs
  in society, believing that the government should play that role.
  Even the most dedicated free-market capitalist will often admit
  the need for some government and some forms of
  welfare--Social Security, Medicare, assistance to flood-stricken
  areas, help for pandemics--along with some public goods
  (such as defense, education, highways, parks, and support of
  key industries affecting national security).

     People who do not see the need for public goods3 (including
  laws, court systems, and the government goods and services
  just cited) often question why there needs to be a government
  at all. One response might be, "Without government, there
  would be no corporations."

3. Goods that are useful to society (parks, education, national defense,
  highways) that would ordinarily not be produced by private
  enterprise. Public goods require public revenues (taxes) and political
  support to be adequately maintained.
   176 | CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND BUSINESS
   ETHICS

     Thomas Hobbes believed
  that people in a "state of
  nature" would rationally
  choose to have some form of
  government. He called this
  the social contract4, where
  people give up certain rights
  to government in exchange
  for security and common
  benefits. In your own lives Thomas Hobbes
  and in this course, you will
  see an ongoing balancing act between human desires for
  freedom and human desires for order; it is an ancient tension.
  Some commentators also see a kind of social contract between
  corporations and society; in exchange for perpetual duration
  and limited liability, the corporation has some corresponding
  duties toward society. Also, if a corporation is legally a
  "person," as the Supreme Court reaffirmed in 2010, then some
  would argue that if this corporate person commits three
  felonies, it should be locked up for life and its corporate charter
  revoked!

4. The idea that people in a civil society have voluntarily given up some
  of their freedoms to have ordered liberty with the assistance of a
  government that will support that liberty. Hobbes and Locke are
  generally regarded as the preeminent social contract theorists.
                  CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND BUSINESS
                                                                            ETHICS | 177

Modern social contract theorists, such as Thomas Donaldson
and Thomas Dunfee (Ties that Bind, 1999), observe that
various communities, not just nations, make rules for the
common good. Your college or school is a community, and
there are communities within the school (fraternities,
sororities, the folks behind the counter at the circulation desk,
the people who work together at the university radio station,
the sports teams, the faculty, the students generally, the gay
and lesbian alliance) that have rules, norms, or standards that
people can buy into or not. If not, they can exit from that
community, just as we are free (though not without cost) to
reject US citizenship and take up residence in another country.

   Donaldson and Dunfee's integrative social contracts theory
stresses the importance of studying the rules of smaller
communities along with the larger social contracts made in
states (such as Colorado or California) and nation-states (such
as the United States or Germany). Our Constitution can be
seen as a fundamental social contract.

   It is important to realize that a social contract can be
changed by the participants in a community, just as the US
Constitution can be amended. Social contract theory is thus
dynamic--it allows for structural and organic changes. Ideally,
the social contract struck by citizens and the government
allows for certain fundamental rights such as those we enjoy in
the United States, but it need not. People can give up freedom-
oriented rights (such as the right of free speech or the right to
be free of unreasonable searches and seizures) to secure order
178 | CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND BUSINESS
ETHICS

(freedom from fear, freedom from terrorism). For example,
many citizens in Russia now miss the days when the Kremlin
was all powerful; there was less crime and more equality and
predictability to life in the Soviet Union, even if there was less
freedom.

   Thus the rights that people have--in positive law--come
from whatever social contract exists in the society. This view
differs from that of the deontologists and that of the natural-
law thinkers such as Gandhi, Jesus, or Martin Luther King Jr.,
who believed that rights come from God or, in less religious
terms, from some transcendent moral order.

   Another important movement in ethics and society is the
communitarian outlook. Communitarians emphasize that
rights carry with them corresponding duties; that is, there
cannot be a right without a duty. Interested students may wish
to explore the work of Amitai Etzioni. Etzioni was a founder of
the Communitarian Network, which is a group of individuals
who have come together to bolster the moral, social, and
political environment. It claims to be nonsectarian,
nonpartisan, and international in scope.

   The relationship between rights and duties--in both law
and ethics--calls for some explanations:

   If you have a right of free expression, the government has
a duty to respect that right but can put reasonable limits on
it. For example, you can legally say whatever you want about
the US president, but you can't get away with threatening the
president's life. Even if your criticisms are strong and insistent,
                  CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND BUSINESS
                                                                            ETHICS | 179

you have the right (and our government has the duty to protect
your right) to speak freely. In Singapore during the 1990s, even
indirect criticisms--mere hints--of the political leadership
were enough to land you in jail or at least silence you with a
libel suit.

   Rights and duties exist not only between people and their
governments but also between individuals. Your right to be
free from physical assault is protected by the law in most states,
and when someone walks up to you and punches you in the
nose, your rights--as set forth in the positive law of your
state--have been violated. Thus other people have a duty to
respect your rights and to not punch you in the nose.

   Your right in legal terms is only as good as your society's
willingness to provide legal remedies through the courts and
political institutions of society.

   A distinction between basic rights and nonbasic rights may
also be important. Basic rights may include such fundamental
elements as food, water, shelter, and physical safety. Another
distinction is between positive rights (the right to bear arms,
the right to vote, the right of privacy) and negative rights (the
right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures, the
right to be free of cruel or unusual punishments). Yet another
is between economic or social rights (adequate food, work, and
environment) and political or civic rights (the right to vote, the
right to equal protection of the laws, the right to due process).

   ETHICS

 (Similarities to Character Tradition)

                                         Virtue theory5, or virtue
                                         ethics, has received
                                         increasing attention over the
                                         past twenty years,
                                         particularly in contrast to
                                         utilitarian and deontological
                                         approaches to ethics. Virtue
                                         theory emphasizes the value
                                         of virtuous qualities rather
                                         than formal rules or useful
                                         results. Aristotle is often
                                         recognized as the first
  philosopher to advocate the ethical value of certain qualities,
  or virtues, in a person's character. As LaRue Hosmer has
  noted, Aristotle saw the goal of human existence as the active,
  rational search for excellence, and excellence requires the
  personal virtues of honesty, truthfulness, courage, temperance,

5. Aristotle's perspective on finding happiness through the application
  of reason in human affairs advises continual practice to develop
  habits of virtuous moral character. In a modern setting, deliberating
  on core values and their application to individual and corporate
  ethical dilemmas and adhering to the recommendations of core
  values analysis would provide similar practice.
                     CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND BUSINESS
                                                                               ETHICS | 181

  generosity, and high-mindedness. This pursuit is also termed
  "knowledge of the good" in Greek philosophy.6

     Aristotle believed that all activity was aimed at some goal
  or perceived good and that there must be some ranking that
  we do among those goals or goods. Happiness may be our
  ultimate goal, but what does that mean, exactly? Aristotle
  rejected wealth, pleasure, and fame and embraced reason as the
  distinguishing feature of humans, as opposed to other species.
  And since a human is a reasoning animal, happiness must be
  associated with reason. Thus happiness is living according to
  the active (rather than passive) use of reason. The use of reason
  leads to excellence, and so happiness can be defined as the
  active, rational pursuit of personal excellence, or virtue.

     Aristotle named fourteen virtues: (1) courage, particularly
  in battle; (2) temperance, or moderation in eating and
  drinking; (3) liberality, or spending money well; (4)
  magnificence, or living well; (5) pride, or taking pleasure in
  accomplishments and stature; (6) high-mindedness, or
  concern with the noble rather than the petty; (7) unnamed
  virtue, which is halfway between ambition and total lack of
  effort; (8) gentleness, or concern for others; (9) truthfulness;
  (10) wit, or pleasure in group discussions; (11) friendliness,
  or pleasure in personal conduct; (12) modesty, or pleasure in

6. LaRue Tone Hosmer, Moral Leadership in Business (Chicago: Irwin
  Professional Publishing, 1994), 72.
   182 | CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND BUSINESS
   ETHICS

  personal conduct; (13) righteous indignation, or getting angry
  at the right things and in the right amounts; and (14) justice.

     From a modern perspective, some of these virtues seem old-
  fashioned or even odd. Magnificence, for example, is not
  something we commonly speak of. Three issues emerge: (1)
  How do we know what a virtue is these days? (2) How useful is
  a list of agreed-upon virtues anyway? (3) What do virtues have
  to do with companies, particularly large ones where various
  groups and individuals may have little or no contact with other
  parts of the organization?

     As to the third question, whether corporations can "have"
  virtues or values is a matter of lively debate. A corporation
  is obviously not the same as an individual. But there seems
  to be growing agreement that organizations do differ in their
  practices and that these practices are value driven. If all a
  company cares about is the bottom line, other values will
  diminish or disappear. Quite a few books have been written in
  the past twenty years that emphasize the need for businesses to
  define their values in order to be competitive in today's global
  economy.7

     As to the first two questions regarding virtues, a look at
  Michael Josephson's core values may prove helpful.

5.2.5 Josephson's Core Values
Analysis and Decision Process

Michael Josephson, a noted American ethicist, believes that
a current set of core values has been identified and that the
values can be meaningfully applied to a variety of personal and
corporate decisions.

   To simplify, let's say that there are ethical and nonethical
qualities among people in the United States. When you ask
people what kinds of qualities they admire in others or in
themselves, they may say wealth, power, fitness, sense of
humor, good looks, intelligence, musical ability, or some other
quality. They may also value honesty, caring, fairness, courage,
perseverance, diligence, trustworthiness, or integrity. The
qualities on the second list have something in common--they
are distinctively ethical characteristics. That is, they are
commonly seen as moral or ethical qualities, unlike the
qualities on the first list. You can be, like the Athenian
Alcibiades, brilliant but unprincipled, or, like some political
leaders today, powerful but dishonest, or wealthy but
uncaring. You can, in short, have a number of admirable
qualities (brilliance, power, wealth) that are not per se
virtuous. Just because Harold is rich or good-looking or has
a good sense of humor does not mean that he is ethical. But
if Harold is honest and caring (whether he is rich or poor,
humorous or humorless), people are likely to see him as ethical.

   Among the virtues, are any especially important? Studies
   184 | CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND BUSINESS
   ETHICS

  from the Josephson Institute of Ethics in Marina del Rey,
  California, have identified six core values8 in our society, values
  that almost everyone agrees are important to them. When
  asked what values people hold dear, what values they wish to
  be known by, and what values they wish others would exhibit
  in their actions, six values consistently turn up: (1)
  trustworthiness, (2) respect, (3) responsibility, (4) fairness, (5)
  caring, and (6) citizenship.

     Note that these values are distinctly ethical. While many
  of us may value wealth, good looks, and intelligence, having
  wealth, good looks, and intelligence does not automatically
  make us virtuous in our character and habits. But being more
  trustworthy (by being honest and by keeping promises) does
  make us more virtuous, as does staying true to the other five
  core values.

     Notice also that these six
  core values share something
  in common with other
  ethical values that are less
  universally agreed upon.
  Many values taught in the

8. Values that are generally recognized as positive ethical characteristics
  of an individual or a business organization. People may have strong
  views about other kinds of ethical values, but core values are more
  widely accepted.
                  CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND BUSINESS
                                                                            ETHICS | 185

family or in places of wor- ship are not generally agreed on,
practiced, or admired by all. Some families and individuals
believe strongly in the virtue of saving money or in abstaining
from alcohol or sex prior to marriage. Others clearly do not,
or at least don't act on their beliefs. Moreover, it is possible to
have and practice core ethical values even if you take on heavy
debt, knock down several drinks a night, or have frequent
premarital sex. Some would dispute this, saying that you can't
really lead a virtuous life if you get into debt, drink heavily,
or engage in premarital sex. But the point here is that since
people do disagree in these areas, the ethical traits of thrift,
temperance, and sexual abstinence do not have the unanimity
of approval that the six core values do.

   The importance of an individual's having these consistent
qualities of character is well known. Often we remember the
last bad thing a person did far more than any or all previous
good acts. For example, Eliot Spitzer and Bill Clinton are more
readily remembered by people for their last, worst acts than
for any good they accomplished as public servants. As for a
company, its good reputation also has an incalculable value
that when lost takes a great deal of time and work to recover.
Shell, Nike, and other companies have discovered that there
is a market for morality, however difficult to measure, and
that not paying attention to business ethics often comes at a
serious price. In the past fifteen years, the career of ethics and
compliance officer has emerged, partly as a result of criminal
proceedings against companies but also because major
186 | CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND BUSINESS
ETHICS

companies have found that reputations cannot be recovered
retroactively but must be pursued proactively. For individuals,
Aristotle emphasized the practice of virtue to the point where
virtue becomes a habit. Companies are gradually learning the
same lesson.

     Key Takeaway

     Throughout history, people have pondered what it
     means "to do what is right." Some
     of the main answers have come from the differing
     perspectives of utilitarian thought;
     duty-based, or deontological, thought; social
     contract theory; and virtue ethics.

     After reading this section, you should be able to do
     the following:

         1. Understand one model for ethical decision
             making: a process to arrive at the most ethical
             option for an individual or a business
             organization, using a virtue ethics approach
             combined with some elements of stakeholder
             analysis and utilitarianism.

5.3.1 Josephson's Core Values Model

Once you recognize that there is a decision that involves ethical
judgment, Michael Josephson would first have you ask as many
questions as are necessary to get a full background on the
relevant facts. Then, assuming you have all the needed
information, the decision process is as follows:

 1. Identify the stakeholders. That is, who are the potential
      gainers and losers in the various decisions that might be
      made here?

 2. Identify several likely or reasonable decisions that could
      be made.

 3. Consider which stakeholders gain or lose with each
      decision.
188 | CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND BUSINESS
ETHICS

 4. Determine which decision satisfies the greatest number
      of core values.

 5. If there is no decision that satisfies the greatest number
      of core values, try to determine which decision delivers
      the greatest good to the various stakeholders.

It is often helpful to identify who (or what group) is the most
important stakeholder, and why. In Milton Friedman's view, it
will always be the shareholders. In the view of John Mackey,
the CEO of Whole Foods Market, the long-term viability and
profitability of the organization may require that customers
come first, or, at times, some other stakeholder group.

       The Core Values
       Here are the core values and their
       subcomponents as developed by the Josephson
       Institute of Ethics.
       Trustworthiness: Be honest--tell the truth, the
       whole truth, and nothing but the truth; be
       sincere, forthright; don't deceive, mislead, or be
       tricky with the truth; don't cheat or steal, and
       don't betray a trust. Demonstrate
       integrity--stand up for what you believe, walk
       the walk as well as talking the talk; be what you
         CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND BUSINESS
                                                                  ETHICS | 189

seem to be; show commitment and courage. Be
loyal--stand by your family, friends, co-workers,
community, and nation; be discreet with
information that comes into your hands; don't
spread rumors or engage in harmful gossip; don't
violate your principles just to win friendship or
approval; don't ask a friend to do something that
is wrong. Keep promises--keep your word,
honor your commitments, and pay your debts;
return what you borrow.

Respect: Judge people on their merits, not their
appearance; be courteous, polite, appreciative,
and accepting of differences; respect others'
right to make decisions about their own lives;
don't abuse, demean, mistreat anyone; don't use,
manipulate, exploit, or take advantage of others.

Responsibility: Be accountable--think about
the consequences on yourself and others likely
to be affected before you act; be reliable;
perform your duties; take responsibility for the
consequences of your choices; set a good
example and don't make excuses or take credit
for other people's work. Pursue excellence: Do
your best, don't quit easily, persevere, be
190 | CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND BUSINESS
ETHICS

       diligent, make all you do worthy of pride.
       Exercise self-restraint--be disciplined, know the
       difference between what you have a right to do
       and what is right to do.
       Fairness: Treat all people fairly, be open-
       minded; listen; consider opposing viewpoints; be
       consistent; use only appropriate considerations;
       don't let personal feelings improperly interfere
       with decisions; don't take unfair advantage of
       mistakes; don't take more than your fair share.
       Caring: Show you care about others through
       kindness, caring, sharing, compassion, and
       empathy; treat others the way you want to be
       treated; don't be selfish, mean, cruel, or
       insensitive to others' feelings.
       Citizenship: Play by the rules, obey laws; do
       your share, respect authority, stay in- formed,
       vote, protect your neighbors, pay your taxes; be
       charitable, help your community; protect the
       environment, conserve resources.

When individuals and organizations confront ethical
problems, the core values decision model offered by Josephson
generally works well (1) to clarify the gains and losses of the
                  CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND BUSINESS
                                                                            ETHICS | 191

various stakeholders, which then raises ethical awareness on
the part of the decision maker and (2) to provide a fairly
reliable guide as to what the most ethical decision would be.
In nine out of ten cases, step 5 in the decision process is not
needed.

   That said, it does not follow that students (or managers)
would necessarily act in accord with the results of the core
values decision process. There are many psychological
pressures and organizational constraints that place limits on
people both individually and in organizations. These pressures
and constraints tend to compromise ideal or the most ethical
solutions for individuals and for organizations. For a business,
one essential problem is that ethics can cost the organization
money or resources, at least in the short term. Doing the most
ethical thing will often appear to be something that fails to
maximize profits in the short term or that may seem pointless
because if you or your organization acts ethically, others will
not, and society will be no better off, anyway.

     Key Takeaway

     Having a step-by-step process to analyze difficult
     moral dilemmas is useful. One such process is
192 | CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND BUSINESS
ETHICS

     offered here, based on the core values of
     trustworthiness, caring, respect, fairness,
     responsibility, and citizenship.

5.4 Corporations and Corporate
Governance

     Learning Objectives

     After reading this section, you should be able to do
     the following:

         1. Explain the basic structure of the typical
             corporation and how the shareholders
             own the company and elect directors to run it.

         2. Understand how the shareholder profit-
             maximization model is different from
             stakeholder theory.

         3. Discern and describe the ethical challenges for
                  CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND BUSINESS
                                                                            ETHICS | 193

             corporate cultures.
         4. Explain what conscious capitalism is and how

             it differs from stakeholder theory.

5.4.1 Legal Organization of the
Corporation

   This figure, though
somewhat oversimplified,
shows the basic legal
structure of a corporation
under Delaware law and the
laws of most other states in the United States. Shareholders
elect directors, who then hire officers to manage the company.
From this structure, some very basic realities follow. Because
the directors of a corporation do not meet that often, it's
possible for the officers hired (top management, or the "C-
suite") to be selective of what the board knows about, and
directors are not always ready and able to provide the oversight
that the shareholders would like. Nor does the law require
officers to be shareholders, so that officers' motivations may
not align with the best interests of the company. This is the
"agency problem" often discussed in corporate governance:
how to get officers and other top management to align their
194 | CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND BUSINESS
ETHICS

own interests with those of the shareholders. For example, a
CEO might trade insider information to the detriment of the
company's shareholders. Even board members are susceptible
to misalignment of interests; for example, board members
might resist hostile takeover bids because they would likely
lose their perks (short for perquisites) as directors, even though
the tender offer would benefit stockholders. Among other
attempted realignments, the use of stock options was an
attempt to make managers more attentive to the value of
company stock, but the law of unintended consequences was
in full force; managers tweaked and managed earnings in the
bubble of the 1990s bull market, and "managing by numbers"
became an epidemic in corporations organized under US
corporate law. The rights of shareholders can be bolstered by
changes in state and federal law, and there have been some
attempts to do that since the late 1990s. But as owners,
shareholders have the ultimate power to replace
nonperforming or underperforming directors, which usually
results in changes at the C-suite level as well.

5.4.2 Shareholders and Stakeholders

There are two main views about what the corporation's duties
are. The first view--maximizing profits--is the prevailing view
among business managers and in business schools. This view
largely follows the idea of Milton Friedman that the duty of a
manager is to maximize return on investment to the owners. In
                  CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND BUSINESS
                                                                            ETHICS | 195

essence, managers' legally prescribed duties are those that make
their employment possible. In terms of the legal organization
of the corporation, the shareholders elect directors who hire
managers, who have legally prescribed duties toward both
directors and shareholders. Those legally prescribed duties are
a reflection of the fact that managers are managing other
people's money and have a moral duty to act as a responsible
agent for the owners. In law, this is called the manager's
fiduciary duty. Directors have the same duties toward
shareholders. Friedman emphasized the primacy of this duty in
his writings about corporations and social responsibility.

   5.4.2.1 Maximizing Profits: Milton Friedman
Economist Milton Friedman is often quoted as having said
that the only moral duty a corporation has is to make the most
possible money, or to maximize profits, for its stockholders.
Friedman's beliefs are noted at length (see sidebar on
Friedman's article from the New York Times), but he asserted
in a now-famous 1970 article that in a free society, "there is
one and only one social responsibility of business: to use its
resources and engage in activities designed to increase its
profits as long as it stays within the rules of the game, which
is to say, engages in open and free competition without
deception and fraud." What follows is a major portion of what
Friedman had to say in 1970.
196 | CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND BUSINESS
ETHICS

       "The Social Responsibility of Business Is to
       Increase Its Profits"

       Milton Friedman, New York Times Magazine,
       September 13, 1970

       What does it mean to say that "business" has
       responsibilities? Only people can have
       responsibilities. A corporation is an artificial
       person and in this sense may have artificial
       responsibilities, but "business" as a whole cannot
       be said to have responsibilities, even in this
       vague sense. . . .

       Presumably, the individuals who are to be
       responsible are businessmen, which means
       individual proprietors or corporate executives. In
       a free enterprise, private-property system, a
       corporate executive is an employee of the
       owners of the business. He has direct
       responsibility to his employers. That
       responsibility is to conduct the business in
       accordance with their desires, which generally
       will be to make as much money as possible while
       conforming to the basic rules of the society, both
         CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND BUSINESS
                                                                  ETHICS | 197

those embodied in law and those embodied in
ethical custom.. . .

. . . [T]he manager is that agent of the individuals
who own the corporation or establish the
eleemosynary institution, and his primary
responsibility is to them. . .

Of course, the corporate executive is also a
person in his own right. As a person, he may
have other responsibilities that he recognizes or
assumes voluntarily--to his family, his
conscience, his feeling of charity, his church, his
clubs, his city, his country. He may feel impelled
by these responsibilities to devote part of his
income to causes he regards as worthy, to refuse
to work for particular corporations, even to leave
his job. But in these respects he is acting as a
principal, not an agent; he is spending his own
money or time or energy, not the money of his
employers or the time or energy he has
contracted to devote to their purposes. If these
are "social responsibilities," they are the social
responsibilities of individuals, not of business.

What does it mean to say that the
corporate executive has a "social
198 | CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND BUSINESS
ETHICS

      responsibility" in his capacity as
      businessman? If this statement is not pure
      rhetoric, it must mean that he has to act in
      some way that is not in the interest of his
      employers. For example, that he is to refrain
      from increasing the price of the product in
      order to contribute to the social objective of
      preventing inflation, even though a price
      increase would be in the best interests of
      the corporation. Or that he is to make
      expenditures on reducing pollution beyond
      the amount that is in the best interests of
      the corporation or that is required by law in
      order to contribute to the social objective of
      improving the environment. Or that, at the
      expense of corporate profits, he is to hire
      "hardcore" unemployed instead of better
      qualified available workmen to contribute to
      the social objective of reducing poverty.

      In each of these cases, the corporate
      executive would be spending someone
      else's money for a general social interest.
      Insofar as his actions. . . reduce returns to
      stockholders, he is spending their money.
                  CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND BUSINESS
                                                                            ETHICS | 199

      Insofar as his actions raise the price to
      customers, he is spending the customers'
      money. Insofar as his actions lower the
      wages of some employees, he is spending
      their money.
      This process raises political questions on
      two levels: principle and consequences. On
      the level of political principle, the imposition
      of taxes and the expenditure of tax
      proceeds are governmental functions. We
      have established elaborate constitutional,
      parliamentary, and judicial provisions to
      control these functions, to assure that taxes
      are imposed so far as possible in accordance
      with the preferences and desires of the
      public. . . .

Others have challenged the notion that corporate managers
have no real duties except toward the owners (shareholders).
By changing two letters in shareholder, stakeholder theorists
widened the range of people and institutions that a
corporation should pay moral consideration to. Thus they
contend that a corporation, through its management, has a set
of responsibilities toward nonshareholder interests.

   Advocates of this counterpoint might also point out two
difficulties with the "maximize profit" alone approach to
business strategy. First, very different decisions might be
reached based on the timeframe involved in the maximization
problem. Some decisions that maximize profit in the short
term might be disasterous for profit in the long run. E.g.,
Enron. When considering long-term profit, many decisions
such as investing in customer or community relations are
rational, even if they have no short-term effect on profits.
Second, the best way to maximize profit might be to adopt
a more stakeholder-centric view of business! Nobody likes to
visit a business that they feel does not appreciate them, and
nobody likes to work for a company that does not value
employees. In anything but the short term, considering the
needs of crucial stakeholders beyond shareholders alone is
almost always a sound business decision, resulting in long-term
gains for shareholders as well!

5.4.2.2 Stakeholder Theory Stakeholders of a corporation
include its employees, suppliers, customers, and the
community. Stakeholder is a deliberate play on the word
shareholder, to emphasize that corporations have obligations
that extend beyond the bottom-line aim of maximizing profits.
A stakeholder is anyone who most would agree is significantly
affected (positively or negatively) by the decision of another
moral agent.

   There is one vital fact about corporations: the corporation
                  CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND BUSINESS
                                                                            ETHICS | 201

is a creation of the law. Without law (and government),
corporations would not have existence. The key concept for
corporations is the legal fact of limited liability. The benefit
of limited liability for shareholders of a corporation meant
that larger pools of capital could be aggregated for larger
enterprises; shareholders could only lose their investments
should the venture fail in any way, and there would be no
personal liability and thus no potential loss of personal assets
other than the value of the corporate stock. Before New Jersey
and Delaware competed to make incorporation as easy as
possible and beneficial to the incorporators and founders,
those who wanted the benefits of incorporation had to go
to legislatures--usually among the states--to show a public
purpose that the company would serve.

In the late 1800s, New Jersey and Delaware changed their laws
to make incorporating relatively easy. These two states allowed
incorporation "for any legal purpose," rather than requiring
some public purpose. Thus it is government (and its laws) that
makes limited liability happen through the corporate form.
That is, only through the consent of the state and armed with
the charter granted by the state can a corporation's
shareholders have limited liability. This is a right granted by
the state, a right granted for good and practical reasons for
encouraging capital and innovation. But with this right comes
a related duty, not clearly stated at law, but assumed when a
charter is granted by the state: that the corporate form of doing
   202 | CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND BUSINESS
   ETHICS

  business is legal because the government feels that it socially
  useful to do so.

     Implicitly, then, there is a social contract between
  governments and corporations: as long as corporations are
  considered socially useful, they can exist. But do they have
  explicit social responsibilities? Milton Friedman's position
  suggests that having gone along with legal duties, the
  corporation can ignore any other social obligations. But there
  are others (such as advocates of stakeholder theory9) who
  would say that a corporation's social responsibilities go beyond
  just staying within the law and go beyond the corporation's
  shareholders to include a number of other important
  stakeholders, those whose lives can be affected by corporate
  decisions.

     According to stakeholder theorists, corporations (and other
  business organizations) must pay attention not only to the
  bottom line but also to their overall effect on the community.
  Public perception of a company's unfairness, uncaring,
  disrespect, or lack of trustworthiness often leads to long-term
  failure, whatever the short-term successes or profits may be. A
  socially responsible corporation is likely to consider the impact

  kind of moral consideration and that corporations that keep all
  stakeholders in mind will, over the long term, deliver superior results
  to shareholders.

of its decisions on a wide range of stakeholders, not just
shareholders. As the table below indicates, stakeholders have
very different kinds of interests ("stakes") in the actions of a
corporation.

Stakes of Various Stakeholders

5.4.3 Corporate Culture and Codes of
Ethics

A corporation is a "person" capable of suing, being sued, and
having rights and duties in our legal system. (It is a legal or
juridical person, not a natural person, according to our
Supreme Court.) Moreover, many corporations have distinct
cultures and beliefs that are lived and breathed by its members.
Often, the culture of a corporation is the best defense against
     204 | CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND BUSINESS
     ETHICS

   individuals within that firm who may be tempted to break the
   law or commit serious ethical misdeeds.

   What follows is a series of observations about corporations,
   ethics, and corporate culture.

      5.4.3.1 Ethical Leadership Is Top-Down People in an
   organization tend to watch closely what the top managers do
   and say. Regardless of managers' talk about ethics, employees
   quickly learn what speech or actions are in fact rewarded. If the
   CEO is firm about acting ethically, others in the organization
   will take their cues from him or her. People at the top tend to
   set the target, the climate, the beliefs, and the expectations that
   fuel behavior.

      5.4.3.2 Accountability is Often Weak Clever
   managers can learn to shift blame to others, take credit for
   others' work, and move on before "funny numbers" or other
   earnings management tricks come to light.10 Again, we see that
   the manager is often an agent for himself or herself and will
   often act more in his or her self-interest than for the corporate
   interest.

      5.4.3.3 Killing the Messenger Where organizations no
   longer function, inevitably some employees are unhappy. If
   they call attention to problems that are being covered up by

10. See Robert Jackall, Moral Mazes: The World of Corporate Managers
    (New York: Oxford University Press, 1988).

                                                                                ETHICS | 205

   coworkers or supervisors, they bring bad news. Managers like
   to hear good news and discourage bad news. Intentionally or
   not, those who told on others, or blew the whistle, have rocked
   the boat and become unpopular with those whose defalcations
   they report on and with the managers who don't really want
   to hear the bad news. In many organizations, "killing the
   messenger" solves the problem. Consider James Alexander at
   Enron Corporation, who was deliberately shut out after
   bringing problems to CEO Ken Lay's attention.11 When
   Sherron Watkins sent Ken Lay a letter warning him about
   Enron's accounting practices, CFO Andrew Fastow tried to
   fire her.12

   5.4.3.4 Ethics Codes Without strong leadership and a
   willingness to listen to bad news as well as good news,
   managers do not have the feedback necessary to keep the
   organization healthy. Ethics codes have been put in
   place--partly in response to federal sentencing guidelines and
   partly to encourage feedback loops to top management. The
   best ethics codes are aspirational, or having an ideal to be
   pursued, not legalistic or compliance driven. The Johnson &
   Johnson ethics code predated the Tylenol scare and the

     206 | CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND BUSINESS
     ETHICS

   company's oft-celebrated corporate response.13 The corporate
   response was consistent with that code, which was lived and
   modeled by the top of the organization.

   It's often noted that a code of ethics is only as important as
   top management is willing to make it. If the code is just a
   document that goes into a drawer or onto a shelf, it will not
   effectively encourage good conduct within the corporation.
   The same is true of any kind of training that the company
   undertakes, whether it be in racial sensitivity or sexual
   harassment. If the message is not continuously reinforced, or
   (worse yet) if the message is undermined by management's
   actions, the real message to employees is that violations of the
   ethics code will not be taken seriously, or that efforts to stop
   racial discrimination or sexual harassment are merely token
   efforts, and that the important things are profits and
   performance. The ethics code at Enron seems to have been one
   of those "3-P" codes that wind up sitting on shelves--"Print,
   Post, and Pray." Worse, the Enron board twice suspended the
   code in 1999 to allow outside partnerships to be led by a top
   Enron executive who stood to gain financially from them.14

   5.4.3.5 Ethics Hotlines and Federal Sentencing
Guidelines The federal sentencing guidelines were enacted
in 1991. The original idea behind these guidelines was for
Congress to correct the lenient treatment often given to white-
collar, or corporate, criminals. The guidelines require judges to
consider "aggravating and mitigating" factors in determining
sentences and fines. (While corporations cannot go to jail, its
officers and managers certainly can, and the corporation itself
can be fined. Many companies will claim that it is one bad
apple that has caused the problem; the guidelines invite these
companies to show that they are in fact tending their orchard
well. They can show this by providing evidence that they have
(1) a viable, active code of ethics; (2) a way for employees to
report violations of law or the ethics code; and (3) an ethics
ombudsman, or someone who oversees the code.

   In short, if a company can show that it has an ongoing
process to root out wrongdoing at all levels of the company,
the judge is allowed to consider this as a major mitigating factor
in the fines the company will pay. Most Fortune 500
companies have ethics hotlines and processes in place to find
legal and ethical problems within the company.

   5.4.3.6 Managing by the Numbers If you manage by
the numbers, there is a temptation to lie about those numbers,

   based on the need to get stock price ever higher. At Enron,
   "15 percent a year or better earnings growth" was the mantra.
   Jeffrey Pfeffer, professor of organizational behavior at Stanford
   University, observes how the belief that "stock price is all that
   matters" has been hardwired into the corporate psyche. It
   dictates not only how people judge the worth of their company
   but also how they feel about themselves and the work that
   they are doing. And, over time, it has clouded judgments about
   what is acceptable corporate behavior.15

           Managing by Numbers: The Sears Auto Center
           Story
           If winning is the most important thing in your
           life, then you must be prepared to do anything
           to win.
           --Michael Josephson

           with winners. As humans, our desire to associate
           with those who have status provides plenty of

incentive to glorify winners and ignore losers.
But if an individual, a team, or a company does
whatever it takes to win, then all other values
are thrown out in the goal to win at all costs. The
desire of some people within Sears & Roebuck
Company's auto repair division to win by gaining
higher profits resulted in the situation portrayed
here.

Sears Roebuck & Company has been a fixture in
American retailing throughout the twentieth
century. At one time, people in rural America
could order virtually anything (including a house)
from Sears. Not without some accuracy, the
company billed itself as "the place where
Americans shop." But in 1992, Sears was charged
by California authorities with gross and
deliberate fraud in many of its auto centers.

The authorities were alerted by a 50 percent
increase in consumer complaints over a three-
year period. New Jersey's division of consumer
affairs also investigated Sears Auto Centers and
found that all six visited by investigators had
recommended unnecessary repairs. California's
department of consumer affairs found that Sears
210 | CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND BUSINESS
ETHICS

       had systematically overcharged by an average of
       $223 for repairs and routinely billed for work that
       was not done. Sears Auto Centers were the
       largest providers of auto repair services in the
       state.

       The scam was a variant on the old bait-and-
       switch routine. Customers received coupons in
       the mail inviting them to take advantage of hefty
       discounts on brake jobs. When customers came
       in to redeem their coupons, sales staffers would
       convince them to authorize additional repairs. As
       a management tool, Sears had also established
       quotas for each of their sales representatives to
       meet.

       Ultimately, California got Sears to settle a large
       number of lawsuits against it by threatening to
       revoke Sears' auto repair license. Sears agreed to
       distribute $50 coupons to nearly a million
       customers nationwide who had obtained certain
       services between August 1, 1990, and January 31,
       1992. Sears also agreed to pay $3.5 million to
       cover the costs of various government
       investigations and to contribute $1.5 million
       annually to conduct auto mechanic training
                  CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND BUSINESS
                                                                            ETHICS | 211

       programs. It also agreed to abandon its repair
       service quotas. The entire settlement cost Sears
       $30 million. Sears Auto Center sales also dropped
       about 15 to 20 percent after news of the scandal
       broke.

Note that in boosting sales by performing unnecessary
services, Sears suffered very bad publicity. Losses were
incalculable. The short-term gains were easy to measure; long-
term consequences seldom are. The case illustrates a number
of important lessons:

   People generally choose short-term gains over potential
      long-term losses.

   People often justify the harm to others as being minimal
      or "necessary" to achieve the desired sales quota or
      financial goal.

   In working as a group, we often form an "us versus
      them" mentality. In the Sears case, it is likely that Sears
      "insiders" looked at customers as "outsiders," effectively
      treating them (in Kantian terms) as means rather than
      ends in themselves. In short, outsiders were used for the
      benefit of insiders.

   The long-term losses to Sears are difficult to quantify,
212 | CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND BUSINESS
ETHICS

      while the short-term gains were easy to measure and (at
      least for a brief while) quite satisfying financially.
   Sears' ongoing rip-offs were possible only because
      individual consumers lacked the relevant information
      about the service being offered. This lack of information
      is a market failure, since many consumers were
      demanding more of Sears Auto Center services than
      they would have (and at a higher price) if relevant
      information had been available to them earlier. Sears,
      like other sellers of goods and services, took advantage of
      a market system, which, in its ideal form, would not
      permit such information distortions.
   People in the organization probably thought that the
      actions they took were necessary.
   Noting this last point, we can assume that these key
      people were motivated by maximizing profits and had
      lost sight of other goals for the organization.

The emphasis on doing whatever is necessary to win is entirely
understandable, but it is not ethical. The temptation will
always exist--for individuals, companies, and nations--to
dominate or to win and to write the history of their actions in
a way that justifies or overlooks the harm that has been done.
In a way, this fits with the notion that "might makes right," or
that power is the ultimate measure of right and wrong.

       Conscious Capitalism

One effort to integrate the two viewpoints of stakeholder
theory and shareholder primacy is the conscious capitalism
movement. Companies that practice conscious capitalism16
embrace the idea that profit and prosperity can and must go
hand in hand with social justice and environmental
stewardship. They operate with a holistic or systems view. This
means that they understand that all stakeholders are connected
and interdependent. They reject false trade-offs between
stakeholder interests and strive for creative ways to achieve
win-win-win outcomes for all.17

   The "conscious business" has a purpose that goes beyond
maximizing profits. It is designed to maximize profits but is
focused more on its higher purpose and does not fixate solely
on the bottom line. To do so, it focuses on delivering value
to all its stakeholders, harmonizing as best it can the interests
of consumers, partners, investors, the community, and the
environment. This requires that company managers take a

"servant leadership" role, serving as stewards to the company's
deeper purpose and to the company's stakeholders.

   Conscious business leaders serve as such stewards, focusing
on fulfilling the company's purpose, delivering value to its
stakeholders, and facilitating a harmony of interests, rather
than on personal gain and self-aggrandizement. Why is this
refocusing needed? Within the standard profit-maximizing
model, corporations have long had to deal with the "agency
problem." Actions by top-level managers--acting on behalf
of the company--should align with the shareholders, but in
a culture all about winning and money, managers sometimes
act in ways that are self- aggrandizing and that do not serve
the interests of shareholders. Laws exist to limit such self-
aggrandizing, but the remedies are often too little and too late
and often catch only the most egregious overreaching. Having
a culture of servant leadership is a much better way to see that
a company's top management works to ensure a harmony of
interests.

5.4.5 Putting it All Together

To combine our discussion of ethics and stakeholders, the
following framework may be useful when approaching an
ethical problem.

       1. Identify stakeholders (those who influence the
            organization, and who are influenced by it) and

    their wishes
2. Identify alternative solutions to the problem
3. Apply an ethical framework

            a. Choose an ethical framework
            b. State what that framework entails

     After reading this chapter, you should be able to do

                commerce, and how the Supreme Court may
                sometimes limit that power.
           6. Describe how the Supreme Court, under the
                supremacy clause of the Constitution,
                balances state and federal laws that may be
                wholly or partly in conflict.
            7. Explain how the Bill of Rights relates to
                business activities in the United States.

  The US Constitution is the foundation for all of US law.1
  Business and commerce are directly affected by the words,
  meanings, and interpretations of the Constitution. Because it
  speaks in general terms, its provisions raise all kinds of issues
  for scholars, lawyers, judges, politicians, and commentators.

1. Although the common law preceded the Constitution, and remains
  in force, constitutional processes like creation of statutes may
  overrule the common law.

  For example, arguments still rage over the nature and meaning
  of "federalism," the concept that there is shared governance
  between the states and the federal government. The US
  Supreme Court is the ultimate arbiter of those disputes, and
  as such it has a unique role in the legal system. It has assumed
  the power of judicial review2, unique among federal systems
  globally, through which it can strike down federal or state
  statutes that it believes violate the Constitution and can even
  void the president's executive orders if they are contrary to
  the Constitution's language. No knowledgeable citizen or
  businessperson can afford to be ignorant of its basic
  provisions.

  Constitution means. Because the Constitution speaks in broad
  terms, the interpretations of the Supreme Court as to the meaning of
  its provisions define what the Constitution means. The

  interpretation by the Supreme Court.

         1. Describe the American values that are
             reflected in the US Constitution.

         2. Know what federalism means, along with

                                      unswerving allegiance is the
                                      Constitution. If you serve,
you are asked to "support and defend" the Constitution
"against all enemies, foreign and domestic." The oath usually
includes a statement that you swear that this oath is taken
freely, honestly, and without "any purpose of evasion." This
loyalty oath may be related to a time--fifty years ago--when
"un-American" activities were under investigation in Congress
and the press; the fear of communism (as antithetical to
                      CONSTITUTIONAL LAW AND US COMMERCE | 221

American values and principles) was paramount. As you look
at the Constitution and how it affects the legal environment
of business, please consider what basic values it may impart to
us and what makes it uniquely American and worth defending
"against all enemies, foreign and domestic."

   In Article I, the Constitution places the legislature first and
prescribes the ways in which representatives are elected to
public office. Article I balances influence in the federal
legislature between large states and small states by creating a
Senate in which the smaller states (by population) as well as
the larger states have two votes. In Article II, the Constitution
sets forth the powers and responsibilities of the branch--the
presidency--and makes it clear that the president should be
the commander in chief of the armed forces. Article II also
gives states rather than individuals (through the Electoral
College) a clear role in the election process. Article III creates
the federal judiciary, and the Bill of Rights, adopted in 1791,
makes clear that individual rights must be preserved against
activities of the federal government. In general, the idea of
rights is particularly strong.
222 | CONSTITUTIONAL LAW AND US COMMERCE

The Constitution itself

speaks of rights in fairly

general terms, and the

judicial interpretation of

various rights has been in

flux. The "right" of a person

to own another person was

no- tably affirmed by the      Lewis Hine, Adolescent Girl, a
                               Spinner, in a Carolina Cotton
Supreme Court in the Dred      Mill (1908)
Scott decision in 1857.3 The

"right" of a child to freely contract for long, tedious hours of

work was upheld by the court in Hammer v. Dagenhart in

1918. Both decisions were later repudiated, just as the decision

that a woman has a "right" to an abortion in the first trimester

of pregnancy could later be repudiated if Roe v. Wade is
overturned by the Supreme Court.4

3. In Scott v. Sanford (the Dred Scott decision), the court states that
  Scott should remain a slave, that as a slave he is not a citizen of the
  United States and thus not eligible to bring suit in a federal court,
  and that as a slave he is personal property and thus has never been
  free.

 6.1.2 General Structure of the
 Constitution

  Look at the Constitution. Notice that there are seven articles,
  starting with Article I (legislative powers), Article II (executive
  branch), and Article III (judiciary). Notice that there is no
  separate article for administrative agencies. The Constitution
  also declares that it is "the supreme Law of the Land" (Article
  VI). Following Article VII are the ten amendments adopted
  in 1791 that are referred to as the Bill of Rights. Notice also
  that in 1868, a new amendment, the Fourteenth, was adopted,
  requiring states to provide "due process" and "equal protection
  of the laws" to citizens of the United States. The Fourteenth
  Amendment is often considered the most important, as
  otherwise the rights guaranteed in the Constitution would
  apply to Congress alone, and not the states.5

 6.1.3 Federalism

  The partnership created in the Constitution between the states

5. That is, states would be free to, e.g., control speech and gun rights
  without considering the First or Second Amendments, subject to the
  restrictions in their respective state constitutions only.
   224 | CONSTITUTIONAL LAW AND US COMMERCE

  and the federal government is called federalism.6 In effect,
  federalism is the concept of shared governance between the
  states and the federal government.. The Constitution is a
  document created by the states in which certain powers are
  delegated to the national government, and other powers are
  reserved to the states. This is made explicit in the Tenth
  Amendment.

 6.1.4 Separation of Powers and
 Judicial Review

  Because the Founding Fathers wanted to ensure that no single
  branch of the government, especially the executive branch,
  would be ascendant over the others, they created various
  checks and balances to ensure that each of the three principal
  branches had ways to limit or modify the power of the others.
  This is known as the separation of powers.7 Thus the president
  retains veto power, but the House of Representatives is
  entrusted with the power to initiate spending bills.

6. The idea, built into the structure of the Constitution, that states and
  the federal government have concurrent powers

7. In the original design of the Constitution, the executive, legislative,
  and judicial branches were all given powers that could modify or
  limit the powers of the other branches of government. For example,
  the president wields a veto power over congressional legislation.
                      CONSTITUTIONAL LAW AND US COMMERCE | 225

   Power sharing was evident in the basic design of Congress,
the federal legislative branch. The basic power imbalance was
between the large states (with greater population) and the
smaller ones (such as Delaware). The smaller ones feared a loss
of sovereignty if they could be outvoted by the larger ones, so
the federal legislature was constructed to guarantee two Senate
seats for every state, no matter how small. The Senate was
also given great responsibility in ratifying treaties and judicial
nominations. The net effect of this today is that senators from
a very small number of states can block treaties and other
important legislation. The power of small states is also
magnified by the Senate's cloture rule, which currently
requires sixty out of one hundred senators to vote to bring a
bill to the floor for an up-or-down vote.

   Because the Constitution often speaks in general terms
(with broad phrases such as "due process" and "equal
protection"), reasonable people have disagreed as to how those
terms apply in specific cases. The United States is unique
among industrialized democracies in having a Supreme Court
that reserves for itself that exclusive power to interpret what
the Constitution means. The famous case of Marbury v.
Madison began that tradition in 1803, when the Supreme
Court had marginal importance in the new republic. The
decision in Bush v. Gore, decided in December of 2000,
illustrates the power of the court to shape our destiny as a
nation. In that case, the court overturned a ruling by the
Florida Supreme Court regarding the way to proceed on a
226 | CONSTITUTIONAL LAW AND US COMMERCE

recount of the Florida vote for the presidency. The court's
ruling was purportedly based on the "equal protection of the
laws" provision in the Fourteenth Amendment.

                                         From Marbury to the
                                      present day, the Supreme
                                      Court has articulated the
                                      view that the US
                                      Constitution sets the
                                      framework for all other US
                                      laws, whether statutory or
                                      judicially created. Thus any
                                      statute (or portion thereof)
                                      or legal ruling (judicial or
                                      administrative) in conflict
with the Constitution is not enforceable. And as the Bush v.
Gore decision indicates, the states are not entirely free to do
what they might choose; their own sovereignty is limited by
their union with the other states in a federal sovereign.
   If the Supreme Court makes a "bad decision" as to what
the Constitution means, it is not easily overturned. Either the
court must change its mind (which it seldom does) or two-
thirds of Congress and three-fourths of the states must make
an amendment (Article V).
   Because the Supreme Court has this power of judicial
review, there have been many arguments about how it should
be exercised and what kind of "philosophy" a Supreme Court
justice should have. President Richard Nixon often said that
                      CONSTITUTIONAL LAW AND US COMMERCE | 227

a Supreme Court justice should "strictly construe" the
Constitution and not add to its language. Finding law in the
Constitution was "judicial activism" rather than "judicial
restraint." The general philosophy behind the call for "strict
constructionist" justices is that legislatures make laws in accord
with the wishes of the majority, and so unelected judges should
not make law according to their own views and values. Nixon
had in mind the 1960s Warren court, which "found" rights
in the Constitution that were not specifically mentioned--the
right of privacy, for example. In later years, critics of the
Rehnquist court would charge that it "found" rights that were
not specifically mentioned, such as the right of states to be free
from federal antidiscrimination laws. See, for example, Kimel
v. Florida Board of Regents, or the Citizens United v. Federal
Election Commission case below, which held that corporations
are "persons" with "free speech rights" that include spending
unlimited amounts of money in campaign donations and
political advocacy. Kimel v. Florida Board of Regents, 528 US
62 (2000).

   Because Roe v. Wade has been so controversial, this chapter
includes a seminal case on "the right of privacy," Griswold
v. Connecticut, below. Was the court correct in recognizing a
"right of privacy" in Griswold? This may not seem like a
"business case," but consider: the manufacture and
distribution of birth control devices is a highly profitable (and
legal) business in every US state. Moreover, Griswold illustrates
another important and much-debated concept in US
228 | CONSTITUTIONAL LAW AND US COMMERCE

constitutional law: substantive due process (see the subsection
"Fifth Amendment" below). The problem of judicial review
and its proper scope is brought into sharp focus in the
abortion controversy. Abortion became a lucrative service
business after Roe v. Wade was decided in 1973. That has
gradually changed, with state laws that have limited rather than
overruled Roe v. Wade and with persistent antiabortion
protests, killings of abortion doctors, and efforts to publicize
the human nature of the fetuses being aborted. The key here
is to understand that there is no explicit mention in the
Constitution of any right of privacy. As Justice Harry
Blackmun argued in his majority opinion in Roe v. Wade,

       The Constitution does not explicitly mention any
       right of privacy. In a line of decisions, however,
       the Court has recognized that a right of personal
       privacy or a guarantee of certain areas or zones
       of privacy, does exist under the Constitution.
       [T]hey also make it clear that the right has some
       extension to activities relating to marriage. . .
       procreation. . . contraception. . . family
       relationships. . . and child rearing and education..
       . . The right of privacy is broad enough to
       encompass a woman's decision whether or not
       to terminate her pregnancy.
                      CONSTITUTIONAL LAW AND US COMMERCE | 229

Similarly in more recent years, the Supreme Court in
Obergefell v. Hodges found a right to same-sex marriage within
the Constitution, striking provisions in many state
constitutions, based on the idea that banning same-sex
marriage violated the dignity of same-sex couples. The
Constitution says nothing directly about privacy, dignity,
family, or reproductive rights, yet the Supreme Court has used
the Constitution to protect these areas.

   In short, justices interpreting the Constitution wield quiet
yet enormous power through judicial review. In deciding that
the right of privacy applied to a woman's decision to abort in
the first trimester, or when deciding dignity rights protected
same-sex marriage, the Supreme Court did not act on the basis
of clear and unequivocal language in the Constitution, and it
made illegal any state or federal legislative or executive action
contrary to its interpretations. Only a constitutional
amendment or the court's repudiation of these cases as a
precedent could change that interpretation.

     Key Takeaway

     The Constitution gives voice to the idea that people
     have basic rights and that a civilian president is also
230 | CONSTITUTIONAL LAW AND US COMMERCE

     the commander in chief of the armed forces. It gives
     instructions as to how the various branches of
     government must share power and also tries to
     balance power between the states and the federal
     government. It does not expressly allow for judicial
     review, but the Supreme Court's ability to declare
     what laws are (or are not) constitutional has given
     the judicial branch a kind of power not seen in other
     industrialized democracies.

6.2 The Commerce Clause

     Learning Objectives

     After reading this section, you should be able to do
     the following:

         1. Name the specific clause through which
             Congress has the power to regulate
                          CONSTITUTIONAL LAW AND US COMMERCE | 231

                commerce. What, specifically, does this clause
                say?
            2. Explain how early decisions of the Supreme
                Court interpreted the scope of the commerce
                clause and how that impacted the legislative
                proposals and programs of Franklin Delano
                Roosevelt during the Great Depression.
            3. Describe both the wider use of the commerce
                clause from World War II through the 1990s
                and the limitations the Supreme Court
                imposed in Lopez and other cases.

  First, turn to Article I, Section 8. The commerce clause8 gives
  Congress the exclusive power to make laws relating to foreign
  trade and commerce and to commerce among the various
  states. Most of the federally created legal environment springs
  from this one clause: if Congress is not authorized in the
  Constitution to make certain laws, then it acts
  unconstitutionally and its actions may be ruled
  unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. Lately, the Supreme

8. Article I, Section 8, of the US Constitution is generally regarded as
  the legal authority by which the federal government can make law
  that governs commerce among the states and with foreign nations.
232 | CONSTITUTIONAL LAW AND US COMMERCE

Court has not been shy about ruling acts of Congress
unconstitutional.

   Here are the first five parts of Article I, Section 8, which
sets forth the powers of the federal legislature. The commerce
clause is in boldface. It is short, but most federal legislation
affecting business depends on this very clause:

   Section 8 [Clause 1] The Congress shall have Power To
lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the
Debts and provide for the common Defence and general
Welfare of the United States; but all Duties, Imposts and
Excises shall be uniform throughout the United States;

   [Clause 2] To borrow Money on the credit of the United
States;

   [Clause 3] To regulate Commerce with foreign
Nations, and among the several States, and with the
Indian Tribes;

   [Clause 4] To establish a uniform Rule of Naturalization,
and uniform Laws on the subject of Bankruptcies throughout
the United States;

   [Clause 5] To coin Money, regulate the Value thereof, and
of foreign Coin, and fix the Standard of Weights and Measures;
                      CONSTITUTIONAL LAW AND US COMMERCE | 233

        The Commerce Clause undergirds most federal
        regulation of the economy.

6.2.1 Early Commerce Clause Cases

For many years, the Supreme Court was very strict in applying
the commerce clause: Congress could only use it to legislate
aspects of the movement of goods from one state to another.
Anything else was deemed local rather than national. For
example, In Hammer v. Dagenhart, decided in 1918, a 1916
federal statute had barred transportation in interstate
commerce of goods produced in mines or factories employing
children under fourteen or employing children fourteen and
above for more than eight hours a day. A complaint was filed
in the US District Court for the Western District of North
Carolina by a father in his own behalf and on behalf of his two
minor sons, one under the age of fourteen years and the other
between fourteen and sixteen years, who were employees in a
   234 | CONSTITUTIONAL LAW AND US COMMERCE

  cotton mill in Charlotte, North Carolina. The father's lawsuit
  asked the court to enjoin (block) the enforcement of the act
  of Congress intended to prevent interstate commerce in the
  products of child labor.

     The Supreme Court saw the issue as whether Congress had
  the power under the commerce clause to control interstate
  shipment of goods made by children under the age of fourteen.
  The court found that Congress did not. The court cited several
  cases that had considered what interstate commerce could be
  constitutionally regulated by Congress. In Hipolite Egg Co. v.
  United States, the Supreme Court had sustained the power
  of Congress to pass the Pure Food and Drug Act, which
  prohibited the introduction into the states by means of
  interstate commerce impure foods and drugs.9 In Hoke v.
  United States, the Supreme Court had sustained the
  constitutionality of the so-called White Slave Traffic Act of
  1910, whereby the transportation of a woman in interstate
  commerce for the purpose of prostitution was forbidden. In
  that case, the court said that Congress had the power to protect
  the channels of interstate commerce: "If the facility of
  interstate transportation can be taken away from the
  demoralization of lotteries, the debasement of obscene
  literature, the contagion of diseased cattle or persons, the
  impurity of food and drugs, the like facility can be taken away

9. Hipolite Egg Co. v. United States, 220 US 45 (1911).
                           CONSTITUTIONAL LAW AND US COMMERCE | 235

   from the systematic enticement to, and the enslavement in
   prostitution and debauchery of women, and, more insistently,
   of girls."10

      In each of those instances, the Supreme Court said, "[T]he
   use of interstate transportation was necessary to the
   accomplishment of harmful results." In other words, although
   the power over interstate transportation was to regulate, that
   could only be accomplished by prohibiting the use of the
   facilities of interstate commerce to effect the evil intended. But
   in Hammer v. Dagenhart, that essential element was lacking.
   The law passed by Congress aimed to standardize among all
   the states the ages at which children could be employed in
   mining and manufacturing, while the goods themselves are
   harmless. Once the labor is done and the articles have left
   the factory, the "labor of their production is over, and the
   mere fact that they were intended for interstate commerce
   transportation does not make their production subject to
   federal control under the commerce power."

10. Hoke v. United States, 227 US 308 (1913).
236 | CONSTITUTIONAL LAW AND US COMMERCE

                                      In short, the early use of the
                                      commerce clause was
                                      limited to the movement of
                                      physical goods between
                                      states. Just because
                                      something might enter the
channels of interstate commerce later on does not make it a fit
subject for national regulation. The production of articles
intended for interstate commerce is a matter of local
regulation. The court therefore upheld the result from the
district and circuit court of appeals; the application of the
federal law was enjoined. Goods produced by children under
the age of fourteen could be shipped anywhere in the United
States without violating the federal law.

6.2.2 From the New Deal to the New
Frontier and the Great Society:
1930s-1970

During the global depression of the 1930s, the US economy
saw jobless rates of a third of all workers, and President
Roosevelt's New Deal program required more active federal
legislation. Included in the New Deal program was the
recognition of a "right" to form labor unions without undue
interference from employers. Congress created the National
Labor Relations Board (NLRB) in 1935 to investigate and to
enjoin employer practices that violated this right.
                      CONSTITUTIONAL LAW AND US COMMERCE | 237

   In NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corporation, a union
dispute with management at a large steel-producing facility
near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, became a court case. In this
case, the NLRB had charged the Jones & Laughlin Steel
Corporation with discriminating against employees who were
union members. The company's position was that the law
authorizing the NLRB was unconstitutional, exceeding
Congress's powers. The court held that the act was narrowly
constructed so as to regulate industrial activities that had the
potential to restrict interstate commerce. The earlier decisions
under the commerce clause to the effect that labor relations
had only an indirect effect on commerce were effectively
reversed. Since the ability of employees to engage in collective
bargaining (one activity protected by the act) is "an essential
condition of industrial peace," the national government was
justified in penalizing corporations engaging in interstate
commerce that "refuse to confer and negotiate" with their
workers. This was, however, a close decision, and the switch of
one justice made this ruling possible. Without this switch, the
New Deal agenda would have been effectively derailed.

6.2.3 The Substantial Effects
Doctrine: World War II to the 1990s

Subsequent to NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corporation,
Congress and the courts generally accepted that even modest
impacts on interstate commerce were "reachable" by federal
     238 | CONSTITUTIONAL LAW AND US COMMERCE

   legislation. For example, the case of Wickard v. Filburn, from
   1942, represents a fairly long reach for Congress in regulating
   what appear to be very local economic decisions.

      Wickard established that "substantial effects" in interstate
   commerce could be very local indeed! But commerce clause
   challenges to federal legislation continued. In the 1960s, the
   Civil Rights Act of 1964 was challenged on the ground that
   Congress lacked the power under the commerce clause to
   regulate what was otherwise fairly local conduct. For example,
   Title II of the act prohibited racial discrimination in public
   accommodations (such as hotels, motels, and restaurants),
   leading to the famous case of Katzenbach v. McClung (1964).

      Ollie McClung's barbeque place in Birmingham, Alabama,
   allowed "colored" people to buy takeout at the back of the
   restaurant but not to sit down with "white" folks inside. The
   US attorney sought a court order to require Ollie to serve
   all races and colors, but Ollie resisted on commerce clause
   grounds: the federal government had no business regulating
   a purely local establishment. Indeed, Ollie did not advertise
   nationally, or even regionally, and had customers only from
   the local area. But the court found that some 42 percent of
   the supplies for Ollie's restaurant had moved in the channels
   of interstate commerce. This was enough to sustain federal
   regulation based on the commerce clause.11

11. Katzenbach v. McClung, 379 US 294 (1964).
                      CONSTITUTIONAL LAW AND US COMMERCE | 239

   For nearly thirty years following, it was widely assumed that
Congress could almost always find some interstate commerce
connection for any law it might pass. It thus came as something
of a shock in 1995 when the Rehnquist court decided U.S.
v. Lopez. Lopez had been convicted under a federal law that
prohibited possession of firearms within 1,000 feet of a school.
The law was part of a twenty-year trend (roughly 1970 to
1990) for senators and congressmen to pass laws that were
tough on crime. Lopez's lawyer admitted that Lopez had had
a gun within 1,000 feet of a San Antonio school yard but
challenged the law itself, arguing that Congress exceeded its
authority under the commerce clause in passing this
legislation. The US government's Solicitor General argued on
behalf of the Department of Justice to the Supreme Court
that Congress was within its constitutional rights under the
commerce clause because education of the future workforce
was the foundation for a sound economy and because guns at
or near school yards detracted from students' education. The
court rejected this analysis, noting that with the government's
analysis, an interstate commerce connection could be conjured
from almost anything. Lopez went free because the law itself
was unconstitutional, according to the court.
240 | CONSTITUTIONAL LAW AND US COMMERCE

Congress made no attempt
to pass similar legislation
after the case was decided.
But in passing subsequent
legislation, Congress was
often careful to make a
record as to why it believed it was addressing a problem that
related to interstate commerce. In 1994, Congress passed the
Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), having held hearings
to establish why violence against women on a local level would
impair interstate commerce. In 1994, while enrolled at Virginia
Polytechnic Institute (Virginia Tech), Christy Brzonkala
alleged that Antonio Morrison and James Crawford, both
students and varsity football players at Virginia Tech, had
raped her. In 1995, Brzonkala filed a complaint against
Morrison and Crawford under Virginia Tech's sexual assault
policy. After a hearing, Morrison was found guilty of sexual
assault and sentenced to immediate suspension for two
semesters. Crawford was not punished. A second hearing again
found Morrison guilty. After an appeal through the
university's administrative system, Morrison's punishment
was set aside, as it was found to be "excessive." Ultimately,
Brzonkala dropped out of the university. Brzonkala then sued
Morrison, Crawford, and Virginia Tech in federal district
court, alleging that Morrison's and Crawford's attack violated
42 USC Section 13981, part of the VAWA, which provides a
federal civil remedy for the victims of gender-motivated
                      CONSTITUTIONAL LAW AND US COMMERCE | 241

violence. Morrison and Crawford moved to dismiss
Brzonkala's suit on the ground that Section 13981's civil
remedy was unconstitutional. In dismissing the complaint, the
district court found that that Congress lacked authority to
enact Section 13981 under either the commerce clause or the
Fourteenth Amendment, which Congress had explicitly
identified as the sources of federal authority for the VAWA.
Ultimately, the court of appeals affirmed, as did the Supreme
Court.

   The Supreme Court held that Congress lacked the
authority to enact a statute under the commerce clause or the
Fourteenth Amendment because the statute did not regulate
an activity that substantially affected interstate commerce nor
did it redress harm caused by the state. Chief Justice William
H. Rehnquist wrote for the court that "under our federal
system that remedy must be provided by the Commonwealth
of Virginia, and not by the United States." Dissenting, Justice
Stephen G. Breyer argued that the majority opinion "illustrates
the difficulty of finding a workable judicial Commerce Clause
touchstone." Justice David H. Souter, dissenting, noted that
VAWA contained a "mountain of data assembled by Congress
. . . showing the effects of violence against women on interstate
commerce."

   The absence of a workable judicial commerce clause
touchstone remains. In 1996, California voters passed the
Compassionate Use Act, legalizing marijuana for medical use.
California's law conflicted with the federal Controlled
242 | CONSTITUTIONAL LAW AND US COMMERCE

Substances Act (CSA), which banned possession of marijuana.
After the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) seized
doctor-prescribed marijuana from a patient's home, a group
of medical marijuana users sued the DEA and US Attorney
General John Ashcroft in federal district court.

The medical marijuana users argued that the CSA--which
Congress passed using its constitutional power to regulate
interstate commerce--exceeded Congress's commerce clause
power. The district court ruled against the group, but the
Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed and ruled the CSA
unconstitutional because it applied to medical marijuana use
solely within one state. In doing so, the Ninth Circuit relied
on U.S. v. Lopez (1995) and U.S. v. Morrison (2000) to say
that using medical marijuana did not "substantially affect"
interstate commerce and therefore could not be regulated by
Congress.

   But by a 6-3 majority, the Supreme Court held that the
commerce clause gave Congress authority to prohibit the local
cultivation and use of marijuana, despite state law to the
contrary. Justice John Paul Stevens argued that the court's
precedents established Congress's commerce clause power to
regulate purely local activities that are part of a "class of
activities" with a substantial effect on interstate commerce.
The majority argued that Congress could ban local marijuana
use because it was part of such a class of activities: the national
marijuana market. Local use affected supply and demand in
                      CONSTITUTIONAL LAW AND US COMMERCE | 243

the national marijuana market, making the regulation of
intrastate use "essential" to regulating the drug's national
market.

   Notice how similar this reasoning is to the court's earlier
reasoning in Wickard v. Filburn. In contrast, the court's
conservative wing was adamant that federal power had been
exceeded. Justice Clarence Thomas's dissent in Gonzalez v.
Raich stated that Raich's local cultivation and consumption of
marijuana was not "Commerce . . . among the several States."
Representing the "originalist" view that the Constitution
should mostly mean what the Founders meant it to mean,
he also said that in the early days of the republic, it would
have been unthinkable that Congress could prohibit the local
cultivation, possession, and consumption of marijuana.

     Key Takeaway

     The commerce clause is the basis on which the
     federal government regulates interstate economic
     activity. The phrase "interstate commerce" has been
     subject to differing interpretations by the Supreme
     Court over the past one hundred years. There are
     certain matters that are essentially local or
244 | CONSTITUTIONAL LAW AND US COMMERCE

     intrastate, but the range of federal involvement in
     local matters is still considerable.

6.3 Dormant Commerce Clause

     Learning Objectives

     After reading this section, you should be able to do
     the following:

         1. Understand that when Congress does not
             exercise its powers under the commerce
             clause, the Supreme Court may still limit state
             legislation that discriminates against
             interstate commerce or places an undue
             burden on interstate commerce.

         2. Distinguish between "discrimination"
             dormant-commerce-clause cases and "undue
             burden" dormant-commerce-clause cases.
                           CONSTITUTIONAL LAW AND US COMMERCE | 245

   Congress has the power to legislate under the commerce clause
   and often does legislate. For example, Congress might say that
   trucks moving on interstate highways must not be more than
   seventy feet in length. But if Congress does not exercise its
   powers and regulate in certain areas (such as the size and length
   of trucks on interstate highways), states may make their own
   rules. States may do so under the so-called historic police
   powers of states that were never yielded up to the federal
   government.

      These police powers can be broadly exercised by states for
   purposes of health, education, welfare, safety, morals, and the
   environment. But the Supreme Court has reserved for itself
   the power to determine when state action is excessive, even
   when Congress has not used the commerce clause to regulate.
   This power is claimed to exist in the dormant commerce
   clause.12

      There are two ways that a state may violate the dormant
   commerce clause. If a state passes a law that is an "undue
   burden" on interstate commerce or that "discriminates"
   against interstate commerce, it will be struck down. Kassel
   v. Consolidated Freightways, in "Summary and Exercises", is

12. Even when the federal government does not act to make rules to
    govern matters of interstate commerce, the states may (using their
    police powers), but they may not do so in ways that unduly burden
    or discriminate against interstate commerce.
     246 | CONSTITUTIONAL LAW AND US COMMERCE

   an example of a case where Iowa imposed an undue burden
   on interstate commerce by prohibiting double trailers on its
   highways.13 Iowa's prohibition was judicially declared void
   when the Supreme Court judged it to be an undue burden.

      Discrimination cases pose a different standard. The court
   has been fairly inflexible here: if one state discriminates in its
   treatment of any article of commerce based on its state of
   origin, the court will strike down the law. For example, in
   Oregon Waste Systems v. Department of Environmental
   Quality, the state wanted to place a slightly higher charge on
   waste coming from out of state.14 The state's reasoning was
   that in-state residents had already contributed to roads and
   other infrastructure and that tipping fees at waste facilities
   should reflect the prior contributions of in-state companies
   and residents. Out-of-state waste handlers who wanted to use
   Oregon landfills objected and won their dormant commerce
   clause claim that Oregon's law discriminated "on its face"
   against interstate commerce. Under the Supreme Court's
   rulings, anything that moves in channels of interstate
   commerce is "commerce," even if someone is paying to get rid
   of something instead of buying something.

                                             Thus the states are bound
                                          by Supreme Court decisions
                                          under the dormant
                                          commerce clause to do
                                          nothing that differentiates
                                          between articles of
   commerce that originate from within the state from those that
   originate elsewhere. If Michigan were to let counties decide for
   themselves whether to take garbage from outside of the county
   or not, this could also be a discrimination based on a place of
   origin outside the state. (Suppose, for instance, each county
   were to decide not to take waste from outside the county; then
   all Michigan counties would effectively be excluding waste
   from outside of Michigan, which is discriminatory.)15
      The Supreme Court probably would uphold any solid waste
   requirements that did not differentiate on the basis of origin.
   If, for example, all waste had to be inspected for specific
   hazards, then the law would apply equally to in-state and out-
   of-state garbage. Because this is the dormant commerce clause,
   Congress could still act (i.e., it could use its broad commerce
   clause powers) to say that states are free to keep out-of-state
   waste from coming into their own borders. But Congress has
   declined to do so.

15. Fort Gratiot Sanitary Landfill v. Michigan Dep't of Natural
    Resources, 504 US 353 (1992).
248 | CONSTITUTIONAL LAW AND US COMMERCE

     Key Takeaway

     Where Congress does not act pursuant to its
     commerce clause powers, the states are free to
     legislate on matters of commerce under their historic
     police powers. However, the Supreme Court has set
     limits on such powers. Specifically, states may not
     impose undue burdens on interstate commerce and
     may not discriminate against articles in interstate
     commerce.

6.4 Preemption: The Supremacy
Clause

     Learning Objectives
                      CONSTITUTIONAL LAW AND US COMMERCE | 249

     After reading this section, you should be able to do
     the following:

         1. Understand the role of the supremacy clause
             in the balance between state and federal
             power.

         2. Give examples of cases where state legislation
             is preempted by federal law and cases where
             state legislation is not preempted by federal
             law.

When Congress does use its power under the commerce
clause, it can expressly state that it wishes to have exclusive
regulatory authority. For example, when Congress determined
in the 1950s to promote nuclear power ("atoms for peace"),
it set up the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and provided
a limitation of liability for nuclear power plants in case of a
nuclear accident. The states were expressly told to stay out
of the business of regulating nuclear power or the movement
of nuclear materials. Thus Rochester, Minnesota, or Berkeley,
California, could declare itself a nuclear-free zone, but the
federal government would have preempted such legislation. If
Michigan wished to set safety standards at Detroit Edison's
Fermi II nuclear reactor that were more stringent than the
250 | CONSTITUTIONAL LAW AND US COMMERCE

federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission's standards,
Michigan's standards would be preempted and thus be void.

Even where Congress does not expressly preempt state action,
such action may be impliedly pre-empted. States cannot
constitutionally pass laws that interfere with the
accomplishment of the purposes of the federal law. Suppose,
for example, that Congress passes a comprehensive law that
sets standards for foreign vessels to enter the navigable waters
and ports of the United States. If a state creates a law that sets
standards that conflict with the federal law or sets standards so
burdensome that they interfere with federal law, the doctrine
of preemption will (in accordance with the supremacy clause)
void the state law or whatever parts of it are inconsistent with
federal law.

   But Congress can allow what might appear to be
inconsistencies; the existence of federal statutory standards
does not always mean that local and state standards cannot be
more stringent. If California wants cleaner air or water than
other states, it can set stricter standards--nothing in the Clean
Water Act or Clean Air Act forbids the state from setting
stricter pollution standards. As the auto industry well knows,
California has set stricter standards for auto emissions. Since
the 1980s, most automakers have made both a federal car and
a California car, because federal Clean Air Act emissions
restrictions do not preempt more rigorous state standards.

   Large industries and companies actually prefer regulation at
                           CONSTITUTIONAL LAW AND US COMMERCE | 251

   the national level. It is easier for a large company or industry
   association to lobby in Washington, DC, than to lobby in
   fifty different states. Accordingly, industry often asks Congress
   to put preemptive language into its statutes. The tobacco
   industry is a case in point.

      The cigarette warning legislation of the 1960s (where the
   federal government required warning labels on cigarette
   packages) effectively preempted state negligence claims based
   on failure to warn. When the family of a lifetime smoker who
   had died sued in New Jersey court, one cause of action was the
   company's failure to warn of the dangers of its product. The
   Supreme Court reversed the jury's award based on the federal
   preemption of failure to warn claims under state law.16

           The Supremacy Clause
           Article VI
           This Constitution, and the Laws of the United
           States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof;
           and all Treaties made, or which shall be made,
           under the Authority of the United States, shall
           be the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges
           in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing

16. Cippolone v. Liggett Group, 505 US 504 (1993).
     252 | CONSTITUTIONAL LAW AND US COMMERCE

           in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the
           Contrary notwithstanding.

   The preemption17 doctrine derives from the supremacy clause
   of the Constitution, which states that the "Constitution and
   the Laws of the United States. . . shall be the supreme Law
   of the Land . . . any Thing in the Constitutions or Laws of
   any State to the Contrary notwithstanding." This means of
   course, that any federal law--even a regulation of a federal
   agency--would control over any conflicting state law.

      Preemption can be either express or implied. When
   Congress chooses to expressly preempt state law, the only
   question for courts becomes determining whether the
   challenged state law is one that the federal law is intended to
   preempt. Implied preemption presents more difficult issues.
   The court has to look beyond the express language of federal
   statutes to determine whether Congress has "occupied the
   field" in which the state is attempting to regulate, or whether

17. Based on the supremacy clause, the preemption doctrine holds that
    state and federal laws that conflict must yield to the superior law,
    which is federal law.
                      CONSTITUTIONAL LAW AND US COMMERCE | 253

a state law directly conflicts with federal law, or whether
enforcement of the state law might frustrate federal purposes.

   Federal "occupation of the field" occurs, according to the
court in Pennsylvania v. Nelson (1956), when there is "no
room" left for state regulation. Courts are to look to the
pervasiveness of the federal scheme of regulation, the federal
interest at stake, and the danger of frustration of federal goals
in making the determination as to whether a challenged state
law can stand.

   In Silkwood v. Kerr-McGee (1984), the court, voting 5-4,
found that a $10 million punitive damages award (in a case
litigated by famed attorney Gerry Spence) against a nuclear
power plant was not impliedly preempted by federal law. Even
though the court had recently held that state regulation of the
safety aspects of a federally licensed nuclear power plant was
preempted, the court drew a different conclusion with respect
to Congress's desire to displace state tort law--even though
the tort actions might be premised on a violation of federal
safety regulations.

   Federal preemption also explains much of the law one
encounters in everyday life, such as in the grocery store. For
example, often students who have studied some consumer law
note that many juices are labeled "100% Juice" yet contain
some added ingredients, such as citric acid. Here, state-based
false advertising laws attorneys might bring to attack these
     254 | CONSTITUTIONAL LAW AND US COMMERCE

   claims have been preempted by FDA regulations, which
   regulates the term "100%".18

         Key Takeaway

         In cases of conflicts between state and federal law,
         federal law will preempt (or control) state law
         because of the supremacy clause. Preemption can be
         express or implied. In cases where preemption is
         implied, the court usually finds that compliance with
         both state and federal law is not possible or that a
         federal regulatory scheme is comprehensive (i.e.,
         "occupies the field") and should not be modified by
         state actions.

6.5 Business and the Bill of
Rights

     Learning Objectives

     After reading this section, you should be able to do
     the following:

         1. Understand and describe which articles in the
             Bill of Rights apply to business activities and
             how they apply.

         2. Explain the application of the Fourteenth
             Amendment--including the due process
             clause and the equal protection clause--to
             various rights enumerated in the original Bill
             of Rights.

We have already seen the Fourteenth Amendment's
application in our chapter on civil procedure, where we saw
how due process limited the locations in which one could sue a
defendant. The Bill of Rights (the first ten amendments to the
Constitution) was originally meant to apply to federal actions
256 | CONSTITUTIONAL LAW AND US COMMERCE

only. During the twentieth century, the court began to apply
selected rights to state action as well. So, for example, federal
agents were prohibited from using evidence seized in violation
of the Fourth Amendment, but state agents were not, until
Mapp v. Ohio (1960), when the court applied the guarantees
(rights) of the Fourth Amendment to state action as well. In
this and in similar cases, the Fourteenth Amendment's due
process clause was the basis for the court's action. The due
process clause commanded that states provide due process in
cases affecting the life, liberty, or property of US citizens, and
the court saw in this command certain "fundamental
guarantees" that states would have to observe. Over the years,
most of the important guarantees in the Bill of Rights came to
apply to state as well as federal action. The court refers to this
process as selective incorporation.

6.5.1 Here are some very basic
principles to remember:

 1. The guarantees of the Bill of Rights apply only to state
      and federal government action. They do not limit what a
      company or person in the private sector may do. For
      example, states may not impose censorship on the media
      or limit free speech in a way that offends the First
      Amendment, but your boss (in the private sector) may
      order you not to talk to the media.

 2. In some cases, a private company may be regarded as
                           CONSTITUTIONAL LAW AND US COMMERCE | 257

         participating in "state action." For example, a private
         defense contractor that gets 90 percent of its business
         from the federal government has been held to be public
         for purposes of enforcing the constitutional right to free
         speech (the company had a rule barring its employees
         from speaking out in public against its corporate
         position). It has even been argued that public regulation
         of private activity is sufficient to convert the private into
         public activity, thus subjecting it to the requirements of
         due process. But the Supreme Court rejected this
         extreme view in 1974 when it refused to require private
         power companies, regulated by the state, to give
         customers a hearing before cutting off electricity for
         failure to pay the bill.19
     3. States have rights, too. While "states rights" was a battle
         cry of Southern states before the Civil War, the question
         of what balance to strike between state sovereignty and
         federal union has never been simple.

  6.5.2 First Amendment

   In part, the First Amendment states that "Congress shall make
   no law. . . abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press."
   The Founding Fathers believed that democracy would work

19. Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison Co., 419 US 345 (1974).
258 | CONSTITUTIONAL LAW AND US COMMERCE

best if people (and the press) could talk or write freely, without
governmental interference. But the First Amendment was also
not intended to be as absolute as it sounded. Oliver Wendell
Holmes's famous dictum that the law does not permit you to
shout "Fire!" in a crowded theater has seldom been answered,
"But why not?" And no one in 1789 thought that defamation
laws (torts for slander and libel) had been made
unconstitutional. Moreover, because the apparent purpose of
the First Amendment was to make sure that the nation had
a continuing, vigorous debate over matters political, political
speech has been given the highest level of protection over such
other forms of speech as (1) "commercial speech," (2) speech
that can and should be limited by reasonable "time, place, and
manner" restrictions, or (3) obscene speech.

   Because of its higher level of protection, political speech
can be false, malicious, mean-spirited, or even a pack of lies.
A public official in the United States must be prepared to
withstand all kinds of false accusations and cannot succeed in
an action for defamation unless the defendant has acted with
"malice" and "reckless disregard" of the truth. Public figures,
such as CEOs of the largest US banks, must also be prepared to
withstand accusations that are false. In any defamation action,
truth is a defense, but a defamation action brought by a public
figure or public official must prove that the defendant not only
has his facts wrong but also lies to the public in a malicious
way with reckless disregard of the truth. Celebrities have the
same burden to go forward with a defamation action. It is for
                           CONSTITUTIONAL LAW AND US COMMERCE | 259

   this reason that the National Enquirer writes exclusively about
   public figures, public officials, and celebrities; it is possible to
   say many things that aren't completely true and still have the
   protection of the First Amendment.

      Political speech is so highly protected that the court has
   recognized the right of people to support political candidates
   through campaign contributions and thus promote the
   particular viewpoints and speech of those candidates. Fearing
   the influence of money on politics, Congress has from time to
   time placed limitations on corporate contributions to political
   campaigns. But the Supreme Court has had mixed reactions
   over time. Initially, the court recognized the First Amendment
   right of a corporation to donate money, subject to certain
   limits.20 In another case, Austin v. Michigan Chamber of
   Commerce (1990), the Michigan Campaign Finance Act
   prohibited corporations from using treasury money for
   independent expenditures to support or oppose candidates in
   elections for state offices. But a corporation could make such
   expenditures if it set up an independent fund designated solely
   for political purposes. The law was passed on the assumption
   that "the unique legal and economic characteristics of
   corporations necessitate some regulation of their political
   expenditures to avoid corruption or the appearance of
   corruption."

20. Buckley v. Valeo, 424 US 1 (1976).
260 | CONSTITUTIONAL LAW AND US COMMERCE

   The Michigan Chamber of Commerce wanted to support
a candidate for Michigan's House of Representatives by using
general funds to sponsor a newspaper advertisement and
argued that as a nonprofit organization, it was not really like
a business firm. The court disagreed and upheld the Michigan
law. Justice Marshall found that the chamber was akin to a
business group, given its activities, linkages with community
business leaders, and high percentage of members (over 75
percent) that were business corporations. Furthermore, Justice
Marshall found that the statute was narrowly crafted and
implemented to achieve the important goal of maintaining
integrity in the political process. But as you will see in Citizens
United v. Federal Election Commission (below), Austin was
overruled; corporations are recognized as "persons" with First
Amendment political speech rights that cannot be impaired by
Congress or the states without some compelling governmental
interest with restrictions on those rights that are "narrowly
tailored."

6.5.3 Fourth Amendment

                                      The Fourth Amendment
                                      says, "all persons shall be
                                      secure in their persons,
                                      houses, pa- pers, and effects
                                      from unreasonable searches
                                      and seizures, and no
                      CONSTITUTIONAL LAW AND US COMMERCE | 261

warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, before a
magistrate and upon Oath, specifically describing the persons
to be searched and places to be seized."

   The court has read the Fourth Amendment to prohibit only
those government searches or seizures that are "unreasonable."
Because of this, businesses that are in an industry that is
"closely regulated" can be searched more frequently and can be
searched without a warrant. In one case, an auto parts dealer
at a junkyard was charged with receiving stolen auto parts.
Part of his defense was to claim that the search that found
incriminating evidence was unconstitutional. But the court
found the search reasonable, because the dealer was in a
"closely regulated industry."

   In the 1980s, Dow Chemical objected to an overflight by
the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The EPA
had rented an airplane to fly over the Midland, Michigan, Dow
plant, using an aerial mapping camera to photograph various
pipes, ponds, and machinery that were not covered by a roof.
Because the court's precedents allowed governmental
intrusions into "open fields," the EPA search was ruled
constitutional. Because the literal language of the Fourth
Amendment protected "persons, houses, papers, and effects,"
anything searched by the government in "open fields" was
reasonable. (The court's opinion suggested that if Dow had
really wanted privacy from governmental intrusion, it could
have covered the pipes and machinery that were otherwise
outside and in open fields.)
     262 | CONSTITUTIONAL LAW AND US COMMERCE

      Note again that constitutional guarantees like the Fourth
   Amendment apply to governmental action. Your employer or
   any private enterprise is not bound by constitutional limits.
   For example, if drug testing of all employees every week is
   done by government agency, the employees may have a cause of
   action to object based on the Fourth Amendment. However,
   if a private employer begins the same kind of routine drug
   testing, employees have no constitutional arguments to make;
   they can simply leave that employer, or they may pursue
   whatever statutory or common-law remedies are available.

  6.5.4 Fifth Amendment

   The Fifth Amendment states, "No person shall be. . . deprived
   of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor
   shall private property be taken for public use, without just
   compensation."

      The Fifth Amendment has three principal aspects:
   procedural due process21, the takings clause22, and substantive

21. In matters of civil or criminal procedure, the Constitution requires
    that both states and the federal government provide fair process (or
    due process) to all parties, especially defendants who are accused of a
    crime or, in a civil case, defendants who are served with a summons
    and complaint in a state other than their residence.

22. In the Fifth Amendment, the government is required to provide
                           CONSTITUTIONAL LAW AND US COMMERCE | 263

   due process23. In terms of procedural due process, the
   amendment prevents government from arbitrarily taking the
   life of a criminal defendant. In civil lawsuits, it is also
   constitutionally essential that the proceedings be fair.

      The takings clause of the Fifth Amendment ensures that
   the government does not take private property without just
   compensation. In the international setting, governments that
   take private property engage in what is called expropriation.
   The standard under customary international law is that when
   governments do that, they must provide prompt, adequate,
   and effective compensation. This does not always happen,
   especially where foreign owners' property is being
   expropriated. The guarantees of the Fifth Amendment
   (incorporated against state action by the Fourteenth
   Amendment) are available to property owners where state,
   county, or municipal government uses the power of eminent
   domain to take private property for public purposes. Just what
   is a public purpose is a matter of some debate. For example,

    compensation to the owner for any taking of private property. The
    same requirement is imposed on states through the due process
    clause of the Fourteenth Amendment (under selective
    incorporation).
23. A doctrine of the Supreme Court that negated numerous laws in the
    first third of the 20th century. Its use in the past 80 years is greatly
    diminished, but it survives in terms of protecting substantive
    liberties not otherwise enumerated in the Constitution.
     264 | CONSTITUTIONAL LAW AND US COMMERCE

   if a city were to condemn economically viable businesses or
   neighborhoods to construct a baseball stadium with public
   money to entice a private enterprise (the baseball team) to stay,
   is a public purpose being served?

      In Kelo v. City of New London, Mrs. Kelo and other
   residents fought the city of New London, in its attempt to
   use powers of eminent domain to create an industrial park and
   recreation area that would have Pfizer & Co. as a principal
   tenant.24 The city argued that increasing its tax base was a
   sufficient public purpose. In a very close decision, the Supreme
   Court determined that New London's actions did not violate
   the takings clause. However, political reactions in various
   states resulted in a great deal of new state legislation that would
   limit the scope of public purpose in eminent domain takings
   and provide additional compensation to property owners in
   many cases.

      In addition to the takings clause and aspects of procedural
   due process, the Fifth Amendment is also the source of what
   is called substantive due process. During the first third of the
   twentieth century, the Supreme Court often nullified state and
   federal laws using substantive due process. In 1905, for
   example, in Lochner v. New York, the Supreme Court voided
   a New York statute that limited the number of hours that
   bakers could work in a single week. New York had passed the

24. Kelo v. City of New London, 545 US 469 (2005).
                      CONSTITUTIONAL LAW AND US COMMERCE | 265

law to protect the health of employees, but the court found
that this law interfered with the basic constitutional right of
private parties to freely contract with one another. Over the
next thirty years, dozens of state and federal laws were struck
down that aimed to improve working conditions, secure social
welfare, or establish the rights of unions. However, in 1934,
during the Great Depression, the court reversed itself and
began upholding the kinds of laws it had struck down earlier.

   Since then, the court has employed a two-tiered analysis of
substantive due process claims. Under the first tier, legislation
on economic matters, employment relations, and other
business affairs is subject to minimal judicial scrutiny. This
means that a law will be overturned only if it serves no rational
government purpose. Under the second tier, legislation
concerning fundamental liberties is subject to "heightened
judicial scrutiny," meaning that a law will be invalidated unless
it is "narrowly tailored to serve a significant government
purpose."

   The Supreme Court has identified two distinct categories of
fundamental liberties. The first category includes most of the
liberties expressly enumerated in the Bill of Rights. Through
a process known as selective incorporation, the court has
interpreted the due process clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment to bar states from denying their residents the
most important freedoms guaranteed in the first ten
amendments to the federal Constitution. Only the Third
Amendment right (against involuntary quartering of soldiers)
266 | CONSTITUTIONAL LAW AND US COMMERCE

and the Fifth Amendment right to be indicted by a grand
jury have not been made applicable to the states. Because these
rights are still not applicable to state governments, the
Supreme Court is often said to have "selectively incorporated"
the Bill of Rights into the due process clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment.

   The second category of fundamental liberties includes those
liberties that are not expressly stated in the Bill of Rights but
that can be seen as essential to the concepts of freedom and
equality in a democratic society. These unstated liberties come
from Supreme Court precedents, common law, moral
philosophy, and deeply rooted traditions of US legal history.
The Supreme Court has stressed that he word liberty cannot
be defined by a definitive list of rights; rather, it must be viewed
as a rational continuum of freedom through which every
aspect of human behavior is protected from arbitrary
impositions and random restraints. In this regard, as the
Supreme Court has observed, the due process clause protects
abstract liberty interests, including the right to personal
autonomy, bodily integrity, self-dignity, and self-
determination.

   These liberty interests often are grouped to form a general
right to privacy, which was first recognized in Griswold v.
Connecticut, where the Supreme Court struck down a state
statute forbidding married adults from using, possessing, or
distributing contraceptives on the ground that the law violated
the sanctity of the marital relationship. According to Justice
                           CONSTITUTIONAL LAW AND US COMMERCE | 267

   Douglas's plurality opinion, this penumbra of privacy, though
   not expressly mentioned in the Bill of Rights, must be
   protected to establish a buffer zone or breathing space for those
   freedoms that are constitutionally enumerated.

      But substantive due process has seen fairly limited use since
   the 1930s. During the 1990s, the Supreme Court was asked
   to recognize a general right to die under the doctrine of
   substantive due process. Although the court stopped short
   of establishing such a far-reaching right, certain patients may
   exercise a constitutional liberty to hasten their deaths under
   a narrow set of circumstances. In Cruzan v. Missouri
   Department of Health, the Supreme Court ruled that the due
   process clause guarantees the right of competent adults to
   make advanced directives for the withdrawal of life-sustaining
   measures should they become incapacitated by a disability that
   leaves them in a persistent vegetative state.25 Once it has been
   established by clear and convincing evidence that a mentally
   incompetent and persistently vegetative patient made such a
   prior directive, a spouse, parent, or other appropriate guardian
   may seek to terminate any form of artificial hydration or
   nutrition.

  6.5.5 Fourteenth Amendment: Due
  Process and Equal Protection

25. Cruzan v. Missouri Department of Health, 497 US 261 (1990).
     268 | CONSTITUTIONAL LAW AND US COMMERCE

  Guarantees

   The Fourteenth Amendment (1868) requires that states treat
   citizens of other states with due process. This can be either an
   issue of procedural due process or an issue of substantive due
   process. For substantive due process, consider what happened
   in an Alabama court not too long ago.26

      The plaintiff, Dr. Ira Gore, bought a new BMW for $40,000
   from a dealer in Alabama. He later discovered that the vehicle's
   exterior had been slightly damaged in transit from Europe and
   had therefore been repainted by the North American
   distributor prior to his purchase. The vehicle was, by best
   estimates, worth about 10 percent less than he paid for it.
   The distributor, BMW of North America, had routinely sold
   slightly damaged cars as brand new if the damage could be
   fixed for less than 3 percent of the cost of the car. In the trial,
   Dr. Gore sought $4,000 in compensatory damages and also
   punitive damages. The Alabama trial jury considered that
   BMW was engaging in a fraudulent practice and wanted to
   punish the defendant for a number of frauds it estimated at
   somewhere around a thousand nationwide. The jury awarded
   not only the $4,000 in compensatory damages but also $4
   million in punitive damages, which was later reduced to $2
   million by the Alabama Supreme Court. On appeal to the

26. BMW of North America, Inc. v. Gore, 517 U.S. 559 (1996).
                      CONSTITUTIONAL LAW AND US COMMERCE | 269

US Supreme Court, the court found that punitive damages
may not be "grossly excessive." If they are, then they violate
substantive due process. Whatever damages a state awards
must be limited to what is reasonably necessary to vindicate the
state's legitimate interest in punishment and deterrence.

The BMW case established constitutional limitations on
punitive damages.

"Equal protection of the laws" is a phrase that originates in the
Fourteenth Amendment, adopted in 1868. The amendment
provides that no state shall "deny to any person within its
jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws." This is the equal
protection clause. It means that, generally speaking,
governments must treat people equally. Unfair classifications
among people or corporations will not be permitted. A well-
     270 | CONSTITUTIONAL LAW AND US COMMERCE

   known example of unfair classification would be race
   discrimination: requiring white children and black children
   to attend different public schools or requiring "separate but
   equal" public services, such as water fountains or restrooms.
   Yet despite the clear intent of the 1868 amendment, "separate
   but equal" was the law of the land until Brown v. Board of
   Education (1954).27

      Governments make classifications every day, so not all
   classifications can be illegal under the equal protection clause.
   People with more income generally pay a greater percentage
   of their income in taxes. People with proper medical training
   are licensed to become doctors; people without that training
   cannot be licensed and commit a criminal offense if they do
   practice medicine. To know what classifications are
   permissible under the Fourteenth Amendment, we need to
   know what is being classified. The court has created three
   classifications, and the outcome of any equal protection case
   can usually be predicted by knowing how the court is likely to
   classify the case:

       Minimal scrutiny (or "rational basis review"): economic
         and social relations. Government actions are usually
         upheld if there is a rational basis for them.

       Intermediate scrutiny: gender. Government

27. Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 US 537 (1896).
                      CONSTITUTIONAL LAW AND US COMMERCE | 271

      classifications are sometimes upheld.
   Strict scrutiny: race, ethnicity, and fundamental rights.

      Classifications based on any of these are almost never
      upheld.

Under minimal scrutiny (or rational basis review) for
economic and social regulation, laws that regulate economic
or social issues are presumed valid and will be upheld if they
are rationally related to legitimate goals of government. So, for
example, if the city of New Orleans limits the number of street
vendors to some rational number (more than one but fewer
than the total number that could possibly fit on the sidewalks),
the local ordinance would not be overturned as a violation of
equal protection.

   Under intermediate scrutiny, the city of New Orleans might
limit the number of street vendors who are men. For example,
suppose that the city council decreed that all street vendors
must be women, thinking that would attract even more
tourism. A classification like this, based on sex, will have to
meet a sterner test than a classification resulting from
economic or social regulation. A law like this would have to
substantially relate to important government objectives.
Increasingly, courts have nullified government sex
classifications as societal concern with gender equality has
     272 | CONSTITUTIONAL LAW AND US COMMERCE

   grown. (See Shannon Faulkner's case against The Citadel, an
   all-male state school.)28

      Suppose, however, that the city of New Orleans decided
   that no one of Middle Eastern heritage could drive a taxicab
   or be a street vendor. That kind of classification would be
   examined with strict scrutiny to see if there was any compelling
   justification for it. As noted, classifications such as this one are
   almost never upheld. The law would be upheld only if it were
   necessary to promote a compelling state interest. Very few laws
   that have a racial or ethnic classification meet that test.

      The strict scrutiny test will be applied to classifications
   involving racial and ethnic criteria as well as classifications that
   interfere with a fundamental right. In Palmore v. Sidoti, the
   state refused to award custody to the mother because her new
   spouse was racially different from the child.29 This practice
   was declared unconstitutional because the state had made a
   racial classification; this was presumptively invalid, and the
   government could not show a compelling need to enforce such
   a classification through its law. An example of government
   action interfering with a fundamental right will also receive
   strict scrutiny. When New York State gave an employment
   preference to veterans who had been state residents at the time
   of entering the military, the court declared that veterans who

29. Palmore v. Sidoti, 466 US 429 (1984).
                           CONSTITUTIONAL LAW AND US COMMERCE | 273

   were new to the state were less likely to get jobs and that
   therefore the statute interfered with the right to travel, which
   was deemed a fundamental right.30

         Key Takeaway

         The Bill of Rights, through the Fourteenth
         Amendment, largely applies to state actions. The Bill
         of Rights has applied to federal actions from the
         start. Both the Bill of Rights and the Fourteenth
         Amendment apply to business in various ways, but
         it is important to remember that the rights conferred
         are rights against governmental action and not the
         actions of private enterprise.

From the 1930s on, administrative agencies, law, and
procedures have virtually remade our government and much
of private life. Every day, business must deal with rules and
decisions of state and federal administrative agencies.
Informally, such rules are often called regulations, and they
differ (only in their source) from laws passed by Congress and
signed into law by the president. The rules created by agencies
are voluminous: thousands of new regulations pour forth each
year. The overarching question of whether there is too much
regulation--or the wrong kind of regulation--of our
economic activities is an important one but well beyond the
scope of this chapter, in which we offer an overview of the
purpose of administrative agencies, their structure, and their
impact on business.

Their Structure and Powers

        After reading this section, you should be able to do
        the following:

            1. Explain the reasons why we have federal
                administrative agencies.

            2. Explain the difference between executive
                branch agencies and independent agencies.

            3. Describe the constitutional issue that
                questions whether administrative agencies
                could have authority to make enforceable
                rules that affect business.

 7.1.1 Why Have Administrative
 Agencies?

  The US Constitution mentions only three branches of
  government: legislative, executive, and judicial (Articles I, II,
  and III). There is no mention of agencies in the Constitution,
  even though federal agencies are sometimes referred to as "the
  fourth branch of government." The Supreme Court has
  recognized the legitimacy of federal administrative agencies1

1. Governmental units, either state or federal, that have specialized
  expertise and authority over some area of the economy.
278 | ADMINISTRATIVE AND ENVIRONMENTAL LAW

to make rules that have the same binding effect as statutes by
Congress.

   Most commentators note that having agencies with rule-
making power is a practical necessity:

   (1) Congress does not have the expertise or continuity to
develop specialized knowledge in various areas (e.g.,
communications, the environment, aviation). (2) Because of
this, it makes sense for Congress to set forth broad statutory
guidance to an agency and delegate authority to the agency
to propose rules that further the statutory purposes. (3) As
long as Congress makes this delegating guidance sufficiently
clear, it is not delegating improperly. If Congress's guidelines
are too vague or undefined, it is (in essence) giving away its
constitutional power to some other group, and this it cannot
do.

7.1.2 Why Regulate the Economy at
All?

The market often does not work properly, as economists
usually note. Monopolies, for example, happen in the natural
course of human events but are not always desirable. To fix
this, well- conceived and objectively enforced competition law
(what is called antitrust law in the United States) can be
helpful. Negative externalities must be "fixed," as well. For
example, as we see in tort law, people and business
organizations often do things that impose costs (damages) on
       ADMINISTRATIVE AND ENVIRONMENTAL LAW | 279

others, and the legal system will try--through the award of

compensatory damages--to make fair adjustments. In terms of

the ideal conditions for a free market, think of tort law as the

legal system's attempt to compensate for negative externalities:

those costs imposed on people who have not voluntarily

consented to bear those costs.

In short, some forms of legislation and regulation are

needed to counter a tendency toward consolidation of

economic power and discriminatory attitudes toward certain

individuals and groups and to insist that people and companies

clean up their own messes and not hide information that

would empower voluntary choices in the free market.

But there are additional reasons to regulate. For example, in

economic systems, it is likely for natural monopolies to occur.

These are where one firm can most efficiently supply all of the

good or service. Having duplicate (or triplicate) systems for

supplying electricity, for example, would be inefficient, so most

states have a public utilities commission to determine both

price and quality of service. This is direct regulation.

Other  market

imperfections can yield a

demand for regulation. For

example, there is a need to

regulate frequencies for

public broad- cast on radio,

television, and other wireless transmissions (for police, fire,

national defense, etc.). Many economists would also list an
280 | ADMINISTRATIVE AND ENVIRONMENTAL LAW

adequate supply of public goods as some- thing that must be
created by government. On its own, for example, the market
would have difficulty completely providing public goods such
as education, a highway system, a military for defense.

   At the same time, government regulation can go beyond
correcting externalities and market imperfections. Often
government agencies are subject to "capture" by the very
industry they were created to regulate, and so regulations are
issued that preserve monopoly power, limit consumer choice,
favor certain businesses, and so on.

7.1.3 History of Federal Agencies

Through the commerce clause in the US Constitution,
Congress has the power to regulate trade between the states
and with foreign nations. The earliest federal agency therefore
dealt with trucking and railroads, to literally set the rules of
the road for interstate commerce. The first federal agency, the
Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC), was created in
1887. Congress delegated to the ICC the power to enforce
federal laws against railroad rate discrimination and other
unfair pricing practices. By the early part of this century, the
ICC gained the power to fix rates. From the 1970s through
1995, however, Congress passed deregulatory measures, and
the ICC was formally abolished in 1995, with its powers
transferred to the Surface Transportation Board.

   Beginning with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in
                    ADMINISTRATIVE AND ENVIRONMENTAL LAW | 281

1914, Congress has created numerous other agencies, many
of them familiar actors in American government. Today more
than eighty-five federal agencies have jurisdiction to regulate
some form of private activity. Most were created since 1930
with the Supreme Court's expansive interpretation of the
Commerce Clause (more ability to legally regulate led to more
regulatory agencies), and more than a third since 1960. A
similar growth has occurred at the state level. Most states now
have dozens of regulatory agencies, many of them overlapping
in function with the federal bodies.

              introtolaw/?p=164#oembed-1

7.1.4 Classification of Agencies

Independent agencies are different from federal executive
departments and other executive agencies by their structural
and functional characteristics. Most executive departments
have a single director, administrator, or secretary appointed
by the president of the United States. Independent agencies
almost always have a commission or board consisting of five
to seven members who share power over the agency. The
president appoints the commissioners or board subject to
Senate confirmation, but they often serve with staggered terms
and often for longer terms than a usual four-year presidential
term. They cannot be removed except for "good cause." This
means that most presidents will not get to appoint all the
                    ADMINISTRATIVE AND ENVIRONMENTAL LAW | 283

commissioners of a given independent agency. Most
independent agencies have a statutory requirement of
bipartisan membership on the commission, so the president
cannot simply fill vacancies with members of his own political
party.

   In addition to the ICC and the FTC, the major
independent agencies are the Federal Communications
Commission (1934), Securities and Exchange Commission
(1934), National Labor Relations Board (1935), and
Environmental Protection Agency (1970).

   By contrast, members of executive branch agencies serve
at the pleasure of the president and are therefore far more
amenable to political control. One consequence of this
distinction is that the rules that independent agencies
promulgate may not be reviewed by the president or his
staff--only Congress may directly overrule them--whereas
the White House or officials in the various cabinet
departments may oversee the work of the agencies contained
within them (unless specifically denied the power by
Congress).

7.1.5 Powers of Agencies

Agencies have a variety of powers. Many of the original statutes
that created them, like the Federal Communications Act, gave
them licensing power. No party can enter into the productive
activity covered by the act without prior license from the
284 | ADMINISTRATIVE AND ENVIRONMENTAL LAW

agency--for example, no utility can start up a nuclear power
plant unless first approved by the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission. In recent years, the move toward deregulation of
the economy has led to diminution of some licensing power.
Many agencies also have the authority to set the rates charged
by companies subject to the agency's jurisdiction. Finally, the
agencies can regulate business practices. The FTC has general
jurisdiction over all business in interstate commerce to
monitor and root out "unfair acts" and "deceptive practices."
The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) oversees the
issuance of corporate securities and other investments and
monitors the practices of the stock exchanges.

   The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) oversees
regulation of large areas of the economy, from food labeling
to prescription drugs to medical devices. For example, FDA
establishes regulations for required "serving sizes" on food
products. An extensive table establishes these amounts for an
incredibly specific variety of foods.
                    ADMINISTRATIVE AND ENVIRONMENTAL LAW | 285

An example from the FDA's table (valid as of January 2022).

Unlike courts, administrative agencies are charged with the
responsibility of carrying out a specific assignment or reaching
a goal or set of goals. They are not to remain neutral on the
various issues of the day; they must act. They have been given
legislative powers because in a society growing ever more
complex, Congress does not know how to legislate with the
kind of detail that is necessary, nor would it have the time to
approach all the sectors of society even if it tried. Precisely
because they are to do what general legislative bodies cannot
do, agencies are specialized bodies. Through years of
experience in dealing with similar problems they accumulate
a body of knowledge that they can apply to accomplish their
statutory duties.
   286 | ADMINISTRATIVE AND ENVIRONMENTAL LAW

     All administrative agencies have two different sorts of
  personnel. The heads, whether a single administrator or a
  collegial body of commissioners, are political appointees and
  serve for relatively limited terms. Below them is a more or
  less permanent staff--the bureaucracy. Much policy making
  occurs at the staff level, because these employees are in essential
  control of gathering facts and presenting data and argument
  to the commissioners, who wield the ultimate power of the
  agencies.

 7.1.6 The Constitution and Agencies

  Congress can establish an agency through legislation. When
  Congress gives powers to an agency, the legislation is known
  as an enabling act.2 The concept that Congress can delegate
  power to an agency is known as the delegation doctrine.3
  Usually, the agency will have all three kinds of power:
  executive, legislative, and judicial. (That is, the agency can set
  the rules that business must comply with, can investigate and
  prosecute those businesses, and can hold administrative

2. The legislative act that establishes an agency's authority in a
  particular area of the economy.

3. As a matter of constitutional law, the delegation doctrine declares
  that an agency can only exercise that power delegated to it by a
  constitutional authority.
                       ADMINISTRATIVE AND ENVIRONMENTAL LAW | 287

  hearings for violations of those rules. They are, in effect, rule
  maker, prosecutor, and judge.) Because agencies have all three
  types of governmental powers, important constitutional
  questions were asked when Congress first created them. The
  most important question was whether Congress was giving
  away its legislative power. Was the separation of powers
  violated if agencies had power to make rules that were
  equivalent to legislative statutes?

     In 1935, in Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, the
  Supreme Court overturned the National Industrial Recovery
  Act on the ground that the congressional delegation of power
  was too broad.4 Under the law, industry trade groups were
  granted the authority to devise a code of fair competition for
  the entire industry, and these codes became law if approved
  by the president. No administrative body was created to
  scrutinize the arguments for a particular code, to develop
  evidence, or to test one version of a code against another. Thus
  it was unconstitutional for the Congress to transfer all of its
  legislative powers to an agency. In later decisions, it was made
  clear that Congress could delegate some of its legislative
  powers, but only if the delegation of authority was not overly
  broad.

     Still, some congressional enabling acts are very broad, such
  as the enabling legislation for the Occupational Safety and

4. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, 295 US 495 (1935).
288 | ADMINISTRATIVE AND ENVIRONMENTAL LAW

Health Administration (OSHA), which is given the authority
to make rules to provide for safe and healthful working
conditions in US workplaces. Such a broad initiative power
gives OSHA considerable discretion. But, as noted in
"Controlling Administrative Agencies", there are both
executive and judicial controls over administrative agency
activities, as well as ongoing control by Congress through
funding and the continuing oversight of agencies, both in
hearings and through subsequent statutory amendments.

        OSHA regulations aim to protect from
        workplace dangers.

     Key Takeaway
                    ADMINISTRATIVE AND ENVIRONMENTAL LAW | 289

     Congress creates administrative agencies through
     enabling acts. In these acts, Congress must delegate
     authority by giving the agency some direction as to
     what it wants the agency to do. Agencies are usually
     given broad powers to investigate, set standards
     (promulgating regulations), and enforce those
     standards. Most agencies are executive branch
     agencies, but some are independent.

         3. Understand how the courts can control
             administrative agencies.

During the course of the past seventy years, a substantial
debate has been conducted, often in shrill terms, about the
legitimacy of administrative lawmaking. One criticism is that
agencies are "captured" by the industry they are directed to
regulate. Another is that they overregulate, stifling individual
initiative and the ability to compete. During the 1960s and
1970s, a massive outpouring of federal law created many new
agencies and greatly strengthened the hands of existing ones.
In the late 1970s during the Carter administration, Congress
began to deregulate American society, and deregulation
increased under the Reagan administration. But the
accounting frauds of WorldCom, Enron, and others led to
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and the financial meltdown
of 2008 has led to reregulation of the financial sector. In the
2010s, the Trump administration set about a large scheme of
government deregulation, citing concerns that regulation
impaired business productivity.

   Administrative agencies are the focal point of controversy
because they are policy-making bodies, incorporating facets
                    ADMINISTRATIVE AND ENVIRONMENTAL LAW | 291

of legislative, executive, and judicial power in a hybrid form
that fits uneasily at best in the framework of American
government. They are necessarily at the center of tugging and
hauling by the legislature, the executive branch, and the
judiciary, each of which has different means of exercising
political control over them. In early 1990, for example, the
Bush administration approved a Food and Drug
Administration regulation that limited disease-prevention
claims by food packagers, reversing a position by the Reagan
administration in 1987 permitting such claims.

Major Administrative Agencies of the United States
292 | ADMINISTRATIVE AND ENVIRONMENTAL LAW

7.2.1 Legislative Control

Congress can always pass a law repealing a regulation that an
agency promulgates. Because this is a time-consuming process
that runs counter to the reason for creating administrative
bodies, it happens rarely. Another approach to controlling
agencies is to reduce or threaten to reduce their
appropriations. By retaining ultimate control of the purse
strings, Congress can exercise considerable informal control
over regulatory policy.

7.2.2 Executive Control

The president (or a governor, for state agencies) can exercise
considerable control over agencies that are part of his cabinet
departments and that are not statutorily defined as
independent. Federal agencies, moreover, are subject to the
fiscal scrutiny of the Office of Management and Budget
(OMB), subject to the direct control of the president. Agencies
are not permitted to go directly to Congress for increases in
budget; these requests must be submitted through the OMB,
giving the president indirect leverage over the continuation of
administrators' programs and policies.

 7.2.3 Judicial Review of Agency
 Actions

  Administrative agencies are creatures of law and like everyone
  else must obey the law. The courts have jurisdiction to hear
  claims that the agencies have overstepped their legal authority
  or have acted in some unlawful manner.

     Courts are unlikely to overturn administrative actions,
  often believing that the agencies are better situated to judge
  their own jurisdiction and are experts in rulemaking for those
  matters delegated to them by Congress. In a famous case
  referred to as Chevron,5 the United States Supreme Court
  established the doctrine of "Chevron deference." This doctrine
  states that courts should defer to how agencies interpret
  statutes. If Congress did not speak clearly to an issue, courts
  must defer to the agency's "permissible" or "reasonable"
  interpretation of the statute.

        Key Takeaway

294 | ADMINISTRATIVE AND ENVIRONMENTAL LAW

     Administrative agencies are given unusual powers:
     to legislate, investigate, and adjudicate. But these
     powers are limited by executive and legislative
     controls and by judicial review.

Procedure Act

     After reading this section, you should be able to do
     the following:

           Understand why the Administrative
             Procedure Act was needed.

           Understand how hearings are conducted
             under the act.

           Understand how the act affects rulemaking
             by agencies.
                       ADMINISTRATIVE AND ENVIRONMENTAL LAW | 295

  In 1946, Congress enacted the Administrative Procedure Act
  (APA).6 This fundamental statute detailed for all federal
  administrative agencies how they must function when they
  are deciding cases or issuing regulations, the two basic tasks
  of administration. At the state level, the Model State
  Administrative Procedure Act, issued in 1946 and revised in
  1961, has been adopted in twenty-eight states and the District
  of Columbia; three states have adopted the 1981 revision. The
  other states have statutes that resemble the model state act to
  some degree.

 7.3.1 Trial-Type Hearings

  Deciding cases is a major task of many agencies. For example,
  the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is empowered to charge
  a company with having violated the Federal Trade
  Commission Act. Perhaps a seller is accused of making
  deceptive claims in its advertising. Proceeding in a manner
  similar to a court, staff counsel will prepare a case against the
  company, which can defend itself through its lawyers. The case
  is tried before an administrative law judge7 (ALJ), formerly

6. The federal act that governs all agency procedures in both hearings
  and rulemaking.

7. The primary hearing officer in an administrative agency, who
296 | ADMINISTRATIVE AND ENVIRONMENTAL LAW

known as an administrative hearing examiner. The change in
nomenclature was made in 1972 to enhance the prestige of
ALJs and more accurately reflect their duties. Although not
appointed for life as federal judges are, the ALJ must be free of
assignments inconsistent with the judicial function and is not
subject to supervision by anyone in the agency who carries on
an investigative or prosecutorial function.

   The accused parties are
entitled to receive notice of
the issues to be raised, to
present evidence, to argue,
to cross-examine, and to
appear with their lawyers. Ex
parte (eks PAR- tay) communications--contacts between the
ALJ and outsiders or one party when both par- ties are not
present--are prohibited. However, the usual burden-of-proof
standard followed in a civil proceeding in court does not apply:
the ALJ is not bound to decide in favor of that party
producing the more persuasive evidence.

   The rule in most administrative proceedings is "substantial
evidence," evidence that is not flimsy or weak, but is not
necessarily overwhelming evidence, either. The ALJ in most
cases will write an opinion. That opinion is not the decision

provides the initial ruling of the agency (often called an order) in any
contested proceeding.
                    ADMINISTRATIVE AND ENVIRONMENTAL LAW | 297

of the agency, which can be made only by the commissioners
or agency head. In effect, the ALJ's opinion is appealed to the
commission itself.

   Certain types of agency actions that have a direct impact on
individuals need not be filtered through a full-scale hearing.
Safety and quality inspections (grading of food, inspection of
airplanes) can be made on the spot by skilled inspectors.
Certain licenses can be administered through tests without a
hearing (a test for a driver's license), and some decisions can be
made by election of those affected (labor union elections).

7.3.2 Rulemaking

Trial-type hearings generally impose on particular parties
liabilities based on past or present facts. Because these cases will
serve as precedents, they are a partial guide to future conduct
by others. But they do not directly apply to nonparties, who
may argue in a subsequent case that their conduct does not
fit within the holding announced in the case. Agencies can
affect future conduct far more directly by announcing rules
that apply to all who come within the agency's jurisdiction.

   The acts creating most of the major federal agencies
expressly grant them authority to engage in rulemaking. This
means, in essence, authority to legislate. The outpouring of
federal regulations has been immense. The APA directs
agencies about to engage in rulemaking to give notice in the
   298 | ADMINISTRATIVE AND ENVIRONMENTAL LAW

  Federal Register8 of their intent to do so. The Federal Register
  is published daily, Monday through Friday, in Washington,
  DC, and contains notice of various actions, including
  announcements of proposed rulemaking and regulations as
  adopted. The notice must specify the time, place, and nature
  of the rulemaking and offer a description of the proposed rule
  or the issues involved. Any interested person or organization
  is entitled to participate by submitting written "data, views
  or arguments." Agencies are not legally required to air debate
  over proposed rules, though they often do so.

  The administrative rulemaking process.

  The procedure just described is known as "informal"
  rulemaking. A different procedure is required for "formal"
  rulemaking, defined as those instances in which the enabling
  legislation directs an agency to make rules "on the record after

8. The Federal Register is where all proposed administrative regulations
  are first published, usually inviting comment from interested parties.
                       ADMINISTRATIVE AND ENVIRONMENTAL LAW | 299

  opportunity for an agency hearing." When engaging in formal
  rulemaking, agencies must hold an adversary hearing.

     Administrative regulations are not legally binding unless
  they are published. Agencies must publish in the Federal
  Register the text of final regulations, which ordinarily do not
  become effective until thirty days later. Every year the annual
  output of regulations is collected and reprinted in the Code of
  Federal Regulations (CFR)9, a multivolume paperback series
  containing all federal rules and regulations keyed to the fifty
  titles of the US Code (the compilation of all federal statutes
  enacted by Congress and grouped according to subject).

        Key Takeaway

        Agencies make rules that have the same effect as
        laws passed by Congress and the president. But
        such rules (regulations) must allow for full
        participation by interested parties. The

     regulations, and it provides a process for fair

7.4 Administrative Burdens on
Business Operations

     Learning Objectives

     After reading this section, you should be able to do
     the following:

         1. Describe the paperwork burden imposed by
             administrative agencies.

         2. Explain why agencies have the power of
             investigation, and what limits there are to
             that power.

         3. Explain the need for the Freedom of
                    ADMINISTRATIVE AND ENVIRONMENTAL LAW | 301

             Information Act and how it works in the US
             legal system.

7.4.1 The Paperwork Burden

The administrative process is not frictionless. The interplay
between government agency and private enterprise can burden
business operations in a number of ways. Several of these are
noted in this section.

   Deciding whether and how to act are not decisions that
government agencies reach out of the blue. They rely heavily
on information garnered from business itself. Dozens of
federal agencies require corporations to keep hundreds of
types of records and to file numerous periodic reports. The
Commission on Federal Paperwork, established during the
Ford administration to consider ways of reducing the
paperwork burden, estimated in its final report in 1977 that
the total annual cost of federal paperwork amounted to $50
billion and that the 10,000 largest business enterprises spent
$10 billion annually on paperwork alone. The paperwork
involved in licensing a single nuclear power plant, the
commission said, costs upward of $15 million.
     302 | ADMINISTRATIVE AND ENVIRONMENTAL LAW

                                          Not surprisingly, therefore,
                                          businesses have sought ways
                                          of avoiding requests for
                                          data. Since the 1940s, the
                                          Federal Trade Commission
                                          (FTC) has collected
                                          economic data on corporate
   performance from individual companies for statistical
   purposes. As long as each company engages in a single line of
   business, data are comparable. When the era of con-
   glomerates began in the 1970s, with widely divergent types of
   businesses brought together under the roof of a single
   corporate parent, the data became useless for purposes of
   examining the competitive behavior of different industries. So
   the FTC ordered dozens of large companies to break out their
   economic information according to each line of business that
   they carried on. The companies resisted, but the US Court of
   Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, where much of
   the litigation over federal administrative action is decided,
   directed the companies to comply with the commission's
   order, holding that the Federal Trade Commission Act clearly
   permits the agency to collect information for investigatory
   purposes.10

10. In re FTC Line of Business Report Litigation, 595 F.2d 685 (D.C.
    Cir. 1978).
                    ADMINISTRATIVE AND ENVIRONMENTAL LAW | 303

   In 1980, responding to cries that businesses, individuals,
and state and local governments were being swamped by
federal demands for paperwork, Congress enacted the
Paperwork Reduction Act. It gives power to the federal Office
of Management and Budget (OMB) to develop uniform
policies for coordinating the gathering, storage, and
transmission of all the millions of reports flowing in each year
to the scores of federal departments and agencies requesting
information. These reports include tax and Medicare forms,
financial loan and job applications, questionnaires of all sorts,
compliance reports, and tax and business records. The OMB
was given the power also to determine whether new kinds of
information are needed. In effect, any agency that wants to
collect new information from outside must obtain the OMB's
approval.

7.4.2 Inspections

No one likes surprise inspections. A section of the
Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 empowers agents
of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration
(OSHA) to search work areas for safety hazards and for
violations of OSHA regulations. The act does not specify
whether inspectors are required to obtain search warrants,
required under the Fourth Amendment in criminal cases. For
many years, the government insisted that surprise inspections
are not unreasonable and that the time required to obtain
     304 | ADMINISTRATIVE AND ENVIRONMENTAL LAW

   a warrant would defeat the surprise element. The Supreme
   Court finally ruled squarely on the issue in 1978. In Marshall
   v. Barlow's, Inc., the court held that no less than private
   individuals, businesses are entitled to refuse police demands to
   search the premises unless a court has issued a search warrant.11

      But where a certain type of business is closely regulated,
   surprise inspections are the norm, and no warrant is required.
   For example, businesses with liquor licenses that might sell to
   minors are subject to both overt and covert inspections (e.g.,
   an undercover officer may "search" a liquor store by sending
   an underage patron to the store). Or a junkyard that specializes
   in automobiles and automobile parts may also be subject to
   surprise inspections, on the rationale that junkyards are highly
   likely to be active in the resale of stolen autos or stolen auto
   parts.12

      It is also possible for inspections to take place without a
   search warrant and without the permission of the business. For
   example, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) wished
   to inspect parts of the Dow Chemical facility in Midland,
   Michigan, without the benefit of warrant. When they were
   refused, agents of the EPA obtained a fairly advanced aerial
   mapping camera and rented an airplane to fly over the Dow
   facility. Dow went to court for a restraining order against the

   EPA and a request to have the EPA turn over all photographs
   taken. But the Supreme Court ruled that the areas
   photographed were "open fields" and not subject to the
   protections of the Fourth Amendment.13

  7.4.3 Access to Business Information
  in Government Files

   In 1966, Congress enacted the Freedom of Information Act
   (FOIA), opening up to the citizenry many of the files of the
   government. (The act was amended in 1974 and again in 1976
   to overcome a tendency of many agencies to stall or refuse
   access to their files.) Under the FOIA, any person has a legally
   enforceable right of access to all government documents, with
   nine specific exceptions, such as classified military intelligence,
   medical files, and trade secrets and commercial or financial
   information if "obtained from a person and privileged or
   confidential." Without the trade-secret and financial-
   information exemptions, business competitors could, merely
   by requesting it, obtain highly sensitive competitive
   information sitting in government files.

13. Dow Chemical Co. v. United States Environmental Protection
    Agency, 476 US 227 (1986).
306 | ADMINISTRATIVE AND ENVIRONMENTAL LAW

   A federal agency is
required under the FOIA to
respond to a document
request within ten days. But
in practice, months or even
years may pass before the
government actually responds to an FOIA re- quest.
Requesters must also pay the cost of locating and copying the
records. Moreover, not all documents are available for public
inspection. Along with the trade-secret and financial-
information ex- emptions, the FOIA specifically exempts the
following:

   Records required by executive order of the president to
      be kept secret in the interest of national defense or
      public policy;

   Records related solely to the internal personnel rules and
      practice of an agency;

   Records exempted from disclosure by another statute;
   Interagency memos or decisions reflecting the

      deliberative process;
   Personnel files and other files that if disclosed, would

      constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;
   Information compiled for law enforcement purposes;

      and
   Geological information concerning wells.
                    ADMINISTRATIVE AND ENVIRONMENTAL LAW | 307

Note that the government may provide such information but
is not required to provide such information; it retains
discretion to provide information or not.

   Regulated companies are often required to submit
confidential information to the government. For these
companies, submitting such information presents a danger
under the FOIA of disclosure to competitors. To protect
information from disclosure, the company is well advised to
mark each document as privileged and confidential so that
government officials reviewing it for a FOIA request will not
automatically disclose it. Most agencies notify a company
whose data they are about to disclose. But these practices are
not legally required under the FOIA.

     Key Takeaway

     Government agencies, in order to do their jobs,
     collect a great deal of information from businesses.
     This can range from routine paperwork (often
     burdensome) to inspections, those with warrants
     and those without. Surprise inspections are allowed
     for closely regulated industries but are subject to
     Fourth Amendment requirements in general. Some
308 | ADMINISTRATIVE AND ENVIRONMENTAL LAW

     information collected by agencies can be accessed
     using the Freedom of Information Act.

7.5 The Scope of Judicial
Review

     Learning Objectives

     After reading this section, you should be able to do
     the following:

           Describe the "exhaustion of remedies"
             requirement.

           Detail various strategies for obtaining judicial
             review of agency rules.

           Explain under what circumstances it is
             possible to sue the government.

Neither an administrative agency's adjudication nor its
                         ADMINISTRATIVE AND ENVIRONMENTAL LAW | 309

   issuance of a regulation is necessarily final. Most federal agency
   decisions are appealable to the federal circuit courts. To get
   to court, the appellant must overcome numerous complex
   hurdles. He or she must have standing--that is, be in some
   sense directly affected by the decision or regulation. The case
   must be ripe for review; administrative remedies such as
   further appeal within the agency must have been exhausted.

  7.5.1 Exhaustion of Administrative
  Remedies

   Before you can complain to court about an agency's action,
   you must first try to get the agency to reconsider its action.
   Generally, you must have asked for a hearing at the hearing
   examiner level, there must have been a decision reached that
   was unfavorable to you, and you must have appealed the
   decision to the full board. The full board must rule against
   you, and only then will you be heard by a court. The broadest
   exception to this exhaustion of administrative remedies14
   requirement is if the agency had no authority to issue the rule
   or regulation in the first place, if exhaustion of remedies would
   be impractical or futile, or if great harm would happen should
   the rule or regulation continue to apply. Also, if the agency is

14. A requirement that anyone wishing to appeal an agency action must
    wait until the agency has taken final action.
310 | ADMINISTRATIVE AND ENVIRONMENTAL LAW

not acting in good faith, the courts will hear an appeal without
exhaustion.

7.5.2 Strategies for Obtaining Judicial
Review

Once these obstacles are cleared, the court may look at one of
a series of claims. The appellant might assert that the agency's
action was ultra vires (UL-truh VI-reez)--beyond the scope of
its authority as set down in the statute. This attack is rarely
successful. A somewhat more successful claim is that the
agency did not abide by its own procedures or those imposed
upon it by the Administrative Procedure Act.

   In formal rulemaking, the appellant also might insist that
the agency lacked substantial evidence for the determination
that it made. If there is virtually no evidence to support the
agency's findings, the court may reverse. But findings of fact
are not often overturned by the courts.

   Likewise, there has long
been a presumption that
when an agency issues a
regulation, it has the
authority to do so: those
opposing the regulation
must bear a heavy burden in court to upset it. This is not a
surprising rule, for otherwise courts, not administrators,
would be the authors of regulations. Nevertheless, regulations
                     ADMINISTRATIVE AND ENVIRONMENTAL LAW | 311

cannot exceed the scope of the authority conferred by
Congress on the agency. In an important 1981 case before
the Supreme Court, the issue was whether the secretary of
labor, acting through the Occupational Health and Safety
Administration (OSHA), could lawfully issue a standard
limiting exposure to cotton dust in the workplace without first
undertaking a cost- benefit analysis. A dozen cotton textile
manufacturers and the American Textile Manufacturers
Institute, representing 175 companies, asserted that the cotton
dust standard was unlawful because it did not rationally relate
the benefits to be derived from the standard to the costs that
the standard would impose.

   In summary, then, an individual or a company may (after
exhaustion of administrative remedies) challenge agency
action where such action is the following:

   Not in accordance with the agency's scope of authority;
   Not in accordance with the US Constitution or the

      Administrative Procedure Act;
   Not in accordance with the substantial evidence test;
   Unwarranted by the facts; or
   Arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or

      otherwise not in accord with the law.

Section 706 of the Administrative Procedure Act sets out
those standards. While it is difficult to show that an agency's
action is arbitrary and capricious, there are cases that have so
     312 | ADMINISTRATIVE AND ENVIRONMENTAL LAW

   held. For example, after the Reagan administration set aside a
   Carter administration rule from the National Highway Traffic
   and Safety Administration on passive restraints in
   automobiles, State Farm and other insurance companies
   challenged the reversal as arbitrary and capricious. Examining
   the record, the Supreme Court found that the agency had
   failed to state enough reasons for its reversal and required the
   agency to review the record and the rule and provide adequate
   reasons for its reversal. State Farm and other insurance
   companies thus gained a legal benefit by keeping an agency rule
   that placed costs on automakers for increased passenger safety
   and potentially reducing the number of injury claims from
   those it had insured.15

  7.5.3 Suing the Government

   In the modern administrative state, the range of government
   activity is immense, and administrative agencies frequently get
   in the way of business enterprise. Often, bureaucratic
   involvement is wholly legitimate, compelled by law;
   sometimes, however, agencies or government officials may
   overstep their bounds, in a fit of zeal or spite. What recourse
   does the private individual or company have?

15. Motor Vehicle Manufacturers' Assn. v. State Farm Mutual Ins., 463
    US 29 (1983).
                         ADMINISTRATIVE AND ENVIRONMENTAL LAW | 313

      Mainly for historical reasons, it has always been more
   difficult to sue the government than to sue private individuals
   or corporations. For one thing, the government has long had
   recourse to the doctrine of sovereign im- munity as a shield
   against lawsuits. Yet in 1976, Congress amended the
   Administrative Procedure Act to waive any federal claim to
   sovereign immunity in cases of injunctive or other
   nonmonetary relief. Earlier, in 1946, in the Federal Tort
   Claims Act, Congress had waived sovereign immunity of the
   federal government for most tort claims for money damages,
   although the act contains several exceptions for specific
   agencies (e.g., one cannot sue for injuries resulting from fiscal
   operations of the Treasury Department or for injuries
   stemming from activities of the military in wartime). The act
   also contains a major exception for claims "based upon [an
   official's] exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or
   perform a discretionary function or duty." This exception
   prevents suits against parole boards for paroling dangerous
   criminals who then kill or maim in the course of another crime
   and suits against officials whose decision to ship explosive
   materials by public carrier leads to mass deaths and injuries
   following an explosion en route.16

      In recent years, the Supreme Court has been stripping away
   the traditional immunity enjoyed by many government

16. Dalehite v. United States, 346 US 15 (1953).
     314 | ADMINISTRATIVE AND ENVIRONMENTAL LAW

   officials against personal suits. Some government
   employees--judges, prosecutors, legislators, and the president,
   for example--have absolute immunity against suit for official
   actions. But many public administrators and government
   employees have at best a qualified immunity. Under a
   provision of the Civil Rights Act of 1871 (so-called Section
   1983 actions), state officials can be sued in federal court for
   money damages whenever "under color of any state law" they
   deprive anyone of his rights under the Constitution or federal
   law. In Bivens v. Six Unknown Federal Narcotics Agents, the
   Supreme Court held that federal agents may be sued for
   violating the plaintiff's Fourth Amendment rights against an
   unlawful search of his home.17 Subsequent cases have followed
   this logic to permit suits for violations of other constitutional
   provisions. This area of the law is in a state of flux, and it is
   likely to continue to evolve.

   Sometimes damage is done to an individual or business
   because the government has given out erroneous information.
   For example, suppose that Charles, a bewildered, disabled navy
   employee, is receiving a federal disability annuity. Under the
   regulations, he would lose his pension if he took a job that paid
   him in each of two succeeding years more than 80 percent of

17. Bivens v. Six Unknown Federal Narcotics Agents, 403 US 388
    (1971).
                         ADMINISTRATIVE AND ENVIRONMENTAL LAW | 315

   what he earned in his old navy job. A few years later, Congress
   changed the law, making him ineligible if he earned more than
   80 percent in anyone year. For many years, Charles earned
   considerably less than the ceiling amount. But then one year he
   got the opportunity to make some extra money. Not wishing
   to lose his pension, he called an employee relations specialist in
   the US Navy and asked how much he could earn and still keep
   his pension. The specialist gave him erroneous information
   over the telephone and then sent him an out-of-date form
   that said Charles could safely take on the extra work.
   Unfortunately, as it turned out, Charles did exceed the salary
   limit, and so the government cut off his pension during the
   time he earned too much. Charles sues to recover his lost
   pension. He argues that he relied to his detriment on false
   information supplied by the navy and that in fairness the
   government should be estopped from denying his claim.

      Unfortunately for Charles, he will lose his case. In Office
   of Personnel Management v. Richmond, the Supreme Court
   reasoned that it would be unconstitutional to permit
   recovery.18 The appropriations clause of Article I says that
   federal money can be paid out only through an appropriation
   made by law. The law prevented this particular payment to be
   made. If the court were to make an exception, it would permit

executive officials in effect to make binding payments, even
though unauthorized, simply by misrepresenting the facts.
The harsh reality, therefore, is that mistakes of the government
are generally held against the individual, not the government,
unless the law specifically provides for recompense (as, for
example, in the Federal Tort Claims Act just discussed).

     Learning Objectives

         1. Describe the major federal laws that govern
             business activities that may adversely affect
             air quality and water quality.

         2. Describe the major federal laws that govern
             waste disposal and chemical hazards including
             pesticides.

In one sense, environmental law is very old. Medieval England
had smoke control laws that established the seasons when soft
coal could be burned. Nuisance laws give private individuals
a limited control over polluting activities of adjacent
                    ADMINISTRATIVE AND ENVIRONMENTAL LAW | 317

landowners. But a comprehensive set of US laws directed
toward general protection of the environment is largely a
product of the past quarter-century, with most of the
legislative activity stemming from the late 1960s and later,
when people began to perceive that the environment was
systematically deteriorating from assaults by rapid population
growth and greatly increased automobile driving, vast
proliferation of factories that generate waste products, and a
sharp rise in the production of toxic materials. Two of the
most significant developments in environmental law came in
1970, when the National Environmental Policy Act took effect
and the Environmental Protection Agency became the first
of a number of new federal administrative agencies to be
established during the decade.

NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL
POLICY ACT

Signed into law by President Nixon on January 1, 1970, the
National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) declared that it
shall be the policy of the federal government, in cooperation
with state and local governments, "to create and maintain
conditions under which man and nature can exist in
productive harmony, and fulfill the social, economic, and
other requirements of present and future generations of
Americans.. . . The Congress recognizes that each person
should enjoy a healthful environment and that each person
318 | ADMINISTRATIVE AND ENVIRONMENTAL LAW

has a responsibility to contribute to the preservation and
enhancement of the environment."

   The most significant aspect of NEPA is its requirement that
federal agencies prepare an environmental impact
statement332 in every recommendation or report on proposals
for legislation and whenever undertaking a major federal
action that significantly affects environmental quality. The
statement must (1) detail the environmental impact of the
proposed action, (2) list any unavoidable adverse impacts
should the action be taken, (3) consider alternatives to the
pro- posed action, (4) compare short-term and long-term
consequences, and (5) describe irreversible commitments of
resources. Unless the impact statement is prepared, the project
can be enjoined from proceeding. Note that NEPA does not
apply to purely private activities but only to those proposed to
be carried out in some manner by federal agencies.

ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
AGENCY

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has been in the
forefront of the news since its creation in 1970. Charged with
monitoring environmental practices of industry, assisting the
government and private business to halt environmental
deterioration, promulgating regulations consistent with
federal environmental policy, and policing industry for
violations of the various federal environmental statutes and
                         ADMINISTRATIVE AND ENVIRONMENTAL LAW | 319

   regulations, the EPA has had a pervasive influence on
   American business. Business Week noted the following in
   1977: "Cars rolling off Detroit's assembly line now have
   antipollution devices as standard equipment. The dense black
   smokestack emissions that used to symbolize industrial
   prosperity are rare, and illegal, sights. Plants that once blithely
   ran discharge water out of a pipe and into a river must apply
   for permits that are almost impossible to get unless the plants
   install expensive water treatment equipment. All told, the EPA
   has made a sizable dent in man-made environmental filth."19

      The EPA is especially active in regulating water and air
   pollution and in overseeing the disposition of toxic wastes and
   chemicals. Clean Water Act Legislation governing the nation's
   waterways goes back a long time. The first federal water
   pollution statute was the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899.
   Congress enacted new laws in 1948, 1956, 1965, 1966, and
   1970. But the centerpiece of water pollution enforcement is
   the Clean Water Act of 1972 (technically, the Federal Water
   Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972), as amended
   in 1977 and by the Water Quality Act of 1987. The Clean
   Water Act is designed to restore and maintain the "chemical,
   physical, and biological integrity of the Nation's waters."33
   United States Code, Section 1251. It operates on the states,

19. 20
20. [15]
320 | ADMINISTRATIVE AND ENVIRONMENTAL LAW

requiring them to designate the uses of every significant body
of water within their borders (e.g., for drinking water,
recreation, commercial fishing) and to set water quality
standards to reduce pollution to levels appropriate for each
use.

CLEAN WATER ACT

Congress only has power to

regulate                                     interstate

commerce, and so the Clean

Water Act is applicable only

to "navigable waters" of the

United States. This has led

to disputes over whether the

act can apply, say, to an

abandoned gravel pit that

has no visible connection to

navigable waterways, even if

the gravel pit provides

habitat for migratory birds.

In Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook County v. Army Corps

of Engineers, the US Supreme Court said no.

The Clean Water Act also governs private industry and

imposes stringent standards on the discharge of pollutants into

waterways and publicly owned sewage systems. The act created

an effluent permit system known as the National Pollutant
                    ADMINISTRATIVE AND ENVIRONMENTAL LAW | 321

Discharge Elimination System. To discharge any pollutants
into navigable waters from a "point source" like a pipe, ditch,
ship, or container, a company must obtain a certification that
it meets specified standards, which are continually being
tightened. For example, until 1983, industry had to use the
"best practicable technology" currently available, but after July
1, 1984, it had to use the "best available technology"
economically achievable. Companies must limit certain kinds
of "conventional pollutants" (such as suspended solids and
acidity) by "best conventional control technology."

CLEAN AIR ACT

The centerpiece of the legislative effort to clean the atmosphere
is the Clean Air Act of 1970 (amended in 1975, 1977, and
1990). Under this act, the EPA has set two levels of National
Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). The primary
standards limit the ambient (i.e., circulating) pollution that
affects human health; secondary standards limit pollution that
affects animals, plants, and property. The heart of the Clean
Air Act is the requirement that subject to EPA approval, the
states implement the standards that the EPA establishes. The
setting of these pollutant standards was coupled with directing
the states to develop state implementation plans (SIPs),
applicable to appropriate industrial sources in the state, in
order to achieve these standards. The act was amended in 1977
and 1990 primarily to set new goals (dates) for achieving
322 | ADMINISTRATIVE AND ENVIRONMENTAL LAW

attainment of NAAQS since many areas of the country had
failed to meet the deadlines.

   Beyond the NAAQS, the EPA has established several
specific standards to control different types of air pollution.
One major type is pollution that mobile sources, mainly
automobiles, emit. The EPA requires new cars to be equipped
with catalytic converters and to use unleaded gasoline to
eliminate the most noxious fumes and to keep them from
escaping into the atmosphere. To minimize pollution from
stationary sources, the EPA also imposes uniform standards on
new industrial plants and those that have been substantially
modernized. And to safeguard against emissions from older
plants, states must promulgate and enforce SIPs.

   The Clean Air Act is even more solicitous of air quality in
certain parts of the nation, such as designated wilderness areas
and national parks. For these areas, the EPA has set standards
to prevent significant deterioration in order to keep the air as
pristine and clear as it was centuries ago.

TOXIC WASTE

The EPA also worries about chemicals so toxic that the tiniest
quantities could prove fatal or extremely hazardous to health.
To control emission of substances like asbestos, beryllium,
mercury, vinyl chloride, benzene, and arsenic, the EPA has
established or proposed various National Emissions Standards
for Hazardous Air Pollutants. Concern over acid rain and
                    ADMINISTRATIVE AND ENVIRONMENTAL LAW | 323

other types of air pollution prompted Congress to add almost
eight hundred pages of amendments to the Clean Air Act
in 1990. (The original act was fifty pages long.) As a result
of these amendments, the act was modernized in a manner
that parallels other environmental laws. For instance, the
amendments established a permit system that is modeled after
the Clean Water Act. And the amendments provide for felony
convictions for willful violations, similar to penalties
incorporated into other statutes.

   The amendments include certain defenses for industry.
Most important, companies are protected from allegations
that they are violating the law by showing that they were acting
in accordance with a permit. In addition to this "permit
shield," the law also contains protection for workers who
unintentionally violate the law while following their
employers' instructions.

   Though pollution of the air by highly toxic substances like
benzene or vinyl chloride may seem a problem removed from
that of the ordinary person, we are all in fact polluters. Every
year, the United States generates approximately 230 million
tons of "trash"--about 4.6 pounds per person per day. Less
than one-quarter of it is recycled; the rest is incinerated or
buried in landfills. But many of the country's landfills have
been closed, either because they were full or because they were
contaminating groundwater. Once groundwater is
contaminated, it is extremely expensive and difficult to clean
it up. In the 1965 Solid Waste Disposal Act and the 1970
324 | ADMINISTRATIVE AND ENVIRONMENTAL LAW

Resource Recovery Act, Congress sought to regulate the
discharge of garbage by encouraging waste management and
recycling. Federal grants were available for research and
training, but the major regulatory effort was expected to come
from the states and municipalities.

   But shocking news prompted Congress to get tough in
1976. The plight of homeowners near Love Canal in upstate
New York became a major national story as the discovery of
massive underground leaks of toxic chemicals buried during
the previous quarter century led to evacuation of hundreds of
homes. Next came the revelation that Kepone, an exceedingly
toxic pesticide, had been dumped into the James River in
Virginia, causing a major human health hazard and severe
damage to fisheries in the James and downstream in the
Chesapeake Bay. The rarely discussed industrial dumping of
hazardous wastes now became an open controversy, and
Congress responded in 1976 with the Resource Conservation
and Recovery Act (RCRA) and the Toxic Substances Control
Act (TSCA) and in 1980 with the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act
(CERCLA).

   The RCRA expresses a "cradle-to-grave" philosophy:
hazardous wastes must be regulated at every stage. The act
gives the EPA power to govern their creation, storage,
transport, treatment, and disposal. Any person or company
that generates hazardous waste must obtain a permit (known
as a "manifest") either to store it on its own site or ship it
                    ADMINISTRATIVE AND ENVIRONMENTAL LAW | 325

to an EPA-approved treatment, storage, or disposal facility.
No longer can hazardous substances simply be dumped at a
convenient landfill. Owners and operators of such sites must
show that they can pay for damage growing out of their
operations, and even after the sites are closed to further
dumping, they must set aside funds to monitor and maintain
the sites safely.

   This philosophy can be severe. In 1986, the Supreme Court
ruled that bankruptcy is not a sufficient reason for a company
to abandon toxic waste dumps if state regulations reasonably
require protection in the interest of public health or safety.
The practical effect of the ruling is that trustees of the
bankrupt company must first devote assets to cleaning up a
dump site, and only from remaining assets may they satisfy
creditors. Another severity is RCRA's imposition of criminal
liability, including fines of up to $25,000 a day and one-year
prison sentences, which can be extended beyond owners to
individual employees.

   The CERCLA, also known as the Superfund, gives the EPA
emergency powers to respond to public health or
environmental dangers from faulty hazardous waste disposal,
currently estimated to occur at more than seventeen thousand
sites around the country. The EPA can direct immediate
removal of wastes presenting imminent danger (e.g., from
train wrecks, oil spills, leaking barrels, and fires). Injuries can be
sudden and devastating; in 1979, for example, when a freight
train derailed in Florida, ninety thousand pounds of chlorine
326 | ADMINISTRATIVE AND ENVIRONMENTAL LAW

gas escaped from a punctured tank car, leaving 8 motorists
dead and 183 others injured and forcing 3,500 residents within
a 7-mile radius to be evacuated. The EPA may also carry out
"planned removals" when the danger is substantial, even if
immediate removal is not necessary.

   The EPA prods owners who can be located to voluntarily
clean up sites they have abandoned. But if the owners refuse,
the EPA and the states will undertake the task, drawing on a
federal trust fund financed mainly by taxes on the manufacture
or import of certain chemicals and petroleum (the balance of
the fund comes from general revenues). States must finance 10
percent of the cost of cleaning up private sites and 50 percent
of the cost of cleaning up public facilities. The EPA and the
states can then assess unwilling owners' punitive damages up
to triple the cleanup costs.

   Cleanup requirements are especially controversial when
applied to landowners who innocently purchased
contaminated property. To deal with this problem, Congress
enacted the Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act
in 1986, which protects innocent landowners who--at the
time of purchase--made an "appropriate inquiry" into the
prior uses of the property. The act also requires companies to
publicly disclose information about hazardous chemicals they
use. We now turn to other laws regulating chemical hazards.
                    ADMINISTRATIVE AND ENVIRONMENTAL LAW | 327

CHEMICAL HAZARDS

Toxic Substances Control Act

Chemical substances that decades ago promised to improve
the quality of life have lately shown their negative side--they
have serious adverse side effects. For example, asbestos, in use
for half a century, causes cancer and asbestosis, a debilitating
lung disease, in workers who breathed in fibers decades ago.
The result has been crippling disease and death and more than
thirty thousand asbestos-related lawsuits filed nationwide.
Other substances, such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)
and dioxin, have caused similar tragedy. Together, the
devastating effects of chemicals led to enactment of the TSCA,
designed to control the manufacture, processing, commercial
distribution, use, and disposal of chemicals that pose
unreasonable health or environmental risks. (The TSCA does
not apply to pesticides, tobacco, nuclear materials, firearms
and ammunition, food, food additives, drugs, and
cosmetics--all are regulated by other federal laws.)

   The TSCA gives the EPA
authority to screen for
health and environmental
risks by requiring companies
to notify the EPA ninety
days before manufacturing
or importing new chemicals. The EPA may demand that the
328 | ADMINISTRATIVE AND ENVIRONMENTAL LAW

companies test the substances before marketing them and may
regulate them in a number of ways, such as requiring the
manufacturer to label its products, to keep records on its
manufacturing and disposal processes, and to document all
significant adverse reactions in people exposed to the
chemicals. The EPA also has authority to ban certain especially
hazardous substances, and it has banned the further
production of PCBs and many uses of asbestos.

   Both industry groups and consumer groups have attacked
the TSCA. Industry groups criticize the act because the
enforcement mechanism requires mountainous paperwork
and leads to widespread delay. Consumer groups complain
because the EPA has been slow to act against numerous
chemical substances. The debate continues.

     Key Takeaways

     Laws limiting the use of one's property have been
     around for many years; common-law restraints (e.g.,
             ADMINISTRATIVE AND ENVIRONMENTAL LAW | 329

the law of nuisance) exist as causes of action against
those who would use their property to adversely
affect the life or health of others or the value of their
neighbors' property. Since the 1960s, extensive
federal laws governing the environment have been
enacted. These include laws governing air, water,
and chemicals. Some laws include criminal penalties
for noncompliance.

CRIMINAL LAW

     Learning Objectives

     After reading this chapter, you should be able to do
     the following:

         1. Explain how criminal law differs from civil law.
         2. Categorize the various types of crimes and

             define the most serious felonies.
         3. Discuss and question the criminal "intent" of a

             corporation.
         4. Explain basic criminal procedure and the rights

             of criminal defendants.

At times, unethical behavior by businesspeople can be extreme
enough that society will respond by criminalizing certain kinds
of activities. Ponzi schemes, arson, various kinds of fraud,
                                                                 CRIMINAL LAW | 331

embezzlement, racketeering, foreign corrupt practices, tax
evasion, and insider trading are just a few. A corporation can
face large fines, and corporate managers can face both fines
and jail sentences for violating criminal laws. This chapter aims
to explain how criminal law differs from civil law, to discuss
various types of crimes, and to relate the basic principles of
criminal procedure.

8.1 The Nature of Criminal Law

Criminal law is the most ancient branch of the law. Many
wise observers have tried to define and explain it, but the
explanations often include many complex and subtle
distinctions. A traditional criminal law course would include
a lot of discussions on criminal intent, the nature of criminal
versus civil responsibility, and the constitutional rights
accorded the accused. But in this chapter, we will consider
only the most basic aspects of intent, responsibility, and
constitutional rights.

                                         Unlike civil actions,
                                      where plaintiffs seek
                                      compensation or other
                                      remedies for themselves,
                                      crimes involve "the state"
(the federal government, a state government, or some subunit
of state government). This is because crimes involve some
"harm to society" and not just harm to certain individuals. But
332 | CRIMINAL LAW

"harm to society" is not always evident in the act itself. For
example, two friends of yours at a party argue, take the
argument outside, and blows are struck; one has a bloody nose
and immediately goes home. The crimes of assault and battery
have been committed, even though no one else knows about
the fight and the friends later make up. By contrast, suppose
a major corporation publicly announces that it is closing
operations in your community and moving operations to
Southeast Asia. There is plenty of harm to society as the plant
closes down and no new jobs take the place of the company's
jobs. Although the effects on society are greater in the second
example, only the first example is a crime.

   Crimes are generally defined by legislatures, in statutes; the
statutes describe in general terms the nature of the conduct
they wish to criminalize. For government punishment to be
fair, citizens must have clear notice of what is criminally
prohibited. Ex post facto laws--laws created "after the fact"
to punish an act that was legal at the time--are expressly
prohibited by the US Constitution. Overly vague statutes can
also be struck down by courts under a constitutional doctrine
known as "void for vagueness."

What is considered a crime will also vary from society to
society and from time to time. For example, while cocaine
use was legal in the United States at one time, it is now a
controlled substance, and unauthorized use is now a crime.
Medical marijuana was not legal fifty years ago when its use
                                                                CRIMINAL LAW | 333

began to become widespread, and in some states its use or
possession was a felony. Now, some states make it legal to use
or possess it under some circumstances. In the United States,
you can criticize and make jokes about the president of the
United States without committing a crime, but in many
countries it is a serious criminal act to criticize a public official.

   It is often said that
ignorance of the law is no
excuse. But there are far too
many criminal laws for
anyone to know them all.
Also, because most people
do not actually read statutes, the question of "criminal intent"
comes up right away: if you don't know that the legislature has
made driving without a seat belt fastened a misdemeanor, you
cannot have intended to harm society. You might even argue
that there is no harm to anyone but yourself!

   The usual answer to this is that the phrase "ignorance of
the law is no excuse" means that society (through its elected
representatives) gets to decide what is harmful to society, not
you. Still, you may ask, "Isn't it my choice whether to take
the risk of failing to wear a seat belt? Isn't this a victimless
crime? Where is the harm to society?" A policymaker or social
scientist may answer that your injuries, statistically, are
generally going to be far greater if you don't wear one and that
your choice may actually impose costs on society. For example,
you might not have enough insurance, so that a public hospital
334 | CRIMINAL LAW

will have to take care of your head injuries, injuries that would
likely have been avoided by your use of a seat belt.

   But, as just noted, it is hard to know the meaning of some
criminal laws. Teenagers hanging around the sidewalks on
Main Street were sometimes arrested for "loitering." The
constitutional void-for-vagueness doctrine has led the courts
to overturn statutes that are not clear. For example, "vagrancy"
was long held to be a crime, but US courts began some forty
years ago to overturn vagrancy and "suspicious person"
statutes on the grounds that they are too vague for people to
know what they are being asked not to do.

   This requirement that criminal statutes not be vague does
not mean that the law always defines crimes in ways that can be
easily and clearly understood. Many statutes use terminology
developed by the common-law courts. For example, a
California statute defines murder as "the unlawful killing of a
human being, with malice aforethought." If no history backed
up these words, they would be unconstitutionally vague. But
there is a rich history of judicial decisions that provides
meaning for much of the arcane language like "malice
aforethought" strewn about in the statute books.

                                      Because a crime is an act that
                                      the legislature has defined as
                                      socially harmful, the parties
                                      involved cannot agree
                                      among themselves to forget
                                                                CRIMINAL LAW | 335

a particular incident, such as a barroom brawl, if the
authorities decide to prosecute. This is one of the critical
distinctions between criminal and civil law. An assault is both
a crime and a tort. The person who was assaulted may choose
to forgive his assailant and not to sue him for damages. But
he cannot stop the prosecutor from bringing an indictment
against the assailant. (However, because of crowded dockets,
a victim that declines to press charges may cause a busy
prosecutor to choose to not to bring an indictment.)

   A crime traditionally was thought of as consisting of an
act defined as criminal--an actus reus--and the requisite
"criminal intent." Someone who has a burning desire to kill
a rival in business or romance and who may actually intend
to murder but does not act on his desire has not committed
a crime. He may have a "guilty mind"--the translation of the
Latin phrase mens rea--but he is guilty of no crime. A person
who is forced to commit a crime at gunpoint is not guilty
of a crime, because although there was an act defined as
criminal--an actus reus--there was no criminal intent. More
and more, however, crimes are defined through "strict
liability," which does not require proving a specific mental
state for conviction.

     Key Takeaway
336 | CRIMINAL LAW

     Crimes are usually defined by statute and constitute
     an offense against society. In each case, there must
     be both an act and some mens rea (criminal intent).

8.2 Types of Crimes

     Learning Objectives

     After reading this section, you should be able to do
     the following:

         1. Categorize various types of crimes.
         2. Name and define the major felonies in

             criminal law.
         3. Explain how white-collar crime differs from

             other crimes.
         4. Define a variety of white-collar crimes.

Most classifications of crime turn on the seriousness of the
                                                                    CRIMINAL LAW | 337

  act. In general, seriousness is defined by the nature or duration
  of the punishment set out in the statute. A felony1 is a crime
  punishable (usually) by imprisonment of more than one year
  or by death. (Crimes punishable by death are sometimes
  known as capital crimes; they are increasingly rare in the
  United States.) The major felonies include murder, rape,
  kidnapping, armed robbery, embezzlement, insider trading,
  fraud, and racketeering. All other crimes are usually known
  as misdemeanors2, petty offenses, or infractions. Another way
  of viewing crimes is by the type of social harm the statute
  is intended to prevent or deter, such as offenses against the
  person, offenses against property, and "white-collar," or
  business, crime.

 8.2.1 Offenses Against the Person

  7.2.1.1 Homicide Homicide is the killing of one person by
  another. Not every killing is criminal. When the law permits
  one person to kill another--for example, a soldier killing an
  enemy on the battlefield during war, or a killing in self-
  defense--the death is considered the result of justifiable

1. A serious kind of crime, usually involving potential imprisonment of
  one year or more.

2. Crimes that are less serious than a felony, involving punishment of
  less than one year in prison.
338 | CRIMINAL LAW

homicide. An excusable homicide, by contrast, is one in which
death results from an accident in which the killer is not at fault.

   All other homicides are criminal. The most severely
punished form is murder, defined as homicide committed with
"malice aforethought." This is a term with a very long history.
Boiled down to its essentials, it means that the defendant had
the intent to kill. A killing need not be premeditated for any
long period of time; the premeditation might be quite sudden,
as in a bar fight that escalates in that moment when one of the
fighters reaches for a knife with the intent to kill.

                                         Sometimes a homicide
                                      can be murder even if there
                                      is no intent to kill; an intent
                                      to inflict great bodily harm
                                      can be murder if the result is
                                      the death of another person.
A killing that takes place while a felony (such as armed
robbery) is being committed is also murder, whether or not the
killer intended any harm. This is the so-called felony murder
rule. Examples are the accidental discharge of a gun that kills
an innocent bystander or the asphyxiation death of a fireman
from smoke resulting from a fire set by an arsonist. The felony
murder rule is more significant than it sounds, because it also
applies to the accomplices of one who does the killing. Thus
the driver of a getaway car stationed a block away from the
scene of the robbery can be convicted of murder if a gun
accidentally fires during the robbery and someone is killed.
                                                                CRIMINAL LAW | 339

Manslaughter is an act of killing that does not amount to
murder. Voluntary manslaughter is an intentional killing, but
one carried out in the "sudden heat of passion" as the result of
some provocation. An example is a fight that gets out of hand.
Involuntary manslaughter entails a lesser degree of willfulness;
it usually occurs when someone has taken a reckless action that
results in death (e.g., a death resulting from a traffic accident in
which one driver recklessly runs a red light).

8.2.1.2 Assault and Battery Ordinarily, we would say
that a person who has struck another has "assaulted" him.
Technically, that is a battery--the unlawful application of
force to another person. The force need not be violent. Indeed,
a man who kisses a woman is guilty of a battery if he does it
against her will. The other person may consent to the force.
That is one reason why surgeons require patients to sign
consent forms, giving the doctor permission to operate. In the
absence of such a consent, an operation is a battery. That is
also why football players are not constantly being charged with
battery. Those who agree to play football agree to submit to the
rules of the game, which of course include the right to tackle.
But the consent does not apply to all acts of physical force: a
hockey player who hits an opponent over the head with his
stick can be prosecuted for the crime of battery.

   Criminal assault is an attempt to commit a battery or the
deliberate placing of another in fear of receiving an immediate
battery. If you throw a rock at a friend, but he manages to
340 | CRIMINAL LAW

dodge it, you have committed an assault. Some states limit an
assault to an attempt to commit a battery by one who has
a "present ability" to do so. Pointing an unloaded gun and
threatening to shoot would not be an assault, nor, of course,
could it be a battery. The modem tendency, however, is to
define an assault as an attempt to commit a battery by one with
an apparent ability to do so.

   Assault and battery may be excused. For example, a bar
owner (or her agent, the bouncer) may use reasonable force to
remove an unruly patron. If the use of force is excessive, the
bouncer can be found guilty of assault and battery, and a civil
action could arise against the bar owner as well.

8.2.2 Offenses against Property
   8.2.2.1 Theft: Larceny, Robbery, Embezzlement,

False Pretenses The concept of theft is familiar enough. Less
familiar is the way the law has treated various aspects of the act
of stealing. Criminal law distinguishes among many different
crimes that are popularly known as theft. Many technical
words have entered the language--burglary, larceny,
robbery--but are often used inaccurately. Brief definitions of
the more common terms are discussed here.

   The basic crime of stealing personal property is larceny. By
its old common-law definition, still in use today, larceny is the
wrongful "taking and carrying away of the personal property
of another with intent to steal the same."
                                                                 CRIMINAL LAW | 341

                                         The separate elements of
                                      this offense have given rise to
                                      all kinds of difficult cases.
                                      Take the theft of fruit, for
                                      example, with regard to the
                                      essential element of
                                      "personal property." If a
                                      man walking through an
                                      orchard plucks a peach from
                                      a tree and eats it, he is not
                                      guilty of larceny because he
                                      has not taken away personal
                                      property (the peach is part
of the land, being connected to the tree). But if he picks up a
peach lying on the ground, he is guilty of larceny. Or consider
the element of "taking" or "carrying away." Sneaking into a
movie theater without paying is not an act of larceny (though
in most states it is a criminal act). Taking electricity by tapping
into the power lines of an electric utility was something that
baffled judges late in the nineteenth century because it was not
clear whether electricity is a "something" that can be taken.
Modern statutes have tended to make clear that electricity can
be the object of larceny. Or consider the element of an "intent
to steal the same." If you borrow your friend's BMW without
his permission in order to go to the grocery store, intending to
return it within a few minutes and then do return it, you have
not committed larceny. But if you meet another friend at the
   342 | CRIMINAL LAW

  store who convinces you to take a long joyride with the car and
  you return hours later, you may have committed larceny.

     A particular form of larceny is robbery, which is defined as
  larceny from a person by means of violence or intimidation.
  Larceny involves the taking of property from the possession of
  another. Suppose that a person legitimately comes to possess
  the property of another and wrongfully appropriates it--for
  example, an automobile mechanic entrusted with your car
  refuses to return it, or a bank teller who is entitled to
  temporary possession of cash in his drawer takes it home with
  him. The common law had trouble with such cases because
  the thief in these cases already had possession; his crime was
  in assuming ownership. Today, such wrongful conversion,
  known as embezzlement3, has been made a statutory offense in
  all states.

     Statutes against larceny and embezzlement did not cover
  all the gaps in the law. A conceptual problem arises in the
  case of one who is tricked into giving up his title to property.
  In larceny and embezzlement, the thief gains possession or
  ownership without any consent of the owner or custodian
  of the property. Suppose, however, that an automobile dealer
  agrees to take his customer's present car as a trade-in. The

                                                                   CRIMINAL LAW | 343

  customer says that he has full title to the car. In fact, the
  customer is still paying off an installment loan and the finance
  company has an interest in the old car. If the finance company
  repossesses the car, the customer--who got a new car at a
  discount because of his false representation--cannot be said
  to have taken the new car by larceny or embezzlement.
  Nevertheless, he tricked the dealer into selling, and the dealer
  will have lost the value of the repossessed car. Obviously, the
  customer is guilty of a criminal act; the statutes outlawing it
  refer to this trickery as the crime of false pretenses4, defined
  as obtaining ownership of the property of another by making
  untrue representations of fact with intent to defraud.

  A number of problems have arisen in the judicial
  interpretation of false-pretense statutes. One concerns
  whether the taking is permanent or only temporary. The case
  of State v. Mills shows the subtle questions that can be
  presented and the dangers inherent in committing "a little
  fraud."

     In the Mills case, the claim was that a mortgage instrument
  dealing with one parcel of land was used instead for another.
  This is a false representation of fact. Suppose, by contrast, that
  a person misrepresents his state of mind: "I will pay you back

4. A form of larceny in which the rightful owner is tricked into giving
  up title to his or her property.
   344 | CRIMINAL LAW

  tomorrow," he says, knowing full well that he does not intend
  to. Can such a misrepresentation amount to false pretenses
  punishable as a criminal offense? In most jurisdictions it
  cannot. A false-pretense violation relates to a past event or
  existing fact, not to a statement of intention. If it were
  otherwise, anyone failing to pay a debt might find himself
  facing criminal prosecution, and business would be less prone
  to take risks.

     The problem of proving intent is especially difficult when a
  person has availed himself of the services of another without
  paying. A common example is someone leaving a restaurant
  without paying for the meal. In most states, this is specifically
  defined in the statutes as theft of services.

     8.2.2.2 Receiving Stolen Property One who engages
  in receiving stolen property5 with knowledge that it is stolen is
  guilty of a felony or misdemeanor, depending on the value of
  the property. The receipt need not be personal; if the property
  is delivered to a place under the control of the receiver, then
  he is deemed to have received it. "Knowledge" is construed
  broadly: not merely actual knowledge, but (correct) belief and
  suspicion (strong enough not to investigate for fear that the

  another person, knowing that it has been stolen, you have committed
  either a misdemeanor or a felony.
                                                                CRIMINAL LAW | 345

property will turn out to have been stolen) are sufficient for
conviction.

   8.2.2.3 Forgery Forgery is false writing of a document of
legal significance (or apparent legal significance!) with intent
to defraud. It includes the making up of a false document
or the alteration of an existing one. The writing need not be
done by hand but can be by any means--typing, printing,
and so forth. Documents commonly the subject of forgery are
negotiable instruments (checks, money orders, and the like),
deeds, receipts, contracts, and bills of lading. The forged
instrument must itself be false, not merely contain a falsehood.
If you fake your neighbor's signature on one of his checks
made out to cash, you have committed forgery. But if you sign
a check of your own that is made out to cash, knowing that
there is no money in your checking account, the instrument is
not forged, though the act may be criminal if done with the
intent to defraud.

The mere making of a
forged instrument is
unlawful. So is the
"uttering" (or presentation)
of such an instrument,
whether or not the one
uttering it actually forged it. The usual example of a false
signature is by no means the only way to commit forgery. If
done with intent to defraud, the backdating of a document,
346 | CRIMINAL LAW

the modification of a corporate name, or the filling in of lines
left blank on a form can all constitute forgery.

   8.2.2.4 Extortion Under common law, extortion could
only be committed by a government official, who corruptly
collected an unlawful fee under color of office. A common
example is a salaried building inspector who refuses to issue a
permit unless the permittee pays him. Under modern statutes,
the crime of extortion has been broadened to include the
wrongful collection of money or something else of value by
anyone by means of a threat (short of a threat of immediate
physical violence, for such a threat would make the demand
an act of robbery). This kind of extortion is usually called
blackmail. The blackmail threat commonly is to expose some
fact of the victim's private life or to make a false accusation
about him.

8.2.3 Offenses against Habitation and
Other Offenses

8.2.3.1 Burglary Burglary is not a crime against property.
It is defined as "the breaking and entering of the dwelling of
another in the nighttime with intent to commit a felony." The
intent to steal is not an issue: a man who sneaks into a woman's
home intent on raping her has committed a burglary, even if he
does not carry out the act. The student doing critical thinking
will no doubt notice that the definition provides plenty of
                                                                CRIMINAL LAW | 347

room for argument. What is "breaking"? (The courts do not
require actual destruction; the mere opening of a closed door,
even if unlocked, is enough.) What is entry? When does night
begin? What kind of intent? Whose dwelling? Can a landlord
burglarize the dwelling of his tenant? (Yes.) Can a person
burglarize her own home? (No.)

   8.2.3.2 Arson Under common law, arson was the
malicious burning of the dwelling of another. Burning one's
own house for purposes of collecting insurance was not an
act of arson under common law. The statutes today make it a
felony intentionally to set fire to any building, whether or not
it is a dwelling and whether or not the purpose is to collect
insurance.

   8.2.3.3 Bribery Bribery is a corrupt payment (or receipt
of such a payment) for official action. The payment can be in
cash or in the form of any goods, intangibles, or services that
the recipient would find valuable. Under common law, only a
public official could be bribed. In most states, bribery charges
can result from the bribe of anyone performing a public
function.

Bribing a public official in government procurement
(contracting) can result in serious criminal charges. Bribing a
public official in a foreign country to win a contract can result
in charges under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.

   8.2.3.4 Perjury Perjury is the crime of giving a false
oath, either orally or in writing, in a judicial or other official
   348 | CRIMINAL LAW

  proceeding (lies made in proceedings other than courts are
  sometimes termed "false swearing"). To be perjurious, the oath
  must have been made corruptly--that is, with knowledge that
  it was false or without sincere belief that it was true. An
  innocent mistake is not perjury. A statement, though true, is
  perjury if the maker of it believes it to be false. Statements such
  as "I don't remember" or "to the best of my knowledge" are
  not sufficient to protect a person who is lying from conviction
  for perjury. To support a charge of perjury, however, the false
  statement must be "material," meaning that the statement is
  relevant to whatever the court is trying to find out.

 8.2.4 Business Crime

  Business6 crime, as distinguished from "street crime," refers
  generally to fraud-related acts carried out in a nonviolent way,
  usually connected with business. Armed bank robbery is not
  a business crime, but embezzlement by a teller or bank officer
  is. Many business crimes are included within the statutory
  definitions of embezzlement and false pretenses. Most are
  violations of state law. Depending on how they are carried out,
  many of these same crimes are also violations of federal law.

     Any act of fraud in which the United States postal system

  is used or which involves interstate phone calls or Internet
  connections is a violation of federal law. Likewise, many
  different acts around the buying and selling of securities can
  run afoul of federal securities laws. Other business crimes
  include tax fraud; price fixing; violations of food, drug, and
  environmental laws; corporate bribery of foreign companies;
  and--the newest form--computer fraud. Some of these are
  discussed here; others are covered in later chapters.

     8.2.4.1 Mail and Wire Fraud Federal law prohibits the
  use of the mails or any inter- state electronic communications
  medium for the purpose of furthering a "scheme or artifice
  to defraud." The statute is broad, and it is relatively easy for
  prosecutors to prove a violation. The law also bans attempts
  to defraud, so the prosecutor need not show that the scheme
  worked or that anyone suffered any losses. "Fraud" is broadly
  construed: anyone who uses the mails or telephone to defraud
  anyone else of virtually anything, not just of money, can be
  convicted under the law. In one case, a state governor was
  convicted of mail fraud when he took bribes to influence the
  setting of racing dates. The court's theory was that he
  defrauded the citizenry of its right to his "honest and faithful
  services" as governor.7

Antitrust Law In

Violations of Section 1 of

the Sherman Act, which

condemns activities in

"restraint of trade" (including price fixing), are also crimes.

8.2.4.3 Violations of the Food and Drug Act The

federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act prohibits any person

or corporation from sending into interstate commerce any

adulterated or misbranded food, drug, cosmetics, or related

device. For example, in a 2010 case, Allergen had to pay a

criminal fine for marketing Botox as a headache or pain

reliever, a use that had not been approved by the Food and

Drug Administration. Unlike most criminal statutes,

willfulness or deliberate misconduct is not an element of the

act. An executive can be held criminally liable even though she

may have had no personal knowledge of the violation.

8.2.4.4  Environmental Crimes Many federal

environmental statutes have criminal provisions. These

include the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (commonly

called the Clean Water Act); the Rivers and Harbors Act of

1899 (the Refuse Act); the Clean Air Act; the Federal

Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA); the

Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA); and the Resource

Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). Under the Clean

Water Act, for example, wrongful discharge of pollutants into
                                                                    CRIMINAL LAW | 351

  navigable waters carries a fine ranging from $2,500 to $25,000
  per day and imprisonment for up to one year. "Responsible
  corporate officers" are specifically included as potential
  defendants in criminal prosecutions under the act. They can
  include officers who have responsibility over a project where
  subcontractors and their employees actually caused the
  discharge.8

     8.2.4.5 Violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices
  Act As a byproduct of Watergate, federal officials at the
  Securities and Exchange Commission and the Internal
  Revenue Service uncovered many instances of bribes paid by
  major corporations to officials of foreign governments to win
  contracts with those governments. Congress responded in
  1977 with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which imposed
  a stringent requirement that the disposition of assets be
  accurately and fairly accounted for in a company's books and
  records. The act also made illegal the payment of bribes to
  foreign officials or to anyone who will transmit the money
  to a foreign official to assist the payor (the one offering and
  delivering the money) in getting business.

  8.2.4.6 Violations of the Racketeering Influenced and
  Corrupt Organizations Act In 1970 Congress enacted the
  Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act

352 | CRIMINAL LAW

(RICO), aimed at ending organized crime's infiltration into
legitimate business. The act tells courts to construe its
language broadly "to effectuate its remedial purpose," and
many who are not part of organized crime have been
successfully prosecuted under the act. It bans a "pattern of
racketeering," defined as the commission of at least two acts
within ten years of any of a variety of already-existing crimes,
including mail, wire, and securities fraud. The act thus makes
many types of fraud subject to severe penalties.

Key Takeaway

Offenses can be against persons, against property,
or against public policy (as when you bribe a public
official, commit perjury, or use public goods such as
the mails or the Internet to commit fraud, violate
antitrust laws, or commit other business crimes).

8.3 The Nature of a Criminal Act

     Learning Objectives

     After reading this section, you should be able to do
     the following:

         1. Understand how it is possible to commit a
             criminal act without actually doing anything
             that you think might be criminal.

         2. Analyze and explain the importance of
             intention in criminal law and criminal
             prosecutions.

         3. Explain how a corporation can be guilty of a
             crime, even though it is a corporation's agents
             that commit the crime.

To be guilty of a crime, you must have acted. Mental desire or
intent to do so is insufficient. But what constitutes an act? This
question becomes important when someone begins to commit
a crime, or does so in association with others, or intends to do
one thing but winds up doing something else.
               CRIMINAL LAW | 355

8.3.1 Attempt

It is not necessary to commit the intended crime to be found
guilty of a criminal offense. An attempt to commit the crime is
punishable as well, though usually not as severely. For example,
Brett points a gun at Ashley, intending to shoot her dead. He
pulls the trigger but his aim is off, and he misses her heart
by four feet. He is guilty of an attempt to murder. Suppose,
however, that earlier in the day, when he was preparing to
shoot Ashley, Brett had been overheard in his apartment
muttering to himself of his intention, and that a neighbor
called the police. When they arrived, he was just snapping his
gun into his shoulder holster.

   At that point, courts in most states would not consider him
guilty of an attempt because he had not passed beyond the
stage of preparation. After having buttoned his jacket he might
have reconsidered and put the gun away. Determining when
the accused has passed beyond mere preparation and taken an
actual step toward perpetrating the crime is often difficult and
is usually for the jury to decide.

8.3.2 Impossibility

What if a defendant is accused of attempting a crime that
is factually impossible? Suppose that a husband intended to
poison his wife with strychnine in her coffee, but put sugar
in the coffee instead? The "mens rea" or criminal intent was
356 | CRIMINAL LAW

there, but the act itself was not criminal (murder by poisoning
requires the use of poison). States are divided on this, but
thirty-seven states have ruled out factual impossibility as a
defense to the crime of attempt.

   Legal impossibility is different, and is usually acknowledged
as a valid defense. If the defendant completes all of his intended
acts, but those acts do not fulfill all the required elements of
a crime, there could be a successful "impossibility" defense. If
Barney (who has poor sight), shoots at a tree stump, thinking it
is his neighbor, Ralph, intending to kill him, has he committed
an attempt? Many courts would hold that he has not. But
the distinction between factual impossibility and legal
impossibility is not always clear, and the trend seems to be to
punish the intended attempt.
                  CRIMINAL LAW | 357

8.3.3 Conspiracy

Under both federal and state
laws, it is a separate offense
to work with others toward
the commission of a crime.
When two or more people
combine to carry out an
unlawful purpose, they are
engaged in a conspiracy. The
law of conspiracy is quite
broad, especially when it is
used by prosecutors in
connection with white-
collar crimes. Many people
can be swept up in the net of conspiracy, because it is
unnecessary to show that the actions they took were sufficient
to constitute either the crime or an attempt. Usually, the
prosecution needs to show only (1) an agreement and (2) a
single overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy. Thus if three
people agree to rob a bank, and if one of them goes to a store
to purchase a gun to be used in the holdup, the three can be
convicted of conspiracy to commit robbery. Even the purchase
of an automobile to be used as the getaway car could support a
conspiracy conviction.

   The act of any one of the conspirators is imputed to the
other members of the conspiracy. It does not matter, for
358 | CRIMINAL LAW

instance, that only one of the bank robbers fired the gun that
killed a guard. All can be convicted of murder. That is so even
if one of the conspirators was stationed as a lookout several
blocks away and even if he specifically told the others that his
agreement to cooperate would end "just as soon as there is
shooting."

8.3.4 Agency and Corporations

A person can be guilty of a crime if he acts through another.
Again, the usual reason for "imputing" the guilt of the actor
to another is that both were engaged in a conspiracy. But
imputation of guilt is not limited to a conspiracy. The agent
may be innocent even though he participates. A corporate
officer directs a junior employee to take a certain bag and
deliver it to the officer's home. The employee reasonably
believes that the officer is entitled to the bag. Unbeknownst
to the employee, the bag contains money that belongs to the
company, and the officer wishes to keep it. This is not a
conspiracy. The employee is not guilty of larceny, but the
officer is, because the agent's act is imputed to him.

   Since intent is a necessary component of crime, an agent's
intent cannot be imputed to his principal if the principal did
not share the intent. The company president tells her sales
manager, "Go make sure our biggest customer renews his
contract for next year"--by which she meant, "Don't ignore
our biggest customer." Standing before the customer's
                                                                CRIMINAL LAW | 359

purchasing agent, the sales manager threatens to tell the
purchasing agent's boss that the purchasing agent has been
cheating on his expense account, unless he signs a new
contract. The sales manager could be convicted of blackmail,
but the company president could not.

   Can a corporation be guilty of a crime? For many types of
crimes, the guilt of individual employees may be imputed to
the corporation. Thus the antitrust statutes explicitly state that
the corporation may be convicted and fined for violations by
employees. This is so even though the shareholders are the ones
who ultimately must pay the price--and who may have had
nothing to do with the crime nor the power to stop it. The
law of corporate criminal responsibility has been changing in
recent years. The tendency is to hold the corporation liable
under criminal law if the act has been directed by a responsible
officer or group within the corporation (the president or board
of directors).

     Key Takeaway

     Although proving the intent to commit a crime (the
     mens rea) is essential, the intent can be established
     by inference (circumstantially). Conspirators may not
360 | CRIMINAL LAW

     actually commit a crime, for example, but in
     preparing for a criminal act, they may be guilty of
     the crime of conspiracy. Certain corporate officers, as
     well, may not be directly committing criminal acts
     but may be held criminally responsible for acts of
     their agents and contractors.

8.4 Responsibility

     Learning Objectives

     After reading this section, you should be able to do
     the following:

         1. Explain why criminal law generally requires
             that the defendant charged with a
             crime have criminal "intent."

         2. Know and explain the possible excuses
             relating to responsibility that are legally
                                                                CRIMINAL LAW | 361

             recognized by courts, including lack of
             capacity.

8.4.1 In General

The mens rea requirement depends on the nature of the crime
and all the circumstances surrounding the act. In general,
though, the requirement means that the accused must in some
way have intended the criminal consequences of his act.
Suppose, for example, that Charlie gives Gabrielle a poison
capsule to swallow. That is the act. If Gabrielle dies, is Charlie
guilty of murder? The answer depends on what his state of
mind was. Obviously, if he gave it to her intending to kill her,
the act was murder.

What if he gave it to her knowing that the capsule was poison
but believing that it would only make her mildly ill? The act
is still murder, because we are all liable for the consequences of
any intentional act that may cause harm to others. But suppose
that Gabrielle had asked Harry for aspirin, and he handed her
two pills that he reasonably believed to be aspirin (they came
from the aspirin bottle and looked like aspirin) but that turned
out to be poison, the act would not be murder, because he
362 | CRIMINAL LAW

had neither intent nor a state of knowledge from which intent
could be inferred.

   Not every criminal law requires criminal intent as an
ingredient of the crime. Many regulatory codes dealing with
the public health and safety impose strict requirements.
Failure to adhere to such requirements is a violation, whether
or not the violator had mens rea.

8.4.2 Excuses That Limit or
Overcome Responsibility

8.4.2.1 Mistake of Fact and Mistake of Law Ordinarily,
ignorance of the law is not an excuse. If you believe that it is
permissible to turn right on a red light but the city ordinance
prohibits it, your belief, even if reasonable, does not excuse
your violation of the law. Under certain circumstances,
however, ignorance of law will be excused. If a statute imposes
criminal penalties for an action taken without a license, and
if the government official responsible for issuing the license
formally tells you that you do not need one (though in fact you
do), a conviction for violating the statute cannot stand. In rare
cases, a lawyer's advice, contrary to the statute, will be held to
excuse the client, but usually the client is responsible for his
attorney's mistakes. Otherwise, as it is said, the lawyer would
be superior to the law.

   Ignorance or mistake of fact more frequently will serve as
an excuse. If you take a coat from a restaurant, believing it
                                                                   CRIMINAL LAW | 363

  to be yours, you cannot be convicted of larceny if it is not.
  Your honest mistake of fact negates the requisite intent. In
  general, the rule is that a mistaken belief of fact will excuse
  criminal responsibility if (1) the belief is honestly held, (2) it
  is reasonable to hold it, and (3) the act would not have been
  criminal if the facts were as the accused supposed them to have
  been.

     8.4.2.2 Entrapment One common technique of
  criminal investigation is the use of an undercover agent or
  decoy--the policeman who poses as a buyer of drugs from
  a street dealer or the elaborate "sting" operations in which
  ostensibly stolen goods are "sold" to underworld "fences."
  Sometimes these methods are the only way by which certain
  kinds of crime can be rooted out and convictions secured.

     But a rule against entrapment9 limits the legal ability of the
  police to play the role of criminals. The police are permitted
  to use such techniques to detect criminal activity; they are
  not permitted to do so to instigate crime. The distinction is
  usually made between a person who intends to commit a crime
  and one who does not. If the police provide the former with
  an opportunity to commit a criminal act--the sale of drugs
  to an undercover agent, for example--there is no defense of

9. When a police officer or other government agent entices people to
  commit crimes they were not disposed to commit without the
  government agent's suggestions and inducements.
364 | CRIMINAL LAW

entrapment. But if the police knock on the door of one not

known to be a drug user and persist in a demand that he

purchase drugs from them, finally overcoming his will to resist,

a conviction for purchase and possession of drugs can be

overturned on the ground of entrapment.

8.4.2.3  Other Excuses A number of other

circumstances can limit or excuse criminal liability. These

include compulsion (a gun pointed at one's head by a masked

man who apparently is unafraid to use the weapon and who

demands that you help him rob a store), honest consent of

the "victim" (the quarterback who is tackled), adherence to the

requirements of legitimate public authority lawfully exercised

(a policeman directs a towing company to remove a car parked

in a tow-away zone), the proper exercise of domestic authority

(a parent may spank a child, within limits), and defense of

self, others, property, and habitation. Each of these excuses is a

complex subject in itself.

8.4.2.4 Lack of Capacity A further defense to criminal
prosecution is the lack of mental capacity to commit the crime.
Infants and children are considered incapable of committing
a crime; under common law any child under the age of seven
could not be prosecuted for any act. That age of incapacity
varies from state to state and is now usually defined by statutes.
Likewise, insanity or mental disease or defect can be a complete
defense. Intoxication can be a defense to certain crimes, but the
mere fact of drunkenness is not ordinarily sufficient.

Key Takeaway
366 | CRIMINAL LAW

     In the United States, some crimes can be committed
     by not following strict regulatory requirements for
     health, safety, or the environment. The law does
     provide excuses from criminal liability for mistakes of
     fact, entrapment, and lack of capacity.

8.5 Procedure

     Learning Objectives

     After reading this section, you should be able to do
     the following:

         1. Describe the basic steps in pretrial criminal
             procedure that follow a government's
             determination to arrest someone for an
             alleged criminal act.

                                                                CRIMINAL LAW | 367

The procedure for criminal prosecutions is complex.
Procedures will vary from state to state. A criminal case begins
with an arrest if the defendant is caught in the act or fleeing
from the scene; if the defendant is not caught, a warrant for the
defendant's arrest will issue. The warrant is issued by a judge
or a magistrate upon receiving a complaint detailing the charge
of a specific crime against the accused. It is not enough for
a police officer to go before a judge and say, "I'd like you to
arrest Bonnie because I think she's just murdered Clyde." She
must supply enough information to satisfy the magistrate that
there is probable cause (reasonable grounds) to believe that the
accused committed the crime. The warrant will be issued to
any officer or agency that has power to arrest the accused with
warrant in hand.

   The accused will be brought before the magistrate for a
preliminary hearing. The purpose of the hearing is to
determine whether there is sufficient reason to hold the
accused for trial. If so, the accused can be sent to jail or be
permitted to make bail. Bail is a sum of money paid to the
court to secure the defendant's attendance at trial. If he fails
to appear, he forfeits the money. Constitutionally, bail can be
withheld only if there is reason to believe that the accused will
flee the jurisdiction.

   Once the arrest is made, the case is in the hands of the
prosecutor. In the fifty states, prosecution is a function of the
district attorney's office. These offices are usually organized
on a county- by-county basis. In the federal system, criminal
     368 | CRIMINAL LAW

   prosecution is handled by the office of the US attorney, one of
   whom is appointed for every federal district.

      Following the preliminary hearing, the prosecutor must
   either file an information formal charge that a less serious
   crime has been committed. (a document stating the crime of
   which the person being held is accused) or ask the grand jury10
   for an indictment.11

      The grand jury consists of twenty-three people who sit to
   determine whether there is sufficient evidence to warrant a
   prosecution. It does not sit to determine guilt or innocence.
   The indictment is the grand jury's formal declaration of
   charges on which the accused will be tried. If indicted, the
   accused formally becomes a defendant.

      The defendant will then be arraigned, that is, brought
   before a judge to answer the accusation in the indictment.
   The defendant may plead guilty or not guilty. If he pleads not
   guilty, the case will be tried before a jury (sometimes referred

10. A group of citizens that hear the state's evidence and determine
    whether a reasonable basis (probable cause) exists for believing that a
    crime has been committed and thus that a criminal proceeding
    should be brought against a defendant.

11. A formal charge that a serious crime has been committed; where a
    grand jury is convened, an indictment may issue if probable cause is
    found.
                                                                     CRIMINAL LAW | 369

   to as a petit jury). The jury cannot convict unless it finds the
   defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.12

   The defendant might have
   pleaded guilty to the offense
   or to a lesser charge (often
   referred to as a "lesser
   included offense"--simple
   larceny, for example, is a
   lesser included offense of
   robbery because the
   defendant may not have
   used violence but
   nevertheless stole from the
   victim). Such a plea is
   usually arranged through plea bargaining with the
   prosecution. In return for the plea, the prosecutor promises to
   recommend to the judge that the sentence be limited. The
   judge most often, but not always, goes along with the
   prosecutor's recommendation.

      The defendant is also permitted to file a plea of nolo
   contendere (no contest) in prosecutions for certain crimes. In

12. The prosecutor must prove how each element of the offense charged
    is "beyond a reasonable doubt." This is more difficult than satisfying
    the "preponderance of the evidence" standard in civil cases.
370 | CRIMINAL LAW

so doing, he neither affirms nor denies his guilt. He may be
sentenced as though he had pleaded guilty, although usually
a nolo plea is the result of a plea bargain. Why plead nolo?
In some offenses, such as violations of the antitrust laws, the
statutes provide that private plaintiffs may use a conviction
or a guilty plea as proof that the defendant violated the law.
This enables a plaintiff to prove liability without putting on
witnesses or evidence and reduces the civil trial to a hearing
about the damages to plaintiff. The nolo plea permits the
defendant to avoid this, so that any plaintiff will have to not
only prove damages but also establish civil liability.

   Following a guilty plea or a verdict of guilt, the judge will
impose a sentence after presentencing reports are written by
various court officials (often, probation officers). Permissible
sentences are spelled out in statutes, though these frequently
give the judge a range within which to work (e.g., twenty years
to life). The judge may sentence the defendant to
imprisonment, a fine, or both, or may decide to suspend
sentence (i.e., the defendant will not have to serve the sentence
as long as he stays out of trouble).

   Sentencing usually comes before appeal. As in civil cases,
the defendant, now convicted, has the right to take at least
one appeal to higher courts, where issues of procedure and
constitutional rights may be argued.
              CRIMINAL LAW | 371

Key Takeaway

Criminal procedure in US courts is designed to
provide a fair process to both criminal defendants
and to society. The grand jury system, prosecutorial
discretion, plea bargains, and appeals for lack of a
fair trial are all part of US criminal procedure.

8.6 Constitutional Rights of the
Accused

     Learning Objectives

     After reading this section, you should be able to do
     the following:

         1. Describe the most significant constitutional
             rights of defendants in US courts, and name
             the source of these rights.

         2. Explain the Exclusionary rule and the reason
             for its existence.

8.6.1 Search and Seizure

The rights of those accused of a crime are spelled out in four
of the ten constitutional amendments that make up the Bill of
Rights (Amendments Four, Five, Six, and Eight). For the most
part, these amendments have been held to apply to both the
                                                                     CRIMINAL LAW | 373

   federal and the state governments. The Fourth Amendment
   says in part that "the right of the people to be secure in their
   persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable
   searches and seizures, shall not be violated." Although there
   are numerous and tricky exceptions to the general rule,
   ordinarily the police may not break into a person's house or
   confiscate his papers or arrest him unless they have a warrant
   to do so. This means, for instance, that a policeman cannot
   simply stop you on a street corner and ask to see what is in your
   pockets (a power the police enjoy in many other countries),
   nor can your home be raided without probable cause to believe
   that you have committed a crime. Here are some specifics:

      Under the Supreme Court case Terry v. Ohio13, police can
   briefly detain and pat down a suspect when there is
   "reasonable suspicion" of criminal activity.14 Beyond that brief
   type of interaction, police need probable cause and a warrant
   to search or seize, with several important exceptions. Police do
   not need a warrant when, for example:

       No reasonable expectation of privacy exists, such as in
         garbage on the street;

13. 392 U.S. 1 (1968).
14. Reasonable suspicion means "specific and articulable facts" based on

    surrounding circumstances. Reasonable suspicion for detainment
    ("stop") and pat down ("frisk") are different.
     374 | CRIMINAL LAW

       Responding to an emergency;
       Searching a vehicle (probable cause is still needed, but

         not a warrant); or
       Searching incident to an arrest.

   What if the police do search or seize unreasonably? The courts
   have devised a remedy for the use at trial of the fruits of an
   unlawful search or seizure. Evidence that is unconstitutionally
   seized is excluded from the trial. This is the so-called
   exclusionary rule, first made applicable in federal cases in 1914
   and brought home to the states in 1961. The exclusionary
   rule15 is highly controversial, and there are numerous
   exceptions to it. But it remains generally true that the
   prosecutor may not use evidence willfully taken by the police
   in violation of constitutional rights generally, and most often
   in the violation of Fourth Amendment rights. (The fruits of a
   coerced confession are also excluded.)

  8.6.2 Double Jeopardy

   The Fifth Amendment prohibits the government from
   prosecuting a person twice for the same offense. The

15. Evidence obtained in violation of constitutional rights from the
    Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments are generally not admissible at
    trial.
                                                                CRIMINAL LAW | 375

amendment says that no person shall be "subject for the same
offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb." If a
defendant is acquitted, the government may not appeal. If a
defendant is convicted and his conviction is upheld on appeal,
he may not thereafter be re-prosecuted for the same crime.
Please note, this does not stop two different sovereigns from
bringing similar charges. Thus, it is not double jeopardy to
be tried twice, once by a state, and again by the federal
government, based on the same actions.

8.6.3 Self-Incrimination

The Fifth Amendment is also the source of a person's right
against self-incrimination (no person "shall be compelled in
any criminal case to be a witness against himself"). The debate
over the limits of this right has given rise to an immense
literature. In broadest outline, the right against self-
incrimination means that the prosecutor may not call a
defendant to the witness stand during trial and may not
comment to the jury on the defendant's failure to take the
stand. Moreover, a defendant's confession must be excluded
from evidence if it was not voluntarily made (e.g., if the police
beat the person into giving a confession). In Miranda v.
Arizona, the Supreme Court ruled that confessions made (1)
once in custody, and (2) in response to interrogation, are not
admissible if the police have not first advised a suspect of his
constitutional rights, including the right to have a lawyer
     376 | CRIMINAL LAW

   present to advise him during the questioning.16 These so-called
   Miranda warnings have prompted scores of follow-up cases
   that have made this branch of jurisprudence especially
   complex.

  8.6.4 Speedy Trial

   The Sixth Amendment tells the government that it must try
   defendants speedily. How long a delay is too long depends on
   the circumstances in each case. In 1975, Congress enacted the
   Speedy Trial Act to give priority to criminal cases in federal
   courts. It requires all criminal prosecutions to go to trial within
   seventy-five days (though the law lists many permissible
   reasons for delay). In Iowa, the time frame is one year. If the
   prosecution fails to try the case in that time, the case may be
   dismissed unless the defendant waives their right to a speedy
   trial.17

  8.6.5 Cross-Examination

   The Sixth Amendment also says that the defendant shall have

16. Miranda v. Arizona, 384 US 436 (1966).

the right to confront witnesses against him. No testimony is
permitted to be shown to the jury unless the person making it
is present and subject to cross-examination by the defendant's
counsel.

8.6.6 Assistance of Counsel

The Sixth Amendment guarantees criminal defendants the
right to have the assistance of defense counsel. During the
eighteenth century and before, the British courts frequently
refused to permit defendants to have lawyers in the courtroom
during trial. The right to counsel is much broader in this
country, as the result of Supreme Court decisions that require
the state to pay for a lawyer for indigent defendants in most
criminal cases.

8.6.7 Cruel and Unusual Punishment

Punishment under the common law was frequently
horrifying. Death was a common punishment for relatively
minor crimes. In many places throughout the world,
punishments still persist that seem cruel and unusual, such
as the practice of stoning someone to death. The guillotine,
famously in use during and after the French Revolution, is no
longer used, nor are defendants put in stocks for public display
and humiliation. In pre-Revolutionary America, an unlucky
378 | CRIMINAL LAW

defendant who found himself convicted could face brutal
torture before death.

   The Eighth Amendment banned these actions with the
words that "cruel and unusual punishments [shall not be]
inflicted." Virtually all such punishments either never were
enacted or have been eliminated from the statute books in
the United States. Nevertheless, the Eighth Amendment has
become a source of controversy, first with the Supreme Court's
ruling in 1976 that the death penalty, as haphazardly applied
in the various states, amounted to cruel and unusual
punishment. Later Supreme Court opinions have made it
easier for states to administer the death penalty. As of 2020,
there were 2,620 defendants on death row in the United States.
Of course, no corporation is on death row, and no
corporation's charter has ever been revoked by a US state, even
though some corporations have repeatedly been indicted and
convicted of criminal offenses.

8.6.8 Presumption of Innocence

The most important constitutional right in the US criminal
justice system is the presumption of innocence. The Supreme
Court has repeatedly cautioned lower courts in the United
States that juries must be properly instructed that the
defendant is innocent until proven guilty. This is the origin
of the "beyond all reasonable doubt" standard of proof and
is an instruction given to juries in each criminal case. The
                                                                CRIMINAL LAW | 379

Fifth Amendment notes the right of "due process" in federal
proceedings, and the Fourteenth Amendment requires that
each state provide "due process" to defendants.

     Key Takeaway

     The US Constitution provides several important
     protections for criminal defendants, including a
     prohibition on the use of evidence that has been
     obtained by unconstitutional means. This would
     include evidence seized in violation of the Fourth
     Amendment and confessions obtained in violation of
     the Fifth Amendment.

In civil litigation, contract and tort claims are by far the most
numerous. The law attempts to adjust for harms done by
awarding damages to a successful plaintiff who demonstrates
that the defendant was the cause of the plaintiff's losses. Torts
can be intentional torts, negligent torts, or strict liability torts.
Employers must be aware that in many circumstances, their
employees may create liability in tort. This chapter explains
the different kind of torts, as well as available defenses to tort
claims.

             in tort.

9.1.1 Definition of Tort

The term tort is the French equivalent of the English word
wrong. The word tort is also derived from the Latin word
tortum, which means twisted or crooked or wrong, in contrast
to the word rectum, which means straight (rectitude uses that
Latin root). Thus conduct that is twisted or crooked and not
straight is a tort. The term was introduced into the English law
by the Norman jurists.

   The idea of tort law is even more ancient than the term. The
ancient Greek poem The Iliad says:

       But Achilles hath wrought to fury the proud
       heart within him, cruel man! neither recketh he
       of the love of his comrades wherewith we ever
       honoured him amid the ships above all
       others--pitiless one! Lo, a man accepteth
       recompense from the slayer of his brother, or for
       his dead son; and the slayer abideth in his own
       land for the paying of a great price, and the
                                             INTRODUCTION TO TORT LAW | 383

          kinsman's heart and proud spirit are restrained
          by the taking of recompense.1

  Clear back to ancient Greek life, people held the idea of
  "recompense" for injury. After the recompense was paid, the
  injured party did not go to war for revenge. At heart, this
  system of "blood-money" is the foundation of modern tort
  law, taking the ancient idea of monetary recompense for injury
  or death into modern law.

  Long ago, tort was used in
  everyday speech; today it is
  left to the legal system. A
  judge will instruct a jury
  that a tort is usually defined
  as a wrong for which the law
  will provide a remedy, most
  often in the form of money
  dam- ages. The law does not
  remedy all "wrongs." The preceding definition of tort does not
  reveal the underlying principles that divide wrongs in the legal
  sphere from those in the moral sphere. Hurting someone's

1. Book IX, Augustus Taber Murray translation (1924).
384 | INTRODUCTION TO TORT LAW

feelings may be more devastating than saying something un-
true about him behind his back; yet the law will not provide a
remedy for saying something cruel to someone directly, while
it may provide a remedy for "defaming" someone, orally or in
writing, to others.

Although the word is no longer in general use, tort suits are
the stuff of everyday headlines. More and more people injured
by exposure to a variety of risks now seek redress (some sort of
remedy through the courts). Headlines boast of multimillion-
dollar jury awards against doctors who bungled operations,
against newspapers that libeled subjects of stories, and against
oil companies that devastate entire ecosystems. All are
examples of tort suits.

   The law of torts developed almost entirely in the common-
law courts; that is, statutes passed by legislatures were not the
source of law that plaintiffs usually relied on. Usually, plaintiffs
would rely on the common law (judicial decisions). Through
thousands of cases, the courts have fashioned a series of rules
that govern the conduct of individuals in their noncontractual
dealings with each other. Through contracts, individuals can
craft their own rights and responsibilities toward each other.
In the absence of contracts, tort law holds individuals legally
accountable for the consequences of their actions. Those who
suffer losses at the hands of others can be compensated.

   Many acts (like homicide) are both criminal and tortious.
                                          INTRODUCTION TO TORT LAW | 385

But torts and crimes are different, and the difference is worth
noting. A crime is an act against the people as a whole. Society
punishes the murderer; it does not usually compensate the
family of the victim. Tort law, on the other hand, views the
death as a private wrong for which damages are owed. In a
civil case, the tort victim or his family, not the state, brings the
action. The judgment against a defendant in a civil tort suit
is usually expressed in monetary terms, not in terms of prison
times or fines, and is the legal system's way of trying to make
up for the victim's loss.

9.1.2 Kinds of Torts

There are three kinds of torts: intentional torts, negligent torts,
and strict liability torts. Intentional torts arise from intentional
acts, whereas unintentional torts often result from carelessness
(e.g., when a surgical team fails to remove a clamp from a
patient's abdomen when the operation is finished). Both
intentional torts and negligent torts imply some fault on the
part of the defendant. In strict liability torts, by contrast, there
may be no fault at all, but tort law will sometimes require a
defendant to make up for the victim's losses even where the
defendant was not careless and did not intend to do harm.

9.1.3 Dimensions of Tort Liability

There is a clear moral basis for recovery through the legal
386 | INTRODUCTION TO TORT LAW

system where the defendant has been careless (negligent) or
has intentionally caused harm. Using the concepts that we are
free and autonomous beings with basic rights, we can see that
when others interfere with either our freedom or our
autonomy, we will usually react negatively. As the old saying
goes, "Your right to swing your arm ends at the tip of my
nose." The law takes this even one step further: under
intentional tort law, if you frighten someone by swinging your
arms toward the tip of her nose, you may have committed the
tort of assault, even if there is no actual touching (battery).

   Under a capitalistic market system, rational economic rules
also call for no negative externalities. That is, actions of
individuals, either alone or in concert with others, should not
negatively impact third parties. The law will try to compensate
third parties who are harmed by your actions, even as it knows
that a money judgment cannot actually mend a badly injured
victim.

Dimensions of Tort Liability

9.1.3.1 Dimensions of Tort: Fault Tort principles can be
viewed along different dimensions. One is the fault dimension.
Like criminal law, tort law requires a wrongful act by a
defendant for the plaintiff to recover. Unlike criminal law,
however, there need not be a specific intent. Since tort law
focuses on injury to the plaintiff, it is less concerned than
criminal law about the reasons for the defendant's actions.
An innocent act or a relatively innocent one may still provide
the basis for liability. Nevertheless, tort law--except for strict
liability--relies on standards of fault, or blameworthiness.
The most obvious standard is willful conduct. If the defendant
(often called the tortfeasor--i.e., the one committing the tort)
intentionally injures another, there is little argument about
tort liability. Thus all crimes resulting in injury to a person or
   388 | INTRODUCTION TO TORT LAW

  property (murder, assault, arson, etc.) are also torts, and the
  plaintiff may bring a separate lawsuit to recover damages for
  injuries to his person, family, or property.

     Most tort suits do not rely on intentional fault. They are
  based, rather, on negligent conduct that in the circumstances
  is careless or poses unreasonable risks of causing damage. Most
  automobile accident and medical malpractice suits are
  examples of negligence suits.

     The fault dimension is a continuum. At one end is the
  deliberate desire to do injury. The middle ground is occupied
  by careless conduct. At the other end is conduct that most
  would consider entirely blameless, in the moral sense. The
  defendant may have observed all possible precautions and yet
  still be held liable. This is called strict liability.2 An example
  is that incurred by the manufacturer of a defective product
  that is placed on the market despite all possible precautions,
  including quality-control inspection. In many states, if the
  product causes injury, the manufacturer will be held liable.

     9.1.3.2 Dimensions of Tort: Nature of Injury Tort
  liability varies by the type of injury caused. The most obvious
  type is physical harm to the person (assault, battery, infliction
  of emotional distress, negligent exposure to toxic pollutants,

2. Liability without fault. This may arise when the defendant engages
  in ultrahazardous activities or where defective product creates an
  unreasonable risk of injury to consumers or others.
                                             INTRODUCTION TO TORT LAW | 389

  wrongful death) or property (trespass, nuisance, arson,
  interference with contract). Mental suffering can be redressed
  if it is a result of physical injury (e.g., shock and depression
  following an automobile accident). A few states now permit
  recovery for mental distress alone (a mother's shock at seeing
  her son injured by a car while both were crossing the street).
  Other protected interests include a person's reputation
  (injured by defamatory statements or writings), privacy
  (injured by those who divulge secrets of his personal life), and
  economic interests (misrepresentation to secure an economic
  advantage, certain forms of unfair competition).

     9.1.3.3 Dimensions of Tort: Excuses A third element
  in the law of torts is the excuse for committing an apparent
  wrong. The law does not condemn every act that ultimately
  results in injury.

     One common rule of exculpation is assumption of risk.3
  A baseball fan who sits along the third base line close to the
  infield assumes the risk that a line drive foul ball may fly toward
  him and strike him. He will not be permitted to complain in
  court that the batter should have been more careful or that
  management should have either warned him or put up a
  protective barrier.

3. A defense to a plaintiff's action in tort where the plaintiff has
  knowingly and voluntarily entered into a risky activity that results in
  injury.
   390 | INTRODUCTION TO TORT LAW

  Another excuse is negligence of the plaintiff. If two drivers
  are careless and hit each other on the highway, some states
  will refuse to permit either to recover from the other. Still
  another excuse is consent: two boxers in the ring consent to
  being struck with fists (but not to being bitten on the ear).

 9.1.4 Damages

  Since the purpose of tort law is to compensate the victim for
  harm actually done, damages are usually measured by the
  extent of the injury. Expressed in money terms, these include
  replacement of property destroyed, compensation for lost
  wages, reimbursement for medical expenses, and dollars that
  are supposed to approximate the pain that is suffered. Damages
  for these injuries are called compensatory damages.4

     In certain instances, the courts will permit an award of
  punitive damages.5 As the word punitive implies, the purpose
  is to punish the defendant's actions. Because a punitive award
  (sometimes called exemplary damages) is at odds with the

4. An award of money damages to make the plaintiff whole, as opposed
  to additional damages (punitive) that punish the defendant or make
  an example of defendant.

5. Punitive damages are awarded in cases where the conduct of the
  defendant is deemed to be so outrageous that justice is only served by
  adding a penalty over and above compensatory damages.
                                          INTRODUCTION TO TORT LAW | 391

general purpose of tort law, it is allowable only in aggravated
situations. The law in most states permits recovery of punitive
damages only when the defendant has deliberately committed
a wrong with malicious intent or has otherwise done
something outrageous.

   Punitive damages are rarely allowed in negligence cases for
that reason. But if someone sets out intentionally and
maliciously to hurt another person, punitive damages may well
be appropriate. Punitive damages are intended not only to
punish the wrongdoer, by exacting an additional and
sometimes heavy payment (the exact amount is left to the
discretion of jury and judge), but also to deter others from
similar conduct. The punitive damage award has been subject
to heavy criticism in recent years in cases in which it has been
awarded against manufacturers. One fear is that huge damage
awards on behalf of a multitude of victims could swiftly
bankrupt the defendant. Unlike compensatory damages,
punitive damages are taxable.

     Key Takeaway

     There are three kinds of torts, and in two of them
     (negligent torts and strict liability torts), damages
392 | INTRODUCTION TO TORT LAW

     are usually limited to making the victim whole
     through an enforceable judgment for money
     damages. These compensatory damages awarded
     by a court accomplish only approximate justice for
     the injuries or property damage caused by a
     tortfeasor. Tort laws go a step further toward
     deterrence, beyond compensation to the plaintiff, in
     occasionally awarding punitive damages against a
     defendant. These are almost always in cases where
     an intentional tort has been committed.

9.2 Intentional Torts

     Learning Objectives

     After reading this section, you should be able to do
     the following:

         1. Distinguish intentional torts from other kinds
                                          INTRODUCTION TO TORT LAW | 393

             of torts.
         2. Give three examples of an intentional

             tort--one that causes injury to a person, one
             that causes injury to property, and one that
             causes injury to a reputation.

The analysis of most intentional torts is straightforward and
parallels the substantive crimes in criminal law. When physical
injury or damage to property is caused, there is rarely debate
over liability if the plaintiff deliberately undertook to produce
the harm. Certain other intentional torts are worth noting for
their relevance to business.

9.2.1 Assault and Battery

One of the most obvious intentional torts is assault and
battery. Both criminal law and tort law serve to restrain
individuals from using physical force on others. Assault is (1)
intent to cause (2) the threat of immediate harm or offensive
contact or (3) any intentional act that would arouse reasonable
apprehension of imminent harm. Battery is intentional,
unauthorized, harmful or offensive physical contact with
   394 | INTRODUCTION TO TORT LAW

  another person.6 Battery is the contact, assault is the
  apprehension of contact.7

     Often an assault results in battery, but not always. In
  Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Hill, for example, the
  defendant did not touch the plaintiff's wife, but the case
  presented an issue of possible assault even without an actual
  battery; the defendant employee attempted to kiss a customer
  across the countertop, couldn't quite reach her, but
  nonetheless created actionable fear (or, as the court put it,
  "apprehension") on the part of the plaintiff's wife.

     It is also possible to have a battery without an assault. For
  example, if someone hits you on the back of the head with an
  iron skillet and you didn't see it coming, there is a battery but
  no assault. Likewise, if Andrea passes out from drinking too
  much at the fraternity party and a stranger (Andre) kisses her
  on the lips while she is passed out, she would not be aware
  of any threat of offensive contact and would have no
  apprehension of any harm. Thus there has been no tort of
  assault, but she could allege the tort of battery. (The question
  of what damages, if any, would be an interesting argument.)

6. A person's immediate property will count as the person, so shaking
  someone's glasses could count as a battery.

7. Note, apprehension is not the same thing as fear! One might not be
  afraid of the threat of a weak punch, but that doesn't mean its threat
  is not an assault.
                                          INTRODUCTION TO TORT LAW | 395

                                      Under the doctrine of
                                      transferred intent, if Draco
                                      aims his wand at Harry but
                                      Harry ducks just in time and
                                      the impact is felt by
                                      Hermione instead, English
                                      law (and American law)
                                      would transfer Draco's
                                      intent from the target to the
                                      actual victim of the act.
                                      Thus Hermione could sue
                                      Draco for battery for any
                                      damages she had suffered.

9.2.2 False Imprisonment

The tort of false imprisonment originally implied a locking up,
as in a prison, but today it can occur if a person is restrained in
a room or a car or even if his or her movements are restricted
while walking down the street. People have a right to be free
to go as they please, and anyone who without cause deprives
another of personal freedom has committed a tort. Damages
are allowed for time lost, discomfort and resulting ill health,
mental suffering, humiliation, loss of reputation or business,
and expenses such as attorneys' fees incurred as a result of the
restraint (such as a false arrest). But as the case of Lester v.
Albers Super Markets, Inc. (below) shows, the defendant must
396 | INTRODUCTION TO TORT LAW

be shown to have restrained the plaintiff in order for damages
to be allowed.

9.2.3 Intentional Infliction of
Emotional Distress

Until recently, the common-law rule was that there could be
no recovery for acts, even though intentionally undertaken,
that caused purely mental or emotional distress. For a case
to go to the jury, the courts required that the mental distress
result from some physical injury. In recent years, many courts
have overturned the older rule and now recognize the so-called
new tort. In an employment context, however, it is rare to find
a case where a plaintiff is able to recover. The most difficult
hurdle is proving that the conduct was "extreme" or
"outrageous."

   In an early California case, bill collectors came to the
debtor's home repeatedly and threatened the debtor's
pregnant wife. Among other things, they claimed that the wife
would have to deliver her child in prison. The wife miscarried
and had emotional and physical complications. The court
found that the behavior of the collection company's two
agents was sufficiently outrageous to prove the tort of
intentional infliction of emotional distress. In Roche v. Stern
(New York), the famous cable television talk show host
Howard Stern had tastelessly discussed the remains of
                                             INTRODUCTION TO TORT LAW | 397

  Deborah Roche, a dancer and cable access television host.8 The
  remains had been brought to Stern's show by a close friend of
  Roche, Chaunce Hayden, and a number of crude comments
  by Stern and Hayden about the remains were videotaped and
  broadcast on a national cable television station. Roche's sister
  and brother sued Howard Stern and Infinity broadcasting and
  were able to get past the defendant's motion to dismiss to have
  a jury consider their claim.

     A plaintiff's burden in these cases is to show that the mental
  distress is severe. Many states require that this distress must
  result in physical symptoms such as nausea, headaches, ulcers,
  or, as in the case of the pregnant wife, a miscarriage. Other
  states have not required physical symptoms, finding that
  shame, embarrassment, fear, and anger constitute severe
  mental distress.

 9.2.4 Trespass and Nuisance

  Trespass is intentionally going on land that belongs to
  someone else or putting something on someone else's property
  and re- fusing to remove it. This part of tort law shows how
  strongly the law values the rights of property owners. The
  right to enjoy your property without interference from others
  is also found in common law of nuisance. There are limits

8. Roche v. Stern, 675 N.Y.S.2d 133 (1998).
   398 | INTRODUCTION TO TORT LAW

  to property owners' rights, however. In Katko v. Briney, for
  example, the plaintiff was injured by a spring gun while
  trespassing on the defendant's property.9 The defendant had
  set up No Trespassing signs after ten years of trespassing and
  housebreaking events, with the loss of some household items.
  Windows had been broken, and there was "messing up of the
  property in general." The defendants had boarded up the
  windows and doors in order to stop the intrusions and finally
  had set up a shotgun trap in the north bedroom of the house.
  One defendant had cleaned and oiled his 20-gauge shotgun
  and taken it to the old house where it was secured to an iron
  bed with the barrel pointed at the bedroom door. "It was
  rigged with wire from the doorknob to the gun's trigger so
  would fire when the door was opened." The angle of the
  shotgun was adjusted to hit an intruder in the legs. The spring
  could not be seen from the outside, and no warning of its
  presence was posted.

     The plaintiff, Katko, had been hunting in the area for several
  years and considered the property abandoned. He knew it had
  long been uninhabited. He and a friend had been to the house
  and found several old bottles and fruit jars that they took and
  added to their collection of antiques. When they made a
  second trip to the property, they entered by removing a board
  from a porch window. When the plaintiff opened the north

9. Katko v. Briney, 183 N.W.2d 657 (Iowa 1971).
                                          INTRODUCTION TO TORT LAW | 399

bedroom door, the shotgun went off and struck him in the
right leg above the ankle bone. Much of his leg was blown
away. While Katko knew he had no right to break and enter
the house with intent to steal bottles and fruit jars, the court
held that a property owner could not protect an unoccupied
boarded-up farmhouse by using a spring gun capable of
inflicting death or serious injury.

Does a duty of care extend to trespassers?

In Katko, there is an intentional tort. But what if someone
trespassing is injured by the negligence of the landowner?
States have differing rules about trespass and negligence. In
some states, a trespasser is only protected against the gross
negligence of the landowner. In other states, trespassers may be
owed the duty of due care on the part of the landowner. The
400 | INTRODUCTION TO TORT LAW

burglar who falls into a drained swimming pool, for example,
may have a case against the homeowner unless the courts or
legislature of that state have made it clear that trespassers are
owed the limited duty to avoid gross negligence. Or a very
small child may wander off his own property and fall into a
gravel pit on a nearby property and suffer death or serious
injury; if the pit should (in the exercise of due care) have been
filled in or some barrier erected around it, then there was
negligence. But if the state law holds that the duty to
trespassers is only to avoid gross negligence, the child's family
would lose, unless the state law makes an exception for very
young trespassers. In general, guests, licensees, and invitees are
owed a duty of due care; a trespasser may not be owed such a
duty, but states have different rules on this.

9.2.5 Trespass to Chattels and
Conversion

Trespass to land covered real property, but what about
personal property? The tort of trespass to chattels occurs when
another intentionally acts to interfere with one's right to
possession of an object or damages that object. For example, if
when teaching this class I took your laptop (a piece of personal
property) and locked it in my office for a week, I would be
depriving you of its use, and you could sue. Or, if I
intentionally damaged your laptop by scratching the screen,
again trespass to chattels has occurred. If the trespass is severe
                                          INTRODUCTION TO TORT LAW | 401

enough that the plaintiff deserves the full value of the property
in compensation, such as if I destroyed the laptop, the tort
becomes conversion. The tort of conversion is comparable to
the criminal action of larceny.

9.2.6 Intentional Interference with
Contractual Relations

Tortious interference with a contract can be established by
proving four elements:

 1. There was a contract between the plaintiff and a third
      party.

 2. The defendant knew of the contract.
 3. The defendant improperly induced the third party to

      breach the contract or made performance of the contract
      impossible.
 4. There was injury to the plaintiff.

In a famous case of contract interference, Texaco was sued
by Pennzoil for interfering with an agreement that Pennzoil
had with Getty Oil. After complicated negotiations between
Pennzoil and Getty, a takeover share price was struck, a
memorandum of understanding was signed, and a press release
announced the agreement in principle between Pennzoil and
Getty. Texaco's lawyers, however, believed that Getty oil was
"still in play," and before the lawyers for Pennzoil and Getty
402 | INTRODUCTION TO TORT LAW

could complete the paperwork for their agreement, Texaco
announced it was offering Getty shareholders an additional
$12.50 per share over what Pennzoil had offered.

                                         Texaco later increased its
                                      offer to $228 per share, and
                                      the Getty board of directors
                                      soon began dealing with
                                      Texaco instead of Pennzoil.
                                      Pennzoil decided to sue in
Texas state court for tortious interference with a contract.
After a long trial, the jury returned an enormous verdict
against Texaco: $7.53 billion in actual damages and $3 billion
in punitive damages. The verdict was so large that it would
have bankrupted Texaco. Appeals from the verdict centered on
an obscure rule of the Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC), Rule 10(b)-13, and Texaco's argument was based on
that rule and the fact that the contract had not been
completed. If there was no contract, Texaco could not have
legally interfered with one. After the SEC filed a brief that
supported Texaco's interpretation of the law, Texaco agreed to
pay $3 billion to Pennzoil to dismiss its claim of tortious
interference with a contract.

9.2.7 Malicious Prosecution

Malicious prosecution is the tort of causing someone to be
prosecuted for a criminal act, knowing that there was no
                                          INTRODUCTION TO TORT LAW | 403

probable cause to believe that the plaintiff committed the
crime. The plaintiff must show that the defendant acted with
malice or with some purpose other than bringing the guilty
to justice. A mere complaint to the authorities is insufficient
to establish the tort, but any official proceeding will support
the claim--for example, a warrant for the plaintiff's arrest. The
criminal proceeding must terminate in the plaintiff's favor in
order for his suit to be sustained.

   A majority of US courts, though by no means all, permit a
suit for wrongful civil proceedings. Civil litigation is usually
costly and burdensome, and one who forces another to defend
himself against baseless accusations should not be permitted
to saddle the one he sues with the costs of defense. However,
because, as a matter of public policy, litigation is favored as
the means by which legal rights can be vindicated--indeed,
the Supreme Court has even ruled that individuals have a
constitutional right to litigate--the plaintiff must meet a heavy
burden in proving his case. The mere dismissal of the original
lawsuit against the plaintiff is not sufficient proof that the suit
was unwarranted. The plaintiff in a suit for wrongful civil
proceedings must show that the defendant (who was the
plaintiff in the original suit) filed the action for an improper
purpose and had no reasonable belief that his cause was legally
or factually well grounded.
404 | INTRODUCTION TO TORT LAW

9.2.8 Defamation

Defamation is injury to a

person's good name or

reputation. In general, if the

harm is done through the

spoken word--one person

to another, by telephone, by

radio, or on television--it is  A defamatory statement
called slander. If the          published in written form is
defamatory statement is         called libel.

published in written form, it is called libel.

The Restatement (Second) of Torts defines a defamatory

communication as one that "so tends to harm the reputation

of another as to lower him in the estimation of the community

or to deter third persons from associating or dealing with
him."10

A statement is not defamatory unless it is false. Truth is

an absolute defense to a charge of libel or slander. Moreover,

the statement must be "published"--that is, communicated

to a third person. You cannot be libeled by one who sends

you a letter full of false accusations and scurrilous statements

about you unless a third person opens it first (your roommate,

perhaps). Any living person is capable of being defamed, but

10. Restatement (Second) of Torts, Section 559 (1965).
                                          INTRODUCTION TO TORT LAW | 405

the dead are not. Corporations, partnerships, and other forms
of associations can also be defamed, if the statements tend to
injure their ability to do business or to garner contributions.

   For example, a recent defamation lawsuit centered around a
single text from the artist Kesha to Lady Gaga. The text read
"she was raped by the same man", referring to the producer
Lukasz "Dr. Luke" Gottwald. Although the statement was
only a single text to a single person, this counted as being
"published."

The statement must have reference to a particular person, but
he or she need not be identified by name. A statement that "the
company president is a crook" is defamatory, as is a statement
that "the major network weathermen are imposters." The
company president and the network weathermen could show
that the words were aimed at them. But statements about large
groups will not support an action for defamation (e.g., "all
doctors are butchers" is not defamatory of any particular
doctor).

   The law of defamation is largely built on strict liability. That
a person did not intend to defame is ordinarily no excuse; a
typographical error that converts a true statement into a false
one in a newspaper, magazine, or corporate brochure can be
sufficient to make out a case of libel. Even the exercise of due
care is usually no excuse if the statement is in fact
communicated. Repeating a libel is itself a libel; a libel cannot
be justified by showing that you were quoting someone else.
406 | INTRODUCTION TO TORT LAW

Though a plaintiff may be able to prove that a statement was
defamatory, he is not necessarily entitled to an award of
damages. That is because the law contains a number of
privileges that excuse the defamation.

   Publishing false information about another business's
product constitutes the tort of slander of quality, or trade libel.
In some states, this is known as the tort of product
disparagement. It may be difficult to establish damages,
however. A plaintiff must prove that actual damages
proximately resulted from the slander of quality and must
show the extent of the economic harm as well.

   9.2.8.1 Absolute Privilege Statements made during the
course of judicial proceedings are absolutely privileged,
meaning that they cannot serve as the basis for a defamation
suit. Accurate accounts of judicial or other proceedings are
absolutely privileged; a newspaper, for example, may pass on
the slanderous comments of a judge in court. "Judicial" is
broadly construed to include most proceedings of
administrative bodies of the government. The Constitution
exempts members of Congress from suits for libel or slander
for any statements made in connection with legislative
business. The courts have constructed a similar privilege for
many executive branch officials.

   9.2.8.2 Qualified Privilege Absolute privileges pertain
to those in the public sector. A narrower privilege exists for
private citizens. In general, a statement that would otherwise
be actionable is held to be justified if made in a reasonable
                                               INTRODUCTION TO TORT LAW | 407

   manner and for a reasonable purpose. Thus you may warn a
   friend to beware of dealing with a third person, and if you had
   reason to believe that what you said was true, you are privileged
   to issue the warning, even though false. Likewise, an employee
   may warn an employer about the conduct or character of a
   fellow or prospective employee, and a parent may complain to
   a school board about the competence or conduct of a child's
   teacher. There is a line to be drawn, however, and a defendant
   with nothing but an idle interest in the matter (an "officious
   intermeddler") must take the risk that his information is
   wrong.

      In 1964, the Supreme Court handed down its historic
   decision in New York Times v. Sullivan, holding that under
   the First Amendment a libel judgment brought by a public
   official against a newspaper cannot stand unless the plaintiff
   has shown "actual malice," which in turn was defined as
   "knowledge that [the statement] was false or with a reckless
   disregard of whether it was false or not."11 In subsequent cases,
   the court extended the constitutional doctrine further,
   applying it not merely to government officials but to public
   figures,12 people who voluntarily place themselves in the public

11. Times v. Sullivan, 376 US 254 (1964).

    figure cannot recover in a defamation case unless the plaintiff's
    defamation was done with actual malice.

eye or who involuntarily find themselves the objects of public
scrutiny. Whether a private person is or is not a public figure
is a difficult question that has so far eluded rigorous definition
and has been answered only from case to case. A CEO of
a private corporation ordinarily will be considered a private
figure unless he puts himself in the public eye--for example,
by starring in the company's television commercials.

9.2.9 Invasion of Privacy

The right of privacy--the right "to be let alone"--did not
receive judicial recognition until the twentieth century, and
its legal formulation is still evolving. In fact there is no single
right of privacy. Courts and commentators have discerned at
least four different types of interests: (1) the right to control
the appropriation of your name and picture for commercial
purposes, (2) the right to be free of intrusion on your
"personal space" or seclusion, (3) freedom from public
disclosure of embarrassing and intimate facts of your personal
life, and (4) the right not to be presented in a "false light."

   9.2.9.1 Appropriation of Name or Likeness The
earliest privacy interest recognized by the courts was
appropriation of name or likeness: someone else placing your
photograph on a billboard or cereal box as a model or using
your name as endorsing a product or in the product name. A
New York statute makes it a misdemeanor to use the name,
portrait, or picture of any person for advertising purposes or
                                          INTRODUCTION TO TORT LAW | 409

for the purposes of trade (business) without first obtaining
written consent. The law also permits the aggrieved person
to sue and to recover damages for unauthorized profits and
also to have the court enjoin (judicially block) any further
unauthorized use of the plaintiff's name, likeness, or image.
This is particularly useful to celebrities.

   Because the publishing and advertising industries are
concentrated heavily in New York, the statute plays an
important part in advertising decisions made throughout the
country. Deciding what "commercial" or "trade" purposes are
is not always easy. Thus a newsmagazine may use a baseball
player's picture on its cover without first obtaining written
permission, but a chocolate manufacturer could not put the
player's picture on a candy wrapper without consent.

9.2.9.2 Personal Space

One form of intrusion upon

a  person's

solitude--trespass--has

long been actionable under

common law. Physical

invasion of home or other property is not a new tort. But in

recent years, the notion of intrusion has been broadened

considerably. Now, taking photos of someone else with your

cell phone in a locker room could constitute invasion of the

right to privacy. Reading someone else's mail or e-mail could

also constitute an invasion of the right to privacy.
410 | INTRODUCTION TO TORT LAW

Photographing someone on a city street is not tortious, but
subsequent use of the photograph could be. Whether the
invasion is in a public or private space, the amount of damages
will depend on how the image or information is disclosed to
others.

   9.2.9.3 Public Disclosure of Embarrassing Facts
Circulation of false statements that do injury to a person are
actionable under the laws of defamation. What about true
statements that might be every bit as damaging-- for example,
disclosure of someone's income tax return, revealing how
much he earned? The general rule is that if the facts are truly
private and of no "legitimate" concern to the public, then their
disclosure is a violation of the right to privacy. But a person
who is in the public eye cannot claim the same protection.

   9.2.9.4 False Light A final type of privacy invasion is
that which paints a false picture in a publication. Though false,
it might not be libelous, since the publication need contain
nothing injurious to reputation. Indeed, the publication
might even glorify the plaintiff, making him seem more heroic
than he actually is. Subject to the First Amendment
requirement that the plaintiff must show intent or extreme
recklessness, statements that put a person in a false light, like a
fictionalized biography, are actionable.

     Key Takeaway
                                           INTRODUCTION TO TORT LAW | 411

     There are many kinds of intentional torts. Some of
     them involve harm to the physical person or to his or
     her property, reputation or feelings, or economic
     interests. In each case of intentional tort, the plaintiff
     must show that the defendant intended harm, but
     the intent to harm does not need to be directed at a
     particular person and need not be malicious, as long
     as the resulting harm is a direct consequence of the
     defendant's actions.

9.3 Negligence

     Learning Objectives

     After reading this section, you should be able to do
     the following:

         1. Understand how the duty of due care relates
             to negligence.
     412 | INTRODUCTION TO TORT LAW

             2. Distinguish between actual and proximate
                 cause.

             3. Explain the primary defenses to a claim of
                 negligence.

  9.3.1 Elements of Negligence

   Physical harm need not be intentionally caused. A pedestrian
   knocked over by an automobile does not hurt less because
   the driver intended no wrong but was merely careless. The
   law imposes a duty of care on all of us in our everyday lives.
   Accidents caused by negligence are actionable.

      Determining negligence13 is not always easy. If a driver runs
   a red light, we can say that he is negligent because a driver must
   always be careful to ascertain whether the light is red and be
   able to stop if it is. Suppose that the driver was carrying a badly
   injured person to a nearby hospital and that after slowing
   down at an intersection, went through a red light, blowing
   his horn, whereupon a driver to his right, seeing him, drove
   into the intersection anyway and crashed into him. Must one
   always stop at a red light? Is proof that the light was red always

13. A breach of the duty of due care.
                                                INTRODUCTION TO TORT LAW | 413

   proof of negligence? Usually, but not always: negligence is an
   abstract concept that must always be applied to concrete and
   often widely varying sets of circumstances. Whether someone
   was or was not negligent is almost always a question of fact for
   a jury to decide. Rarely is it a legal question that a judge can
   settle.

      The tort of negligence has four elements: (1) a duty of due
   care that the defendant had, (2) the breach of the duty of
   due care14, (3) connection between cause and injury, and (4)
   actual damage or loss. Even if a plaintiff can prove each of these
   aspects, the defendant may be able to show that the law excuses
   the conduct that is the basis for the tort claim. We examine
   each of these factors below.

      9.3.1.1 Standard of Care Not every unintentional act
   that causes injury is negligent. If you brake to a stop when
   you see a child dart out in front of your car, and if the noise
   from your tires gives someone in a nearby house a heart attack,
   you have not acted negligently toward the person in the house.
   The purpose of the negligence standard is to protect others

14. Any act that fails to meet a standard of the person's duty of due care
    toward others. The standard is usually described as the standard of
    behavior that is expected of a hypothetical "reasonable person"
    under the circumstances. Certain professionals, however, may be
    held to a higher standard than the ordinary person.
414 | INTRODUCTION TO TORT LAW

against the risk of injury that foreseeably would ensue from
unreasonably dangerous conduct.

   Given the infinite variety of human circumstances and
conduct, no general statement of a reasonable standard of care
is possible. Nevertheless, the law has tried to encapsulate it in
the form of the famous standard of "the reasonable person."
This fictitious person "of ordinary prudence" is the model that
juries are instructed to compare defendants with in assessing
whether those defendants have acted negligently. Analysis of
this mythical personage has baffled several generations of
commentators. How much knowledge must he have of events
in the community, of technology, of cause and effect? With
what physical attributes, courage, or wisdom is this
nonexistent person supposedly endowed? If the defendant is
a person with specialized knowledge, like a doctor or an
automobile designer, must the jury also treat the "reasonable
person" as having this knowledge, even though the average
person in the community will not? (Answer: in most cases,
yes.)
                                           INTRODUCTION TO TORT LAW | 415

A "wet floor" sign is designed to protect against negligence
suits.

Despite the many difficulties, the concept of the reasonable
man is one on which most negligence cases ultimately turn. If
a defendant has acted "unreasonably under the circumstances"
and his conduct posed an unreasonable risk of injury, then
he is liable for injury caused by his conduct. Perhaps in most
instances, it is not difficult to divine what the reasonable man
would do. The reasonable man stops for traffic lights and
always drives at reasonable speeds, does not throw baseballs
through windows, performs surgical operations according to
the average standards of the medical profession, ensures that
the floors of his grocery store are kept free of fluids that would
cause a patron to slip and fall, takes proper precautions to
avoid spillage of oil from his supertanker, and so on. The
416 | INTRODUCTION TO TORT LAW

"reasonable man" standard imposes hindsight on the decisions
and actions of people in society; the circumstances of life are
such that courts may sometimes impose a standard of due care
that many people might not find reasonable.

9.3.2 Duty of Care and Its Breach

The law does not impose on us a duty to care for every person.
If the rule were otherwise, we would all, in this interdependent
world, be our brothers' keepers, constantly unsure whether
any action we took might subject us to liability for its effect on
someone else. The law copes with this difficulty by limiting the
number of people toward whom we owe a duty to be careful.

   In general, the law imposes no obligation to act in a
situation to which we are strangers. We may pass the drowning
child without risking a lawsuit. But if we do act, then the law
requires us to act carefully. The law of negligence requires us
to behave with due regard for the foreseeable consequences of
our actions in order to avoid unreasonable risks of injury.

   During the course of the twentieth century, the courts have
constantly expanded the notion of "foreseeability," so that
today many more people are held to be within the zone of
injury than was once the case. For example, it was once believed
that a manufacturer or supplier owed a duty of care only to
immediate purchasers, not to others who might use the
product or to whom the product might be resold. This
limitation was known as the rule of privity. And users who
                                                INTRODUCTION TO TORT LAW | 417

   were not immediate purchasers were said not to be in privity
   with a supplier or manufacturer. In 1916, Judge Benjamin N.
   Cardozo, then on the New York Court of Appeals, penned
   an opinion in a celebrated case that exploded the theory of
   privity, though it would take half a century before the last
   state--Mississippi in 1966--would fall in line.

      Determining a duty of care can be a vexing problem.
   Physicians, for example, are bound by principles of medical
   ethics to respect the confidences of their patients. Suppose a
   patient tells a psychiatrist that he intends to kill his girlfriend.
   Does the physician then have a higher legal duty to warn
   prospective victim? The California Supreme Court has said
   yes.15

      Establishing a breach of the duty of due care where the
   defendant has violated a statute or municipal ordinance is
   eased considerably with the doctrine of negligence per se16, a
   doctrine common to all US state courts. If a legislative body
   sets a minimum standard of care for particular kinds of acts
   to protect a certain set of people from harm and a violation
   of that standard causes harm to someone in that set, the
   defendant is negligent per se. If Harvey is driving sixty-five

    1976).

    ordinance can be used to establish a breach of the duty of due care.

   miles per hour in a fifty-five-mile-per-hour zone when he
   crashes into Haley's car and the police accident report
   establishes that or he otherwise admits to going ten miles per
   hour over the speed limit, Haley does not have to prove that
   Harvey has breached a duty of due care. She will only have
   to prove that the speeding was an actual and proximate cause
   of the collision and will also have to prove the extent of the
   resulting damages to her.

  9.3.3 Causation: Actual Cause and
  Proximate Cause

   "For want of a nail, the kingdom was lost," as the old saying
   has it. Virtually any cause of an injury can be traced to some
   preceding cause. The problem for the law is to know when to
   draw the line between causes that are immediate and causes
   too remote for liability reasonably to be assigned to them. In
   tort theory, there are two kinds of causes that a plaintiff must
   prove: actual cause and proximate cause. Actual cause
   (causation in fact)17 can be found if the connection between
   the defendant's act and the plaintiff's injuries passes the "but
   for" test: if an injury would not have occurred "but for" the
   defendant's conduct, then the defendant is the cause of the

17. The actual cause of negligence is sometimes called the "but for"
    event that is a breach of duty on the part of the defendant.
                                                INTRODUCTION TO TORT LAW | 419

   injury. Still, this is not enough causation to create liability.
   The injuries to the plaintiff must also be foreseeable, or not
   "too remote," for the defendant's act to create liability. This
   is proximate cause18: a cause that is not too remote or
   unforseeable.

      Suppose that the person
   who was injured was not
   one whom a reasonable
   person could have expected
   to be harmed. Such a
   situation was presented in
   one of the most famous US tort cases, Palsgraf v. Long Island
   Railroad (below), which was decided by Judge Benjamin
   Cardozo. Although Judge Cardozo persuaded four of his
   seven brethren to side with his position, the closeness of the
   case demonstrates the difficulty that unforeseeable
   consequences and unforeseeable plaintiffs present.

  9.3.4 Damages

   For a plaintiff to win a tort case, she must allege and prove

18. Sometimes known as legal cause, proximate cause must be shown as
    well as actual cause, so that an act of the defendant will not result in
    liability if the consequences of the negligent act are too remote or
    unforeseeable.
420 | INTRODUCTION TO TORT LAW

that she was injured. The fear that she might be injured in the
future is not a sufficient basis for a suit. This rule has proved
troublesome in medical malpractice and industrial disease
cases. A doctor's negligent act or a company's negligent
exposure of a worker to some form of contamination might
not become manifest in the body for years. In the meantime,
the tort statute of limitations might have run out, barring the
victim from suing at all. An increasing number of courts have
eased the plaintiff's predicament by ruling that the statute of
limitations does not begin to run until the victim discovers
that she has been injured or contracted a disease.

   The law allows an exception to the general rule that damages
must be shown when the plaintiff stands in danger of
immediate injury from a hazardous activity. If you discover
your neighbor experimenting with explosives in his basement,
you could bring suit to enjoin him from further
experimentation, even though he has not yet blown up his
house--and yours.

9.3.5 Problems of Proof

The plaintiff in a tort suit, as in any other, has the burden
of proving his allegations. He must show that the defendant
took the actions complained of as negligent, demonstrate the
circumstances that make the actions negligent, and prove the
occurrence and extent of injury. Factual issues are for the jury
to resolve. Since it is frequently difficult to make out the
                                                INTRODUCTION TO TORT LAW | 421

   requisite proof, the law allows certain presumptions and rules
   of evidence that ease the plaintiff's task, on the ground that
   without them substantial injustice would be done. One
   important rule goes by the Latin phrase res ipsa loquitur19,
   meaning "the thing speaks for itself." The best evidence is
   always the most direct evidence: an eyewitness account of the
   acts in question. But eyewitnesses are often unavailable, and
   in any event they frequently cannot testify directly to the
   reasonableness of someone's conduct, which inevitably can
   only be inferred from the circumstances.

      In many cases, therefore, circumstantial evidence20
   (evidence that is indirect) will be the only evidence or will
   constitute the bulk of the evidence. Circumstantial evidence
   can often be quite telling: though no one saw anyone leave the
   building, muddy footprints tracing a path along the sidewalk
   are fairly conclusive. Res ipsa loquitur is a rule of
   circumstantial evidence that permits the jury to draw an
   inference of negligence. A common statement of the rule is the

19. Literally, "the thing speaks for itself." In tort cases, res ipsa loquitur
    creates a presumption that the defendant was negligent because he or
    she was in exclusive control of the situation and that the plaintiff
    would not have suffered injury but for someone's negligence. Res
    ipsa loquitur shifts the burden to the defendant to prove that he or
    she was not negligent.

20. Evidence that is not "direct" but that provides judges and juries with
    facts that tend to show legal liability.
     422 | INTRODUCTION TO TORT LAW

   following: "There must be reasonable evidence of negligence
   but where the thing is shown to be under the management of
   the defendant or his servants, and the accident is such as in
   the ordinary course of things does not happen if those who
   have the management use proper care, it affords reasonable
   evidence, in the absence of explanation by the defendants, that
   the accident arose from want of care."21

                                          If a barrel of flour rolls out
                                          of a factory window and hits
                                          someone, or a soda bottle
                                          explodes, or an airplane
                                          crashes, courts in every state
                                          permit juries to conclude, in
                                          the absence of contrary
   explanations by the defendants, that there was negligence. The
   plaintiff is not put to the impossible task of explaining
   precisely how the accident occurred. A defendant can always
   offer evidence that he acted reasonably-- for example, that the
   flour barrel was securely fastened and that a bolt of lightning,
   for which he was not responsible, broke its bands, causing it to
   roll out the window. But testimony by the factory employees
   that they secured the barrel, in the absence of any further

                                               INTRODUCTION TO TORT LAW | 423

   explanation, will not usually serve to rebut the inference. That
   the defendant was negligent does not conclude the inquiry
   or automatically entitle the plaintiff to a judgment. Tort law
   provides the defendant with several excuses, some of which are
   discussed briefly in the next section.

  9.3.6 Excuses

   There are more excuses (defenses) than are listed here, but
   those listed here are among the principal defenses that will
   completely or partially excuse the negligence of the defendant.

      9.3.6.1 Contributory and Comparative Negligence
   Under an old common-law rule, it was a complete defense
   to show that the plaintiff in a negligence suit was himself
   negligent. Even if the plaintiff was only mildly negligent, most
   of the fault being chargeable to the defendant, the court would
   dismiss the suit if the plaintiff's conduct contributed to his
   injury. In a few states today, this rule of contributory
   negligence22 is still in effect. Although referred to as negligence,
   the rule encompasses a narrower form than that with which
   the defendant is charged, because the plaintiff's only error in
   such cases is in being less careful of himself than he might have

22. Actions of a plaintiff that contribute to his or her own injuries. In a
    few states, comparative negligence is a complete bar to the plaintiff's
    recovery.
     424 | INTRODUCTION TO TORT LAW

   been, whereas the defendant is charged with conduct careless
   toward others. This rule was so manifestly unjust in many cases
   that most states, either by statute or judicial decision, have
   changed to some version of comparative negligence.23 Under
   the rule of comparative negligence, damages are apportioned
   according to the defendant's degree of culpability. For
   example, if the plaintiff has sustained a $100,000 injury and is
   20 percent responsible, the defendant will be liable for $80,000
   in damages.

      9.3.6.2 Assumption of Risk Risk of injury pervades the
   modern world, and plaintiffs should not win a lawsuit simply
   because they took a risk and lost. The law provides, therefore,
   that when a person knowingly takes a risk, he or she must
   suffer the consequences.

   The assumption of risk doctrine comes up in three ways. The
   plaintiff may have formally agreed with the defendant before
   entering a risky situation that he will relieve the defendant of
   liability should injury occur. ("You can borrow my car if you
   agree not to sue me if the brakes fail, because they're worn and
   I haven't had a chance to replace them.") Or the plaintiff may

23. In most states, the negligence of the plaintiff is weighed against the
    negligence of the defendant, and where the defendant's negligence
    outweighs the plaintiff's, the plaintiff can recover against the
    defendant even though the plaintiff has caused some of his or her
    own injuries.
                                          INTRODUCTION TO TORT LAW | 425

have entered into a relationship with the defendant knowing
that the defendant is not in a position to protect him from
known risks (the fan who is hit by a line drive in a ballpark).
Or the plaintiff may act in the face of a risky situation known
in advance to have been created by the defendant's negligence
(failure to leave, while there was an opportunity to do so, such
as getting into an automobile when the driver is known to be
drunk).

   The difficulty in many cases is to determine the dividing
line between subjectivity and objectivity. If the plaintiff had
no actual knowledge of the risk, he cannot be held to have
assumed it. On the other hand, it is easy to claim that you
did not appreciate the danger, and the courts will apply an
objective standard of community knowledge (a "but you
should have known" test) in many situations. When the
plaintiff has no real alternative, however, assumption of risk
fails as a defense (e.g., a landlord who negligently fails to light
the exit to the street cannot claim that his tenants assumed the
risk of using it).

   At the turn of the century, courts applied assumption of
risk in industrial cases to bar relief to workers injured on the
job. They were said to assume the risk of dangerous conditions
or equipment. This rule has been abolished by workers'
compensation statutes in most states.

   9.3.6.3 Act of God Technically, the rule that no one
is responsible for an "act of God," or force majeure as it is
sometimes called, is not an excuse but a defense premised on
     426 | INTRODUCTION TO TORT LAW

   a lack of causation. If a force of nature caused the harm, then
   the defendant was not negligent in the first place. A marina,
   obligated to look after boats moored at its dock, is not liable
   if a sudden and fierce storm against which no precaution was
   possible destroys someone's vessel. However, if it is foreseeable
   that harm will flow from a negligent condition triggered by
   a natural event, then there is liability. For example, a work
   crew failed to remove residue explosive gas from an oil barge.
   Lightning hit the barge, exploded the gas, and injured several
   workmen. The plaintiff recovered damages against the
   company because the negligence consisted in the failure to
   guard against any one of a number of chance occurrences that
   could ignite the gas.24

      9.3.6.4 Necessity If one is responding to an emergency
   situation, actions which would otherwise be tortious may be
   excused. For instance, trespassing on someone's property to
   save a drowning child would be justified under the doctrine of
   necessity. Proving a necessity defense requires showing that it
   was reasonable to assume the action was necessary to otherwise
   stop unavoidable damages from occurring. Of course, if one
   causes the emergency then the necessity defense would be
   unavailable.

       Vicarious Liability

Liability for negligent acts does not always end with the one
who was negligent. Under certain circumstances, the liability
is imputed to others. For example, an employer is responsible
for the negligence of his employees if they were acting in the
scope of employment. This rule of vicarious liability is often
called respondeat superior, meaning that the higher authority
must respond to claims brought against one of its agents.
Respondeat superior is not limited to the employment
relationship but extends to a number of other agency
relationships as well.

   Legislatures in many states have enacted laws that make
people vicariously liable for acts of certain people with whom
they have a relationship, though not necessarily one of agency.
It is common, for example, for the owner of an automobile
to be liable for the negligence of one to whom the owner
lends the car. So-called dram shop statutes place liability on bar
and tavern owners and others who serve too much alcohol to
one who, in an intoxicated state, later causes injury to others.
In these situations, although the injurious act of the drinker
stemmed from negligence, the one whom the law holds
vicariously liable (the bartender) is not himself necessarily
negligent--the law is holding him strictly liable, and to this
concept we now turn.
428 | INTRODUCTION TO TORT LAW

     Key Takeaway

     The most common tort claim is based on the
     negligence of the defendant. In each negligence
     claim, the plaintiff must establish by a
     preponderance of the evidence that (1) the
     defendant had a duty of due care, (2) the defendant
     breached that duty, (3) that the breach of duty both
     actually and approximately has caused harm to the
     plaintiff, and (4) that the harm is measurable in
     money damages.
     It is also possible for the negligence of one person to
     be imputed to another, as in the case of respondeat
     superior, or in the case of someone who loans his
     automobile to another driver who is negligent and
     causes injury. There are many excuses (defenses) to
     claims of negligence, including assumption of risk
     and comparative negligence. In those few
     jurisdictions where contributory negligence has not
     been modified to comparative negligence, plaintiffs
     whose negligence contributes to their own injuries
     will be barred from any recovery.

9.4 Strict Liability

     Learning Objectives

     After reading this section, you should be able to do
     the following:

         1. Understand how strict liability torts differ
             from negligent torts.

         2. Understand the historical origins of strict
             liability under common law.

         3. Be able to apply strict liability concepts to
             liability for defective products.

         4. Distinguish strict liability from absolute
             liability, and understand the major defenses to
             a lawsuit in products-liability cases.

9.4.1 Historical Basis of Strict Liability:
Animals and Ultrahazardous Activities

To this point, we have considered principles of liability that
430 | INTRODUCTION TO TORT LAW

in some sense depend upon the "fault" of the tortfeasor. This
fault is not synonymous with moral blame.

   Aside from acts intended to harm, the fault lies in a failure
to live up to a standard of reason- ableness or due care. But
this is not the only basis for tort liability. Innocent mistakes
can be a sufficient basis. As we have already seen, someone
who unknowingly trespasses on another's property is liable for
the damage that he does, even if he has a reasonable belief
that the land is his. And it has long been held that someone
who engages in ultrahazardous (or sometimes, abnormally
dangerous) activities is liable for damage that he causes, even
though he has taken every possible precaution to avoid harm
to someone else.

   Likewise, the owner of animals that escape from their
pastures or homes and damage neighboring property may be
liable, even if the reason for their escape was beyond the power
of the owner to stop (e.g., a fire started by lightning that burns
open a barn door). In such cases, the courts invoke the
principle of strict liability, or, as it is sometimes called, liability
without fault. The reason for the rule is explained in Klein v.
Pyrodyne Corp.

9.4.2 Strict Liability for Products

Because of the importance of products liability, this text
devotes an entire chapter to it. Strict liability may also apply
as a legal standard for products, even those that are not
                                           INTRODUCTION TO TORT LAW | 431

ultrahazardous. In some national legal systems, strict liability is
not available as a cause of action to plaintiffs seeking to recover
a judgment of products liability against a manufacturer,
wholesaler, distributor, or retailer. (Some states limit liability
to the manufacturer.) But it is available in the United States
and initially was created by a California Supreme Court
decision in the 1962 case of Greenman v. Yuba Power Products,
Inc.

   In Greenman, the plaintiff had used a home power saw and
bench, the Shopsmith, designed and manufactured by the
defendant. He was experienced in using power tools and was
injured while using the approved lathe attachment to the
Shopsmith to fashion a wooden chalice. The case was decided
on the premise that Greenman had done nothing wrong in
using the machine but that the machine had a defect that
was "latent" (not easily discoverable by the consumer). Rather
than decide the case based on warranties, or requiring that
Greenman prove how the defendant had been negligent,
Justice Traynor found for the plaintiff based on the overall
social utility of strict liability in cases of defective products.
According to his decision, the purpose of such liability is to
ensure that the "cost of injuries resulting from defective
products is borne by the manufacturers. . . rather than by the
injured persons who are powerless to protect themselves."

   Today, the majority of US states recognize strict liability for
defective products, although some states limit strict liability
actions to damages for personal injuries rather than property
432 | INTRODUCTION TO TORT LAW

damage. Injured plaintiffs have to prove the product caused
the harm but do not have to prove exactly how the
manufacturer was careless. Purchasers of the product, as well
as injured guests, bystanders, and others with no direct
relationship with the product, may sue for damages caused by
the product.

   The Restatement of the Law of Torts, Section 402(a), was
originally issued in 1964. It is a widely accepted statement of
the liabilities of sellers of goods for defective products. The
Restatement specifies six requirements, all of which must be
met for a plaintiff to recover using strict liability for a product
that the plaintiff claims is defective:

 1. The product must be in a defective condition when the
      defendant sells it.

 2. The defendant must normally be engaged in the
      business of selling or otherwise distributing the product.

 3. The product must be unreasonably dangerous to the
      user or consumer because of its defective condition.

 4. The plaintiff must incur physical harm to self or to
      property by using or consuming the product.

 5. The defective condition must be the proximate cause of
      the injury or damage.

 6. The goods must not have been substantially changed
      from the time the product was sold to the time the
      injury was sustained.
                                          INTRODUCTION TO TORT LAW | 433

Section 402(a) also explicitly makes clear that a defendant can
be held liable even though the defendant has exercised "all
possible care." Thus in a strict liability case, the plaintiff does
not need to show "fault" (or negligence).

   For defendants, who can include manufacturers,
distributors, processors, assemblers, packagers, bottlers,
retailers, and wholesalers, there are a number of defenses that
are available, including assumption of risk, product misuse and
comparative negligence, commonly known dangers, and the
knowledgeable-user defense. We have already seen assumption
of risk and comparative negligence in terms of negligence
actions; the application of these is similar in products-liability
actions.

   Under product misuse, a plaintiff who uses a product in
an unexpected and unusual way will not recover for injuries
caused by such misuse. For example, suppose that someone
uses a rotary lawn mower to trim a hedge and that after twenty
minutes of such use loses control because of its weight and
suffers serious cuts to his abdomen after dropping it. Here,
there would be a defense of product misuse, as well as
contributory negligence. Consider the urban (or Internet)
legend of Mervin Gratz, who supposedly put his Winnebago
on autopilot to go back and make coffee in the kitchen, then
recovered millions after his Winnebago turned over and he
suffered serious injuries. There are multiple defenses to this
alleged action; these would include the defenses of
contributory negligence, comparative negligence, and product
     434 | INTRODUCTION TO TORT LAW

   misuse. (There was never any such case, and certainly no such
   recovery; it is not known who started this legend, or why.)

      Another defense against strict liability as a cause of action
   is the knowledgeable user defense. If the parents of obese
   teenagers bring a lawsuit against McDonald's, claiming that its
   fast-food products are defective and that McDonald's should
   have warned customers of the adverse health effects of eating
   its products, a defense based on the knowledgeable user is
   available. In one case, the court found that the high levels of
   cholesterol, fat, salt, and sugar in McDonald's food is well
   known to users. The court stated, "If consumers know (or
   reasonably should know) the potential ill health effects of
   eating at McDonald's, they cannot blame McDonald's if they,
   nonetheless, choose to satiate their appetite with a surfeit of
   supersized McDonald's products."25

         Key Takeaway

         Common-law courts have long held that certain

25. Pellman v. McDonald's Corp., 237 F.2d 512 (S.D.N.Y. 2003).

activities are inherently dangerous and that those
who cause damage to others by engaging in those
activities will be held strictly liable. More recently,
courts in the United States have applied strict
liability to defective products. Strict liability,
however, is not absolute liability, as there are many
defenses available to defendants in lawsuits based
on strict liability, such as comparative negligence and
product abuse.

10.1 Introduction: Why
Products-Liability Law Is
Important

     Learning Objectives

     After reading this section, you should be able to do
     the following:

         1. Understand why products-liability law
             underwent a revolution in the twentieth
             century.

         2. Recognize that courts play a vital role in
             policing the free enterprise system by
             adjudicating how the true costs of modern
             consumer culture are allocated.

         3. Know the names of the modern causes of
             action for products-liability cases.

In previous chapters, we discussed contract and tort remedies
for various types of injury. In this chapter, we focus specifically
on remedies available when a defective product causes personal
438 | PRODUCTS LIABILITY

injury or other damages. Products liability describes a type of
claim, not a separate theory of liability. Products liability has
strong emotional overtones--ranging from the prolitigation
position of consumer advocates to the conservative perspective
of the manufacturers.

10.1.1 History of Products-Liability
Law

The theory of caveat emptor--let the buyer beware--that
pretty much governed consumer law from the early eighteenth
century until the early twentieth century made some sense. A
horse-drawn buggy is a fairly simple device: its workings are
apparent; a person of average experience in the 1870s would
know whether it was constructed well and made of the proper
woods. Most foodstuffs 150 years ago were grown at home and
"put up" in the home kitchen or bought in bulk from a local
grocer, subject to inspection and sampling; people made home
remedies for coughs and colds and made many of their own
clothes. Houses and furnishings were built of wood, stone,
glass, and plaster--familiar substances. Entertainment was a
book or a piano. The state of technology was such that the
things consumed were, for the most part, comprehensible
and--very important--mostly locally made, which meant that
the consumer who suffered damages from a defective product
could confront the product's maker directly. Local reputation
is a powerful influence on behavior.
                                                       PRODUCTS LIABILITY | 439

   The free enterprise system confers great benefits, and no one
can deny that: materialistically, compare the image sketched in
the previous paragraph with circumstances today. But those
benefits come with a cost, and the fundamental political issue
always is who has to pay. Consider the following famous
passage from Upton Sinclair's novel The Jungle. It appeared
in 1906. He wrote it to inspire labor reform; to his dismay,
the public outrage focused instead on consumer protection
reform. Here is his description of the sausage-making process
in a big Chicago meatpacking plant:

       There was never the least attention paid to what
       was cut up for sausage; there would come all the
       way back from Europe old sausage that had
       been rejected, and that was moldy and white--it
       would be dosed with borax and glycerin, and
       dumped into the hoppers, and made over again
       for home consumption. There would be meat
       that had tumbled out on the floor, in the dirt and
       sawdust, where the workers had tramped and
       spit uncounted billions of consumption germs.
       There would be meat stored in great piles in
       rooms; and the water from leaky roofs would
       drip over it, and thousands of rats would race
       about on it. It was too dark in these storage
   440 | PRODUCTS LIABILITY

          places to see well, but a man could run his hand
          over these piles of meat and sweep off handfuls
          of the dried dung of rats. These rats were
          nuisances, and the packers would put poisoned
          bread out for them; they would die, and then
          rats, bread, and meat would go into the hoppers
          together. This is no fairy story and no joke; the
          meat would be shoveled into carts, and the man
          who did the shoveling would not trouble to lift
          out a rat even when he saw one--there were
          things that went into the sausage in comparison
          with which a poisoned rat was a tidbit. There
          was no place for the men to wash their hands
          before they ate their dinner, and so they made a
          practice of washing them in the water that was
          to be ladled into the sausage.1

1. Upton Sinclair, The Jungle (New York: Signet Classic, 1963), 136.
                   PRODUCTS LIABILITY | 441

               It became clear from

               Sinclair's expos that

               associated with the marvels

               of           then-modern

               meatpacking                             and

               distribution methods was

food poisoning: a true cost became apparent. When the true

cost of some money-making enterprise (e.g., cigarettes)

becomes inescapably apparent, there are two possibilities. First,

the legislature can in some way mandate that the manufacturer

itself pay the cost; with the meatpacking plants, that would be

the imposition of sanitary food-processing standards.

Typically, Congress creates an administrative agency and

gives the agency some marching orders, and then the agency

crafts regulations dictating as many industry-wide reform

measures as are politically possible. Second, the people who

incur damages from the product (1) suffer and die or (2) access

the machinery of the legal system and sue the manufacturer.

If plaintiffs win enough lawsuits, the manufacturer's insurance

company raises rates, forcing reform (as with high-powered

muscle cars in the 1970s); the business goes bankrupt; or the

legislature is pressured to act, either for the consumer or for the

manufacturer.

If the industry has enough clout to blunt--by various

means--a robust proconsumer legislative response so that

government regulation is too lax to prevent harm, recourse

is had through the legal system. Thus for all the talk about
   442 | PRODUCTS LIABILITY

  the need for tort reform (discussed later in this chapter), the
  courts play a vital role in policing the free enterprise system by
  adjudicating how the true costs of modern consumer culture
  are allocated.

     Obviously the situation has improved enormously in a
  century, but one does not have to look very far to find terrible
  problems today.2

     Products liability can also be a life-or-death matter from
  the manufacturer's perspective. In 2009, Bloomberg
  BusinessWeek reported that the costs of product safety for
  manufacturing firms can be enormous: "Peanut Corp., based
  in Lynchberg, Va., has been driven into bankruptcy since
  health officials linked tainted peanuts to more than 600
  illnesses and nine deaths. Mattel said the first of several toy
  recalls it announced in 2007 cut its quarterly operating income
  by $30 million. Earlier this decade, Ford Motor spent roughly
  $3 billion replacing 10.6 million potentially defective Firestone
  tires."3

        Current State of the Law

Although the debate has been heated and at times simplistic,
the problem of products liability is complex and most of us
regard it with a high degree of ambivalence. We are all
consumers, after all, who profit greatly from living in an
industrial society. In this chapter, we examine the legal theories
that underlie products-liability cases that developed rapidly in
the twentieth century to address the problems of product-
caused damages and injuries in an industrial society.

   In the typical products-liability case, three legal theories are
asserted--a contract theory and two tort theories. The
contract theory is warranty4, governed by the UCC, and the
two tort theories are negligence5 and strict products liability6,
governed by the common law.

4. A guarantee.
5. The legal theory imposing liability on a person for the proximate

  consequences of her carelessness.
6. Liability imposed on a merchant-seller of defective goods without

  fault.
444 | PRODUCTS LIABILITY

Major products liability theories

     Key Takeaway

     As products became increasingly sophisticated and
     potentially dangerous in the twentieth century, and
     as the separation between production and
     consumption widened, products liability became a
     very important issue for both consumers and
     manufacturers. Millions of people every year are
     adversely affected by defective products, and
     manufacturers and sellers pay huge amounts for
     products-liability insurance and damages. The law
     has responded with causes of action that provide a
     means for recovery for products-liability damages.

10.2 Warranties

Learning Objectives

     After reading this section, you should be able to do
     the following:

         1. Recognize a UCC express warranty and how it
             is created.

         2. Understand what is meant under the UCC by
             implied warranties, and know the main types
             of implied warranties: merchantability, fitness
             for a particular purpose, and title.

         3. Know that there are other warranties: against
             infringement and as may arise from usage of
             the trade.

         4. See that there are difficulties with warranty
             theory as a cause of action for products
             liability; a federal law has addressed some of
             these.

The UCC governs express warranties and various implied
warranties, and for many years it was the only statutory control
   446 | PRODUCTS LIABILITY

  on the use and meanings of warranties. In 1975, after years
  of debate, Congress passed and President Gerald Ford signed
  into law the Magnuson-Moss Act, which imposes certain
  requirements on manufacturers and others who warrant their
  goods. We will examine both the UCC and the Magnuson-
  Moss Act.

 10.2.1 Types of Warranties

  10.2.1.1 Express Warranties An express warranty7 is
  created whenever the seller affirms that the product will
  perform in a certain manner. Formal words such as "warrant"
  or "guarantee" are not necessary. A seller may create an express
  warranty as part of the basis for the bargain of sale by means
  of (1) an affirmation of a fact or promise relating to the goods,
  (2) a description of the goods, or (3) a sample or model. Any
  of these will create an express warranty that the goods will
  conform to the fact, promise, description, sample, or model.
  Thus a seller who states that "the use of rustproof linings in
  the cans would prevent discoloration and adulteration of the
  Perform solution" has given an express warranty, whether he

7. Any manifestation of the nature or quality of goods that becomes a
  basis of the bargain.
                                                           PRODUCTS LIABILITY | 447

  realized it or not.8 Claims of breach of express warranty are, at
  base, claims of misrepresentation.

     But the courts will not hold a manufacturer to every
  statement that could conceivably be interpreted to be an
  express warranty. Manufacturers and sellers constantly "puff"
  their products, and the law is content to let them inhabit that
  gray area without having to make good on every claim. UCC
  2-313(2) says that "an affirmation merely of the value of the
  goods or a statement purporting to be merely the seller's
  opinion or commendation of the goods does not create a
  warranty." Facts do.

8. Rhodes Pharmacal Co. v. Continental Can Co., 219 N.E.2d 726 (Ill.
  1976).
   448 | PRODUCTS LIABILITY

  It is not always easy,
  however, to determine the
  line between an express
  warranty and a piece of
  puffery. A salesperson who
  says that a strawberry huller
  is "great" has probably
  puffed, not warranted, when
  it turns out that strawberries
  run through the huller look
  like victims of a massacre.
  But consider the classic cases
  of the defective used car and
  the faulty bull. In the former, the salesperson said the car was
  in "A-1 shape" and "mechanically perfect."

     In the latter, the seller said not only that the bull calf would
  "put the buyer on the map" but that "his father was the
  greatest living dairy bull." The car, carrying the buyer's seven-
  month-old child, broke down while the buyer was en route to
  visit her husband in the army during World War II. The court
  said that the salesperson had made an express warranty.9 The
  bull calf turned out to be sterile, putting the farmer on the
  judicial rather than the dairy map. The court said the seller's

9. Wat Henry Pontiac Co. v. Bradley, 210 P.2d 348 (Okla. 1949).
                                                            PRODUCTS LIABILITY | 449

   spiel was trade talk, not a warranty that the bull would
   impregnate cows.10

      Is there any qualitative difference between these decisions,
   other than the quarter century that separates them and the
   different courts that rendered them? Perhaps the most that can
   be said is that the more specific and measurable the statement's
   standards, the more likely it is that a court will hold the seller to
   a warranty, and that a written statement is easier to construe as
   a warranty than an oral one. It is also possible that courts look,
   if only subliminally, at how reasonable the buyer was in relying
   on the statement, although this ought not to be a strict test. A
   buyer may be unreasonable in expecting a car to get 100 miles
   to the gallon, but if that is what the seller promised, that ought
   to be an enforceable warranty.

      10.2.1.2 Implied Warranties Express warranties are
   those over which the parties dickered-- or could have. Express
   warranties go to the essence of the bargain. An implied
   warranty11, by contrast, is one that circumstances alone, not
   specific language, compel reading into the sale. In short, an
   implied warranty is one created by law, acting from an impulse
   of common sense.

11. A warranty imposed by law that comes along with a product

450 | PRODUCTS LIABILITY

Section 2-314 of the UCC lays down the fundamental rule
that goods carry an implied warranty of merchantability. What
is merchantability? Section 2-314(2) of the UCC says that
merchantable goods are those that conform at least to the
following six characteristics:

 1. Pass without objection in the trade under the contract
      description

 2. In the case of fungible goods, are of fair average quality
      within the description

 3. Are fit for the ordinary purposes for which such goods
      are used

 4. Run, within the variations permitted by the agreement,
      of even kind, quality, and quantity within each unit and
      among all units involved

 5. Are adequately contained, packaged, and labeled as the
      agreement may require

 6. Conform to the promise or affirmations of fact made on
      the container or label if any

The problem is common:

you bite into a cherry pit in

or you choke on the clam shells in the chowder. Is such food fit

for the ordinary purposes to which it is put? There are two

schools of thought. One asks whether the food was natural as

prepared. This view adopts the seller's perspective. The other

asks what the consumer's reasonable expectation was.

The first test is sometimes said to be the "natural-foreign"

test. If the substance in the soup is natural to the

substance--as bones are to fish--then the food is fit for

consumption. The second test, relying on reasonable

expectations, tends to be the more commonly used test.

10.2.1.3 Fitness for a Particular Purpose Section

2-315 of the UCC creates another implied warranty.

Whenever a seller, at the time she contracts to make a sale,

knows or has reason to know that the buyer is relying on the
     452 | PRODUCTS LIABILITY

   seller's skill or judgment to select a product that is suitable for
   the particular purpose the buyer has in mind for the goods
   to be sold, there is an implied warranty that the goods are fit
   for that purpose. For example, you go to a hardware store and
   tell the salesclerk that you need a paint that will dry overnight
   because you are painting your front door and a rainstorm is
   predicted for the next day. The clerk gives you a slow-drying
   oil-based paint that takes two days to dry. The store has
   breached an implied warranty of fitness for particular
   purpose.12

   Note the distinction between
   "particular" and "ordinary"
   purposes. Paint is made to color
   and when dry to protect a surface.
   That is its ordinary purpose, and
   had you said only that you wished
   to buy paint, no implied warranty
   of fitness would have been breached. It is only because you had
   a particular purpose in mind that the implied warranty arose.
   Suppose you had found a can of paint in a general store and
   told the same tale, but the proprietor had said, "I don't know
   enough about that paint to tell you anything beyond what's on

12. A seller's implied warranty that the goods will be suitable for the
    buyer's expressed need.
                                                            PRODUCTS LIABILITY | 453

   the label; help yourself." Not every seller has the requisite
   degree of skill and knowledge about every product he sells to
   give rise to an implied warranty. Ultimately, each case turns on
   its particular circumstances.

      10.2.1.4 Other Warranties Article 2 contains other
   warranty provisions, though these are not related specifically
   to products liability. Thus, under UCC, Section 2-312, unless
   explicitly excluded, the seller warrants he is conveying good
   title that is rightfully his and that the goods are transferred
   free of any security interest or other lien or encumbrance. In
   some cases (e.g., a police auction of bicycles picked up around
   campus and never claimed), the buyer should know that the
   seller does not claim title in himself, nor that title will
   necessarily be good against a third party, and so subsection
   (2) excludes warranties in these circumstances. But the
   circumstances must be so obvious that no reasonable person
   would suppose otherwise.

      In Menzel v. List, an art gallery sold a painting by Marc
   Chagall that it purchased in Paris.13 The painting had been
   stolen by the Germans when the original owner was forced
   to flee Belgium in the 1930s. Now in the United States, the
   original owner discovered that a new owner had the painting
   and successfully sued for its return. The customer then sued
   the gallery, claiming that it had breached the implied warranty

13. Menzel v. List, 246 N.E.2d 742 (N.Y. 1969).
454 | PRODUCTS LIABILITY

of title when it sold the painting. The court agreed and
awarded damages equal to the appreciated value of the
painting. A good-faith purchaser who must surrender stolen
goods to their true owner has a claim for breach of the implied
warranty of title against the person from whom he bought the
goods.

   A second implied warranty, related to title, is that the
merchant-seller warrants the goods are free of any rightful
claim by a third person that the seller has infringed his rights
(e.g., that a gallery has not infringed a copyright by selling
a reproduction). This provision only applies to a seller who
regularly deals in goods of the kind in question. If you find
an old print in your grandmother's attic, you do not warrant
when you sell it to a neighbor that it is free of any valid
infringement claims.

   A third implied warranty in this context involves the course
of dealing or usage of trade. Section 2-314(3) of the UCC says
that unless modified or excluded implied warranties may arise
from a course of dealing or usage of trade. If a certain way of
doing business is understood, it is not necessary for the seller
to state explicitly that he will abide by the custom; it will be
implied. A typical example is the obligation of a dog dealer to
provide pedigree papers to prove the dog's lineage conforms to
the contract.

10.2.2 Problems with Warranty
Theory

                                      10.2.2.1 In General It
                                      may seem that a person
                                      asserting a claim for breach
                                      of warranty will have a good
                                      chance of success under an
                                      express warranty or implied
                                      warranty theory of
                                      merchantability or fitness
                                      for a particular purpose. In
                                      practice, though, claimants
                                      are in many cases denied
                                      recovery. Here are four
                                      general problems:

   The claimant must prove that there was a sale.
   The sale was of goods rather than real estate or services.
   The action must be brought within the four-year statute

      of limitations under Article 2-725, when the tender of
      delivery is made, not when the plaintiff discovers the
      defect.
   Under UCC, Section 2-607(3)(a) and Section
      2A-516(3)(a), which covers leases, the claimant who fails
      to give notice of breach within a reasonable time of
      having accepted the goods will see the suit dismissed, and
456 | PRODUCTS LIABILITY

      few consumers know enough to do so, except when
      making a complaint about a purchase of spoiled milk or
      about paint that wouldn't dry.

In addition to these general problems, the claimant faces
additional difficulties stemming directly from warranty theory,
which we take up later in this chapter.

   10.2.2.2 Exclusion or Modification of Warranties
The UCC permits sellers to exclude or disclaim warranties in
whole or in part. That's reasonable, given that the discussion
here is about contract, and parties are free to make such
contracts as they see fit. But a number of difficulties can arise.

   10.2.2.3 Exclusion of Express Warranties The
simplest way for the seller to exclude express warranties is not
to give them. To be sure, Section 2-316(1) of the UCC forbids
courts from giving operation to words in fine print that negate
or limit express warranties if doing so would unreasonably
conflict with express warranties stated in the main body of
the contract--as, for example, would a blanket statement that
"this contract excludes all warranties express or implied." The
purpose of the UCC provision is to prevent customers from
being surprised by unbargained-for language.

   10.2.2.4 Exclusion of Implied Warranties in General
Implied warranties can be excluded easily enough also, by
describing the product with language such as "as is" or "with
all faults." Nor is exclusion simply a function of what the seller
says. The buyer who has either examined or refused to exam-
                                                       PRODUCTS LIABILITY | 457

ine the goods before entering into the contract may not assert
an implied warranty concerning defects an inspection would
have revealed.

10.2.2.5  Implied

Warranty  of

Merchantability Section

2-316(2) of the UCC

permits the seller to disclaim

or modify the implied

warranty  of

merchantability, as long as

the statement actually

mentions "merchantability"

and, if it is written, is

"conspicuous." Note that

the disclaimer need not be in writing, and--again--all implied

warranties can be excluded as noted.

10.2.2.6 Implied Warranty of Fitness Section

2-316(2) of the UCC permits the seller also to disclaim or

modify an implied warranty of fitness. This disclaimer or

modification must be in writing, however, and must be

conspicuous. It need not mention fitness explicitly; general

language will do. The following sentence, for example, is

sufficient to exclude all implied warranties of fitness: "There
458 | PRODUCTS LIABILITY

are no warranties that extend beyond the description on the
face of this contract."

   Here is a standard disclaimer clause found in a Dow
Chemical Company agreement: "Seller warrants that the
goods supplied here shall conform to the description stated
on the front side hereof, that it will convey good title, and
that such goods shall be delivered free from any lawful security
interest, lien, or encumbrance. SELLER MAKES NO
WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS
FOR A PARTICULAR USE. NOR IS THERE ANY
OTHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY."

   10.2.2.7 Conflict between Express and Implied
Warranties Express and implied warranties and their
exclusion or limitation can often conflict. Section 2-317 of the
UCC provides certain rules for deciding which should prevail.
In general, all warranties are to be construed as consistent with
each other and as cumulative. When that assumption is
unreasonable, the parties' intention governs the interpretation,
according to the following rules: (a) exact or technical
specifications displace an inconsistent sample or model or
general language of description; (b) a sample from an existing
bulk displaces inconsistent general language of description; (c)
express warranties displace inconsistent implied warranties
other than an implied warranty of fitness for a particular
purpose. Any inconsistency among warranties must always be
resolved in favor of the implied warranty of fitness for a
particular purpose. This doesn't mean that warranty cannot be
                                                       PRODUCTS LIABILITY | 459

limited or excluded altogether. The parties may do so. But in
cases of doubt whether it or some other language applies, the
implied warranty of fitness will have a superior claim.

   10.2.2.8 The Magnuson-Moss Act and Phantom
Warranties After years of debate over extending federal law
to regulate warranties, Congress enacted the Magnuson-Moss
Federal Trade Commission Warranty Improvement Act (more
commonly referred to as the Magnuson- Moss Act) and
President Ford signed it in 1975. The act was designed to clear
up confusing and misleading warranties, where--as Senator
Magnuson put it in introducing the bill--"purchasers of
consumer products discover that their warranty may cover a
25-cent part but not the $100 labor charge or that there is full
coverage on a piano so long as it is shipped at the purchaser's
expense to the factory. There is a growing need to generate
consumer understanding by clearly and conspicuously
disclosing the terms and conditions of the warranty and by
telling the consumer what to do if his guaranteed product
becomes defective or malfunctions." The Magnuson-Moss
Act only applies to consumer products (for household and
domestic uses); commercial purchasers are presumed to be
knowledgeable enough not to need these protections, to be
able to hire lawyers, and to be able to include the cost of
product failures into the prices they charge.

   The act has several provisions to meet these consumer
concerns; it regulates the content of warranties and the means
of disclosing those contents. The act gives the Federal Trade
     460 | PRODUCTS LIABILITY

   Commission (FTC) the authority to promulgate detailed
   regulations to interpret and enforce it. Under FTC
   regulations, any written warranty for a product costing a
   consumer more than ten dollars must disclose in a single
   document and in readily understandable language a variety of
   information items, such as a statement of when the warranty
   period starts and expires, how the consumer can utilize
   informal dispute mechanisms, etc.

      In addition to these requirements, the act requires that the
   warranty be labeled either a full or limited warranty. A full
   warranty14 means (1) the defective product or part will be fixed
   or replaced for free, including removal and reinstallation; (2)
   it will be fixed within a reasonable time; (3) the consumer
   need not do anything unreasonable (like shipping the piano to
   the factory) to get warranty service; (4) the warranty is good
   for anyone who owns the product during the period of the
   warranty; (5) the consumer gets money back or a new product
   if the item cannot be fixed within a reasonable number of
   attempts. But the full warranty may not cover the whole
   product: it may cover only the hard drive in the computer, for
   example; it must state what parts are included and excluded. A
   limited warranty15 is less inclusive. It may cover only parts, not

14. Under the Magnuson-Moss Act, a complete promise of satisfaction
    limited only in duration.

15. Under the Magnuson-Moss Act, a less-than-full warranty.
                                                        PRODUCTS LIABILITY | 461

labor; it may require the consumer to bring the product to the
store for service; it may impose a handling charge; it may cover
only the first purchaser. Both full and limited warranties may
exclude consequential damages.

   Disclosure of the warranty provisions prior to sale is
required by FTC regulations; this can be done in a number of
ways. The text of the warranty can be attached to the product
or placed in close conjunction to it. It can be maintained in a
binder kept in each department or otherwise easily accessible
to the consumer. Either the binders must be in plain sight or
signs must be posted to call the prospective buyer's attention
to them. A notice containing the text of the warranty can be
posted, or the warranty itself can be printed on the product's
package or container.

   Phantom warranties are addressed by the Magnuson-Moss
Act. As we have seen, the UCC permits the seller to disclaim
implied warranties. This authority often led sellers to give what
were called phantom warranties--that is, the express warranty
contained disclaimers of implied warranties, thus leaving the
consumer with fewer rights than if no express warranty had
been given at all. In the words of the legislative report of the
act, "The bold print giveth, and the fine print taketh away."
The act abolished these phantom warranties by providing that
if the seller gives a written warranty, whether express or
implied, he cannot disclaim or modify implied warranties.
However, a seller who gives a limited warranty can limit
462 | PRODUCTS LIABILITY

implied warranties to the duration of the limited warranty, if
the duration is reasonable.

   A seller's ability to disclaim implied warranties is also
limited by state law in two ways. First, by amendment to the
UCC or by separate legislation, some states prohibit
disclaimers whenever consumer products are sold. A number
of states have special laws that limit the use of the UCC
implied warranty disclaimer rules in consumer sales. Some of
these appear in amendments to the UCC and others are in
separate statutes. The broadest approach is that of the nine
states that prohibit the disclaimer of implied warranties in
consumer sales (Massachusetts, Connecticut, Maine,
Vermont, Maryland, the District of Columbia, West Virginia,
Kansas, Mississippi, and, with respect to personal injuries only,
Alabama). There is a difference in these states whether the rules
apply to manufacturers as well as retailers. Second, the UCC
at 2-302 provides that unconscionable contracts or clauses will
not be enforced. UCC 2-719(3) provides that limitation of
damages for personal injury in the sale of "consumer goods is
prima facie unconscionable, but limitation of damages where
the loss is commercial is not."

   A first problem with warranty theory, then, is that it's
possible to disclaim or limit the warranty. The worst abuses
of manipulative and tricky warranties are eliminated by the
Magnuson-Moss Act, but there are several other reasons that
                                                            PRODUCTS LIABILITY | 463

   warranty theory is not the panacea for claimants who have
   suffered damages or injuries as a result of defective products.16

         Key Takeaway

         A first basis of recovery in products-liability theory is
         breach of warranty. There are two types of
         warranties: express and implied. Under the implied
         category are three major subtypes: the implied
         warranty of merchantability (only given by
         merchants), the implied warranty of fitness for a
         particular purpose, and the implied warranty of title.
         There are a number of problems with the use of
         warranty theory: there must have been a sale of the
         goods; the plaintiff must bring the action within the
         statute of limitations; and the plaintiff must notify
         the seller within a reasonable time. The seller
         may--within the constraints of the Magnuson-Moss

16. Other issues with warranty law that may limit the plaintiff's recovery
    are lack of "privity" (a contractual relationship with the seller), along
    with tort-theories like assumption of the risk.

10.3 Strict Liability in Tort

     Learning Objectives

     After reading this section, you should be able to do
     the following:

         1. Recognize how the tort theory of negligence
             may be of use in products-liability suits.

         2. Understand why negligence is often not a
             satisfactory cause of action in such suits:
             proof of it may be difficult, and there are
             powerful defenses to claims of negligence.

         3. Know what "strict products liability" means
             and how it differs from the other two
             products-liability theories.
                                                       PRODUCTS LIABILITY | 465

         4. Understand the basic requirements to prove
             strict products liability.

         5. See what obstacles to recovery remain with
             this doctrine.

In addition to contract-law based theories for product liability,
tort theories offer powerful remedies for product liability.
Consumers may allege negligence, or proceed on a strict
products liability theory.

10.3.1 Negligence Claims for
Products Liability

Negligence is the second theory raised in the typical products-
liability case. It is a tort theory (as compared to breach of
warranty, which is of course a contract theory), and it does
have this advantage over warranty theory: privity (a
contractual relationship) is never relevant. A pedestrian is
struck in an intersection by a car whose brakes were defectively
manufactured. Under no circumstances would breach of
warranty be a useful cause of action for the pedestrian--there
is no privity at all.

   There are substantial difficulties in using negligence as a
cause of action in products liability cases. These include:
     466 | PRODUCTS LIABILITY

       Proving negligence at all: just because a product is
         defective does not necessarily prove the manufacturer
         breached a duty of care.

       Proximate cause: even if there was some negligence, the
         plaintiff must prove her damages flowed proximately
         from that negligence.

       Contributory and comparative negligence: the plaintiff's
         own actions contributed to the damages.

       Subsequent alteration of the product: generally the
         manufacturer will not be liable if the product has been
         changed.

       Misuse or abuse of the product: using a lawn mower to
         trim a hedge or taking too much of a drug are examples.

       Assumption of the risk: knowingly using the product in
         a risky way.

                                          Preemption17 (or "pre-
                                          emption") is another
                                          possible defense: suppose
                                          there is a federal standard
                                          concerning the product, and
                                          the defendant manufacturer
   meets it, but the standard is not really very protective. (It is not

17. The theory that a federal law supersedes any inconsistent state law or
    regulation.
                                                            PRODUCTS LIABILITY | 467

   uncommon, of course, for federal standard makers of all types
   to be significantly influenced by lobbyists for the industries
   being regulated by the standards.) Is it enough for the
   manufacturer to point to its satisfaction of the standard so
   that such satisfaction preempts (takes over) any common-law
   negligence claim? "We built the machine to federal standards:
   we can't be liable. Our compliance with the federal safety
   standard is an affirmative defense."

      Preemption is typically raised as a defense in suits about
   (1) cigarettes, (2) FDA-approved medical devices, (3) motor-
   boat propellers, (4) pesticides, and (5) motor vehicles. This is
   a complex area of law. Questions inevitably arise as to whether
   there was federal preemption, express or implied. Sometimes
   courts find preemption and the consumer loses; sometimes
   the courts don't find preemption and the case goes forward.
   According to one lawyer who works in this field, there has been
   "increasing pressure on both the regulatory and congressional
   fronts to preempt state laws." That is, the usual defendants
   (manufacturers) push Congress and the regulatory agencies to
   state explicitly in the law that the federal standards preempt
   and defeat state law.18

10.3.2 Strict Liability

The warranties grounded in the Uniform Commercial Code
(UCC) are often ineffective in assuring recovery for a plaintiff's
injuries. The notice requirements and the ability of a seller to
disclaim the warranties remain bothersome problems, as does
the privity requirement in those states that continue to adhere
to it.

Negligence as a products-liability theory obviates any privity
problems, but negligence comes with a number of familiar
defenses and with the problems of preemption.

   To overcome the obstacles, judges have gone beyond the
commercial statutes and the ancient concepts of negligence.
They have fashioned a tort theory of products liability based
on the principle of strict products liability. One court
expressed the rationale for the development of the concept as
follows: "The rule of strict liability for defective products is
an example of necessary paternalism judicially shifting risk of
loss by application of tort doctrine because [the UCC] scheme
fails to adequately cover the situation. Judicial paternalism is
to loss shifting what garlic is to a stew--sometimes necessary
to give full flavor to statutory law, always distinctly noticeable
in its result, overwhelmingly counterproductive if excessive,
                                                            PRODUCTS LIABILITY | 469

   and never an end in itself.19 Paternalism or not, strict liability
   has become a very important legal theory in products-liability
   cases.

      10.3.2.1 Strict Liability Defined The formulation of
   strict liability that most courts use is Section 402A of the
   Restatement of Torts (Second), set out here in full:

     1. One who sells any product in a defective condition
         unreasonably dangerous to the user or consumer or to
         his property is subject to liability for physical harm
         thereby caused to the ultimate user or consumer, or to
         his property, if

     2. (a) the seller is engaged in the business of selling such a
         product, and

     3. (b) it is expected to and does reach the user or consumer
         without substantial change in the condition in which it
         is sold.

     4. This rule applies even though
     5. (a) the seller has exercised all possible care in the

         preparation and sale of his product, and
     6. (b) the user or consumer has not bought the product

         from or entered into any contractual relation with the
         seller.

19. Kaiser Steel Corp. v. Westinghouse Electric Corp., 127 Cal. Rptr. 838
    (Cal. 1976).
470 | PRODUCTS LIABILITY

Section 402A of the Restatement avoids the warranty booby
traps. It states a rule of law not governed by the UCC, so
limitations and exclusions in warranties will not apply to a suit
based on the Restatement theory. And the consumer is under
no obligation to give notice to the seller within a reasonable
time of any injuries. Privity is not a requirement; the language
of the Restatement says it applies to "the user or consumer,"
but courts have readily found that bystanders in various
situations are entitled to bring actions under Restatement,
Section 402A. The formulation of strict liability, though, is
limited to physical harm. Many courts have held that a person
who suffers economic loss must resort to warranty law.

   Strict liability avoids some negligence traps, too. No proof of
negligence is required.

   10.3.2.2 Section 402A Elements
   10.3.2.2.1 Product in a Defective Condition Sales
of goods but not sales of services are covered under the
Restatement, Section 402A. Furthermore, the plaintiff will
not prevail if the product was safe for normal handling and
consumption when sold. A glass soda bottle that is properly
capped is not in a defective condition merely because it can be
broken if the consumer should happen to drop it, making the
jagged glass dangerous. Chocolate candy bars are not defective
merely because you can become ill by eating too many of them
at once. On the other hand, a seller would be liable for a
product defectively packaged, so that it could explode or
deteriorate and change its chemical composition. A product
                                                        PRODUCTS LIABILITY | 471

can also be in a defective condition if there is danger that could
come from an anticipated wrongful use, such as a drug that
is safe only when taken in limited doses. Under those
circumstances, failure to place an adequate dosage warning on
the container makes the product defective.

Chocolate bars are not defective because one becomes ill by
eating too many!

The plaintiff bears the burden of proving that the product is in
a defective condition, and this burden can be difficult to meet.
Many products are the result of complex feats of engineering.
Expert witnesses are necessary to prove that the products were
defectively manufactured, and these are not always easy to
come by. This difficulty of proof is one reason why many cases
raise the failure to warn as the dispositive issue, since in the
right case that issue is far easier to prove. The Anderson case
     472 | PRODUCTS LIABILITY

   (detailed in the exercises at the end of this chapter)
   demonstrates that the plaintiff cannot prevail under strict
   liability merely because he was injured. It is not the fact of
   injury that is dispositive but the defective condition of the
   product.

      10.3.2.2.2 Unreasonably Dangerous The product
   must be not merely dangerous but unreasonably dangerous.
   Most products have characteristics that make them dangerous
   in certain circumstances. As the Restatement commentators
   note, "Good whiskey is not unreasonably dangerous merely
   because it will make some people drunk, and is especially
   dangerous to alcoholics; but bad whiskey, containing a
   dangerous amount of fuel oil, is unreasonably dangerous.
   Good butter is not unreasonably dangerous merely because, if
   such be the case, it deposits cholesterol in the arteries and leads
   to heart attacks; but bad butter, contaminated with poisonous
   fish oil, is unreasonably dangerous."20 Under Section 402A,
   "the article sold must be dangerous to an extent beyond that
   which would be contemplated by the ordinary consumer who
   purchases it, with the ordinary knowledge common to the
   community as to its characteristics."

      Even high risks of danger are not necessarily unreasonable.
   Some products are unavoidably unsafe; rabies vaccines, for
   example, can cause dreadful side effects. But the disease itself,

20. Restatement (Second) of Contracts, Section 402A(i).
                                                       PRODUCTS LIABILITY | 473

almost always fatal, is worse. A product is unavoidably unsafe
when it cannot be made safe for its intended purpose given the
present state of human knowledge. Because important benefits
may flow from the product's use, its producer or seller ought
not to be held liable for its danger.

   However, the failure to warn a potential user of possible
hazards can make a product defective under Restatement,
Section 402A, whether unreasonably dangerous or even
unavoidably unsafe. The dairy farmer need not warn those
with common allergies to eggs, because it will be presumed
that the person with an allergic reaction to common foodstuffs
will be aware of them. But when the product contains an
ingredient that could cause toxic effects in a substantial
number of people and its danger is not widely known (or
if known, is not an ingredient that would commonly be
supposed to be in the product), the lack of a warning could
make the product unreasonably dangerous within the
meaning of Restatement, Section 402A. Many of the suits
brought by asbestos workers charged exactly this point; "The
utility of an insulation product containing asbestos may
outweigh the known or foreseeable risk to the insulation
workers and thus justify its marketing. The product could still
be unreasonably dangerous, however, if unaccompanied by
adequate warnings. An insulation worker, no less than any
other product user, has a right to decide whether to expose
     474 | PRODUCTS LIABILITY

   himself to the risk."21 This rule of law came to haunt the
   Manville Corporation: it was so burdened with lawsuits,
   brought and likely to be brought for its sale of asbestos--a
   known carcinogen--that it declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy in
   1982 and shucked its liability.22

      10.3.2.2.3 Engaged in the Business of Selling
   Restatement, Section 402A(1)(a), limits liability to sellers
   "engaged in the business of selling such a product." The rule is
   intended to apply to people and entities engaged in business,
   not to casual one-time sellers. The business need not be solely
   in the defective product; a movie theater that sells popcorn
   with a razor blade inside is no less liable than a grocery store
   that does so. But strict liability under this rule does not attach
   to a private individual who sells his own automobile. In this
   sense, Restatement, Section 402A, is analogous to the UCC's
   limitation of the warranty of merchantability to the merchant.

   The requirement that the
   defendant be in the business
   of selling gets to the
   rationale for the whole

21. Borel v. Fibreboard Paper Products Corp., 493 F.Zd 1076 (5th Cir.
    1973).

22. In re Johns-Manville Corp., 36 R.R. 727 (So. Dist. N.Y. 1984).
                                                             PRODUCTS LIABILITY | 475

   concept of strict products liability: businesses should shoulder
   the cost of injuries because they are in the best position to
   spread the risk and distribute the expense among the public.
   This same policy has been the rationale for holding bailors and
   lessors liable for defective equipment just as if they had been
   sellers.23

      10.3.2.2.4 Reaches the User without Change in
   Condition Restatement, Section 402A(1)(b), limits strict
   liability to those defective products that are expected to and
   do reach the user or consumer without substantial change in
   the condition in which the products are sold. A product that
   is safe when delivered cannot subject the seller to liability if it
   is subsequently mishandled or changed. The seller, however,
   must anticipate in appropriate cases that the product will be
   stored; faulty packaging or sterilization may be the grounds for
   liability if the product deteriorates before being used.

      10.3.2.2.5 Liability Despite Exercise of All Due Care
   Strict liability applies under the Restatement rule even though
   "the seller has exercised all possible care in the preparation and
   sale of his product." This is the crux of "strict liability" and
   distinguishes it from the conventional theory of negligence.
   It does not matter how reasonably the seller acted or how
   exemplary is a manufacturer's quality control system--what
   matters is whether the product was defective and the user

23. Martin v. Ryder Rental, Inc., 353 A.2d 581 (Del. 1976).
476 | PRODUCTS LIABILITY

injured as a result. Suppose an automated bottle factory
manufactures 1,000 bottles per hour under exacting standards,
with a rigorous and costly quality-control program designed
to weed out any bottles showing even an infinitesimal amount
of stress. The plant is "state of the art," and its computerized
quality-control operation is the best in the world. It regularly
detects the one out of every 10,000 bottles that analysis has
shown will be defective. Despite this intense effort, it proves
impossible to weed out every defective bottle; one out of one
million, say, will still escape detection. Assume that a bottle,
filled with soda, finds its way into a consumer's home, explodes
when handled, sends glass shards into his eye, and blinds him.
Under negligence, the bottler has no liability; under strict
liability, the bottler will be liable to the consumer.

   10.3.2.2.6 Liability without Contractual Relation
Under Restatement, Section 402A(2)(b), strict liability applies
even though the user has not purchased the product from the
seller nor has the user entered into any contractual relation
with the seller. In short, privity is abolished and the injured
user may use the theory of strict liability against manufacturers
and wholesalers as well as retailers. Here, however, the courts
have varied in their approaches; the trend has been to allow
bystanders recovery. The Restatement explicitly leaves open
the question of the bystander's right to recover under strict
liability.

   10.3.2.3 Specific Strict Liability Theories Plaintiffs in
strict products liability actions apply these standards through
                                                       PRODUCTS LIABILITY | 477

three theories: manufacturing defect, design defect, and failure
to warn (which is really just a special case of design defect, with
the defect being the failure to warn).

   10.3.2.3.1 Manufacturing Defect A manufacturing
defect claim centers on the production process. The plaintiff
alleges the product, although potentially designed correctly,
was produced in a faulty manner. This error in the production
process resulted in the plaintiff's injury.

   10.3.2.3.2 Design Defect Manufacturers can be, and
often are, held liable for injuries caused by products that were
defectively designed. The question is whether the designer
used reasonable care in designing a product reasonably safe
for its foreseeable use. The concern over reasonableness and
standards of care are elements of negligence theory.

   Defective-design cases can pose severe problems for
manufacturing and safety engineers. More safety means more
cost. Designs altered to improve safety may impair
functionality and make the product less desirable to
consumers. At what point safety comes into reasonable
balance with performance, cost, and desirability is impossible
to forecast accurately, though some factors can be taken into
account. For example, if other manufacturers are marketing
comparable products whose design are intrinsically safer, the
less-safe products are likely to lose a test of reasonableness in
court.
478 | PRODUCTS LIABILITY

The Reasonable Design Balance

10.3.2.3.3 Failure to Warn We noted that a product may
be defective if the manufacturer failed to warn the user of
potential dangers. Whether a warning should have been affixed
is often a question of what is reasonably foreseeable, and the
failure to affix a warning will be treated as negligence. The
manufacturer of a weed killer with poisonous ingredients is
certainly acting negligently when it fails to warn the consumer
that the contents are potentially lethal.

   The law governing the necessity to warn and the adequacy
of warnings is complex. What is reasonable turns on the degree
to which a product is likely to be misused and, as the
disturbing Laaperi case (below) illustrates, whether the hazard
is obvious.
                                                       PRODUCTS LIABILITY | 479

Failure to warn is a common strict liability theory.

10.3.3 Problems with Strict Liability

Strict liability is liability without proof of negligence and
without privity. It would seem that strict liability is the "holy
grail" of products-liability lawyers: the complete answer. Well,
no, it's not the holy grail. It is certainly true that 402A
abolishes the contractual problems of warranty. Restatement,
Section 402A, Comment m, says,

   The rule stated in this Section is not governed by the
provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code, as to warranties;
and it is not affected by limitations on the scope and content
of warranties, or by limitation to "buyer" and "seller" in those
statutes. Nor is the consumer required to give notice to the
seller of his injury within a reasonable time after it occurs,
480 | PRODUCTS LIABILITY

as provided by the Uniform Act. The consumer's cause of
action does not depend upon the validity of his contract with
the person from whom he acquires the product, and it is not
affected by any disclaimer or other agreement, whether it be
between the seller and his immediate buyer, or attached to
and accompanying the product into the consumer's hands. In
short, "warranty" must be given a new and different meaning
if it is used in connection with this Section. It is much simpler
to regard the liability here stated as merely one of strict liability
in tort.

   Inherent in the Restatement's language is the obvious point
that if the product has been altered, losses caused by injury
are not the manufacturer's liability. Beyond that there are still
some limitations to strict liability.

   10.3.3.1 Disclaimers Comment m specifically says the
cause of action under Restatement, Section 402A, is not
affected by disclaimer. But in nonconsumer cases, courts have
allowed clear and specific disclaimers. In 1969, the Ninth
Circuit observed: "In Kaiser Steel Corp. the [California
Supreme Court] court upheld the dismissal of a strict liability
action when the parties, dealing from positions of relatively
equal economic strength, contracted in a commercial setting
to limit the defendant's liability. The court went on to hold
that in this situation the strict liability cause of action does not
apply at all. In reaching this conclusion, the court in Kaiser
reasoned that strict liability `is designed to encompass
situations in which the principles of sales warranties serve their
                                                             PRODUCTS LIABILITY | 481

   purpose "fitfully at best." ' " It concluded that in such
   commercial settings the UCC principles work well and "to
   apply the tort doctrines of products liability will displace the
   statutory law rather than bring out its full flavor."24

      10.3.3.2 Plaintiff 's Conduct Conduct by the plaintiff
   herself may defeat recovery in two circumstances.

      10.3.3.2.1 Assumption of Risk Courts have allowed
   the defense of assumption of the risk in strict products-liability
   cases. A plaintiff assumes the risk of injury, thus establishing
   defense to claim of strict products liability, when he is aware
   the product is defective, knows the defect makes the product
   unreasonably dangerous, has reasonable opportunity to elect
   whether to expose himself to the danger, and nevertheless
   proceeds to make use of the product. The rule makes sense.

      10.3.3.2.2 Misuse or Abuse of the Product Where
   the plaintiff does not know a use of the product is dangerous
   but nevertheless uses for an incorrect purpose, a defense arises,
   but only if such misuse was not foreseeable. If it was, the
   manufacturer should warn against that misuse. In Eastman v.
   Stanley Works, a carpenter used a framing hammer to drive
   masonry nails; the claw of the hammer broke off, striking him
   in the eye.25 He sued. The court held that while a defense

24. Idaho Power Co. v. Westinghouse Electric Corp., 596 F.2d 924, 9CA
    (1979).

25. Eastman v. Stanley Works, 907 N.E.2d 768 (Ohio App. 2009).
     482 | PRODUCTS LIABILITY

   does exist "where the product is used in a capacity which is
   unforeseeable by the manufacturer and completely
   incompatible with the product's design. . . misuse of a product
   suggests a use which was unanticipated or unexpected by the
   product manufacturer, or unforeseeable and unanticipated
   [but] it was not the case that reasonable minds could only
   conclude that appellee misused the [hammer]. Though the
   plaintiff's use of the hammer might have been unreasonable,
   unreasonable use is not a defense to a strict product-liability
   action or to a negligence action."

      10.3.3.3 Limited Remedy The Restatement says
   recovery under strict liability is limited to "physical harm
   thereby caused to the ultimate user or consumer, or to his
   property," but not other losses and not economic losses. In
   Atlas Air v. General Electric, a New York court held that the
   "economic loss rule" (no recovery for economic losses) barred
   strict products-liability and negligence claims by the purchaser
   of a used airplane against the airplane engine manufacturer
   for damage to the plane caused by an emergency landing
   necessitated by engine failure, where the purchaser merely
   alleged economic losses with respect to the plane itself, and not
   damages for personal injury (recovery for damage to the engine
   was allowed).26

      But there are exceptions. In Duffin v. Idaho Crop Imp. Ass'n,

26. Atlas Air v. General Electric, 16 A.D.3d 444 (N.Y.A.D. 2005).
                                                            PRODUCTS LIABILITY | 483

   the court recognized that a party generally owes no duty to
   exercise due care to avoid purely economic loss, but if there is
   a "special relationship" between the parties such that it would
   be equitable to impose such a duty, the duty will be imposed.27
   "In other words, there is an extremely limited group of cases
   where the law of negligence extends its protections to a party's
   economic interest."

         Key Takeaway

         Negligence is a second possible cause of action for
         products-liability claimants. A main advantage is
         that no issues of privity are relevant, but there are
         often problems of proof; there are a number of
         robust common-law defenses, and federal
         preemption is a recurring concern for plaintiffs'
         lawyers.
         Because the doctrines of breach of warranty and
         negligence did not provide adequate relief to those

27. Duffin v. Idaho Crop Imp. Ass'n, 895 P.2d 1195 (Idaho 1995).
484 | PRODUCTS LIABILITY

     suffering damages or injuries in products-liability
     cases, beginning in the 1960s courts developed a
     new tort theory: strict products liability, restated in
     the Second Restatement, section 402A. Basically the
     doctrine says that if goods sold are unreasonably
     dangerous or defective, the merchant-seller will be
     liable for the immediate property loss and personal
     injuries caused thereby. But there remain obstacles
     to recovery even under this expanded concept of
     liability: disclaimers of liability have not completely
     been dismissed, the plaintiff's conduct or changes to
     the goods may limit recovery, and--with some
     exceptions--the remedies available are limited to
     personal injury (and damage to the goods
     themselves); economic loss is not recoverable.

             reforms in the last two decades.

         3. Know what federal reforms have been
             instituted.

10.4.1 The Cry for Reform

In 1988, The Conference Board published a study that
resulted from a survey of more than 500 chief executive officers
from large and small companies regarding the effects of
products liability on their firms. The study concluded that
US companies are less competitive in international business
because of these effects and that products-liability laws must
be reformed. The reform effort has been under way ever since,
with varying degrees of alarms and finger-pointing as to who
is to blame for the "tort crisis," if there even is one. Business
and professional groups beat the drums for tort reform as a
means to guarantee "fairness" in the courts as well as spur
US economic competitiveness in a global marketplace, while
plaintiffs' attorneys and consumer advocates claim that
     486 | PRODUCTS LIABILITY

   businesses simply want to externalize costs by denying recovery
   to victims of greed and carelessness.

      Each side vilifies the other in very unseemly language:
   probusiness advocates call consumer- oriented states "judicial
   h***-holes" and complain of "well-orchestrated campaign[s] by
   tort lawyer lobbyists and allies to undo years of tort reform at
   the state level,"28 while pro-plaintiff interests claim that there is
   "scant evidence" of any tort abuse.29 It would be more amusing
   if it were not so shrill and partisan. Perhaps the most one can
   say with any certainty is that peoples' perception of reality is
   highly colored by their self-interest. In any event, there have
   been reforms (or, as the detractors say, "deforms").

      Prodded by astute lobbying by manufacturing and other
   business trade associations, state legislatures responded to the
   cries of manufacturers about the hardships that the judicial
   transformation of the products-liability lawsuit ostensibly
   worked on them. Most state legislatures have enacted at least
   one of some three dozen "reform" proposal pressed on them
   over the last two decades. Some of these measures do little
   more than affirm and clarify case law. Among the most that
   have passed in several states are outlined in the next sections.

      10.4.1.1 Statutes of Repose Perhaps nothing so

   frightens the manufacturer as the occa- sional reports of cases
   involving products that were fifty or sixty years old or more at
   the time they injured the plaintiff. Many states have addressed
   this problem by enacting the so-called statute of repose.30 This
   statute establishes a time period, generally ranging from six to
   twelve years; the manufacturer is not liable for injuries caused
   by the product after this time has passed.

      10.4.1.2 State-of-the-Art Defense Several states have
   enacted laws that prevent advances in technology from being
   held against the manufacturer. The fear is that a plaintiff will
   convince a jury a product was defective because it did not use
   technology that was later available. Manufacturers have often
   failed to adopt new advances in technology for fear that the
   change will be held against them in a products-liability suit.
   These new statutes declare that a manufacturer has a valid
   defense if it would have been technologically impossible to
   have used the new and safer technology at the time the product
   was manufactured.

         Key Takeaway

30. A statute limiting the time that a product manufacturer can be liable
    for its defects.

     Business advocates claim the American tort
     system--products-liability law included--is broken
     and corrupted by grasping plaintiffs' lawyers;
     plaintiffs' lawyers say businesses are greedy and
     careless and need to be smacked into recognition of
     its responsibilities to be more careful. The debate
     rages on, decade after decade, but there have been
     some reforms at the state level.

        8. The remedies for breach of contract.

The two legal cornerstones of business relationships are
contract and tort. Although both involve the concept of duty,
creation of the duty differs in a manner that is important to
business. The parties create contract duties through a
bargaining process. The key element in the process is voluntary
consent; individuals are in control of a situation because they
have the freedom to decide whether to enter into a contractual
relationship. Tort duties, in contrast, are obligations the law
imposes, whether or not the parties desire. Together, voluntary
obligations in contract and involuntary obligations in tort are
the foundational aspects of the common law of business.

11.1.1 The Role of Contract in Society

Contract is probably the most familiar legal concept in our
society because it is so central to a deeply held conviction about
the essence of our political, economic, and social life. In
common parlance, the term is used interchangeably with
agreement, bargain, undertaking, or deal; but whatever the
word, it embodies our notion of freedom to pursue our own
lives together with others. Contract is central because it is the
means by which a free society orders what would otherwise
be a jostling, frenetic anarchy. So commonplace is the concept
of contract--and our freedom to make contracts with each
492 | INTRODUCTION TO CONTRACT LAW

other--that it is difficult to imagine a time when contracts
were rare, an age when people's everyday associations with one
another were not freely determined. Yet in historical terms, it
was not so long ago that contracts were rare, entered into if
at all by very few. In historical societies and in the medieval
Europe from which our institutions sprang, the relationships
among people were largely fixed; traditions spelled out duties
that each person owed to family, tribe, or manor. Though
he may have oversimplified, Sir Henry Maine, a nineteenth-
century historian, sketched the development of society in his
classic book Ancient Law. As he put it:

       (F)rom a condition of society in which all the
       relations of Persons are summed up in the
       relations of Family, we seem to have steadily
       moved towards a phase of social order in which
       all these relations arise from the free agreement
       of Individuals. . . . Thus the status of the Slave
       has disappeared--it has been superseded by the
       contractual relation of the servant to his master. .
       . . The status of the Female under Tutelage . . .
       has also ceased to exist. . . . So too the status of
       the Son under Power has no true place in the
       law of modern European societies. If any civil
       obligation binds together the Parent and the
                                     INTRODUCTION TO CONTRACT LAW | 493

          child of full age, it is one to which only contract
          gives its legal validity. . . . If then we employ
          Status, agreeably with the usage of the best
          writers, to signify these personal conditions
          [arising from ancient legal privileges of the
          Family] only, we may say that the movement of
          the progressive societies has hitherto been a
          movement.1

  This movement was not accidental. It went hand-in-glove with
  the emerging industrial order; from the fifteenth to the
  nineteenth centuries, as England, especially, evolved into a
  booming mercantile economy with all that that
  implies--flourishing trade, growing cities, an expanding
  monetary system, commercialization of agriculture,
  mushrooming manufacturing--contract law was created of
  necessity.

     Contract law did not develop, however, according to a
  conscious, far-seeing plan. It was a response to changing
  conditions, and the judges who created it frequently resisted,
  preferring the quieter, imagined pastoral life of their
  forefathers. Not until the nineteenth century, in both the

1. Sir Henry Maine, Ancient Law (1869), 180-82.
   494 | INTRODUCTION TO CONTRACT LAW

  United States and England, did a full-fledged law of contracts
  arise together with modern capitalism.

 11.1.2 Contract Defined

  As usual in the law, the legal definition of "contract" is
  formalistic. The Restatement says: "A contract is a promise
  or a set of promises for the breach of which the law gives a
  remedy, or the performance of which the law in some way
  recognizes as a duty."2Similarly, the Uniform Commercial
  Code says: " `Contract' means the total legal obligation which
  results from the parties' agreement as affected by this Act and
  any other applicable rules of law."3 A short-hand definition is:
  "A contract is a legally enforceable promise."

 11.1.3 Economic View of Contract
 Law

  In An Economic Analysis of Law (1973), Judge Richard A.
  Posner (a former University of Chicago law professor) suggests
  that contract law performs three significant economic
  functions. First, it helps maintain incentives to individuals to
  exchange goods and services efficiently. Second, it reduces the

  costs of economic transactions because its very existence means
  that the parties need not go to the trouble of negotiating a
  variety of rules and terms already spelled out. Third, the law
  of contracts alerts the parties to trouble spots that have arisen
  in the past, thus making it easier to plan the transactions more
  intelligently and avoid potential pitfalls.

 11.1.4 Sources of Contract Law

  There are four basic sources of contract law: the Constitution,
  federal and state statutes, federal and state case law, and
  administrative law. For our purposes, the most important of
  these, and the ones that we will examine at some length, are
  case law4 and statutes.

     11.1.4.1 Case (Common) Law and the Restatement
  of Contracts Because contract law was forged in the
  common-law courtroom, hammered out case by case on the
  anvil of individual judges, it grew in the course of time to
  formidable proportions. By the early twentieth century, tens
  of thousands of contract disputes had been submitted to the
  courts for resolution, and the published opinions, if collected
  in one place, would have filled dozens of bookshelves. Clearly
  this mass of case law was too unwieldy for efficient use. A
  similar problem had developed in the other leading branches

4. Law decided by judges as recorded and published in cases.
   496 | INTRODUCTION TO CONTRACT LAW

  of the common law. Disturbed by the profusion of cases and
  the resulting uncertainty of the law, a group of prominent
  American judges, lawyers, and teachers founded the American
  Law Institute in 1923 to attempt to clarify, simplify, and
  improve the law. One of its first projects, and ultimately one
  of its most successful, was the drafting of the Restatement of
  the Law of Contracts5, completed in 1932. A revision--the
  Restatement (Second) of Contracts--was undertaken in 1946
  and finally completed in 1979.

                                         The Restatement of
                                         Contracts won prompt
                                         respect in the courts and has
                                         been cited in innumerable
                                         cases. The Restatements are
                                         not authoritative, in the
                                         sense that they are not actual
                                         judicial precedents, but they
                                         are nevertheless weighty
                                         interpretive texts, and judges
                                         frequently look to them for
                                         guidance. They are as close
  to "black letter" rules of law as exist anywhere in the American
  legal system for judge-made (common) law.

5. An organized codification of the common law of contracts.
                                     INTRODUCTION TO CONTRACT LAW | 497

     11.1.4.2 Statutory Law: The Uniform Commercial
  Code Common law contract principles govern contracts for
  real estate and for services, obviously very important areas of
  law. But in one area the common law has been superseded by
  an important statute: the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC),
  the modern American state statutory law governing
  commercial transactions, especially Article 26, which deals
  with the sale of goods (movable, tangible items). Briefly put,
  the UCC is a model law developed by the American law
  Institute and the National Conference of Commissioners on
  Uniform State Laws; it has been adopted in one form or
  another in all fifty states, the District of Columbia, and the
  American territories. Before the UCC was written,
  commercial law varied, sometimes greatly, from state to state.
  This first proved a nuisance and then a serious impediment to
  business as the American economy became nationwide during
  the twentieth century.

     The UCC provides a flexible and yet highly technical
  framework for sale of goods that will, for large part, be beyond
  the scope of this chapter. The text will note some cases when
  substantial and important differences exist between the
  common law (services and real estate) and the UCC (sale of
  goods). For example, under the common law offer must meet

6. That part of the Uniform Commercial Code dealing with the sale of
  goods.
498 | INTRODUCTION TO CONTRACT LAW

acceptance exactly for a contract to be formed, while the UCC
is much more flexible, which reflects commercial practice in
which offered terms and conditions often don't match terms
and conditions in acceptances.

11.1.5 The Convention on Contracts
for the International Sale of Goods

A Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of
Goods (CISG)An international body of contract law. was
approved in 1980 at a diplomatic conference in Vienna. (A
convention is a preliminary agreement that serves as the basis
for a formal treaty.) The Convention has been adopted by
several countries, including the United States.

   The Convention is significant for three reasons. First, the
Convention is a uniform law governing the sale of goods--in
effect, an international Uniform Commercial Code. The
major goal of the drafters was to produce a uniform law
acceptable to countries with different legal, social and
economic systems. Second, although provisions in the
Convention are generally consistent with the UCC, there are
significant differences. For instance, under the Convention,
consideration (discussed below) is not required to form a
contract and there is no Statute of Frauds (a requirement that
some contracts be evidenced by a writing to be
enforceable--also discussed below). Finally, the Convention
represents the first attempt by the US Senate to reform the
                                     INTRODUCTION TO CONTRACT LAW | 499

  private law of business through its treaty powers, for the
  Convention preempts the UCC if the parties to a contract
  elect to use the CISG.7

 11.1.6 Basic Contract Taxonomy

  Contracts are not all cut from the same die. Some are written,
  some oral; some are explicit, some not. Because contracts can
  be formed, expressed, and enforced in a variety of ways, a
  taxonomy of contracts has developed that is useful in lumping
  together like legal consequences. In general, contracts are
  classified along these dimensions: explicitness, mutuality,
  enforceability, and degree of completion. Explicitness is
  concerned with the degree to which the agreement is manifest
  to those not party to it. Mutuality takes into account whether
  promises are exchanged by two parties or only one.
  Enforceability is the degree to which a given contract is
  binding. Completion considers whether the contract is yet to be
  performed or the obligations have been fully discharged by one
  or both parties. We will examine each of these concepts in turn.

     11.1.6.1 Explicitness
     11.1.6.1.1 Express Contract An express contract8 is

7. So yes, the parties may contract for which form of contract law
  applies to their agreement!

8. A contract in words, orally or in writing.
   500 | INTRODUCTION TO CONTRACT LAW

  one in which the terms are spelled out directly; the parties
  to an express contract, whether written or oral, are conscious
  that they are making an enforceable agreement. For example,
  an agreement to purchase your neighbor's car for $500 and to
  take title next Monday is an express contract.

     11.1.6.1.2 Implied Contract An implied contract is one
  that is inferred from the actions of the parties. Although no
  discussion of terms took place, an implied contract exists if it
  is clear from the conduct of both parties that they intended
  there be one. A delicatessen patron who asks for a "turkey
  sandwich to go" has made a contract and is obligated to pay
  when the sandwich is made. By ordering the food, the patron
  is implicitly agreeing to the price, whether posted or not.

     11.1.6.1.3 Contract Implied in Law: Quasi-contract
  Both express and implied contracts embody an actual
  agreement of the parties. A quasi-contract9, by contrast, is an
  obligation said to be ` `imposed by law" in order to avoid
  unjust enrichment of one person at the expense of another. In
  fact, a quasi-contract is not a contract at all; it is a fiction that
  the courts created to prevent injustice. Suppose, for example,
  that a carpenter mistakenly believes you have hired him to
  repair your porch; in fact, it is your neighbor who has hired
  him. One Saturday morning he arrives at your doorstep and

9. A contract imposed on a party when there was none, to avoid unjust
  enrichment.
                                       INTRODUCTION TO CONTRACT LAW | 501

   begins to work. Rather than stop him, you let him proceed,
   pleased at the prospect of having your porch fixed for free
   (since you have never talked to the carpenter, you figure you
   need not pay his bill). Although it is true there is no contract,
   the law implies a contract for the value of the work.

      11.1.6.2 Mutuality The garden-variety contract is one
   in which the parties make mutual promises. Each is both
   promisor and promisee; that is, each pledges to do something
   and each is the recipient of such a pledge. This type of contract
   is called a bilateral contract.10 But mutual promises are not
   necessary to constitute a contract. Unilateral contracts11, in
   which only one party makes a promise, are equally valid but
   depend upon performance of the promise to be binding. If
   Charles says to Fran, "I will pay you five dollars if you wash my
   car," Charles is contractually bound to pay once Fran washes
   the car. Fran never makes a promise, but by actually
   performing she makes Charles liable to pay. A common
   example of a unilateral contract is the offer "$50 for the return
   of my lost dog." Frances never makes a promise to the offeror,
   but if she looks for the dog and finds it, she is entitled to the
   $50.

      11.1.6.3 Enforceability Not every agreement between

10. A contract where each party makes a promise to the other.
11. A contract that is accepted by the performance of the requested

    action, not by a promise.
     502 | INTRODUCTION TO CONTRACT LAW

   two people is a binding contract. An agreement that is lacking
   one of the legal elements of a contract is said to be void12--that
   is, not a contract at all. An agreement that is illegal--for
   example, a promise to commit a crime in return for a money
   payment--is void. Neither party to a void "contract" may
   enforce it.

      By contrast, a voidable contract13 is one that is
   unenforceable by one party but enforceable by the other. For
   example, a minor (any person under eighteen, in most states)
   may "avoid" a contract with an adult; the adult may not
   enforce the contract against the minor, if the minor refuses
   to carry out the bargain. But the adult has no choice if the
   minor wishes the contract to be performed. (A contract may
   be voidable by both parties if both are minors.) Ordinarily, the
   parties to a voidable contract are entitled to be restored to their
   original condition. Suppose you agree to buy your seventeen-
   year-old neighbor's car. He delivers it to you in exchange for
   your agreement to pay him next week. He has the legal right to
   terminate the deal and recover the car, in which case you will of
   course have no obligation to pay him. If you have already paid
   him, he still may legally demand a return to the status quo ante
   (previous state of affairs). You must return the car to him; he
   must return the cash to you.

12. An agreement that never was a contract.
13. A contract that can be annulled.
                                       INTRODUCTION TO CONTRACT LAW | 503

      A voidable contract remains a valid contract until it is
   voided. Thus, a contract with a minor remains in force unless
   the minor decides he does not wish to be bound by it. When
   the minor reaches his majority, he may "ratify" the
   contract--that is, agree to be bound by it-in which case the
   contract will no longer be voidable and will thereafter be fully
   enforceable.

      An unenforceable contract14 is one that some rule of law
   bars a court from enforcing. For example, Tom owes Pete
   money, but Pete has waited too long to collect it and the statute
   of limitations has run out. The contract for repayment is
   unenforceable and Pete is out of luck, unless Tom makes a new
   promise to pay or actually pays part of the debt. (However, if
   Pete is holding collateral as security for the debt, he is entitled
   to keep it; not all rights are extinguished because a contract is
   unenforceable.)

14. A contract for which the non-breaching party has not remedy for its
    breach.
     504 | INTRODUCTION TO CONTRACT LAW

  11.1.7 Degree of Completion

   In medieval England,
   contract--defined as set of
   promises--was not an
   intuitive concept. The
   courts gave relief to one who
   wanted to collect a debt, for
   in such a case the creditor
   presumably had already
   given the debtor something
   of value, and the failure of
   the debtor to pay up was
   seen as manifestly unjust.
   But the issue was less clear
   when neither promise had yet been fulfilled. Suppose John
   agrees to sell Humphrey a quantity of wheat in one month. On
   the appointed day, Humphrey refuses to take the wheat or to
   pay. The modern law of contracts holds that a valid contract
   exists and that Humphrey is required to pay John.

      An agreement consisting of a set of promises is called an
   executory contract15 before either promise is carried out. Most
   executory contracts are enforceable. If one promise or set of
   terms has been fulfilled--if, for example, John had delivered

15. A contract that has yet to be completed.
                                      INTRODUCTION TO CONTRACT LAW | 505

   the wheat to Humphrey--the contract is called partially
   executed.16 A contract that has been carried out fully by both
   parties is called an executed contract.17

      Finally, the common law recognizes contracts that are
   "substantially" performed. If one party to a contract performs
   in a way that doesn't precisely fulfill the contract, but fulfills its
   essential terms, the common law would require the other party
   perform. For example, if someone building a house for another
   installed the cabinets incorrectly, the buyer would still need
   to pay for the house. The buyer could then claim damages or
   require the builder to fix the cabinets. The UCC has a different
   rule for buying goods: sellers are bound by the "perfect tender"
   rule, which requires that buyers receive exactly what they
   ordered or they may reject the good.

         Key Takeaway

         Contract is the mechanism by which people in

16. A contract in which one party has performed, or partly performed,
    and the other has not.

17. A contract that has been completed.
506 | INTRODUCTION TO CONTRACT LAW

     modern society make choices for themselves, as
     opposed to being born or placed into a status as is
     common in feudal societies. A contract is a legally
     enforceable promise. The law of contract is the
     common law (for contracts involving real estate and
     services), statutory law (the Uniform Commercial
     Code for contract involving the sale or leasing of
     goods), and treaty law (the Convention on the
     International Sale of Goods). Contracts may be
     described based on the degree of their explicitness,
     mutuality, enforceability, and degree of completion.

11.2 Contract Formation

     Learning Objectives

     After reading this section, you should be able to do
     the following:
                                  INTRODUCTION TO CONTRACT LAW | 507

         1. Understand the elements of common-law
             contracts: mutuality of agreement (offer and
             acceptance), consideration, legality, and
             capacity.

         2. Learn when a contract must be in writing--or
             evidenced by some writing--to be
             enforceable.

Although it has countless wrinkles and nuances, contract law
asks two principal questions: did the parties create a valid,
enforceable contract? What remedies are available when one
party breaks the contract? The answer to the first question is
not always obvious; the range of factors that must be taken
into account can be large and their relationship subtle. Since
people in business frequently conduct contract negotiations
without the assistance of a lawyer, it is important to attend
to the nuances to avoid legal trouble at the outset. Whether a
valid enforceable contract has been formed depends in turn on
whether:

 1. The parties reached an agreement (offer and acceptance);
 2. Consideration was present (some "price was paid for

      what was received in return);
 3. The agreement was legal;
 4. The parties entered into the contract with capacity to
     508 | INTRODUCTION TO CONTRACT LAW

         make a contract; and
     5. The agreement is in the proper form (something in

         writing, if required).

  11.2.1 The Agreement: Offer and
  Acceptance

   The core of a legal contract is the agreement between the
   parties. Although agreements may take any form, including
   unspoken conduct between the parties, they are usually
   structured in terms of an offer and an acceptance. Note,
   however, that not every agreement, in the broadest sense of
   the word, need consist of an offer and acceptance, and it is
   entirely possible, therefore, for two persons to reach agreement
   without forming a contract. For example, people may agree
   that the weather is pleasant or that it would be preferable to
   go out for Chinese food rather than seeing a foreign film; in
   neither case has a contract been formed. One of the major
   functions of the law of contracts is to sort out those
   agreements that are legally binding--those that are
   contracts--from those that are not.

      The Restatement (Second) of Contracts defines agreement as
   a "manifestation of mutual assent by two or more persons to
   one another."18 The UCC defines agreement as "the bargain of

18. (Section 3)
                                      INTRODUCTION TO CONTRACT LAW | 509

   the parties in fact as found in their language or by implication
   from other circumstances including course of dealing or usage
   of trade or course of performance."19 The critical question
   is what the parties objectively said or did, not what they
   subjectively thought they said or did.

      The distinction between objective and subjective standards
   crops up occasionally when one person claims he spoke in
   jest. The vice president of a manufacturer of punchboards,
   used in gambling, testified to the Washington State Game
   Commission that he would pay $100,000 to anyone who
   found a "crooked board." Barnes, a bartender, who had
   purchased two that were crooked some time before, brought
   one to the company office, and demanded payment. The
   company refused, claiming that the statement was made in
   jest (the audience before the commission had laughed when
   the offer was made). The court disagreed, holding that it was
   reasonable to interpret the pledge of $100,000 as a means of
   promoting punchboards:

           [I]f the jest is not apparent and a reasonable
           hearer would believe that an offer was being
           made, then the speaker risks the formation of a

19. (Section 1-201(3))
     510 | INTRODUCTION TO CONTRACT LAW

           contract which was not intended. It is the
           objective manifestations of the offeror that
           count and not secret, unexpressed intentions. If a
           party's words or acts, judged by a reasonable
           standard, manifest an intention to agree in
           regard to the matter in question, that agreement
           is established, and it is immaterial what may be
           the real but unexpressed state of the party's
           mind on the subject.20

   An offer is a manifestation of willingness to enter into a
   bargain such that it would be reasonable for another individual
   to conclude that assent to the offer would complete the
   bargain. Offers must be communicated and must be definite;
   that is, they must spell out terms to which the offeree can
   assent.

      To constitute an agreement, there must be an acceptance
   of the offer. The offeree must manifest his assent to the terms
   of the offer in a manner invited or required by the offer. If the
   offer says "accept in skywriting at noon", then the only way to
   accept the offer is to hire an airplane. If the offeror specifies no
   particular mode, then acceptance is effective when transmitted

20. Barnes v. Treece, 549 P.2d 1152 (Wash. App. 1976).
                                       INTRODUCTION TO CONTRACT LAW | 511

   as long as the offeree uses a reasonable method of acceptance.
   It is implied that the offeree can use the same means used
   by the offeror or a means of communication customary to
   the industry. For example, the use of the postal service was
   so customary that acceptances are considered effective when
   mailed, regardless of the method used to transmit the offer.
   Indeed, the so-called "mailbox rule" (the acceptance is effective
   upon dispatch) has an ancient lineage, tracing back nearly two
   hundred years to the English courts.21

  11.2.2 Consideration

   Not every agreement forms a contract. One way in which
   agreements fail to become contracts is because they lack
   consideration. Consideration is the quid pro quo (something
   given or received for something else) between the contracting
   parties in the absence of which the law will not enforce the
   promise or promises made. Consider the following three
   "contracts":

     1. Betty offers to give a book to Lou. Lou accepts.
     2. Betty offers Lou the book in exchange for Lou's promise

         to pay $15. Lou accepts.
     3. Betty offers to give Lou the book if Lou promises to pick

21. Adams v. Lindsell, 1 Bamewall & Alderson 681 (K.B. 1818).
     512 | INTRODUCTION TO CONTRACT LAW

         it up at Betty's house. Lou accepts.

   The question is which, if any, is a binding contract? In
   American law, only situation 2 is a binding contract, because
   only that contract contains a set of mutual promises in which
   each party pledges to give up something to the benefit of the
   other.22

      The existence of consideration is determined by examining
   whether the person against whom a promise is to be enforced
   (the promisor23) received something in return from the person
   to whom he made the promise (the promisee24). That may
   seem a simple enough question. But as with much in the law,

22. The question of what constitutes a binding contract has been
    answered differently throughout history and in other cultures. For
    example, under Roman law, any contract that was reduced to writing
    was binding, whether or not there was consideration in our sense.
    Moreover, in later Roman times, certain promises of gifts were made
    binding, whether written or oral; these would not be binding in the
    United States. And in the Anglo-American tradition, the presence of
    a seal was once sufficient to make a contract binding without any
    other consideration. In most states, the seal is no longer a substitute
    for consideration, although in some states it creates a presumption of
    consideration. The Uniform Commercial Code has abolished the
    seal on contracts for the sale of goods.

23. The one who makes a promise.
24. The one to whom a promise is made.
                                       INTRODUCTION TO CONTRACT LAW | 513

   the complicating situations are never very far away. The
   "something" that is promised or delivered cannot just be
   anything: a feeling of pride, warmth, amusement, friendship;
   it must be something known as a legal detriment25--an act,
   a forbearance, or a promise of such from the promisee. The
   detriment need not be an actual detriment; it may in fact be a
   benefit to the promisee, or at least not a loss. At the same time,
   the "detriment" to the promisee need not confer a tangible
   benefit on the promisor; the promisee can agree to forego
   something without that something being given to the
   promisor. Whether consideration is legally sufficient has
   nothing to do with whether it is morally or economically
   adequate to make the bargain a fair one. Moreover, legal
   consideration need not even be certain; it can be a promise
   contingent on an event that may never happen. Consideration
   is a legal concept, and it centers on the giving up of a legal right
   or benefit.

25. The giving up by a person of that which she had a right to retain.
514 | INTRODUCTION TO CONTRACT LAW

                                      Consideration has two
                                      elements. The first, as just
                                      outlined, is whether the
                                      promisee has incurred a legal
                                      detriment. (Some courts--
                                      although a minority--take
the view that a bargained-for legal benefit to the promisor is
sufficient consideration.) The second is whether the legal
detriment was bargained for : did the promisor specifically
intend the act, forbearance, or promise in return for his
promise? Applying this two-pronged test to the three examples
given at the outset of the chapter, we can easily see why only in
the second is there legally sufficient consideration. In the first,
Lou incurred no legal detriment; he made no pledge to act or
to forbear from acting, nor did he in fact act or forbear from
acting. In the third example, what might appear to be such a
promise is not really so. Betty made a promise on a condition
that Lou come to her house; the intent clearly is to make a gift.
Betty was not seeking to induce Lou to come to her house by
promising the book.
   There is a widely recognized exception to the requirement
of consideration. In cases of promissory estoppel, the courts
will enforce promises without consideration. Simply stated,
                                       INTRODUCTION TO CONTRACT LAW | 515

   promissory estoppel26 means that the courts will stop the
   promisor from claiming that there was no consideration. The
   doctrine of promissory estoppel is invoked in the interests of
   justice when three conditions are met: (1) the promise is one
   that the promisor should reasonably expect to induce the
   promisee to take action or forbear from taking action of a
   definite and substantial character; (2) the action or forbearance
   is taken; and (3) injustice can be avoided only by enforcing the
   promise.

      Timko served on the board of trustees of a school. He
   recommended that the school purchase a building for a
   substantial sum of money, and to induce the trustees to vote
   for the purchase, he promised to help with the purchase and
   to pay at the end of five years the purchase price less the down
   payment. At the end of four years, Timko died. The school
   sued his estate, which defended on the ground that there was
   no consideration for the promise. Timko was promised or
   given nothing in return, and the purchase of the building was
   of no direct benefit to him (which would have made the
   promise enforceable as a unilateral contract). The court ruled

26. To be prohibited from denying a promise when another has
    subsequently relied upon it.
     516 | INTRODUCTION TO CONTRACT LAW

   that under the three-pronged promissory estoppel test,
   Timko's estate was liable.27

  11.2.3 Illegality

   In general, illegal contracts are unenforceable. Thus, one can
   think of "legality" as being a required element of a contract,
   along with agreement, consideration, and capacity. As illegality
   is also a defense to a contract, we cover it later in the chapter.

  11.2.4 Capacity

   A contract is a meeting of minds. If someone lacks mental
   capacity28 to understand what he is assenting to--or that he is
   assenting to anything--it is unreasonable to hold him to the
   consequences of his act.

      Capacity issues often arise when contracting with minors.
   The general rule is that persons younger than eighteen can
   avoid their contracts.

   Although the age of
majority was lowered in
most states during the 1970s
to correspond to the
Twenty-sixth Amendment
(ratified in 1971,
guaranteeing the right to vote at eighteen), some states still put
the age of majority at twenty-one. Legal rights for those under
twenty-one remain ambiguous, however. Although eighteen-
year-olds may assent to binding contracts, not all creditors and
landlords believe it, and they may require parents to cosign.
For those under twenty-one, there are also legal impediments
to holding certain kinds of jobs, signing certain kinds of
contracts, marrying, leaving home, and drinking alcohol.
There is as yet no uniform set of rules. The exact day on which
the disability of minority vanishes also varies. The old
common law rule put it on the day before the twenty-first
birthday. Many states have changed this rule so that majority
commences on the day of the eighteenth (or twenty-first)
birthday.

   A minor's contract is voidable, not void. A child wishing
to avoid the contract need do nothing positive to disaffirm;
the defense of minority to a lawsuit is sufficient. Although the
adult cannot enforce the contract, the child can (which is why
it is said to be voidable, not void).

   When the minor becomes an adult, she has two choices:
     518 | INTRODUCTION TO CONTRACT LAW

   she may ratify the contract or disaffirm29 it. She may ratify
   explicitly; no further consideration is necessary. She may also
   do so by implication--for instance, by continuing to make
   payments or retaining goods for an unreasonable period of
   time. (In some states, a court may ratify the contract before
   the child becomes an adult. In California, for example, a state
   statute permits a movie producer to seek court approval of a
   contract with a child actor in order to prevent the child from
   disaffirming it upon reaching majority and suing for additional
   wages. As quid pro quo, the court can order the producer
   to pay a percentage of the wages into a trust fund that the
   child's parents or guardians cannot invade.) If the child has
   not disaffirmed the contract while still a minor, she may do so
   within a reasonable time after reaching majority.

      In most cases of disavowal, the only obligation is to return
   the goods (if he still has them) or repay the consideration
   (unless it has been dissipated). However, in two situations, a
   minor might incur greater liability: contracts for necessities
   and misrepresentation of age.

      11.2.4.1 Contract for Necessities At common law, a
   "necessity" was defined as an essential need of a human being:
   food, medicine, clothing, and shelter. In recent years, however,
   the courts have expanded the concept, so that in many states
   today necessities include property and services that will enable

29. To legally disavow or avoid a contract.
                                  INTRODUCTION TO CONTRACT LAW | 519

the minor to earn a living and to provide for those dependent
on him. If the contract is executory, the minor can simply
disaffirm. If the contract has been executed, however, the
minor must face more onerous consequences. Although he
will not be required to perform under the contract, he will
be liable under a theory of "quasi-contract" for the reasonable
value of the necessity.

   11.2.4.2 Misrepresentation of Age In most states, a
minor may misrepresent his age and disaffirm in accordance
with the general rule, because that's what kids do, misrepresent
their age. That the adult reasonably believed the minor was
also an adult is of no consequence in a contract suit. But some
states have enacted statutes that make the minor liable in
certain situations. A Michigan statute, for instance, prohibits
a minor from disaffirming if he has signed a "separate
instrument containing only the statement of age, date of
signing and the signature:" And some states "estop" him from
claiming to be a minor if he falsely represented himself as an
adult in making the 톍ontract. "Estoppel" is a refusal by the
courts on equitable grounds to listen to an otherwise valid
defense; unless the minor can return the consideration, the
contract will be enforced.

   Contracts made by an insane or highly intoxicated person
are also said to have been made by a person lacking capacity.
In general, such contracts are voidable by the person when
capacity is regained (or by the person's legal representative if
capacity is not regained).
     520 | INTRODUCTION TO CONTRACT LAW

  11.2.5 Form

   As a general rule, a contract need not be in writing to be
   enforceable. An oral agreement to pay a high-fashion model
   $1 million to pose for a photograph is as binding as if the
   language of the deal were printed on vellum and signed in
   the presence of twenty bishops. For centuries, however, a large
   exception has grown up around the Statute of Frauds30, first
   enacted in England in 1677 under the formal name "An Act
   for the Prevention of Frauds and Perjuries." The purpose of
   the Statute of Frauds is to prevent the fraud that occurs when
   one party attempts to impose upon another a contract that did
   not in fact exist.

      The Statute of Frauds requires that certain kinds of
   contracts be in writing to be enforceable. These include:

     1. Contracts to convey an interest in land (such as sale of a
         home);

     2. Contracts that are impossible to fulfill within one year
         (such as a contract entered July 1, for employment
         beginning August 1 and lasting a year);

     3. Contracts in which the consideration is marriage;
     4. Contracts to pay another's debt; and

30. A rule requiring that certain contracts be evidenced by some writing,
    signed by the person to be bound, to be enforceable.
                                       INTRODUCTION TO CONTRACT LAW | 521

     5. Under the UCC, contracts for sale of goods for at least
         $500 (and lease of goods of at least $1,000).

            The Statute of Frauds requires certain kinds of
            contracts to be in writing.

   Again, as may be evident from the title of the act and its
   requirements, the general purpose of the law is to provide
   evidence, in areas of some complexity and importance, that a
   contract was actually made. To a lesser degree, the law serves to
   caution those about to enter a contract and "to create a climate
   in which parties often regard their agreements as tentative until
   there is a signed writing."31

      There are many exceptions to the Statute of Frauds. For
   example, under the UCC, custom goods manufactured, such

31. Restatement (Second) of Contracts Chapter 5, statutory note.
522 | INTRODUCTION TO CONTRACT LAW

as with the logo of another company, would be evidence of the
agreement, as it is unlikely someone would produce custom
goods without an agreement. If the parties have began to
perform according to the oral agreement, it would also be hard
to deny the contract exists, at least as to what has been
performed. For contracts to pay another's debt, if the primary
purpose for which the agreement was made was to benefit
the guarantor, then again an exception applies. These are just
several examples, and so one should research the law carefully
before trying to back out of a contract for Statute of Frauds
concerns. Of course, it would be prudent to render the
agreement in writing to begin with!

   11.2.5.1 Parol Evidence
   11.2.5.1.1 The Rule Unlike Minerva sprung forth
whole from the brow of Zeus in Greek mythology, contracts
do not appear at a stroke memorialized on paper. Almost
invariably, negotiations of some sort precede the concluding
of a deal. People write letters, talk by telephone, meet face-
to-face, send e-mails, and exchange thoughts and views about
what they want and how they will reciprocate. They may even
lie and cajole in duplicitous ways, making promises they know
they cannot or will not keep in order not to kill the contract
talks. In the course of these discussions, they may reach
tentative agreements, some of which will ultimately be
reflected in the final contract, some of which will be discarded
along the way, and some of which perhaps will not be included
in the final agreement but will nevertheless not be contradicted
                                  INTRODUCTION TO CONTRACT LAW | 523

by it. Whether any weight should be given to these prior
agreements is a problem that frequently arises.

The rule at common law is this: a written contract intended
to be the parties' complete understanding discharges all prior
or contemporaneous promises, statements, or agreements that
add to, vary, or conflict with it.

   The rule applies to all written contracts, whether or not the
Statute of Frauds requires them to be in writing. The Statute
of Frauds gets to whether there was a contract at all; the parol
evidence rule says, granted there was a written contract, does
it express the parties' understanding? But the rule is concerned
only with events that transpired before the contract in dispute
was signed. It has no bearing on agreements reached
subsequently that may alter the terms of an existing contract.

   11.2.5.1.2 Exceptions to the Parol Evidence Rule
Despite its apparent stringency, the parol evidence rule does
not negate all prior agreements or statements, nor preclude
their use as evidence. A number of situations fall outside the
scope of the rule and hence are not technically exceptions to
it, so they are better phrased as exemptions (something not
within the scope of a rule).

   If the parties never intended the written contract to be their
full understanding--if they intended it to be partly oral--then
the rule does not apply. If the document is fully integrated,
no extrinsic evidence will be permitted to modify the terms
of the agreement, even if the modification is in addition to
     524 | INTRODUCTION TO CONTRACT LAW

   the existing terms, rather than a contradiction of them. If the
   contract is partially integrated, prior consistent additional
   terms may be shown. It is the duty of the party who wants to
   exclude the parol evidence to show the contract was intended
   to be integrated. That is not always an easy task. To prevent
   a party later from introducing extrinsic evidence to show that
   there were prior agreements, the contract itself can recite that
   there were none. Here, for example, is the final clause in the
   National Basketball Association Uniform Player Contract:
   "This agreement contains the entire agreement between the
   parties and there are no oral or written inducements, promises
   or agreements except as contained herein." Such a clause is
   known as a merger or integration clause

      When the parties orally agree that a written contract is
   contingent on the occurrence of an event or some other
   condition (a condition precedent32), the contract is not
   integrated and the oral agreement may be introduced. The
   classic case is that of an inventor who sells in a written contract
   an interest in his invention. Orally, the inventor and the buyer
   agree that the contract is to take effect only if the buyer's
   engineer approves the invention. (The contract was signed in
   advance of approval so that the parties would not need to
   meet again.) The engineer did not approve it, and in a suit

32. A term in a contract that something has to happen before the
    obligation to perform the contract ripens.
                                       INTRODUCTION TO CONTRACT LAW | 525

   for performance, the court permitted the evidence of the oral
   agreement because it showed "that in fact there never was any
   agreement at all."33 Note that the oral condition does not
   contradict a term of the written contract; it negates it. The
   parol evidence rule will not permit evidence of an oral
   agreement that is inconsistent with a written term, for as to
   that term the contract is integrated.

  11.2.6 Third-Party Rights

   11.2.6.1 Assigning Rights Contracts create rights and
   duties. By an assignment34, an obligee (one who has the right to
   receive a contract benefit) transfers a right to receive a contract
   benefit owed by the obligor (the one who has a duty to
   perform) to a third person (assignee); the obligee then becomes
   an assignor (one who makes an assignment). The assignor may
   assign any right unless (1) doing so would materially change
   the obligation of the obligor, materially burden her, increase
   her risk, or otherwise diminish the value to her of the original
   contract; (2) statute or public policy forbids the assignment;
   or (3) the contract itself precludes assignment. A common
   example of this last point are prohibitions against subletting

33. Pym v. Campbell, 119 Eng. Rep. 903 (Q.B. 1856).
34. The passing or delivering by one person to another of the right to a

    contract benefit.
     526 | INTRODUCTION TO CONTRACT LAW

   commonly found in leases-subletting is assigning the
   contractual right of occupancy.

      An assignment of rights effectively makes the assignee stand
   in the shoes of the assignor.35 She gains all the rights against the
   obligor that the assignor had, but no more. An obligor who
   could avoid the assignor's attempt to enforce the rights could
   avoid a similar attempt by the assignee.

      11.2.6.2 Delegating Duties To this point, we have been
   considering the assignment of the assignor's rights (usually,
   though not solely, to money payments). But in every contract,
   a right connotes a corresponding duty, and these may be
   delegated. A delegation is the transfer to a third party of the
   duty to perform under a contract. The one who delegates is
   the delegator. Because most obligees are also obligors, most
   assignments of rights will simultaneously carry with them the
   delegation of duties. Unless public policy or the contract itself
   bars the delegation, it is legally enforceable.

      An obligor who delegates a duty (and becomes a delegator)
   does not thereby escape liability for performing the duty
   himself. The obligee of the duty may continue to look to the
   obligor for performance unless the original contract
   specifically provides for substitution by delegation. This is a
   big difference between assignment of contract rights and
   delegation of contract duties: in the former, the assignor is

35. An assignee takes no greater rights than his assignor had.
                                       INTRODUCTION TO CONTRACT LAW | 527

   discharged (absent breach of assignor's warranties); in the
   latter, the delegator remains liable. The obligee (again, the one
   to whom the duty to perform flows) may also, in many cases,
   look to the delegatee, because the obligee becomes an intended
   beneficiary of the contract between the obligor and the
   delegatee.

      11.2.6.3 Third-Party Beneficiaries The general rule
   is this: persons not a party to a con- tract cannot enforce its
   terms; they are said to lack privity36, a private, face-to-face
   relationship with the contracting parties. But if the persons
   are intended to benefit from the performance of a contract
   between others, then they can enforce it: they are intended
   beneficiaries.

      For example, a contract to paint one's house cannot be
   enforced by a neighbor-the neighbor might benefit from an
   increased home value due to your house looking maintained,
   but this benefit is only incidental. In contrast, a contract
   between A and B to deliver insurance proceeds to C would
   be enforcable by C. C is an intended, rather than merely
   incidental, beneficiary of the contract.

36. The relationship of the immediate parties to a contract, a "private"
    relationship, as between retailer and customer.
528 | INTRODUCTION TO CONTRACT LAW

     Key Takeaway

     A contract requires mutuality--an offer and an
     acceptance of the offer; it requires consideration--a
     "price" paid for what is obtained; it requires that the
     parties to the contract have legal capacity to know
     what they are doing; it requires legality. Certain
     contracts--governed by the statute of frauds--are
     required to be evidenced by some writing, signed by
     the party to be bound. The purpose here is to avoid
     the fraud that occurs when one person attempts to
     impose upon another a contract that did not really
     exist. The parol evidence rule states that if a written
     contract is integrated, evidence of prior oral
     agreements cannot be used in court. Third parties
     may have stakes in contracts: contractual rights can
     be assigned in most cases, and contractual duties
     may be delegated. Intended third party beneficiaries
     may be able to enforce contracts to which they are
     not a party.

Because contracts are voluntary agreements the law will

responded to situations in which someone was not truly free
to enter into the contract, or to situations in which courts felt
it unfair to enforce the agreement. In this section we will study
these doctrines.
530 | INTRODUCTION TO CONTRACT LAW

11.3.1 Fraud

Misrepresentation is a statement of fact that is not consistent
with the truth. If misrepresentation is intentional, it is
fraudulent misrepresentation; if it is not intentional, it is
nonfraudulent misrepresentation, which can be either
negligent or innocent.

   In further taxonomy, courts distinguish between fraud in
the execution and fraud in the induce- ment. Fraud in the
execution occurs when the nature of the document itself is
misrepresented. For example, Alphonse and Gaston decide to
sign a written contract incorporating terms to which they have
agreed. It is properly drawn up, and Gaston reads it and
approves it. Before he can sign it, however, Alphonse shrewdly
substitutes a different version to which Gaston has not agreed.
Gaston signs the substitute version. There is no contract.
There has been fraud in the execution.

   Fraud in the inducement is more common. It involves some
misrepresentation about the subject of the contract that
induces assent. Alphonse tells Gaston that the car Gaston is
buying from Alphonse has just been overhauled--which
pleases Gaston--but it has not been. This renders the contract
voidable.

   11.3.1.1 Nondisclosure A passive type of concealment
is nondisclosure. Although generally the law imposes no
obligation on anyone to speak out, nondisclosure of a fact can
operate as a misrepresentation under certain circumstances.
                                  INTRODUCTION TO CONTRACT LAW | 531

This occurs, for example, whenever the other party has
erroneous information where the nondisclosure amounts to a
failure to act in good faith, or where the party who conceals
knows or should know that the other side cannot, with
reasonable diligence, discover the truth.

   In a remarkable 1991 case out of New York, a New York
City stockbroker bought an old house upstate (basically
anyplace north of New York City) in the village of Nyack,
north of New York City, and then wanted out of the deal when
he discovered--the defendant seller had not told him--that
it was "haunted." The court summarized the facts: "Plaintiff,
to his horror, discovered that the house he had recently
contracted to purchase was widely reputed to be possessed by
poltergeists [ghosts], reportedly seen by defendant seller and
members of her family on numerous occasions over the last
nine years. Plaintiff promptly commenced this action seeking
rescission of the contract of sale. Supreme Court reluctantly
dismissed the complaint, holding that plaintiff has no remedy
at law in this jurisdiction."

   The high court of New York ruled he could rescind the
contract because the house was "haunted as a matter of law":
the defendant had promoted it as such on village tours and
in Reader's Digest. She had concealed it, and no reasonable
buyer's inspection would have revealed the "fact." The dissent
basically hooted, saying, "The existence of a poltergeist is no
     532 | INTRODUCTION TO CONTRACT LAW

   more binding upon the defendants than it is upon this
   court."37

    Can failing to disclose haunting void a real estate contract?

   11.3.1.2 Statement Made False by Subsequent Events
   If a statement of fact is made false by later events, it must
   be disclosed as false. For example, in idle chatter one day,
   Alphonse tells Gaston that he owns thirty acres of land. In
   fact, Alphonse owns only twenty-seven, but he decided to
   exaggerate a little. He meant no harm by it, since the
   conversation had no import. A year later, Gaston offers to
   buy the "thirty acres" from Alphonse, who does not correct

37. Stambovsky v. Ackley, 169 A.D.2d 254 (N.Y. 1991).
                                       INTRODUCTION TO CONTRACT LAW | 533

   the impression that Gaston has. The failure to speak is a
   nondisclosure--presumably intentional, in this
   situation--that would allow Gaston to rescind a contract
   induced by his belief that he was purchasing thirty acres.

      11.3.1.3 Statements of Opinion An opinion, of
   course, is not a fact; neither is sales puffery. For example, the
   statements "In my opinion this apple is very tasty" and "These
   apples are the best in the county" are not facts; they are not
   expected to be taken as true. Reliance on opinion is hazardous
   and generally not considered justifiable.

      If Jack asks what condition the car is in that he wishes to
   buy, Mr. Olson's response of "Great!" is not ordinarily a
   misrepresentation. As the Restatement puts it: "The
   propensity of sellers and buyers to exaggerate the advantages to
   the other party of the bargains they promise is well recognized,
   and to some extent their assertions must be discounted."38
   Vague statements of quality, such as that a product is "good,"
   ought to suggest nothing other than that such is the personal
   judgment of the opinion holder.

      Despite this general rule, there are certain exceptions that
   justify reliance on opinions and effectively make them into
   facts. Merely because someone is less astute than the one with
   whom she is bargaining does not give rise to a claim of
   justifiable reliance on an unwarranted opinion.

  11.3.2 Mistake

   In discussing fraud, we have considered the ways in which
   trickery by the other party makes a contract void or voidable.
   We now examine the ways in which the parties might "trick"
   themselves by making assumptions that lead them mistakenly
   to believe that they have agreed to something they have not. A
   mistake is "a belief about a fact that is not in accord with the
   truth."39

      11.3.2.1 Mistake by One Party
      11.3.2.1.1 Unilateral Mistake Where one party makes
   a mistake, it is a unilateral mis- take.40 The rule: ordinarily, a
   contract is not voidable because one party has made a mistake
   about the subject matter (e.g., the truck is not powerful
   enough to haul the trailer; the dress doesn't fit).
      11.3.2.1.2 Exceptions If one side knows or should know
   that the other has made a mistake, he or she may not take
   advantage of it. A person who makes the mistake of not
   reading a written document will usually get no relief, nor will
   relief be afforded to one whose mistake is caused by negligence
   (a contractor forgets to add in the cost of insulation) unless the
   negligent party would suffer unconscionable hardship if the

40. A mistake made by one party to a contract; relief is not usually

    granted.
                                       INTRODUCTION TO CONTRACT LAW | 535

   mistake were not corrected. Courts will allow the correction of
   drafting errors in a contract ("reformation") in order to make
   the contract reflect the parties' intention.41

      11.3.2.2 Mutual Mistake In the case of mutual
   mistake42--both parties are wrong about the subject of the
   contract--relief may be granted.

      The Restatement sets out three requirements for
   successfully arguing mutual mistake.43 The party seeking to
   avoid the contract must prove that:

     1. The mistake relates to a "basic assumption on which the
         contract was made,"

     2. The mistake has a material effect on the agreed exchange
         of performances, and

     3. The party seeking relief does not bear the risk of the
         mistake.

   Basic assumption is probably clear enough. In the famous "cow

   sell for $1,800).44 Just before the plaintiff was to take Rose
   from the defendant's barn, the defendant discovered she was
   "large with calf"; he refused to go on with the contract. The
   court held this was a mutual mistake of fact--"a barren cow
   is substantially a different creature than a breeding one"--and
   ruled for the defendant. That she was infertile was "a basic
   assumption," but--for example--that hay would be readily
   available to feed her inexpensively was not, and had hay been
   expensive, that would not have vitiated the contract.

   of Performance "Material effect on the agreed-to exchange of
   performance" means that because of the mutual mistake, there
   is a significant difference between the value the parties thought
   they were exchanging compared with what they would
   exchange if the contract were performed, given the standing
   facts. Again, in the cow case, had the seller been required to go
   through with the deal, he would have given up a great deal

more than he anticipated, and the buyer would have received

an unagreed-to windfall.

Bear the Risk of the

Mistake Assume a

weekend browser sees a

painting sitting on the floor

of an antique shop. The

owner says, "That old thing?

You can have it for $100."

The browser takes it home,

dusts it off, and hangs it on the wall. A year later a visitor, an

expert in art history, recognizes the hanging as a famous lost El

Greco worth $1 million. The story is headlined; the antique

dealer is chagrined and claims the contract for sale should be

voided because both parties mistakenly thought they were

dickering over an "old, worthless" painting. The contract is

valid. The owner is said to bear the risk of mistake because he

contracted with conscious awareness of his ignorance: he knew

he didn't know what the painting's possible value might be,

but he didn't feel it worthwhile to have it appraised. He

gambled it wasn't worth much, and lost.

11.3.3 Duress and Undue Influence

11.3.3.1 Duress When a person is forced to do something
     538 | INTRODUCTION TO CONTRACT LAW

   against his or her will, that person is said to have been the
   victim of duress There are two types of duress: physical duress
   and duress by improper threat.

      11.3.3.1.1 Physical Duress If a person is forced into
   entering a contract on threat of physical bodily harm, he or
   she is the victim of physical duress. It is defined by the
   Restatement (Second) of Contracts in Section 174: "If
   conduct that appears to be a manifestation of assent by a party
   who does not intend to engage in that conduct is physically
   compelled by duress, the conduct is not effective as a
   manifestation of assent." A contract induced by physical
   violence is void.45

      11.3.3.1.2 Duress by Economic Threat The second
   kind of duress is duress by economic threat; it is more common
   than physical duress. Here the perpetrator threatens the victim
   economically, who feels there is no reasonable alternative but
   to assent to the contract. It renders the contract voidable. This
   rule contains a number of elements.

      First, the threat must be improper. Second, there must be
   no reasonable alternative. If, for example, a supplier threatens
   to hold up shipment of necessary goods unless the buyer agrees
   to pay more than the contract price, this would not be duress

45. There is different authority on physical violence as a threat or a
    physical action that actually forces a contractual action. For our
    purposes, all forms of physical threat make a contract void.
                                  INTRODUCTION TO CONTRACT LAW | 539

if the buyer could purchase identical supplies from someone
else. Third, the test for inducement is subjective. It does not
matter that the person threatened is unusually timid or that
a reasonable person would not have felt threatened. The
question is whether the threat in fact induced assent by the
victim. Such facts as the victim's belief that the threatener
had the ability to carry out the threat and the length of time
between the threat and assent are relevant in determining
whether the threat did prompt the assent.

   There are many types of improper threats that might induce
a party to enter into a contract: threats to commit a crime or
a tort (e.g., bodily harm or taking of property), to instigate
criminal prosecution, to instigate civil proceedings when a
threat is made in bad faith, to breach a "duty of good faith and
fair dealing under a contract with the recipient," or to disclose
embarrassing details about a person's private life.

   Jack buys a car from a
local used-car salesman, Mr.
Olson, and the next day
realizes he bought a lemon.
He threatens to break
windows in Olson's
showroom if Olson does not buy the car back for $2,150, the
purchase price. Mr. Olson agrees. The agreement is voidable,
even though the underlying deal is fair, if Olson feels he has no
reasonable alternative and is frightened into agreeing. Suppose
Jack knows that Olson has been tampering with his cars'
     540 | INTRODUCTION TO CONTRACT LAW

   odometers, a federal offense, and threatens to have Olson
   prosecuted if he will not repurchase the car. Even though
   Olson may be guilty, this threat makes the repurchase contract
   voidable, because it is a misuse for personal ends of a power
   (to go to the police) given each of us for other purposes. If
   these threats failed, suppose Jack then tells Olson, "I'm going
   to haul you into court and sue your pants off." If Jack means he
   will sue for his purchase price, this is not an improper threat,
   because everyone has the right to use the courts to gain what
   they think is rightfully theirs. But if Jack meant that he would
   fabricate damages done him by a (falsely) claimed odometer
   manipulation, that would be an improper threat. Although
   Olson could defend against the suit, his reputation would
   suffer in the meantime from his being accused of odometer
   tampering.

   11.3.3.2 Undue Influence The Restatement of Contracts
   (Second) characterizes undue influence as "unfair
   persuasion."46 It is a milder form of duress than physical harm
   or threats. The unfairness does not lie in any
   misrepresentation; rather, it occurs when the victim is under
   the domination of the persuader or is one who, in view of
   the relationship between them, is warranted in believing that
   the persuader will act in a manner detrimental to the victim's

46. Restatement (Second) of Contracts, Section 177.
                                       INTRODUCTION TO CONTRACT LAW | 541

   welfare if the victim fails to assent. It is the improper use of
   trust or power to deprive a person of free will and substitute
   instead another's objective. Usually the fact pattern involves
   the victim being isolated from receiving advice except from
   the persuader. Falling within this rule are situations where, for
   example, a child takes advantage of an infirm parent, a doctor
   takes advantage of an ill patient, or a lawyer takes advantage of
   an unknowledgeable client. If there has been undue influence,
   the contract is voidable by the party who has been unfairly
   persuaded. Whether the relationship is one of domination and
   the persuasion is unfair is a factual question. The answer
   hinges on a host of variables, including "the unfairness of the
   resulting bargain, the unavailability of independent advice,
   and the susceptibility of the person persuaded."47

  11.3.4 Illegal Contracts

   11.3.4.1 Contracts that violate a statute Any bargain
   that violates the criminal law-- including statutes that govern
   extortion, robbery, embezzlement, forgery, some gambling,
   licensing, and consumer credit transactions--is illegal. Thus
   determining whether contracts are lawful may seem to be an
   easy enough task. Clearly, whenever the statute itself explicitly
   forbids the making of the contract or the performance agreed

47. Restatement (Second) of Contracts, Section 177(b).
542 | INTRODUCTION TO CONTRACT LAW

upon, the bargain (such as a contract to sell drugs) is unlawful.
But when the statute does not expressly prohibit the making of
sthe contract, courts examine a number of factors.

   11.3.4.2 Unconscionable contracts Courts may refuse
to enforce unconscionable contracts, those that are shockingly
one-sided, unfair, the product of unequal bargaining power, or
oppressive; a court may find the contract divisible and enforce
only the parts that are not unconscionable.

   The common-law rule is reflected in Section 208 of the
Restatement: "If a contract or term thereof is unconscionable
at the time the contract is made a court may refuse to enforce
the contract, or may enforce the remainder of the contract
without the unconscionable term, or may so limit the
application of any unconscionable term as to avoid any
unconscionable result."

   Unconscionability may arise procedurally or substantively.
A term is procedurally unconscionable if it is imposed upon
the "weaker" party because of fine or inconspicuous print,
unexpected place- ment in the contract, lack of opportunity
to read the term, lack of education or sophistication that
precludes understanding, or lack of equality of bargaining
power. Substantive unconscionability arises where the affected
terms are oppressive and harsh, where the term deprives a party
of any real remedy for breach. Most often--but not
always--courts find unconscionable contracts in the context
of consumer transactions rather than commercial transactions.
In the latter case, the assumption is that the parties tend to
                                       INTRODUCTION TO CONTRACT LAW | 543

   be sophisticated businesspeople able to look out for their own
   contract interests.

  11.3.5 Specific Contractual Pitfalls

   Courts have long held that public policy disfavors attempts to
   contract out of tort liability. Exculpatory clauses that exempt
   one party from tort liability to the other for harm caused
   intentionally or recklessly are unenforceable without
   exception. A contract provision that exempts a party from tort
   liability for negligence is unenforceable under two general
   circumstances: (1) when it "exempts an employer from liability
   to an employee for injury in the course of his employment"
   or (2) when it exempts one charged with a duty of public
   service and who is receiving compensation from liability to one
   to whom the duty is owed.48 Contract terms with offensive
   exculpatory clauses may be considered somewhat akin to
   unconscionability.

      Put shortly, exculpatory clauses are okay if they are
   reasonable. Put not so shortly, exculpatory clauses will
   generally be held valid if (1) the agreement does not involve
   a business generally thought suitable for public regulation (a
   twenty-kilometer bicycle race, for example, is probably not one
   thought generally suitable for public regulation, whereas a bus

48. Restatement (Second) of Contracts, Section 195.
     544 | INTRODUCTION TO CONTRACT LAW

   line is); (2) the party seeking exculpation is not performing
   a business of great importance to the public or of practical
   necessity for some members of the public; (3) the party does
   not purport to be performing the service to just anybody who
   comes along (unlike the bus line); (4) the parties are dealing at
   arms' length, able to bargain about the contract; (5) the person
   or property of the purchaser is not placed under control of the
   seller, subject to his or his agent's carelessness; or (6) the clause
   is conspicuous and clear.49

      Another broad area in
   which public policy
   intrudes on private
   contractual arrangements is
   that of undertakings
   between couples, either
   prior to or during marriage. Marriage is quintessentially a
   relation- ship defined by law, and individuals have limited
   ability to change its scope through legally enforceable
   contracts. Moreover, marriage is an institution that public
   policy favors, and agreements that unreasonably restrain
   marriage are void. Thus a father's promise to pay his twenty-
   one-year-old daughter $100,000 if she refrains from marrying
   for ten years would be unenforceable. However, a promise in a
   postnuptial (after marriage) agreement that if the husband

                                       INTRODUCTION TO CONTRACT LAW | 545

   predeceases the wife, he will provide his wife with a fixed
   income for as long as she remains unmarried is valid because
   the offer of support is related to the need.

      Finally, a promise by an employee not to compete with his
   or her former employer is scrutinized carefully by the courts,
   and an injunction50 will be issued cautiously, partly because the
   prospective employee is usually confronted with a contract of
   adhesion51 and is in a weak bargaining position compared to
   the employer, and partly because an injunction might cause
   the employee's unemployment. Many courts are not
   enthusiastic about employment noncompete agreements. The
   California Business and Professions Code provides that "every
   contract by which anyone is restrained from engaging in a
   lawful profession, trade, or business of any kind is to that
   extent void."52 As a result of the statute, and to promote
   entrepreneurial robustness, California courts typically
   interpret the statute broadly and refuse to enforce
   noncompete agreements. Other states are less stingy, and
   employers have attempted to avoid the strictures of no-
   enforcement state rulings by providing that their employment

    should not do.

51. A contract presented to the offeree to take or leave without
    bargaining.

     546 | INTRODUCTION TO CONTRACT LAW

   contracts will be interpreted according to the law of a state
   where noncompetes are favorably viewed.

  11.3.6 Ways to Resolve Ambiguity

   As any reader knows, the meaning of words depends in part
   on context and in part on the skill and care of the writer. As
   Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. once succinctly noted, "A
   word is not a crystal, transparent and unchanged; it is the skin
   of a living thought and may vary greatly in color and content
   according to the circumstances and the time in which it is
   used."53 Words and phrases can be ambiguous, either when
   they stand alone or when they take on a different coloration
   from words and phrases near them. A writer can be careless
   and contradict himself without intending to; people often
   read hurriedly and easily miss errors that a more deliberate
   perusal might catch. Interpretation difficulties can arise for
   any of a number of reasons: a form contract might contain
   language that is inconsistent with provisions specifically
   annexed; the parties might use jargon that is unclear; they
   might forget to incorporate a necessary term; assumptions
   about prior usage or performance, unknown to outsiders like
   judges, might color their understanding of the words they do

53. Towne v. Eisner, 245 US 418, 425 (1917).
                                  INTRODUCTION TO CONTRACT LAW | 547

use. Because ambiguities do arise, courts are frequently called
on to give content to the words on paper.

   Courts attempt to give meaning to the parties'
understanding when they wrote the contract. The intention of
the parties governs, and if their purpose in making the contract
is known or can be ascertained from all the circumstances,
it will be given great weight in determining the meaning of
an obscure, murky, or ambiguous provision or a pattern of
conduct. A father tells the college bookstore that in
consideration of its supplying his daughter, a freshman, with
books for the coming year, he will guarantee payment of up
to $350. His daughter purchases books totaling $400 the first
semester, and he pays the bill. Midway through the second
semester, the bookstore presents him with a bill for an
additional $100, and he pays that. At the end of the year, he
refuses to pay a third bill for $150. A court could construe his
conduct as indicating a purpose to ensure that his daughter
had whatever books she needed, regardless of cost, and
interpret the contract to hold him liable for the final bill.

   The policy of uncovering purpose has led to a number of
tools of judicial interpretation:

   More specific terms or conduct are given more weight
      than general terms or unremarkable conduct. Thus a
      clause that is separately negotiated and added to a
      contract will be counted as more significant than a
      standard term in a form contract.
548 | INTRODUCTION TO CONTRACT LAW

   A writing is interpreted as a whole, without undue
      attention to one clause.

   Common words and terms are given common meaning;
      technical terms are given their technical meaning.

   In the range of language and conduct that helps in
      interpretation, the courts prefer the following items in
      the order listed: express terms, course of performance,
      course of dealing, and usage of trade.

   If an amount is given in words and figures that differ, the
      words control.

   Writing controls over typing; typing controls over
      printed forms.

   Ambiguities are construed against the party that wrote
      the contract.

For an example of resolving ambiguity by construing against,
the drafter, see Grove v. Charbonneau Buick-Pontiac, Inc. in the
Cases section.

     Key Takeaway

     The common law protects the voluntary aspect of
     contract law by policing various ways in which free
                                  INTRODUCTION TO CONTRACT LAW | 549

     will may not be manifest in an agreement. These are
     doctrines such as mistake, duress, and undue
     influence. It also provides methods to avoid
     unconscionable exchanges, methods to stop illegal
     contracts from being enforced, and ways to interpret
     situations in which the parties' intent is unclear.

11.4 Remedies for Breach of
Contract

     Learning Objectives

     After reading this section, you should be able to do
     the following:

           Know the types of damages: compensatory
             and punitive.

           Understand specific performance as a remedy.
           Understand restitution as a remedy.
550 | INTRODUCTION TO CONTRACT LAW

           Recognize the interplay between contract and
             tort as a cause of action.

Monetary awards (called "damages"), specific performance,
and restitution are the three principle remedies when a
contract is broken or "breached".

   In view of the importance given to the intention of the
parties in forming and interpreting contracts, it may seem
surprising that the remedy for every breach is not a judicial
order that the obligor carry out his undertakings. But it is not.
Of course, some duties cannot be performed after a breach:
time and circumstances will have altered their purpose and
rendered many worthless. Still, although there are numerous
occasions on which it would be theoretically possible for
courts to order the parties to carry out their contracts, the
courts will not do it. In 1897, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes,
Jr., declared in a famous line that "the duty to keep a contract
at common law means a prediction that you must pay damages
if you do not keep it."

   By that he meant simply that the common law looks more
toward compensating the promisee for his loss than toward
compelling the promisor to perform--a person always has the
power, though not the right, to breach a contract. Indeed, the
law of remedies often provides the parties with an incentive
                                       INTRODUCTION TO CONTRACT LAW | 551

   to break the contract. In short, the promisor has a choice:
   to perform or pay. The purpose of contract remedies is, for
   the most part, to compensate the non-breaching party for the
   losses suffered--to put the non-breaching party in the position
   he, she, or it would have been in had there been no breach.

      This is very different than tort law! Tort law looks backward,
   to put the injured party in the same position as if the tort had
   not occurred. Contract law looks forward to put the injured
   party in the same position as if the contract had been fulfilled.
   These are called "expectation damages." If giving expectation
   damages is impossible, such as if they cannot be calculated,54
   the law might then look backward and put the parties in the
   same position as if the contract had not been entered.

  11.4.1 Damages

   11.4.1.1 Compensatory Damages One party has the right
   to damages55 (money) when the other party has breached the
   contract unless, of course, the contract itself or other
   circumstances suspend or discharge that right. Compensatory
   damages is the general category of damages awarded to make
   the non-breaching party whole.

54. Such as a contract to start a new business, in which nobody knows
    how well the new business would have performed.

55. Money paid by one party to another to discharge a liability.
552 | INTRODUCTION TO CONTRACT LAW

   11.4.1.2 Consequential Damages A basic principle of
contract law is that a person injured by breach of contract is
not entitled to compensation unless the breaching party, at
the time the contract was made, had reason to foresee the loss
as a probable result of the breach. The leading case, perhaps
the most studied case in all the common law, is Hadley v.
Baxendale, decided in England in 1854. Joseph and Jonah
Hadley were proprietors of a flour mill in Gloucester. In May
1853, the shaft of the milling engine broke, stopping all
milling. An employee went to Pickford and Company, a
common carrier, and asked that the shaft be sent as quickly as
possible to a Greenwich foundry that would use the shaft as
a model to construct a new one. The carrier's agent promised
delivery within two days. But through an error the shaft was
shipped by canal rather than by rail and did not arrive in
Greenwich for seven days. The Hadleys sued Joseph
Baxendale, managing director of Pickford, for the profits they
lost because of the delay. In ordering a new trial, the Court of
Exchequer ruled that Baxendale was not liable because he had
had no notice that the mill was stopped:

       Where two parties have made a contract which
       one of them has broken, the damages which the
       other party ought to receive in respect of such
       breach of contract should be such as may fairly
                                       INTRODUCTION TO CONTRACT LAW | 553

           and reasonably be considered either arising
           naturally, i.e., according to the usual course of
           things, from such breach of contract itself, or
           such as may reasonably be supposed to have
           been in the contemplation of both parties, at the
           time they made the contract, as the probable
           result of the breach of it.56

   This rule, it has been argued, was a subtle change from the
   earlier rule that permitted damages for any consequences as
   long as the breach caused the injury and the plaintiff did not
   exacerbate it. But the change was evidently rationalized, at least
   in part, by the observation that in the "usual course of things,"
   a mill would have on hand a spare shaft, so that its operations
   would not cease.57

      This subset of compensatory damages is called
   consequential damages58--damages that flow as a foreseeable
   consequence of the breach. For example, if you hire a roofer to

fix a leak in your roof, and he does a bad job so that the interior
of your house suffers water damage, the roofer is liable not
only for the poor roofing job, but also for the ruined drapes,
damaged flooring and walls, and so on.

   Whether consequential damages are allowed under the
contract is the source of much litigation. The UCC provides
an extensive set of rules for sale of goods to determine whether
sellers' disclaimers or buyers' inclusion of these terms in
contracts are binding. This kind of dispute is called a "battle of
the forms."

   11.4.1.3 Nominal Damages If the breach caused no
loss, the plaintiff is nevertheless entitled to a minor sum,
perhaps one dollar, called nominal damages. When, for
example, a buyer could purchase the same commodity at the
same price as that contracted for, without spending any extra
time or money, there can be no real damages in the event of
breach.

   11.4.1.4 Incidental Damages Suppose City College
hires Prof. Blake on a two-year contract, after an extensive
search. After one year the professor quits to take a job
elsewhere, in breach of her contract. If City College has to
pay $5000 more to find a replacement for year, Blake is liable
for that amount--that's compensatory damages. But what if
it costs City College $1200 to search for, bring to campus and
interview a replacement? City College can claim that, too, as
                                       INTRODUCTION TO CONTRACT LAW | 555

   incidental damages59 which include additional costs incurred
   by the non-breaching party after the breach in a reasonable
   attempt to avoid further loss, even if the attempt is
   unsuccessful.

      11.4.1.5 Punitive Damages Punitive damages60 are
   those awarded for the purpose of punishing a defendant in a
   civil action, in which criminal sanctions may be unavailable.
   They are not part of the compensation for the loss suffered;
   they are proper in cases in which the defendant has acted
   willfully and maliciously and are thought to deter others from
   acting similarly. Since the purpose of contract law is
   compensation, not punishment, punitive damages have not
   traditionally been awarded, with one exception: when the
   breach of contract is also a tort for which punitive damages
   may be recovered. Punitive damages are permitted in the law of
   torts (in most states) when the behavior is malicious or willful
   (reckless conduct causing physical harm, deliberate defamation
   of one's character, a knowingly unlawful taking of someone's
   property), and some kinds of contract breach are also
   tortuous--for example, when a creditor holding collateral as
   security under a contract for a loan sells the collateral to a

   good-faith purchaser for value even though the debtor was
   not in default, he has breached the contract and committed
   the tort of conversion.61 Punitive damages may be awarded,
   assuming the behavior was willful and not merely mistaken.

      Punitive damages are not fixed by law. The judge or jury
   may award at its discretion whatever sum is believed necessary
   to redress the wrong or deter like conduct in the future. This
   means that a richer person may be slapped with much heavier
   punitive damages than a poorer one in the appropriate case.
   But the judge in all cases may remitA judicial reduction in the
   amount of a damage award (the noun is remission). (lower)
   some or all of a punitive damage award if he or she considers it
   excessive.

      Punitive damage claims have been made in cases dealing
   with the refusal by insurance companies to honor their
   contracts. Many of these cases involve disability payments, and
   among the elements are charges of tortious conduct by the
   company's agents or employees. California has been the leader
   among the state courts in their growing willingness to uphold
   punitive damage awards despite insurer complaints that the
   concept of punitive damages is but a device to permit plaintiffs
   to extort settlements from hapless companies. Courts have also

    equivalent of theft.

   awarded punitive damages against other types of companies
   for breach of contract.

  11.4.2 Specific Performance

   Specific performance62 is a judicial order to the promisor that
   he undertake the performance to which he obligated himself
   in a contract. Specific performance is an alternative remedy
   to damages and may be issued at the discretion of the court,
   subject to a number of exceptions. (When the promisee is
   seeking enforcement of a contractual provision for
   forbearance--a promise that the promisor will refrain from
   doing something--an injunction, a judicial order not to act
   in a specified manner, may be the appropriate remedy.) Emily
   signs a contract to sell Charlotte a gold samovar, a Russian
   antique of great sentimental value because it once belonged to
   Charlotte's mother. Emily then repudiates the contract while
   still executory. A court may properly grant Charlotte an order
   of specific performance against Emily. Specific performance is
   an attractive but limited remedy: it is only available for breach
   of contract to sell a unique item (real estate is always unique).

62. An order directing a person to deliver the exact property (real or
    personal) that she contracted to sell to the buyer.
558 | INTRODUCTION TO CONTRACT LAW

11.4.3 Liquidated Damages

In order to limit risk in contracts, many contractual drafters
choose to include "liquidated damages" clauses. These are
statements in the contract that spell out what damages will
be if the contract is broken. This makes the damages certain,
which lowers risk for the contracting parties. For example, in
a contract for sale of a home, a party might lose their "ready
money" if they back out of the agreement without cause.

   Courts will uphold these clauses so long as they are
reasonable, e.g., in the range of what actual damages might be.
If the liquidated damages clause is unreasonably large, courts
will not enforce it as a penalty. After all, if a liquidated damages
clause was large enough, and courts chose to enforce it, the law
would be favoring a regime of specific performance (as parties
would always find it worthwhile to fulfill contracts rather than
efficiently breach). For example, a liquidated damages clause of
$10,000,000 on the sale of a $100,000 home would is excessive.
If a court chose to enforce a clause like that, the parties would
essentially be forced to perform.
11.4.4                  INTRODUCTION TO CONTRACT LAW | 559

        Restitution

As the word implies,
restitution is a restoring to
one party of what he gave to
the other. Therefore, only to
the extent that the injured
party conferred a benefit on
the other party may the
injured party be awarded
restitution.

   If the claimant has given
the other party a sum of
money, there can be no dispute over the amount of the
restitution interest. Tom gives Tim $100 to chop his tree into
firewood. Tim repudiates. Tom's restitution interest is $100.
But serious difficulties can arise when the benefit conferred
was performance. The courts have considerable discretion to
award either the cost of hiring someone else to do the work
that the injured party performed (generally, the market price of
the service) or the value that was added to the property of the
party in breach by virtue of the claimant's performance.
Mellors, a gardener, agrees to construct ten fences around Lady
Chatterley's flower gardens at the market price of $2,500.
After erecting three, Mellors has performed services that would
cost $750, market value. Assume that he has increased the
value of the Lady's grounds by $800. If the contract is
560 | INTRODUCTION TO CONTRACT LAW

repudiated, there are two measures of Mellors's restitution
interest: $800, the value by which the property was enhanced;
or $750, the amount it would have cost Lady Chatterley to hire
someone else to do the work. Which measure to use depends
on who repudiated the contract and for what reason.

11.4.5 Tort vs. Contract Remedies

Frequently a contract breach may also amount to tortious
conduct. A physician warrants her treatment as perfectly safe
but performs the operation negligently, scarring the patient
for life. The patient could sue for malpractice (tort) or for
breach of warranty (contract). The choice involves at least four
considerations:

 1. Statute of limitations. Most statutes of limitations
      prescribe longer periods for contract than for tort
      actions.

 2. Allowable damages. Punitive damages are more often
      permitted in tort actions, and certain kinds of injuries
      are compensable in tort but not in contract suits--for
      example, pain and suffering.

 3. Expert testimony. In most cases, the use of experts would
      be the same in either tort or contract suits, but in certain
      contract cases, the expert witness could be dispensed
      with, as, for example, in a contract case charging that the
      physician abandoned the patient.
                               INTRODUCTION TO CONTRACT LAW | 561

4. Insurance coverage. Most policies do not cover
    intentional torts, so a contract theory that avoids the
    element of willfulness would provide the plaintiff with a
    surer chance of recovering money damages.

   Key Takeaway

   The purpose of remedies in contract is, usually, to
   put the non-breaching party in the position he or
   she would have been in had there been no breach.
   The remedies are: compensatory damages (money
   paid to compensate the non-breaching party for the
   losses caused by the breach), which also include
   sub-categories of incidental and nominal damages;
   punitive damages (to punish the breaching party)
   are sometimes allowed where the breach is
   egregious and intentional.

     After reading this chapter, you should be able to do
     the following:

           Identify the costs and benefits of operating as
             a sole proprietorship.

           Identify the liability and default management

           Distinguish between LPs, LLPs, and LLCs.
           Understand the steps needed to form an LLC

             and begin a small business in practice.

One of the major decisions involved in starting, or growing, a
                                   SMALL BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS | 563

business is how to legally structure the business entity. If one
does nothing, then a sole proprietorship is created. This has
great flexibility but unlimited personal liability. If one starts
a business with another, but takes no legal steps, a general
partnership has been created. Again, this offers unlimited
personal liability. In contrast, creating a business entity like an
LLC takes little effort and offers the owner protection against
lawsuits.

12.1 Sole Proprietorships

     Learning Objectives

     After reading this section, you should be able to do
     the following:

           Understand the costs and benefits of
             operating as a sole proprietorship.

           Understand the concept of unlimited personal
             liability.

If an individual starts a business by themselves without taking
564 | SMALL BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS

any legal precautions, they have created a "sole
proprietorship". This is a business in which the owner is the
business. This offers great flexibility: if the owner wishes to
work, they may do so. If they wish not to work, nobody will
compel them. The owner can come and go as they please,
set prices as they desire, hire the employees they want, and
fire employees they don't like, all without consulting other
owners.

   These are definitely advantages! It lets businesses be nimble,
and one can start such a business without legal formalities.
In fact, many small businesses in the United States begin as
sole proprietorships. If you've began a solo business enterprise
without taking other legal steps, then you created a sole
proprietorship without realizing it.

   At the same time, operating as a sole proprietor has major
disadvantages. First, it can be hard to raise capital for the
business, because you cannot offer ownership rights in the
form of stock or partnership interests. Second, this type of
business form has unlimited personal liability. Because the
owner is the business, the owner faces unlimited personal
liability for the business. If someone slips and falls on the
premises because the owner was negligent in cleaning up a
spill, and then sues and wins, the owner may lose their home
or retirement account, or be forced into bankruptcy.

   For these reasons, particularly the second, careful
entrepreneurs give thought to liability as they begin a business.
Some feel comfortable by purchasing liability insurance, while
                                   SMALL BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS | 565

many others take the steps to create a business entity that offers
a liability shield, such as a Limited Liability Company or LLC.
Forming an LLC is relatively painless and can protect the
personal assets of the owner.

     Key Takeaway

     A sole proprietorship is a very common way to start
     a new business. No legal formalities need to be
     followed, making this a very easy way to begin an
     enterprise. At the same time, the absence of a
     liability shield means that the proprietor will be
     personally responsible for the liability of the
     business.

  It would be difficult to conceive of a complex society that
  did not operate its businesses through organizations. In this
  section we study partnerships, limited partnerships, and
  limited liability companies, and we touch on joint ventures
  and business trusts.1

     When two or more people form their own business or
  professional practice, they usually consider becoming partners.
  Partnership law defines a partnership as "the association of two

1. A joint venture--sometimes known as a joint adventure,
  coadventure, joint enterprise, joint undertaking, syndicate, group, or
  pool--is an association of persons to carry on a particular task until
  completed. In essence, a joint venture is a "temporary partnership."
                                       SMALL BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS | 567

  or more persons to carry on as co-owners a business for profit.
  . . whether or not the persons intend to form a partnership."2
  When we use the word partnership, we are referring to the
  general business partnership. There are also limited
  partnerships and limited liability partnerships, which are
  discussed later.

     Partnerships are also popular as investment vehicles.
  Partnership law and tax law permit an investor to put capital
  into a limited partnership and realize tax benefits without
  liability for the acts of the general partners.

  Even if you do not plan to work within a partnership, it can be
  important to understand the law that governs it. Why? Because
  it is possible to become someone's partner without intending
  to or even realizing that a partnership has been created.
  Knowledge of the law can help you avoid partnership liability.

 12.2.1 Entity Characteristics of a
 Partnership

  Partnership law is in a state of flux: some states base their
  partnership law on a law called the Uniform Partnership Act
  (UPA) while others use the Revised Uniform Partnership Act
  (RUPA). These laws differ in significant ways, such as whether

2. Revised Uniform Partnership Act, Section 202(a).
568 | SMALL BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS

they treat the partnership as generally a separate legal entity

(RUPA) or as merely the aggregation of the partners (UPA).

In this chapter, for simplicity we will study principles from

RUPA.

       Partnership law (under

       RUPA) treats a partnership

       as a separate legal entity for

       most purposes. This means

       the partnership may keep

       business records as if it were

       a separate entity, it owns

       property as a distinct entity,

       it can be sued as a distinct

       legal entity, and its

       accountants may treat it as

       such for purposes of

       preparing                    income

statements and balance sheets.3 However, for tax purposes and

liability purposes, the partnership remains treated as an

aggregation. As such, partnerships do not pay income taxes.

Instead, each partner's distributive share, which includes

income or other gain, loss, deductions, and credits, must be

included in the partner's personal income tax return, whether

3. When this is not the case, for example, to sue a partnership you must
  sue each partner.
                                   SMALL BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS | 569

or not the share is actually distributed. Similarly for liability
purposes, all partners are, and each one of them is, ultimately
personally liable for the obligations of the partnership, without
limit, which includes personal and unlimited liability. This
personal liability is very distasteful, and it has been abolished,
subject to some exceptions, with limited partnerships and
limited liability companies, as discussed later.

12.2.2 Partnership Formation

The most common way of forming a partnership is
expressly--that is, in words, orally or in writing. Such a
partnership is called an express partnership.

Assume that three persons have decided to form a partnership
to run a car dealership. Able contributes $250,000. Baker
contributes the building and space in which the business will
operate. Carr contributes his services; he will manage the
dealership.

The first question is whether Able, Baker, and Carr must have
a partnership agreement. As should be clear from the
foregoing discussion, no agreement is necessary as long as the
tests of partnership are met. However, they ought to have an
agreement in order to spell out their rights and duties among
themselves.

   The agreement itself is a contract and should follow the
principles and rules of contract law. Because it is intended to
570 | SMALL BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS

govern the relations of the partners toward themselves and
their business, every partnership contract should set forth
clearly the following terms: (1) the name under which the
partners will do business; (2) the names of the partners; (3)
the nature, scope, and location of the business; (4) the capital
contributions of each partner; (5) how profits and losses are to
be divided; (6) how salaries, if any, are to be determined; (7)
the responsibilities of each partner for managing the business;
(8) limitations on the power of each partner to bind the firm;
(9) the method by which a given partner may withdraw from
the partnership; (10) continuation of the firm in the event
of a partner's death and the formula for paying a partnership
interest to his heirs; and (11) method of dissolution.

   If the parties do not provide for these in their agreement,
RUPA will do it for them as the default. If the business cannot
be performed within one year from the time that the
agreement is entered into, the partnership agreement should
be in writing to avoid invalidation under the Statute of Frauds.
Most partnerships have no fixed term, however, and are
partnerships "at will" and therefore not covered by the Statute
of Frauds.

   12.2.2.1 Implied Partnerships An implied partnership
exists when in fact there are two or more persons carrying on
a business as co-owners for profit. For example, Carlos decides
to paint houses during his summer break. He gathers some
materials and gets several jobs. He hires Wally as a helper. Wally
is very good, and pretty soon both of them are deciding what
                                    SMALL BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS | 571

jobs to do and how much to charge, and they are splitting the
profits. They have an implied partnership, without intending
to create a partnership at all.

   12.2.2.2 Tests of Partnership Existence But how do
we know whether an implied partnership has been created?
Obviously, we know if there is an express agreement. But
partnerships can come into existence quite informally, indeed,
without any formality--they can be created accidentally. In
contrast to the corporation, which is the creature of statute,
partnership is a catchall term for a large variety of working
relationships, and frequently, uncertainties arise about
whether or not a particular relationship is that of partnership.
The law can reduce the uncertainty in advance only at the price
of severely restricting the flexibility of people to associate.

   The crucial test for a partnership is: 1) the association of
persons, (2) as co-owners, (3) for profit. Under (1) "persons"
can include an individual, LLC, other partnership,
corporation, and so on. For (2), if what two or more people
own is clearly a business--including capital assets, contracts
with employees or agents, an income stream, and debts
incurred on behalf of the operation--a partnership exists. To
establish a partnership, the ownership must be of a business,
not merely of property. (So owning land with someone does
not necessarily mean there is a partnership.)

For (3), of the tests used by courts to determine co-ownership,
perhaps the most important is sharing of profits. Section
   572 | SMALL BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS

  202(c) of RUPA provides that "a person who receives a share
  of the profits of a business is presumed to be a partner in the
  business," but this presumption can be rebutted by showing
  that the share of the profits paid out was (1) to repay a debt; (2)
  wages or compensation to an independent contractor; (3) rent;
  (4) an annuity, retirement, or health benefit to a representative
  of a deceased or retired partner; (5) interest on a loan, or rights
  to income, proceeds, or increase in value from collateral; or (5)
  for the sale of the goodwill of a business or other property.

 12.2.3 Partnership Operation

  Most of the rules discussed in this section apply unless
  otherwise agreed, and they are really intended for the small
  firm."The basic mission of RUPA is to serve the small firm.
  Large partnerships can fend for themselves by drafting
  partnership agreements that suit their special needs."4

     12.2.3.1 Duties Partners Owe Each Other Among the
  duties partners owe each other, six may be called out here: (1)
  the duty to serve, (2) the duty of loyalty, (3) the duty of care,
  (4) the duty of obedience, (5) the duty to inform copartners,
  and (6) the duty to account to the partnership. These are all

4. Donald J. Weidner, "RUPA and Fiduciary Duty: The Texture of
  Relationship," Law and Contemporary Problems 58, no. 2 (1995):
  81, 83.
          SMALL BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS | 573

very similar to the duty owed by an agent to the principal, as

partnership law is based on agency concepts.

In general, this requires partners to put the firm's interests

ahead of their own. Partners are fiduciaries as to each other and
as to the partnership, and as such, they owe a fiduciary duty5

to each other and the partnership. Judge Benjamin Cardozo, in

an often-quoted phrase, called the fiduciary duty "something

stricter than the morals of the market place. Not honesty

alone, but the punctilio of an honor the most sensitive, is then
the standard of behavior."6 Breach of the fiduciary duty gives

rise to a claim for compensatory, consequential, and incidental

damages;  recoupment            of            compensation;

and--rarely--punitive damages.

The duty of loyalty means, again, that partners must put the

firm's interest above their own. Thus it is held that a partner:

 may not compete with the partnership,
 may not make a secret profit while doing partnership

   business, and
 must maintain the confidentiality of partnership

   information.

5. The highest duty of good faith and trust, imposed on partners as to
  each other and the firm.

6. Meinhard v. Salmon, 164 N.E. 545 (N.Y. 1928).
574 | SMALL BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS

This is certainly not a comprehensive list, and courts will
determine on a case-by-case basis whether the duty of loyalty
has been breached. Stemming from its roots in agency law,
partnership law also imposes a duty of care on partners.
Partners are to faithfully serve to the best of their ability.

12.2.3.2 Partnership Rights Profits and losses may be
shared according to any formula on which the partners agree.
For example, the partnership agreement may provide that two
senior partners are entitled to 35 percent each of the profit
from the year and the two junior partners are entitled to 15
percent each. The next year the percentages will be adjusted
based on such things as number of new clients garnered,
number of billable hours, or amount of income generated.
Eventually, the senior partners might retire and each be
entitled to 2 percent of the firm's income, and the previous
                                   SMALL BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS | 575

junior partners become senior, with new junior partners
admitted.

   If no provision is stated,
then under RUPA Section
401(b), "each partner is
entitled to an equal share of
the partnership profits and
is chargeable with a share of
the partnership losses in
proportion to the partner's
share of the profits." The
right to share in the profits is
the reason people want to
"make partner": a partner
will reap the benefits of other partners' successes (and pay for
their failures too). A person working for the firm who is not a
partner is an associate and usually only gets only a salary.

   All partners are entitled to share equally in the management
and conduct of the business, unless the partnership agreement
provides otherwise. The partnership agreement could be
structured to delegate more decision-making power to one
class of partners (senior partners) than to others (junior
partners), or it may give more voting weight to certain
individuals. For example, perhaps those with the most
experience will, for the first four years after a new partner is
admitted, have more voting weight than the new partner.

   A business partnership is often analogized to a marriage
   576 | SMALL BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS

  partnership. In both there is a relationship of trust and
  confidence between (or among) the parties; in both the poor
  judgment, negligence, or dishonesty of one can create liabilities
  on the other(s). In a good marriage or good partnership, the
  partners are friends, whatever else the legal relationship
  imposes. Thus no one is compelled to accept a partner against
  his or her will. Section 401(i) of RUPA provides, "A person
  may become a partner only with the consent of all of the
  partners." The freedom to select new partners, however, is not
  absolute. In 1984, the Supreme Court held that Title VII of
  the Civil Rights Act of 1964--which prohibits discrimination
  in employment based on race, religion, national origin, or
  sex--applies to partnerships.7

        Key Takeaway

        Partnership law defines a partnership as "an
        association of two or more persons to carry on as
        co-owners a business for profit." The Revised
        Uniform Partnership Act (RUPA) assumes a

7. Hishon v. King & Spalding, 467 U.S. 69 (1984).
                             SMALL BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS | 577

partnership is an entity, but it applies one crucial rule
characteristic of the aggregate theory: the partners
are ultimately liable for the partnership's obligations.
Thus a partnership may keep business records as if it
were a legal entity, may hold real estate in the
partnership name, and may sue and be sued in
federal court and in many state courts in the
partnership name.

Partnerships may be created informally. Among the
clues to the existence of a partnership are (1) co-
ownership of a business, (2) sharing of profits, (3)
right to participate in decision making, (4) duty to
share liabilities, and (5) manner in which the
business is operated. A partnership may also be
formed by implication.

No special rules govern the partnership agreement.
As a practical matter, it should sufficiently spell out
who the partners are, under what name they will
conduct their business, the nature and scope of the
business, capital contributions of each partner, how
profits are to be divided, and similar pertinent
provisions. An oral agreement to form a partnership
is valid unless the business cannot be performed
wholly within one year from the time that the
578 | SMALL BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS

     agreement is made. However, most partnerships
     have no fixed terms and hence are "at-will"
     partnerships not subject to the Statute of Frauds.
     Partners have important duties in a partnership,
     including (1) the duty to serve--that is, to devote
     herself to the work of the partnership; (2) the duty
     of loyalty, which is informed by the fiduciary
     standard: the obligation to act always in the best
     interest of the partnership and not in one's own best
     interest; (3) the duty of care--that is, to act as a
     reasonably prudent partner would; (4) the duty of
     obedience not to breach any aspect of the
     agreement or act without authority; (5) the duty to
     inform copartners; and (6) the duty to account to
     the partnership.

     After reading this section, you should be able to do
     the following:

           Understand the basics of limited partnerships.
           Understand the basics of limited liability

             partnerships.
           Explain how these differ from general

             partnerships.

This and the following section provide a bridge between the
partnership and the corporate form. It explores several types
of associations that are hybrid forms--that is, they share some
aspects of partnerships and some of corporations.
Corporations afford the inestimable benefit of limited liability,
partnerships the inestimable benefit of limited taxation.
Businesspeople always seek to limit their risk and their
taxation.

12.3.1 Limited Partnerships

The limited partnership is attractive because of its treatment
of taxation and its imposition of limited liability on its limited
partners.

   A limited partnership (LP) is defined as "a partnership
formed by two or more persons under the laws of a State and
   580 | SMALL BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS

  having one or more general partners and one or more limited
  partners."8 The form tends to be attractive in business
  situations that focus on a single or limited-term project, such
  as making a movie or developing real estate; it is also widely
  used by private equity firms.

     Unlike a general partnership, a limited partnership is created
  in accordance with the state statute authorizing it. There are
  two categories of partners: limited and general. The limited
  partners capitalize the business and the general partners run it.

     The act requires that the firm's promoters file a certificate
  of limited partnership9 with the secretary of state; if they do
  not, or if the certificate is substantially defective, a general
  partnership is created. The certificate must be signed by all
  general partners. It must include the name of the limited
  partnership (which must include the words limited
  partnership so the world knows there are owners of the firm
  who are not liable beyond their contribution) and the names
  and business addresses of the general partners. If there are any
  changes in the general partners, the certificate must be
  amended. The general partner may be, and often is, a
  corporation. Having a general partner be a corporation
  achieves the goal of limited liability for everyone, but it is

  approved, marks the legal existence of the limited partnership.
                                    SMALL BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS | 581

somewhat of a "clunky" arrangement. That problem is
obviated in the limited liability company, discussed below.

   Any natural person, partnership, limited partnership
(domestic or foreign), trust, estate, association, or corporation
may become a partner of a limited partnership.

   The control of the limited partnership is in the hands of the
general partners, which may--as noted--be partnerships or
corporations. A limited partner who exercises any significant
control can incur liability like a general partner as to third
parties who believed she was one (the "control rule").
However, among the things a limited partner could do that
would not risk the loss of insulation from personal liability
were these "safe harbors":

   Acting as an agent, employee, or contractor for the firm;
      or being an officer, director, or shareholder of a
      corporate general partner;

   Consulting with the general partner of the firm;
   Requesting or attending a meeting of partners;
   Being a surety for the firm; and
   Voting on amendments to the agreement, on dissolution

      or winding up the partnership, on loans to the
      partnership, on a change in its nature of business, on
      removing or admitting a general or limited partner.

General partners owe fiduciary duties to other general
582 | SMALL BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS

partners, the firm, and the limited partners; limited partners
who do not exercise control do not owe fiduciary duties.

The Limited Partnership

Unless the partnership agreement provides otherwise (it
usually does), the admission of additional limited partners
requires the written consent of all. A general partner may
withdraw at any time with written notice; if withdrawal is
a violation of the agreement, the limited partnership has a
right to claim of damages. A limited partner can withdraw any
time after six months' notice to each general partner, and the
withdrawing partner is entitled to any distribution as per the
agreement or, if none, to the fair value of the interest based on
the right to share in distributions.

   The general partners are liable as in a general partnership,
and they have the same fiduciary duty and duty of care as
partners in a general partnership. The limited partners are only
                                        SMALL BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS | 583

   liable up to the amount of their capital contribution, provided
   the surname of the limited partner does not appear in the
   partnership name (unless their name is coincidentally the same
   as that of one of the general partners whose name does appear)
   and provided the limited partner does not participate in
   control of the firm

  12.3.2 Limited Liability Partnerships

   A limited liability partnership (LLP) is a partnership in which
   some or all partners have limited liability, such as from the
   partnership obligations or the actions of the members of the
   partnership. In 1991, Texas enacted the first limited liability
   partnership (LLP) statute, largely in response to the liability
   that had been imposed on partners in partnerships sued by
   government agencies in relation to massive savings and loan
   failures in the 1980s.10 (Here we see an example of the
   legislature allowing business owners to externalize the risks of
   business operation.) More broadly, the success of the limited
   liability company discussed below attracted the attention of
   professionals like accountants, lawyers, and doctors who
   sought insulation from personal liability for the mistakes or

    Conflict-Of-Law Issues In Limited Liability Partnerships," Case
    Western Reserve Law Review 54, no. 2 (2003): 605.
     584 | SMALL BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS

   malpractice of their partners. Their wish was granted with the
   adoption in all states of statutes authorizing the creation of the
   limited liability partnership in the early 1990s.

      Members of a partnership (only a majority is required) who
   want to form an LLP must file with the secretary of state; the
   name of the firm must include "limited liability partnership"
   or "LLP" to notify the public that its members will not stand
   personally for the firm's liabilities. States may limit these to
   professionals such as lawyers, doctors, or accountants.

      As noted, the purpose of the LLP form of business is to
   afford insulation from liability for its members. A typical
   statute provides as follows: "Any obligation of a partnership
   incurred while the partnership is a limited liability partnership,
   whether arising in contract, tort or otherwise, is solely the
   obligation of the partnership. A partner is not personally
   liable, directly or indirectly, by way of indemnification,
   contribution, assessment or otherwise, for such an obligation
   solely by reason of being or so acting as a partner."11

      However, the statutes vary. The early ones only allowed
   limited liability for negligent acts and retained unlimited
   liability for other acts, such as malpractice, misconduct, or
   wrongful acts by partners, employees, or agents. The second
   wave eliminated all these as grounds for unlimited liability,
   leaving only breaches of ordinary contract obligation. These

                                   SMALL BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS | 585

two types of legislation are called partial shield statutes. The
third wave of LLP legislation offered full shield protection--
no unlimited liability at all. Needless to say, the full-shield
type has been most popular and most widely adopted. Still,
however, many statutes require specified amounts of
professional malpractice insurance, and partners remain
fully liable for their own negligence or for wrongful acts of
those in the LLP whom they supervise. In other respects, the
LLP is like a partnership.

     Key Takeaway

     A limited partnership is a creature of statute: it
     requires filing a certificate with the state because it
     confers on some of its members the marvel of
     limited liability. It is an investment device composed
     of one or more general partners and one or more
     limited partners; limited partners may leave with six
     months' notice and are entitled to an appropriate
     payout. The general partner is liable as a partner is a
     general partnership; the limited partners' liability is
     limited to the loss of their investment, unless they
     exercise so much control of the firm as to become
586 | SMALL BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS

     general partners. The general partner is paid, and
     the general and limited partners split profit as per
     the agreement or, if none, in the proportion as they
     made capital contributions. The firm is usually taxed
     like a general partnership: it is a conduit for the
     partners' income.
     A limited liability partnership limits personal liability
     for the actions of other partners or the partnership
     itself. In a limited liability partnership, the partner
     may retain liability for their own actions or those
     they supervise. For this reason, for example,
     attorneys or doctors in an LLP will still retain
     malpractice insurance.

12.4 LLCs and S-Corps

The limited liability company (LLC) gained sweeping
popularity in the late twentieth century because it combines
the best aspects of partnership and the best aspects of
corporations: it allows all its owners (members) insulation
from personal liability and pass-through (conduit) taxation.
The first efforts to form LLCs were thwarted by IRS rulings
that the business form was too much like a corporation to
escape corporate tax complications. Tinkering by promoters
                                   SMALL BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS | 587

of the LLC concept and flexibility by the IRS solved those
problems in interesting and creative ways.

   12.4.0.1 Creating an LLC An LLC is created according
to the statute of the state in which it is formed. It is required
that the LLC members file a "certificate of organization" with
the secretary of state, and the name must indicate that it is
a limited liability company. Partnerships and limited
partnerships may convert to LLCs; the partners' previous
liability under the other organizational forms is not affected,
but going forward, limited liability is provided. The members'
operating agreement spells out how the business will be run; it
is subordinate to state and federal law. Unless otherwise agreed,
the operating agreement can be amended only by unanimous
vote. The LLC is an entity. Foreign LLCs must register with
the secretary of state before doing business in a "foreign" state,
or they cannot sue in state courts.

   As compared with corporations, the LLC is not a good
form if the owners expect to have multiple investors or to
raise money from the public. The typical LLC has relatively
few members (six or seven at most), all of whom usually are
engaged in running the firm.

   Most early LLC statutes, at least, prohibited their use by
professionals. That is, practitioners who need professional
licenses, such as certified public accountants, lawyers, doctors,
architects, chiropractors, and the like, could not use this form
because of concern about what would happen to the standards
of practice if such people could avoid legitimate malpractice
588 | SMALL BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS

claims. For that reason, the limited liability partnership was

invented.

Capitalization is like a

partnership:         members

contribute capital to the

firm according to their

agreement. As in a

partnership, the LLC

property is not specific to any member, but each has a personal

property interest in general. Contributions may be in the form

of cash, property or services rendered, or a promise to render

them in the future.

12.4.0.2 Controlling an LLC The LLC operating

agreement may provide for either a member-managed LLC

or a manager-managed(centralized) LLC. If the former, all

members have actual and apparent authority to bind the LLC

to contracts on its behalf, as in a partnership, and all members'

votes have equal weight unless otherwise agreed. Member-

managers have duty of care and a fiduciary duty, though the

parameters of those duties vary from state to state. If the firm

is manager managed, only managers have authority to bind the

firm; the managers have the duty of care and fiduciary duty,

but the nonmanager members usually do not. Some states'

statutes provide that voting is based on the financial interests

of the members. Most statutes provide that any extraordinary

firm decisions be voted on by all members (e.g., amend the

agreement, admit new members, sell all the assets prior to
                                   SMALL BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS | 589

dissolution, merge with another entity). Members can make
their own rules without the structural requirements (e.g.,
voting rights, notice, quorum, approval of major decisions)
imposed under state corporate law.

   One of the real benefits of the LLC as compared with the
corporation is that no annual meetings are required, and no
minutes need to be kept. Often, owners of small corporations
ignore these formalities to their peril, but with the LLC there
are no worries about such record keeping.

   Distributions are allocated among members of an LLC
according to the operating agreement; managing partners may
be paid for their services. Absent an agreement, distributions
are allocated among members in proportion to the values of
contributions made by them or required to be made by them.
Upon a member's dissociation that does not cause dissolution,
a dissociating member has the right to distribution as provided
in the agreement, or--if no agreement--the right to receive
the fair value of the member's interest within a reasonable time
after dissociation. No distributions are allowed if making them
would cause the LLC to become insolvent.

   12.4.0.3 Liability The great accomplishment of the
LLC is, again, to achieve limited liability for all its members:
no general partner hangs out with liability exposure.

   Members are not liable to third parties for contracts made
by the firm or for torts committed in the scope of business (but
of course a person is always liable for her own torts), regardless
of the owner's level of participation--unlike a limited
     590 | SMALL BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS

   partnership, where the general partner is liable. Third parties'
   only recourse is as against the firm's property.

      Unless the operating agreement provides otherwise,
   members and managers of the LLC are generally not liable
   to the firm or its members except for acts or omissions
   constituting gross negligence, intentional misconduct, or
   knowing violations of the law. Members and managers,
   though, must account to the firm for any personal profit or
   benefit derived from activities not consented to by a majority
   of disinterested members or managers from the conduct of
   the firm's business or member's or managers use of firm
   property--which is the same as in partnership law.

      12.4.0.4 Taxation Assuming the LLC is properly
   formed so that it is not too much like a corporation, it
   will--upon its members' election--be treated like a
   partnership for tax purposes.

  12.4.1 S-Corporations

   The sub-S corporation or the S corporation12 gets its name
   from the IRS Code, Chapter 1, Subchapter S. It was
   authorized by Congress in 1958 to help small corporations and
   to stem the economic and cultural influence of the relatively

    for tax purposes.

few, but increasingly powerful, huge multinational
corporations.

   The S corporation is a regular corporation created upon
application to the appropriate secretary of state's office and
operated according to its bylaws and shareholders' agreements.
There are, however, some limits on how the business is set up,
among them the following:

   It must be incorporated in the United States.
   It cannot have more than one hundred shareholders (a

      married couple counts as one shareholder).
   The only shareholders are individuals, estates, certain

      exempt organizations, or certain trusts.
   Only US citizens and resident aliens may be

      shareholders.
   The corporation has only one class of stock.
   With some exceptions, it cannot be a bank, thrift

      institution, or insurance company.
   All shareholders must consent to the S corporation

      election.
   It is capitalized as is a regular corporation.

The owners of the S corporation have limited liability. For
taxation, the S corporation pays no corporate income tax
(unless it has a lot of passive income). The S corporation's
shareholders include on their personal income statements, and
pay tax on, their share of the corporation's separately stated
592 | SMALL BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS

items of income, deduction, and loss. That is, the S
corporation avoids the dreaded double taxation of corporate
income.

Employment law is made up of a broad body of law that
governs employment relationships between a business and its
employees. It consists of numerous federal and state statutes,
administrative regulations, and judicial decisions.
Additionally, employment law draws from other areas of law
such as contracting, agency, and torts. This chapter provides
an overview of some of the key concepts in this area of law.

13.1 Types of Employment
Relationships

Employment law governs the relationship between an
employer and its employee. There are three key types of
employment relationships covered in this chapter:
employment for a contracted period of time, employment at
will, and independent contractors. In the United States, the
majority of employment relationships are at will or through
independent contractors. As you will learn, the type of
                                     AGENCY AND EMPLOYMENT LAW | 595

employment relationship impacts the responsibilities and
liabilities of both the employer and employee.

13.1.1 Employment for a Contracted
Period of Time

Historically, employment by contract was the most common
form of employment relationship. Under this model,
employees entered into a contract to work for a company for a
fixed period of time. Employees could not be fired during that
time frame unless the company had a good reason for doing
so. For example, a Starbucks barista could sign a contract to
work for the company for a two year term. Starbucks would
then be obligated to employ that barista for the full two years
unless it had some "just cause" for firing him.

   One benefit of the employment by contract model is that
employees could not be fired without just cause. Although
there is no universal meaning of the term, it generally protects
individuals from being fired unless they engage in some
misconduct or negligent job performance. However,
individuals employed by contract cannot be fired for things
like a change in market conditions, employer profitability, or
reduced staffing needs. This provides more stability and
predictability to employees.

Carroll Daugherty, a well-known arbitrator, created the
596 | AGENCY AND EMPLOYMENT LAW

following seven-factor test for determining whether a firm had
just cause to fire an employee:

 1. Did the Company give to the employee forewarning or
      foreknowledge of the possible or probable disciplinary
      consequences of the employee's conduct?

 2. Was the company's rule or managerial order reasonably
      related to the orderly, efficient, and safe operation of the
      Company's business?

 3. Did the company, before administering discipline to an
      employee make an effort to discover whether the
      employee did in fact violate or disobey a rule or order of
      management?

 4. Was the Company's investigation conducted fairly and
      objectively?

 5. At the investigation did the "judge" obtain substantial
      evidence or proof that the employee was guilty as
      charged?

 6. Has the company applied its rules, orders, and penalties
      evenhandedly and without discrimination to all
      employees?

 7. Was the degree of discipline administered by the
      company in a particular case reasonably related to (a) the
      seriousness of the employee's proven offense and (b) the
      record of the employee in his service with the company?1
                                        AGENCY AND EMPLOYMENT LAW | 597

  While this test is less applicable in the modern era where
  contract employment relationships are rare, it sheds light on
  the underlying considerations and rights created by
  employment contracts.

     Contract-based employment has some benefits but it also
  has several major drawbacks. First, contracted employees may
  face more restrictions in changing their jobs. They often must
  provide some notice if they want to quit before their term
  ends and may face other penalties for doing so. Additionally,
  these contracts reduce the leverage employees have if they want
  to negotiate a higher salary or better benefits in the middle
  of their contract term. Finally, firms have significantly less
  flexibility to reduce their staffing levels based on their own
  needs and changes in the market.

     Although employment by contract is rare in the modern
  United States economy, it still exists in some industries.
  Tenured professors, for example, have strong protections
  against being fired without just cause. Unionized employees
  may also receive some just cause protections if they have
  negotiated for them in a contract. In a recent decision, the
  7th Circuit considered a situation where a union agreement
  provided its members with for cause protections, but the

1. In re Enterprise Wire Company and Enterprise Independent Union,
  Decision of Arbitrator, March 28, 1966.
   598 | AGENCY AND EMPLOYMENT LAW

  employer's handbook did not.2 Joshua Cheli was a computer
  systems administrative assistant at a local school district. He
  was also a member of a union that had an agreement with the
  district. The relevant language in the agreement read:

     "An employee may be disciplined, suspended, and/or
  discharged for reasonable cause. Grounds for discharge and/
  or suspension shall include, but not be limited to,
  drunkenness or drinking or carrying intoxicating beverages
  on the job, possession or use of any controlled and/
  or illegal drug, dishonesty, insubordination, incompetency, or
  negligence in the performance of duties."

     In addition to this agreement with the union, the district
  also had an employee handbook outlining its employment
  policies. The handbook stated: "Unless otherwise specifically
  provided, District employment is at-will, meaning that
  employment may be terminated by the District or
  employee at any time for any reason, other than a reason
  prohibited by law, or no reason at all."

     The court considered whether this language in the union
  agreement provided Cheli with for-cause protections, or
  whether the at-will language in the handbook instead applied.
  The district argued that the union agreement said an employee
  may be fired for reasonable cause but did not state that they

2. Cheli v. Taylorville Community School District, 7th Cir., No. 20-2033
  (Feb. 3, 2021).
                                     AGENCY AND EMPLOYMENT LAW | 599

could only be fired for cause. The court rejected this
interpretation based on the detailed language in the union
agreement explaining the protections afforded to its members.
Thus, Cheli was a contract-based employee and could only
be fired for reasonable cause, regardless of the language in the
handbook. Cases like this show the importance of carefully
considering the content of agreements with unions and
employees, and how these agreements may modify other
documents like an employment policy manual.

   In addition to these modern examples of contract-based
employment, benefits like severance packages and "golden
parachutes" provide some of the same benefits as contractual
employment relationships by discouraging firms from firing
employees and by protecting those employees if they are fired.
For example, as of March 2022, the CEO of Moderna stands
to receive a package worth $922.5 million if he loses his job
as a result of the company being sold. Benefits like this have a
similar effect to employment contracts because they strongly
discourage employers from discharging their employees.

13.1.2 Employment at Will

Employment at will is the most common form of employment
relationship in the United States. Unlike a contracted
employee, the two parties in an at-will relationship - the
employer and employee - owe no duty to one another to
continue the employment. A supervisor can fire an employee
600 | AGENCY AND EMPLOYMENT LAW

for nearly any reason, so long as it does not violate state or
federal law. Similarly, an employee can quit at any time and for
any reason.

   There is a presumption of at-will employment in most states
in the United States. For example, California Labor Code
Section 2922 reads: "An employment, having no specified
term, may be terminated at the will of either party on notice to
the other." Under this regime, the default state of employment
contracts is at-will. Employers and employees are free to
modify this presumption by including for-cause language in
an agreement. Absent this language, however, courts will
presume that an at-will relationship exists.

   Remember that both at-will and contract-based employees
generally work under the terms of an employment contract.
In other words, simply signing a contract with an employee
does not make someone a contract-based employee with for
cause protections. The presence of either a fixed length of
employment or for cause protections make someone into a
contract-based employee, not the mere existence of a contract.
Without this language, an employee - regardless of whether or
not they have a contract with their employer - is presumed to
be at-will.

   Even at-will employees receive some protections when they
are fired for wrongful or illegal reasons. These protections
include:

Discharging an Employee for Refusing to Violate a Law.
                                     AGENCY AND EMPLOYMENT LAW | 601

Most state courts recognize a public policy exception barring
firms from firing an employee for refusing to violate the law.
This exception most commonly applies to situations where a
company does not want an employee to testify truthfully at
trial. In one case, a nurse refused a doctor's order to administer
a certain anesthetic when she believed it was wrong for that
particular patient; the doctor, angry at the nurse for refusing
to obey him, then administered the anesthetic himself. The
patient soon stopped breathing. The doctor and others could
not resuscitate him soon enough, and he suffered permanent
brain damage. When the patient's family sued the hospital, the
hospital told the nurse she would be in trouble if she testified.
She did testify according to her oath in the court of law (i.e.,
truthfully), and after several months of harassment, was finally
fired on a pretext. The hospital was held liable for the tort of
wrongful discharge. As a general rule, you should not fire an
employee for refusing to break the law.

   Discharging an Employee for Exercising a Legal Right.
Most state courts recognize a second, similar public policy
exception preventing employers from firing an employee for
exercising some legal right. Courts most commonly apply this
exception to situations where an employee was fired for seeking
workers' compensation after being injured on the job. Suppose
Bob Berkowitz files a claim for workers' compensation for an
accident at Pacific Gas & Electric, where he works and where
the accident that injured him took place. He is fired for doing
so, because the employer does not want to have its workers'
602 | AGENCY AND EMPLOYMENT LAW

comp premiums increased. In this case, the right exercised by
Berkowitz is supported by public policy: he has a legal right
to file the claim, and if he can establish that their discharge
was caused by their filing the claim, he will prove the tort of
wrongful discharge.

   Discharging an Employee for Performing a Legal
Duty. Courts have long held that an employee may not be
fired for performing a legal duty like serving on a jury. This
is so even though courts do recognize that many employers
have difficulty replacing employees called for jury duty. Jury
duty is an important civic obligation, and employers are not
permitted to undermine it.

   Discharging an Employee in a Way That Violates
Public Policy. In addition to the specific public policy
protections listed here, some states recognize a broader
protection against being fired in a way that violates public
policy. This is the most controversial basis for a tort of
wrongful discharge. A state's public policy encapsulates the
"basic social rights, duties, or responsibilities" of its citizens.
However, there is an inherent vagueness to these terms that
make them difficult to apply in practice. Like in contract law,
courts most often look to statutes and case law for guidelines
on public policy.

   In Wagenseller v. Scottsdale Memorial Hospital, for
example, a nurse who refused to "play along" with her
                                        AGENCY AND EMPLOYMENT LAW | 603

  coworkers on a rafting trip was discharged.3 The group of
  coworkers had socialized at night and had been drinking
  alcohol. When the partying was near its peak, the plaintiff
  refused to be part of a group that performed nude actions to
  the tune of "Moon River" (a composition by Henry Mancini
  that was popular in the 1970s). The court, at great length,
  considered that "mooning" was a misdemeanor under Arizona
  law and that therefore her employer could not discharge her
  for refusing to violate a state law. Many courts that recognize
  the general public policy exception follow this practice of
  looking to state laws and regulations as a basis for finding a
  public policy.

  Good Faith and Fair Dealing Standard. A few states,
  among them Massachusetts and California, have modified the
  at-will doctrine in a far-reaching way by holding that every
  employer has entered into an implied covenant of good faith
  and fair dealing with its employees. That means, the courts in
  these states say, that it is "bad faith" and therefore unlawful to
  discharge employees to avoid paying commissions or pensions
  due them. Under this implied covenant of fair dealing, any
  discharge without good cause--such as incompetence,

3. Wagenseller v. Scottsdale Memorial Hospital, 147 Ariz. 370; 710 P.2d
  1025 (1085).
604 | AGENCY AND EMPLOYMENT LAW

corruption, or habitual tardiness--is actionable. This is not
the majority view.

13.1.3 Independent Contractors

In addition to hiring employees on an at-will and contract
basis, businesses frequently rely on the services of independent
contractors. According to the Restatement (Second) of
Agency, Section 2, "an independent contractor is a person who
contracts with another to do something for him but who is
not controlled by the other nor subject to the other's right
to control with respect to his physical conduct in the
performance of the undertaking."

   Individuals participating in the "gig economy" are a
commonly encountered example of independent contractors.
People driving cars for Uber and delivering food for Door
Dash retain high levels of independence and control. An Uber
driver can begin and end work when she wants, accept or reject
ride requests, and pick up customers in whatever area of the
city she would like. Although Uber provides the means for
a driver to connect with her customers, it leaves drivers with
substantial amounts of autonomy that an employee would not
have.

   This distinction between employee and independent
contractor has important legal consequences for taxation,
workers' compensation, and liability insurance. For example,
employers are required to withhold income taxes from their
                                        AGENCY AND EMPLOYMENT LAW | 605

  employees' paychecks. But payment to an independent
  contractor, such as a Grub Hub delivery driver, does not
  require such withholding.

     Deciding who is an independent contractor is not always
  easy; there is no single factor or mechanical answer. In
  Robinson v. New York Commodities Corporation, an injured
  salesman sought workers' compensation benefits, claiming to
  be an employee of the New York Commodities Corporation.4
  The state workmen's compensation board concluded that he
  was an independent contractor, not an employee, and so he
  did not qualify for workers' compensation. It took a holistic
  approach that can shed some light onto factors that distinguish
  an employee from an independent contractor. The claimant
  sold canned meats, making rounds in his car from his home.
  The company did not establish hours for him, did not control
  his movements in any way, and did not reimburse him for
  mileage or any other expenses or withhold taxes from its
  straight commission payments to him. He reported his taxes
  on a form for the self-employed and hired an accountant to
  prepare it for him. The court agreed with the compensation
  board that these facts established the salesman's status as an
  independent contractor.

     The facts specific to each case determines whether a worker

4. Robinson v. New York Commodities Corp., 396 N.Y.S.2d 725, App.
  Div. (1977).
   606 | AGENCY AND EMPLOYMENT LAW

  is an employee or an independent contractor. Neither the
  company nor the worker can establish the worker's status by
  agreement. As the North Dakota Workmen's Compensation
  Bureau explained in a bulletin to real estate brokers, "It has
  come to the Bureau's attention that many employers are
  requiring that those who work for them sign `independent
  contractor' forms so that the employer does not have to pay
  workmen's compensation premiums for his employees. Such
  forms are meaningless if the worker is in fact an employee."5

     Although distinguishing between an employee and
  independent contractor is often fact-specific, the right of
  control test is one helpful way to identify an independent
  contractor. Under this approach, a court will consider the
  extent of a business's behavioral and financial control over
  an individual.

13.2 Agency Relationships and
Employment

An agent is a person who acts in the name of and on behalf
of another, having been given and assumed some degree of
authority to do so. The person or corporation the agent acts
on behalf of is called the "principal." Most organized human
activity--and virtually all commercial activity--is carried on
through agency. An agency relationship can be created by
608 | AGENCY AND EMPLOYMENT LAW

something as simple as a father giving his child money to go
buy some milk from the store. In this scenario, the father is
the principal and the child is ahis gent for the purposes of that
trip. Another common example of agency is in professional
sports. In this relationship, the athlete is the principal and
her agent is responsible for helping her choose a team and
negotiate favorable contracts with that team. Agents have a
duty to work in the athlete's best interest when performing
this job.

   No corporation would be possible, even in theory, without
the concept of agency. We might say "General Motors is
building cars in China," for example, but General Motors itself
cannot build cars or do business. "The General," as people
say, exists and works through agents. Likewise, partnerships
and other business organizations rely extensively on agents to
conduct their business. Indeed, it is not an exaggeration to
say that agency is the cornerstone of enterprise organization.
In a partnership each partner is a general agent, while under
corporation law the officers and all employees are agents of the
corporation.

   The existence of agents does not, however, require a whole
new law of torts or contracts. A tort is no less harmful when
committed by an agent; a contract is no less binding when
negotiated by an agent. What does need to be taken into
account, though, is the manner in which an agent acts on
behalf of his principal and toward a third party.
                                     AGENCY AND EMPLOYMENT LAW | 609

       Employees are usually agents of their employers.
       In contrast, determining whether an
       independent contractor is an agent of a firm
       depends on the specific facts, situation, and
       actions being performed. As you read about the
       responsibilities associated with agency
       relationships, consider how these responsibilities
       would differ for an employee and an
       independent contractor.

13.2.1 Creating Agency Relationships

There are three basic ways in which agency power is granted:
express authorization, implied authorization, and apparent
authorization. Because employees and managers of a
corporation serve as its agents, they act with one or more of
these three types of authority on behalf of the business.

   Express Authority (Agency Created by Agreement)
The strongest form of authority is that which is expressly
granted, often in written form. The principal consents to the
agent's actions, and the third party may then rely on the
document attesting to the agent's authority to deal on behalf
of the principal. One common form of express authority340
610 | AGENCY AND EMPLOYMENT LAW

is the standard signature card on file with banks allowing
corporate agents to write checks on the company's credit.

   This express grant of authority is often part of a contract. In
those cases the general rules of contract law covered in Chapter
8 apply. But agencies can also be created without contract,
by agreement (for instance, without consideration, which not
make the relationship contractual).

   Implied Authority Implied authority exists to reasonably
carry out the express authority granted to the agent. Not every
detail of an agent's work can be spelled out. It is impossible
to delineate step-by-step the duties of a general agent; at best,
a principal can set forth only the general nature of the duties
that the agent is to perform. Even a special agent's duties are
difficult to describe in such detail as to leave him without
discretion. If express authority were the only valid kind, there
would be no efficient way to use an agent, both because the
effort to describe the duties would be too great and because the
third party would be reluctant to deal with him.

   But the law permits authority to be "implied" by the
relationship of the parties, the nature and customs of the
business, the circumstances surrounding the act in question,
the wording of the agency contract, and the knowledge that
the agent has of facts relevant to the assignment. The general
rule is that the agent has implied or "incidental" authority to
perform acts incidental to or reasonably necessary to carrying
out the transaction. Thus if a principal instructs her agent to
"deposit a check in the bank today," the agent has authority to
                                      AGENCY AND EMPLOYMENT LAW | 611

drive to the bank unless the principal specifically prohibits the
agent from doing so.

   Apparent Authority In the agency relationship, the
agent's actions in dealing with third parties will affect the legal
rights of the principal. What the third party knows about the
agency agreement is irrelevant to the agent's legal authority to
act. That authority runs from principal to agent. As long as
an agent has authorization, either express or implied, she may
bind the principal legally. Thus the seller of a house may be
ignorant of the buyer's true identity; the person they suppose
to be the prospective purchaser might be the agent of an
undisclosed principal. Nevertheless, if the agent is authorized
to make the purchase, the seller's ignorance is not a ground for
either seller or principal to void the deal.

   But if a person has no authority to act as an agent, or an
agent has no authority to act in a particular way, is the
principal free from all consequences? The answer depends on
whether or not the agent has apparent authority--that is, on
whether or not the third person reasonably believes from the
principal's words, written or spoken, or from their conduct
that they have in fact consented to the agent's actions.
Apparent authority is a manifestation of authority
communicated to the third person; it runs from principal to
third party, not to the agent.

   Suppose Arthur is Paul's agent, employed through October
31. On November 1, Arthur buys materials at Lumber
Yard--as he has been doing since early spring--and charges
612 | AGENCY AND EMPLOYMENT LAW

them to Paul's account. Lumber Yard, not knowing that
Arthur's employment terminated the day before, bills Paul.
Will Paul have to pay? Yes, because the termination of the
agency was not communicated to Lumber Yard. It appeared
that Arthur was an authorized agent.

13.2.2 Fiduciary Duties in an Agency
Relationship

In a nonagency contractual situation, the parties'
responsibilities terminate at the border of the contract. There
is no relationship beyond the agreement. This literalist
approach is justified by the more general principle that we each
should be free to act unless we commit ourselves to a particular
course.

   But the agency relationship is more than a contractual one,
and the agent's responsibilities go beyond the border of the
                                     AGENCY AND EMPLOYMENT LAW | 613

contract. Agency imposes a higher duty than simply to abide
by the contract terms. It imposes a fiduciary duty. The law
infiltrates the contract creating the agency relationship and
reverses the general principle that the parties are free to act in
the absence of agreement. As a fiduciary of the principal, the
agent stands in a position of special trust. Their responsibility
is to subordinate their self-interest to that of their principal.
The fiduciary responsibility is imposed by law. The absence of
any clause in the contract detailing the agent's fiduciary duty
does not relieve him of it. The duty contains several aspects:
the agent or employee must avoid self-dealing, be loyal, be
lawfully obedient, perform their tasks with reasonable skill and
care, preserve confidential information, and so on.

   The fiduciary duty does not run in reverse: the principal
owes the agent general contractual duties but not fiduciary
duties. Thus, the principal should, e.g., reimburse the agent
for expenses but does not owe them a duty of loyalty. One
particular duty of the employer is to provide workers'
compensation.

13.2.2.1 Worker's Compensation. Alan, who works in a
dynamite factory, negligently stores dynamite in the wrong
shed. Alan warns his fellow employee Bill that he has done so.
Bill lights up a cigarette near the shed anyway, a spark lands
on the ground, the dynamite explodes, and Bill is injured. May
Bill sue his employer to recover damages? At common law,
the answer would be no--three times no. First, the "fellow-
614 | AGENCY AND EMPLOYMENT LAW

servant" rule would bar recovery because the employer was
held not to be responsible for torts committed by one
employee against another. Second, Bill's failure to heed Alan's
warning and his decision to smoke near the dynamite
amounted to contributory negligence. Hence even if the
dynamite had been negligently stored by the employer rather
than by a fellow employee, the claim would have been
dismissed. Third, the courts might have held that Bill had
"assumed the risk": since he was aware of the dangers, it would
not be fair to saddle the employer with the burden of Bill's
actions.

   The three common-law rules just mentioned ignited intense
public fury by the turn of the twentieth century. In large
numbers of cases, workers who were mutilated or killed on the
job found themselves and their families without recompense.
Union pressure and grass roots lobbying led to workers'
compensation acts-- statutory enactments that dramatically
overhauled the law of torts as it affected employees.

   Workers' compensation is a no-fault system. The employee
gives up the right to sue the employer (and, in some states,
other employees) and receives in exchange predetermined
compensation for a job-related injury, regardless of who caused
it. This trade-off was felt to be equitable to employer and
employee: the employee loses the right to seek damages for
pain and suffering--which can be a sizable portion of any jury
award--but in return they can avoid the time-consuming and
uncertain judicial process and assure himself that their medical
                                     AGENCY AND EMPLOYMENT LAW | 615

costs and a portion of their salary will be paid--and paid
promptly. The employer must pay for all injuries, even those
for which they are blameless, but in return they avoid the risk
of losing a big lawsuit, can calculate their costs actuarially, and
can spread the risks through insurance.

   Most workers' compensation acts provide 100 percent of
the cost of a worker's hospitalization and medical care
necessary to cure the injury and relieve him from its effects.
They also provide for payment of lost wages and death
benefits. Even an employee who is able to work may be eligible
to receive compensation for specific injuries.

   Although workers' compensation laws are on the books of
every state, in two states--New Jersey and Texas--they are
not compulsory. In those states the employer may decline to
participate, in which event the employee must seek redress in
court. But in those states permitting an employer election, the
old common-law defenses (fellow-servant rule, contributory
negligence, and assumption of risk) have been statutorily
eliminated, greatly enhancing an employee's chances of
winning a suit. The incentive is therefore strong for employers
to elect workers' compensation coverage.

Those frequently excluded are farm and domestic laborers and
public employees; public employees, federal workers, and
railroad and shipboard workers are covered under different but
similar laws. The trend has been to include more and more
classes of workers. Approximately half the states now provide
616 | AGENCY AND EMPLOYMENT LAW

coverage for household workers, although the threshold of
coverage varies widely from state to state. Some use an earnings
test; other states impose an hours threshold. People who fall
within the domestic category include maids, baby-sitters,
gardeners, and handymen but generally not plumbers,
electricians, and other independent contractors. In addition,
independent contractors are not eligible for workers'
compensation because they are not employees of the firm.

   Recurring legal issues in workers' compensation include
whether the injury was work related, whether the injured
person was actually an employee, and whether psychological
injury counts.

13.2.3 Agent and Principal Liability in
Tort

Direct Liability. There is a distinction between torts
prompted by the principal himself and torts of which the
principal was innocent. If the principal directed the agent to
commit a tort or knew that the consequences of the agent's
carrying out their instructions would bring harm to someone,
the principal is liable. This is an application of the general
common-law principle that one cannot escape liability by
delegating an unlawful act to another. The syndicate that hires
a hitman is as culpable of murder as the man who pulls the
trigger. Similarly, a principal who is negligent in their use of
agents will be held liable for their negligence. This rule comes
                                     AGENCY AND EMPLOYMENT LAW | 617

into play when the principal fails to supervise employees
adequately, gives faulty directions, or hires incompetent or
unsuitable people for a particular job. Imposing liability on
the principal in these cases is readily justifiable since it is the
principal's own conduct that is the underlying fault; the
principal here is directly liable.

   Vicarious Liability. But the principle of liability for one's
agent is much broader, extending to acts of which the principal
had no knowledge, that they had no intention to commit nor
involvement in, and that they may in fact have expressly
prohibited the agent from engaging in. This is the principle
of respondeat superior or the master-servant doctrine, which
imposes on the principal vicarious liability347 (vicarious
means "indirectly, as, by, or through a substitute") under
which the principal is responsible for acts committed by the
agent within the scope of the employment.

   The modern basis for vicarious liability is sometimes termed
the "deep pocket" theory: the principal (usually a corporation)
has deeper pockets than the agent, meaning that it has the
wherewithal to pay for the injuries traceable one way or
another to events it set in motion. A million-dollar industrial
accident is within the means of a company or its insurer; it is
usually not within the means of the agent--employee--who
caused it.

   In general, the broadest liability is imposed on the master in
the case of tortious physical conduct by a servant or employee.
If the servant or employee acted within the scope of their
618 | AGENCY AND EMPLOYMENT LAW

employment--that is, if the servant's wrongful conduct
occurred while performing their job--the master will be liable
to the victim for damages unless, as we have seen, the victim
was another employee, in which event the workers'
compensation system will be invoked. Vicarious tort liability is
primarily a function of the employment relationship and not
agency status.

   Ordinarily, an individual or a company is not vicariously
liable for the tortious acts of inde- pendent contractors. The
plumber who rushes to a client's house to repair a leak and
causes a traffic accident does not subject the home- owner to
liability. But there are exceptions to the rule. Generally, these
exceptions fall into a category of duties that the law deems
nondelegable. In some situations, one person is obligated to
provide protection to or care for another. The failure to do
so results in liability whether or not the harm befell the other
because of an independent contractor's wrongdoing. Thus a
homeowner has a duty to ensure that physical conditions in
and around the home are not unreasonably dangerous. If the
owner hires an independent contracting firm to dig a sewer
line and the contractor negligently fails to guard passersby
against the danger of falling into an open trench, the
homeowner is liable because the duty of care in this instance
cannot be delegated. (The contractor is, of course, liable to the
homeowner for any damages paid to an injured passerby.)

   Liability for Agent's Intentional Torts. In the
nineteenth century, a principal was rarely held liable for
                                         AGENCY AND EMPLOYMENT LAW | 619

  intentional wrongdoing by the agent if the principal did not
  command the act complained of. The thought was that one
  could never infer authority to commit a willfully wrongful act.
  Today, liability for intentional torts is imputed to the principal
  if the agent is acting to further the principal's business.

     The general rule is that a principal is liable for torts only if
  the servant committed them "in the scope of employment."
  But determining what this means is not easy.

     It may be clear that the person causing an injury is the agent
  of another. But a principal cannot be responsible for every
  act of an agent. If an employee is following the letter of their
  instructions, it will be easy to determine liability. But suppose
  an agent deviates in some way from their job. The classic test of
  liability was set forth in an 1833 English case, Joel v. Morrison.6
  The plaintiff was run over on a highway by a speeding cart and
  horse. The driver was the employee of another, and inside was
  a fellow employee. There was no question that the driver had
  acted carelessly, but what they and their fellow employee were
  doing on the road where the plaintiff was injured was disputed.
  For weeks before and after the accident, the cart had never
  been driven in the vicinity in which the plaintiff was walking,
  nor did it have any business there. The suggestion was that
  the employees might have gone out of their way for their own
  purposes. As the great English jurist Baron Parke put it, "If

6. Joel v. Morrison, 6 Carrington & Payne 501.
620 | AGENCY AND EMPLOYMENT LAW

the servants, being on their master's business, took a detour
to call upon a friend, the master will be responsible. But if he
was going on a frolic of his own, without being at all on his
master's business, the master will not be liable." In applying
this test, the court held the employer liable.

   The test is thus one of degree, and it is not always easy to
decide when a detour has become so great as to be transformed
into a frolic. For a time, a rather mechanical rule was invoked
to aid in making the decision. The courts looked to the
servant's purposes in "detouring." If the servant's mind was
fixed on accomplishing their own purposes, then the detour
was held to be outside the scope of employment; hence the tort
was not imputed to the master. But if the servant also intended
to accomplish their master's purposes during their departure
from the letter of their assignment, or if they committed the
wrong while returning to their master's task after the
completion of their frolic, then the tort was held to be within
the scope of employment.

   This test is not always easy to apply. If a hungry delivery
driver stops at a restaurant outside the normal lunch hour,
intending to continue to their next delivery after eating, they
are within the scope of employment. But suppose they decide
to take the truck home that evening, in violation of rules, in
order to get an early start the next morning. Suppose they
decide to stop by the beach, which is far away from the route.
Does it make a difference if the employer knows that the driver
do this?
                                     AGENCY AND EMPLOYMENT LAW | 621

   Court decisions in the last forty years have moved toward a
different standard, one that looks to the foreseeability of the
agent's conduct. By this standard, an employer may be held
liable for their employee's conduct even when devoted entirely
to the employee's own purposes, as long as it was foreseeable
that the agent might act as he did. This is the "zone of risk"
test. The employer will be within the zone of risk for vicarious
liability if the employee is where she is supposed to be,
doing--more or less--what she is supposed to be doing, and
the incident arose from the employee's pursuit of the
employer's interest (again, more or less). That is, the employer
is within the zone of risk if the servant is in the place within
which, if the master were to send out a search party to find a
missing employee, it would be reasonable to look.

13.2.4 Agent and Principal Liability in
Contract

The key to determining whether a principal is liable for
contracts made by their agent is authority: was the agent
authorized to negotiate the agreement and close the deal?
Obviously, it would not be sensible to hold a contractor liable
to pay for a whole load of lumber merely because a stranger
wandered into the lumberyard saying, "I'm an agent for ABC
Contractors; charge this to their account." To be liable, the
principal must have authorized the agent in some manner to
622 | AGENCY AND EMPLOYMENT LAW

act in their behalf, and that authorization must be
communicated to the third party by the principal.

   The agent will be liable in some cases as well. If the agent
acted without authority, then they weren't really acting as an
agent and so will be personally liable for their contractual
actions. If the third-party does not know the agent is acting for
a principal (that is, if the principal is undisclosed), the third
party will naturally sue the agent.349 For these reasons, agents
who wish to avoid liability should always make it clear they
are acting as agent for someone else. For example, an agent
acting for a corporation in signing documents might wish their
signature block to read "Jane Doe, Agent for BigCorp" or
something similar. Finally, an agent acting in their personal
capacity remains liable for their personal contracts.

Even if the agent possessed no actual authority and there was
no apparent authority on which the third person could rely,
the principal may still be liable if they ratify or adopt the
agent's acts before the third person withdraws from the
contract. Ratification usually relates back to the time of the
undertaking, creating authority after the fact as though it had
been established initially. Ratification is a voluntary act by the
principal. Faced with the results of action purportedly done on
their behalf but without authorization and through no fault of
their own, they may affirm or disavow them as they choose. To
ratify, the principal may tell the parties concerned or by their
conduct manifest that they are willing to accept the results as
                                     AGENCY AND EMPLOYMENT LAW | 623

though the act were authorized. Or by their silence they may
find under certain circumstances that they have ratified. Note
that ratification does not require the usual consideration of
contract law. The principal need be promised nothing extra for
their decision to affirm to be binding. Nor does ratification
depend on the position of the third party; for example, a loss
stemming from their reliance on the agent's representations is
not required. In most situations, ratification leaves the parties
where they expected to be, correcting the agent's errors
harmlessly and giving each party what was expected

EMPLOYMENT
DISCRIMINATION LAW

This chapter summarizes various federal anti-discrimination
laws that relate to employment. Perhaps the most well-known
modification of the common law of employment in the
United States are federal anti-discrimination laws such as Title
VII. As we look at federal employment discrimination laws,
bear in mind that most states also have laws that prohibit
various kinds of discriminatory practices in employment.
Until the 1960s, Congress had intruded but little in the affairs
of employers except in union relationships. A company could
refuse to hire members of racial minorities, exclude women
from promotions, or pay men more than women for the same
work. But with the rise of the civil rights movement in the
early 1960s, Congress (and many states) began to legislate away
the employer's frequently exercised power to discriminate. The
most important statutes are Title VII of the Civil Rights Act
of 1964, the Equal Pay Act of 1963, the Age Discrimination in
Employment Act of 1967, and the Americans with Disabilities
Act of 1990.
14.1                  EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION LAW | 625

      Equal Pay Act

The Equal Pay Act of 1963 protects both men and women
from pay discrimination based on sex. The act covers all levels
of private sector employees and state and local government
employees but not federal workers. The act prohibits disparity
in pay for jobs that require equal skill and equal effort. Equal
skill means equal experience, and equal effort means
comparable mental and/or physical exertion. The act prohibits
disparity in pay for jobs that require equal responsibility, such
as equal supervision and accountability, or similar working
conditions.

   In making their determinations, courts will look at the
stated requirements of a job as well as the actual requirements
of the job. If two jobs are judged to be equal and similar, the
employer cannot pay disparate wages to members of different
sexes. Along with the EEOC enforcement, employees can also
bring private causes of action against an employer for violating
this act. There are four criteria that can be used as defenses
in justifying differentials in wages: seniority, merit, quantity
or quality of product, and any factor other than sex. The
employer will bear the burden of proving any of these defenses.
   626 | EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION LAW

 14.2 Title VII of the Civil Rights
 Act of 1964

  The most basic anti-discrimination law in employment is in
  Title VII of the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964. In Title
  VII, Congress for the first time outlawed discrimination in
  employment based on race, religion, sex, or national origin.
  Title VII declares: "It shall be an unlawful employment
  practice for an employer to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge
  any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any
  individual with respect to his compensation, terms,
  conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such
  individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin." Title
  VII applies to (1) employers with fifteen or more employees
  whose business affects interstate commerce, (2) all
  employment agencies, (3) labor unions with fifteen or more
  members, (4) state and local governments and their agencies,
  and (5) most federal government employment.1

  Title VII established the Equal Employment Opportunity

1. In 1984, the Supreme Court said that Title VII applies to
  partnerships as well as corporations when ruling that it is illegal to
  discriminatorily refuse to promote a female lawyer to partnership
  status in a law firm. This applies, by implication, to other fields, such
  as accounting.
                                    EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION LAW | 627

  Commission (EEOC) to investigate violations of the act. A
  victim of discrimination who wishes to file suit must first file
  a complaint with the EEOC to permit that agency to attempt
  conciliation of the dispute. The EEOC has filed a number of
  lawsuits to prove statistically that a company has systematically
  discriminated on one of the forbidden bases. The EEOC has
  received perennial criticism for its extreme slowness in filing
  suits and for failure to handle the huge backlog of complaints
  with which it has had to wrestle.

     The courts have come to recognize two major types of Title
  VII cases:

 14.2.1 Disparate Treatment

  In this type of lawsuit, the plaintiff asserts that because of
  race, sex, religion, or national origin, they have been treated
  less favorably than others within the organization. To prevail
  in a disparate treatment suit, the plaintiff must show that the
  company intended to discriminate because of one of the
  factors the law forbids to be considered. Thus in McDonnell
  Douglas Corp. v. Green, the Supreme Court held that the
  plaintiff had shown that the company intended to discriminate
  by refusing to rehire him because of his race.2 Based on that

2. McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973).
628 | EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION LAW

case, courts use a burden-shifting framework to evaluate Title
VII cases.

   First, the plaintiff needs to allege membership in a
      protected class and that they suffered an adverse action.
      An adverse action could include not being hired, being
      fired, being passed over for a promotion or a raise, or so
      on.

   If the plaintiff can make this showing, the burden shifts
      to the defendant to show a legitimate, non-
      discriminatory reason for the action. These will be
      discussed later under "Defenses to Employment
      Discrimination".

   Finally, if the defendant can show a legitimate reason for
      the action, the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to
      show "pretext", that is, to show that the real reason for
      the action was discriminatory.

14.2.2 Disparate Impact

In this second type of Title VII case, the employee need not
show that the employer intended to discriminate but only that
the effect, or impact, of the employer's action was
discriminatory. Usually, this impact will be upon an entire
class of employees. The plaintiff must demonstrate that the
reason for the employer's conduct (such as refusal to promote)
was not job related. Disparate impact cases often arise out
                                    EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION LAW | 629

  of practices that appear to be neutral or nondiscriminatory
  on the surface, such as educational requirements and tests
  administered to help the employer choose the most qualified
  candidate. In the seminal case of Griggs v. Duke Power Co.,
  the Supreme Court held that under Title VII, an employer is
  not free to use any test it pleases; the test must bear a genuine
  relationship to job performance.3 Griggs stands for the
  proposition that Title VII "prohibits employment practices
  that have discriminatory effects as well as those that are
  intended to discriminate."

  The same burden shifting framework applies, with some
  difference. For example, if an employer is using a neutral test
  to screen applicants, the plaintiff's prima facie case can be built
  on statistical evidence showing that, e.g., all women passed
  the test but half of men did not, or vice versa. The employer
  would then show a legitimate business reason for the test, after
  which the burden would shift to the plaintiff to show that a
  less discriminatory test that accomplished that interest exists.

     We now cover several specific areas of discrimination.

630 | EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION LAW

14.2.3 Discrimination Based on
Religion

An employer who systematically refuses to hire Catholics,
Jews, Buddhists, or members of any other religious group
engages in unlawful disparate treatment under Title VII. But
refusal to deal with someone because of their religion is not the
only type of violation under the law. Title VII defines religion
as including religious observances and practices as well as belief
and requires the employer to "reasonably accommodate to an
employee's or prospective employee's religious observance or
practice" unless the employer can demonstrate that a
reasonable accommodation would work an "undue hardship
on the conduct of the employer's business." Thus a company
that refused even to consider permitting a devout Sikh to wear
his religiously prescribed turban on the job would violate Title
VII.

But the company need not make an accommodation that
would impose more than a minimal cost. For example, an
employee in an airline maintenance department, open twenty
four hours a day, wished to avoid working on his Sabbath.
The employee belonged to a union, and under the collective
bargaining agreement, a rotation system determined by
seniority would have put the worker into a work shift that fell
on his Sabbath. The Supreme Court held that the employer
was not required to pay premium wages to someone whom the
                                 EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION LAW | 631

seniority system would not require to work on that day and
could discharge the employee if they refused the assignment.

14.2.4 Sex Discrimination

A refusal to hire or promote a woman simply because she is
female is a clear violation of Title VII. Under the Pregnancy
Act of 1978, Congress declared that discrimination because of
pregnancy is a form of sex discrimination. Equal pay for equal
or comparable work has also been an issue in sex (or gender)
discrimination.

   The late 1970s brought another problem of sex
discrimination to the fore: sexual harassment. There is much
fear and ignorance about sexual harassment among both
employers and employees. Many men think they cannot
compliment a woman on her appearance without risking at
least a warning by the human resources department. Many
employers have spent significant time and money trying to
train employees about sexual harassment, so as to avoid
lawsuits. Put simply, sexual harassment involves unwelcome
sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or
physical conduct of a sexual nature.

   There are two major categories of sexual harassment: (1)
quid pro quo and (2) hostile work environment.

14.2.4.1 Quid pro quo harassment Quid pro quo comes
from the Latin phrase "one thing in return for another." If
632 | EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION LAW

any part of a job is made conditional on sexual activity, there
is quid pro quo sexual harassment. Here, one person's power
over another is essential; a coworker, for example, is not usually
in a position to make sexual demands on someone at their
same level, unless they have special influence with a supervisor
who has power to hire, fire, promote, or change work
assignments. A supervisor, on the other hand, typically has
those powers or the power to influence those kinds of changes.
For example, when the male foreman says to the female line
worker, "I can get you off of the night shift if you'll sleep with
me," there is quid pro quo sexual harassment

   14.2.4.2 Hostile work environment Hostile work
environment claims are more frequent than quid pro quo
claims and so are more worrisome to management. An
employee has a valid claim of sexual harassment if sexual talk,
imagery, or behavior becomes so pervasive that it interferes
with the employee's ability to work to her best capacity. On
occasion, courts have found that offensive jokes, if sufficiently
frequent and pervasive in the workplace, can create a hostile
work environment. Likewise, comments about body parts or
public displays of pornographic pictures can also create a
hostile work environment. In short, the plaintiff can be
detrimentally offended and hindered in the workplace even if
there are no measurable psychological injuries.

14.2.5 Discrimination Based on Race,
Color, and National Origin

Title VII was primarily enacted to prohibit employment
discrimination based on race, color, and national origin. Race
refers to broad categories such as Black, Caucasian, Asian, and
Native American. Color simply refers to the color of a person's
skin, and national origin refers to the country of the person's
ancestry.

14.2.6 Discrimination based on sexual
orientation

In 2020, the Supreme Court decided Bostock v. Clayton
County. In that case, the Court found that discrimination
based on sexual orientation was discrimination based on sex,
and thus actionable under Title VII. The Court's reasoning
is worth noting, as it focuses on the text of the law over the
"anticipation" of the drafters:

       Sometimes small gestures can have unexpected
       consequences. Major initiatives practically
       guarantee them. In our time, few pieces of
       federal legislation rank in significance with the
634 | EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION LAW

       Civil Rights Act of 1964. There, in Title VII,
       Congress outlawed discrimination in the
       workplace on the basis of race, color, religion,
       sex, or national origin. Today, we must decide
       whether an employer can fire someone simply
       for being homosexual or transgender. The
       answer is clear. An employer who fires an
       individual for being homosexual or transgender
       fires that person for traits or actions it would not
       have questioned in members of a different sex.
       Sex plays a necessary and undisguisable role in
       the decision, exactly what Title VII forbids.

       Those who adopted the Civil Rights Act might
       not have anticipated their work would lead to
       this particular result. Likely, they weren't
       thinking about many of the Act's consequences
       that have become apparent over the years,
       including its prohibition against discrimination on
       the basis of motherhood or its ban on the sexual
       harassment of male employees. But the limits of
       the drafters' imagination supply no reason to
       ignore the law's demands. When the express
       terms of a statute give us one answer and
       extratextual considerations suggest another, it's
                                EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION LAW | 635

       no contest. Only the written word is the law, and
       all persons are entitled to its benefit.

14.3 Defenses to Employment
Discrimination

14.3.1 Merit

Employers are allowed to select on merit and promote on merit
without offending title VII's requirements. Merit decisions are
usually based on work, educational experience, and ability
tests. All requirements, however, must be job related. For
example, the ability to lift heavy cartons of sixty pounds or
more is appropriate for certain warehouse jobs but is not
appropriate for all office workers. The ability to do routine
maintenance (electrical, plumbing, construction) is an
appropriate requirement for maintenance work but not for a
teaching position.

14.3.2 Seniority

Employers may also maintain seniority systems that reward
workers who have been with the company for a long time.
636 | EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION LAW

Higher wages, benefits, and choice of working hours or
vacation schedules are examples of rewards that provide
employees with an incentive to stay with the company. If they
are not the result of intentional discrimination, they are
lawful. Where an employer is dealing with a union, it is typical
to see seniority systems in place.

14.3.3 Bona Fide Occupational
Qualification (BFOQ)

For certain kinds of jobs, employers may impose bona fide
occupational qualifications (BFOQs). Under the express terms
of Title VII, however, a bona fide (good faith) occupational
qualification of race or color is never allowed. In the area of
religion, as noted earlier, a group of a certain religious faith
that is searching for a new spiritual leader can certainly limit
its search to those of the same religion. With regard to sex
(gender), allowing women to be locker-room attendants only
in a women's gym is a valid BFOQ. One important test that
the courts employ in evaluating an employer's BFOQ claims is
the "essence of the business" test.

14.3.4 Defenses in Sexual
Harassment Cases

The Supreme Court has rejected the notion of strict or
automatic liability for employers when agents (employees)
                                EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION LAW | 637

engage in sexual harassment. But the employer can have a valid
defense to liability if it can prove (1) that it exercised reasonable
care to prevent and correct any sexual harassment behaviors
and (2) that the plaintiff employee unreasonably failed to take
advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities
provided by the employer or to otherwise avoid harm. As with
all affirmative defenses, the employer has the burden of
proving this defense.

14.4 The Age Discrimination in
Employment Act

The Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) of 1967
(amended in 1978 and again in 1986) prohibits discrimination
based on age, and recourse to this law has been growing at a
faster rate than any other federal antibias employment law. In
particular, the act protects workers over forty years of age and
prohibits forced retirement in most jobs because of age. Until
1987, federal law had permitted mandatory retirement at age
seventy, but the 1986 amendments that took effect January 1,
1987, abolished the age ceiling except for a few jobs, such as
firefighters, police officers, tenured university professors, and
executives with annual pensions exceeding $44,000. Like Title
VII, the law has a BFOQ exception--for example, employers
may set reasonable age limitations on certain high-stress jobs
requiring peak physical condition.
638 | EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION LAW

14.5 Disabilities: Discrimination
against the Handicapped

The 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) prohibits
employers from discriminating on the basis of disability. A
disabled person is someone with a physical or mental
impairment that substantially limits a major life activity or
someone who is regarded as having such an impairment. This
definition includes people with mental illness, epilepsy, visual
impairment, dyslexia, and AIDS. It also covers anyone who
has recovered from alcoholism or drug addiction. It specifically
does not cover people with sexual disorders, pyromania,
kleptomania, exhibitionism, or compulsive gambling.

   Employers cannot disqualify an employee or job applicant
because of disability as long as they can perform the essential
functions of the job, with reasonable accommodation.
Reasonable accommodation might include installing ramps
for a wheelchair, establishing more flexible working hours,
creating or modifying job assignments, and the like.

   Reasonable accommodation means that there is no undue
hardship for the employer. The law does not offer uniform
standards for identifying what may be an undue hardship
other than the imposition on the employer of a "significant
difficulty or expense." Cases will differ: the resources and
situation of each particular employer relative to the cost or
difficulty of providing the accommodation will be considered;
                                EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION LAW | 639

relative cost, rather than some definite dollar amount, will be
the issue.

14.6 Occupational Safety and
Health Act

In a heavily industrialized society, workplace safety is a major
concern. Hundreds of studies for more than a century have
documented the gruesome toll taken by hazardous working
conditions in mines, on railroads, and in factories from tools,
machines, treacherous surroundings, and toxic chemicals and
other substances. Studies in the late 1960s showed that more
than 14,000 workers were killed and 2.2 million were disabled
annually--at a cost of more than $8 billion and a loss of more
than 250 million worker days. Congress responded in 1970
with the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the primary aim
of which is "to assure so far as possible every working man and
woman in the Nation safe and healthful working conditions."

   The act imposes on each employer a general duty to furnish
a place of employment free from recognized hazards likely to
cause death or serious physical harm to employees. It also gives
the secretary of labor the power to establish national health
and safety standards. The standard- making power has been
delegated to the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration (OSHA), an agency within the US
Department of Labor. The agency has the authority to inspect
workplaces covered by the act whenever it receives complaints
640 | EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION LAW

from employees or reports about fatal or multiple injuries.
The agency may assess penalties and proceed administratively
to enforce its standards. Criminal provisions of the act are
enforced by the Justice Department.

   During its first two decades, OSHA was criticized for not
issuing standards very quickly: fewer than thirty national
workplace safety standards were issued by 1990. But not all
safety enforcement is in the hands of the federal government:
although OSHA standards preempt similar state standards,
under the act the secretary may permit the states to come up
with standards equal to or better than federal standards and
may make grants to the states to cover half the costs of
enforcement of the state safety standards.

14.7 Employee Retirement
Income Security Act

More than half the US workforce is covered by private pension
plans for retirement. One 1988 estimate put the total held
in pension funds at more than $1 trillion, costing the federal
Treasury nearly $60 billion annually in tax write-offs. As the
size of the private pension funds increased dramatically in the
1960s, Congress began to hear shocking stories of employees
defrauded out of pension benefits, deprived of a lifetime's
savings through various ruses (e.g., by long vesting provisions
and by discharges just before retirement). To put an end to
                                 EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION LAW | 641

such abuses, Congress, in 1974, enacted the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA).

   In general, ERISA governs the vesting of employees'
pension rights and the funding of pension plans. Within five
years of beginning employment, employees are entitled to
vested interests in retirement benefits contributed on their
behalf by individual employers. Multiemployer pension plans
must vest their employees' interests within ten years. A variety
of pension plans must be insured through a federal agency, the
Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, to which employers
must pay annual premiums. The corporation may assume
financial control of underfunded plans and may sue to require
employers to make up deficiencies. The act also requires
pension funds to disclose financial information to
beneficiaries, permits employees to sue for benefits, governs
the standards of conduct of fund administrators, and forbids
employers from denying employees their rights to pensions.
The act largely preempts state law governing employee
benefits.

14.8 Fair Labor Standards Act

In the midst of the Depression, Congress enacted at President
Roosevelt's urging a national minimum wage law, the Fair
Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA). The act prohibits most
forms of child labor and established a scale of minimum wages
for the regular workweek and a higher scale for overtime. (The
642 | EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION LAW

original hourly minimum was twenty-five cents, although the
administrator of the Wage and Hour Division of the US
Department of Labor, a position created by the act, could raise
the minimum rate industry by industry.) The act originally
was limited to certain types of work: that which was performed
in transporting goods in interstate commerce or in producing
goods for shipment in interstate commerce.

   Employers quickly learned that they could limit the
minimum wage by, for example, separating the interstate and
intrastate components of their production. Within the next
quarter century, the scope of the FLSA was considerably
broadened, so that it now covers all workers in businesses that
do a particular dollar-volume of goods that move in interstate
commerce, regardless of whether a particular employee
actually works in the interstate component of the business. It
now covers between 80 and 90 percent of all persons privately
employed outside of agriculture, and a lesser but substantial
percentage of agricultural workers and state and local
government employees. Violations of the act are investigated
by the administrator of the Wage and Hour Division, who has
authority to negotiate back pay on the employee's behalf. If
no settlement is reached, the Labor Department may sue on
the employee's behalf, or the employee, armed with a notice
of the administrator's calculations of back wages due, may
sue in federal or state court for back pay. Under the FLSA,
a successful employee will receive double the amount of back
wages due.
14.9                 EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION LAW | 643
Law
      Public Accommodation

It is worth closing this chapter with brief mention of related
law: that prohibiting discrimination in "public
accommodation", or who businesses serve. Law governing
who businesses must serve is broadly similar to Title VII but
with important differences. As with employment-based
discrimination, both federal and state laws have relevant
provisions for public accommodations.

   At the federal level, Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964
prohibits discrimination in "public accommodations" on the
basis of "race, color, religion, or national origin." Note that
unlike Title VII in the workplace, sex is not a protected
category here. Also, "public accommodations" are a specific
list of establishments-basically places where people eat, sleep,
buy gas, or are entertained. Private clubs are specifically
excluded and retain the ability to discriminate under Title II,
unless the private club hosts a public gathering, in which case
it becomes a place of public accommodation.

   States and territories may have laws that go further and
protect broader categories of people in more expansive ways.
For instance, many states protect against discrimination based
on sexual orientation, marital status, and age. Washington DC
makes discriminating based on political affiliation illegal! See
here for more details across the states.

   In general, dress code measures such as "no shirt no shoes
644 | EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION LAW

no service" don't discriminate on the basis of these categories
and are permissible. Of course, if the policy were only enforced
against a protected class, then that would become
discrimination based on the protected class and would be
illegal.

   Finally, note that federal protection against discrimination
for disabilities in public accommodations is broader than Title
II. For purposes of disabilities, the definition of public
accommodation includes those above and places like stores
and schools.
