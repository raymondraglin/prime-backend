INTRODUCTION

GOALS

Over several years of teaching legal research, our law
librarian instructors have listened to students who
express a need for more hands-on practice with legal
research because they lack confidence in the
thoroughness of their research, and they lack the level
of efficiency necessary for effective professional legal
practice. This text targets those concerns by posing a
client scenario involving major sources of law and legal
information (state and federal): secondary sources,
enacted law, case law, administrative regulations, and
legislative history. This text will provide background on
the sources of law, supplement text with video
demonstrations, and suggest group and individual
activities that emphasize formative self-assessment and
simulate practice experiences so that students have many
opportunities to develop and improve research skills.

What is missing?

The problem used in this text does not cover every legal
research topic. Two important topics missing from this
problem are tribal law and foreign and international law.
These two areas of legal research warrant entire courses.
For information on tribal law research, please consult

                           ADVANCED LEGAL RESEARCH: PROCESS AND PRACTICE 3
several excellent research guides: Indian Law Research
Guides, National Indian Law Library; American Indian
Law, Harvard University Law Library; Native American
Law Guide: Federal Indian Law and Tribal Law Materials,
UCLA Law Library; Indian and Tribal Law, University of
Washington Gallagher Law Library.

You can also find research guides for foreign and
international law research: Foreign, Comparative and
International Law, University of Washington Gallagher
Law Library; Foreign and International Law,
Georgetown Law Library.

PROCESS AND PRACTICE-BASED APPROACH

The client scenario provides an opportunity for you to
explore your own research process, develop methods of
documenting and organizing research, communicate
research results to the simulated client or supervising
attorney, and keep time records of research tasks to track
efficiency. This text does not aim to be a comprehensive
explanation of all sources of law. Rather, it focuses on
practicing the research process: how to find and analyze
legal information sources in an efficient, thorough way.
The client scenario presents few specific facts. This is
intentional. You will be investing time and energy
exploring and reflecting on the research process and
finding sources, rather than making complex factual
arguments in a legal memorandum.

ORGANIZATION AND CONTENT

         Part I
        This book begins with an overview of the research
        process and analysis. Next, it introduces a client
        scenario that can be used as a semester-long
        research problem or for practice examples
        throughout a course. Then, it offers some
        contextual material for the client scenario that
        could be used for diversity and inclusion
        discussions.

         Part II
        The next part of the book offers sample
        assignments and assessments that could be used
        for an advanced legal research course. Or, the
        samples could inspire ideas for different
        assignments and assessments. Throughout this
        book, you will have opportunities to contribute
        ideas, questions, and samples, toward the goal of
        making research learning collaborative and
        inclusive.

                           ADVANCED LEGAL RESEARCH: PROCESS AND PRACTICE 5
         Part III

        The next section of the book outlines and
        discusses steps in the legal research process: (1)
        preparing to research; (2) finding and using
        secondary sources; (3) finding and using enacted
        law; (4) finding and using case law; (5) finding and
        using administrative law; (6) finding and using
        legislative history; and (7) updating, reading and
        organizing sources. For each step of the research
        process, the text will explain sources of
        information, suggest search techniques, provide
        practice examples and short demonstration
        videos, and offer discussion and reflection
        questions.

In keeping with the spirit of open and accessible
education, this book will emphasize freely available legal
information resources, rather than focusing mostly on
commercial research platforms such as Westlaw and
Lexis. Commercial platforms are important tools for the
practice of law, so texts used in first year research and
writing instruction necessarily focus on how to use
Westlaw, Lexis, and Bloomberg Law. But for many
entering the profession, the expense of these platforms
makes them unattainable. Even for new attorneys who
have access to commercial platforms, they must learn to
use them in a limited, fiscally responsible way, so
knowing how to find information on freely available
websites is an essential professional skill.

REFLECTION AND COLLABORATION

There are many ways to structure a legal research course
for effective learning. Law librarians and legal research
and writing faculty tend to be creative, energetic, engaged
teachers who care deeply about student learning. I have
learned as much from talking to my colleagues and
watching them teach as I have from being in the
classroom myself. Equally important is what I learn from
you, the students: your questions, reflections,
observations, and commitment to excellent professional
skills continuously inspire and inform instructional
design choices and teaching methods. This book provides
one approach to teaching a second/third year legal
research course: it uses one complex scenario for the
whole semester so you can see the interplay of different
types of sources, experience the iterative nature of legal
research, and have time to reflect deeply on the
effectiveness of your research process. The collaborative
approach of this book allows you to develop teamwork
skills that are essential in professional practice, as well
as appreciate and learn from different approaches and
perspectives of your colleagues. Throughout this
resource, you will have opportunities to share discussion
and reflection questions, as well as your ideas for research
logs.

COURSE DESIGN

This text offers some suggestions for exercises, activities,
assignments, and assessments. It also provides an
opportunity for collaborators to contribute other ideas
for course materials. In addition to content, instructors
and students should think about course design and

                           ADVANCED LEGAL RESEARCH: PROCESS AND PRACTICE 7
delivery. Student learning is best when the course
materials, course design, and instructional approaches
are as inclusive and accessible as possible. Many articles
and books on inclusive and accessible course design and
instruction are available; some suggestions for further
reading are listed below. As a short summary, here are
some important considerations for designing and
teaching a legal research course:

    1. Transparency: Have an in-class discussion about
         the purpose and goals underlying course exercises,
         activities, assessments, and course design. Reflect
         on whether the purpose and goals were achieved.
         Transparency allows students to see the relevancy
         of their coursework to their larger professional
         goals, and requires instructors to be able to
         articulate clearly how course work is aligned with
         those learning goals.

    2. Predictability: The course should be designed
         and structured with a predictable rhythm to each
         class session, each week, and the semester.
         Predictability is enhanced by consistent due dates;
         clearly communicated class agendas; consistent
         and organized weekly modules in the learning
         management system; overviews and recaps during
         each class session; and a clear syllabus that lists
         overviews and learning goals for each class
         session, as well as due dates for every assignment
         and assessment.

    3. Flexibility: The concept of flexibility might seem
         opposite to predictability. However, within the
         predictable structure of the course, students

8 MEGAN AUSTIN
    should have some flexibility in how to complete
    activities, exercises, and assessments. For example,
    if a weekly research journal is assigned, then
    students could have some flexibility in either
    creating a written journal entry, sound recording,
    or short video. Similarly, allowing some flexibility
    in the medium for final projects will allow
    students to communicate what they have learned
    in the most effective way for them. Creating
    frequent opportunities for formative feedback
    also promotes flexibility, as instructors will be
    able to address students' unique challenges and
    strengths, and supplement classroom sessions to
    address any common questions that arise in real
    time.

4. Timely and frequent feedback: Adult learners
    seek frequent feedback so they can improve their
    skills and achieve professional goals. Courses
    should be designed so that feedback from
    instructors is provided in a predictable and timely
    manner. For example, if students submit a weekly
    research journal entry on Friday afternoon,
    feedback should be consistently provided by
    Monday afternoon so that students can use that
    feedback in their work for the week. Set due dates
    for instructor feedback and stick to them.
    Feedback should be provided in multiple forms:
    answering common questions or addressing
    common challenges during a class session;
    personalized feedback to individual students on
    assignments; responding to questions during
    office hours; responding in a timely way to

                    ADVANCED LEGAL RESEARCH: PROCESS AND PRACTICE 9
         student emails; and providing substantive, formal
         feedback on summative assessments.

    5. Formative assessments: Provide multiple
         opportunities for students to practice skills and
         receive feedback before they have a higher stakes
         summative assessment. Formative assessments
         decrease student stress and emphasize growth and
         skills development, rather than focusing on
         grading and ranking students. Using multiple
         formative assessments also allows for variety in
         media (written documents, oral presentations,
         video or audio projects, visual charts or tables)
         which promotes inclusivity in the different ways
         that students communicate their learning.

    6. Universal Design for Learning principles:
         Universal Design for Learning (UDL) is one way
         of approaching inclusive course design and
         teaching. UDL, based on neurological science,
         provides guidelines for engaging all students in
         effective learning. Course design should address
         the affective network (student engagement,
         motivation, and persistence), recognition network
         (ways in which students take in information), and
         strategic network (ways that students demonstrate
         mastery of the course material).

             1. Transparency, predictability, and frequent
                  feedback address the affective network by
                  communicating relevancy of course
                  materials, aligning activities and
                  assessments to learning goals, and
                  providing an organized, step by step
                  approach to achieving professional goals.

10 MEGAN AUSTIN
         2. Varied course materials (demonstrations,
             readings, discussions, written outlines,
             clear class session overviews and recaps,
             and substantive videos) address the
             recognition network by providing multiple
             means by which students can take in
             information, given individual challenges
             such as ADHD, other neurological
             challenges, visual or auditory processing
             difficulties, mental health concerns, as well
             as family situations.

         3. Varied and multiple formative assessments,
             predictable weekly assignments, and
             flexibility in media for assignments and
             projects address the strategic network.
             Students will be able to demonstrate
             mastery of the material most effectively if
             they can plan their time, have multiple
             opportunities to show their growth, and
             have some flexibility in how they
             communicate their knowledge and skills.

7. Backward Design: There are many instructional
    design models. Backward design is one model that
    facilitates thoughtful, methodical planning of a
    course so that it is as inclusive and student-
    centered as possible. Backward design begins with
    determining the end result of the course: what
    should students know or be able to do at the end
    of the course. This is another way of saying "what
    are the learning outcomes of the course?" The
    next step is to create assessments that will
    measure if the learning outcomes are being

                   ADVANCED LEGAL RESEARCH: PROCESS AND PRACTICE 11
         achieved. Then, create class activities and
         materials that will allow students to practice and
         prepare for those assessments. The goal is to align
         course activities, materials, and assessments with
         the learning outcomes. Student engagement,
         motivation and persistence wanes if a class
         activity or assessment is unrelated to a desired
         outcome. For example, if a learning outcome is for
         students to practice using multiple platforms to
         find secondary sources, a multiple choice test or
         quiz on terminology would not align with the
         learning outcome and students might perceive it
         to be busy work, or a needless source of stress and
         unrelated to professional goals. Many instructors
         use backward design chartsor tables to help with
         effective course design.

NEXT GENERATION BAR EXAM

Law students entering law school in 2023 may be taking
the NextGen Bar Exam in 2026. The NextGen Bar Exam
will be the first version on the bar exam to require test
takers to demonstrate legal research proficiency. In May
2023, the National Conference of Bar Examiners (NCBE)
issued its "Bar Exam Content Scope" identifying the
foundational skills, concepts, and principles to be tested
in the new bar exam. The following excerpt from the
NCBE Bar Exam Content Scope outlines the legal
research skills to be tested in the NextGen Bar:

Foundational Skills Group C: Legal Research

The purpose of Foundational Skills Group C is to test the
extent to which an examine can identify and implement
legal research strategies, including preliminary issue-
spotting, working with provided resources, developing
and refining a theory of the case, and reaching closure on
research questions.

  15. In a matter that requires legal research, identify the
         research questions that need to be answered.

  16. Identify ambiguities in the language, standards,
         elements, or factors of a provided resource (such as
         a statute, contract, or judicial opinion).

                         ADVANCED LEGAL RESEARCH: PROCESS AND PRACTICE 13
  17. Identify efficient legal research strategies
         (including appropriate search terms) that are likely
         to uncover other legal sources to assist in the
         interpretation of a provided resource (such as a
         statute, contract, or judicial opinion).

  18. Given a collection of legal sources, identify the
         roles and characteristics of the sources, including
         their authoritative weight.

  19. Given one or more judicial opinions, identify the
         facts in a matter that are analogous to and/or
         distinct from the dispositive facts in the opinions.

Note: Depending on the context of the question, a
question assessing Task 19 may be classified as either an
Issue Spotting and Analysis question (Group A) or a Legal
Research question (Group C).

  20. Given a collection of legal sources, identify other
         sources, search terms, or research strategies that
         might be used to update sources or find additional
         sources.

  21. Given a collection of legal sources, identify which
         sources are relevant to or dispositive of a legal
         issue in the matter.

  22. Given a collection of legal sources, identify
         whether the sources are sufficient to complete an
         assigned research or other lawyering task. (NCBE
         Bar Exam Content Scope Outline, May 2023).

While test takers will not be tasked with an open-ended
research question that requires searching for online legal

14 MEGAN AUSTIN
sources, they will be required to identify legal research
questions; analyze legal sources; develop effective
research plans, including identifying search terms; apply
knowledge of different types of legal sources and their
authoritative weight; update sources; and determine
when their research is complete. You will be practicing
and reflecting on all of these skills throughout this text.
You are encouraged to add reflection and discussion
questions at the end of sections and chapters that focus
on the crucial analytical and legal information literacy
skills that go hand-in-hand with actual searching for and
finding legal sources, so that you can begin your skills
practice for the NextGen Bar Exam. You will find that the
following student learning outcomes for this text reflect
the skills that you will need for success on the new bar
exam and law practice.

LEARNING OUTCOMES

After using this resource, you will be able to:

    1. Read and analyze a set of facts; identify and
         articulate initial legal issues and associated areas
         of substantive law; formulate a research plan that
         identifies relevant primary and secondary legal
         authorities; and document and communicate that
         plan to a colleague or senior partner.

    2. Locate, retrieve and search within legal resources,
         using indexes, tables of contents and keyword
         searching; recognize the terminology associated
         with legal resources; and assess the relevance and
         authority of federal, state, and local legal systems
         that may impact a given research issue.

                         ADVANCED LEGAL RESEARCH: PROCESS AND PRACTICE 15
    3. Read, evaluate, analyze and organize research
         findings (considering authority/credibility,
         current-ness, and authenticity) and communicate
         them through a research summary, log, letter,
         video presentation or other work product.

    4. Reflect on the research findings and how they
         apply to the research issues; determine the
         accuracy and thoroughness of results; critically
         evaluate the efficiency of the research process; and
         determine strategies to modify the research
         process if necessary.

OVERVIEW OF THE RESEARCH PROCESS
AND LEGAL ANALYSIS

LEARNING GOALS

After reading this chapter, you will be able to

    1. List the steps of the research process
    2. Identify the fundamentals of legal analysis in each

         step of the research process
    3. Reflect on your own research process, strengths,

         and weaknesses

OVERVIEW OF LEGAL RESEARCH PROCESS
STEPS

In your first-year legal research and writing course, most
likely you learned steps of the legal research process and
practiced applying them in your course research and
writing projects. Intertwined with the steps of the legal
research process is legal analysis. Analyzing your client's
problem (what questions you need to answer, what
sources might answer that question, what cases will be
most relevant to the legal issues, etc.) makes the legal
research process complex and challenging. This section
will review the steps in the research process as well as
some fundamentals of legal analysis.

                         ADVANCED LEGAL RESEARCH: PROCESS AND PRACTICE 17
    1. Offline preparation for research

    2. Find and Use Secondary Sources

    3. Find and Use Federal, State, and Local Enacted
         Law (Statutes and Ordinances)

    4. Find and Use Case Law

    5. Find and Use Administrative Law

    6. Find and Use Legislative History

    7. Update, Read, Organize, and Analyze Sources

After you have been through the research process several
times, you realize that research is not a rigid, linear
process. Often, you will start with a statute or a case if
that is the information you have. You will then go back to
secondary sources to read some context and learn more
about the relevant area of law. However, because legal
research is so complex, you will always use the legal
research process steps as a structure so that your results
are thorough, and you achieve them in the most efficient
way possible.

LEGAL ANALYSIS

As you proceed through the research process, you are
necessarily engaging in legal analysis. When you are
preparing to research, you frame a legal issue or multiple
issues based on your client's problem; you also decide on
search terms that are likely to produce relevant results
and select the proper jurisdiction for your research.
When you find sources, you question whether they are
relevant to your legal issues and articulate how those
sources apply to your issues. During each step of your
research, you will question if you need to change or add

18 MEGAN AUSTIN
to your search terms in order to find more or different
sources. When you have collected multiple primary and
secondary sources, you will need to understand how they
all fit together. The reflection activities, discussion
questions, and other practice activities throughout this
text will help you engage in the analysis necessary for
thorough legal research, and prepare you for effective
communication of your research in whatever form is
required.

REFLECTION ACTIVITY

Write a short reflection on your current research process:
What steps do you follow? What methods do you use
to find secondary sources, statutes, and cases? How do
you record and organize your research results? Do you
feel confident that you have found all the sources you
need? What are your research strengths? What are your
research weaknesses? How do you decide that you are
finished researching?

STUDENT DISCUSSION AND REFLECTION
QUESTIONS

What is the research skill that you are most confident in?
Why do you think you are most confident in that skill?

What is the research skill that you are least confident in?
Why do you think you are least confident in that skill?

What is the first thing you do when you get a research
project?

What are your learning goals for research skills?

CLIENT SCENARIO

SAMPLE PROBLEM AND CLIENT FILE

Our law librarians have used this scenario for several
semesters of our Advanced Legal Research course (both
asynchronous-online and in-person). We find that the
problem is interesting to most students and requires you
to access many types of sources that you might not have
encountered in first-year research and writing courses.
The scenario could be modified for different
jurisdictions, or to address different student learning
outcomes or course coverage.

The client file contains only basic facts; it consists of a
client intake form, a letter, and an image that is at issue.
Like real law practice, the research inquiry is guided by
the client's questions. In contrast to first year legal
research and writing problems, which are usually
narrowly defined, the broad questions in this client
scenario require you to explore many types of resources,
exercise critical thinking skills, and reflect on and revise
searches based on information you encounter.

For more experiential/simulation practice, students
could interview a simulated client (maybe a colleague or
another student) to gather facts and formulate the
research questions.

TOPICS

The proposed client scenario presents an opportunity to
discuss diversity, equity, and inclusion in the craft
brewing industry. These topics can be part of a class
discussion or an online discussion board to add meaning
and context to the research problem.

Craft brewing is a multi-billion-dollar industry, but less
than 1% of breweries in the U.S. are black-owned...not
for lack of interest, but largely due to lack of access to
seed money to start a business, lack of access to property
suitable for brewing operations, and lack of access to
employment experience and education/training
programs.

People of color, as well as people in the LGBTQIA+
community, and women are significantly
underrepresented in the craft brewing and other
beverage alcohol industries. People of color have not only
felt unwelcome as industry members, but also as
consumers of craft beer. Fortunately, some members of
underrepresented communities who are passionate about
brewing and distilling have acted on their goals to make
the craft brewing industry more inclusive and
welcoming.

WEEKLY RESEARCH JOURNAL ENTRIES

OVERVIEW

The journal entries are simultaneously a reflective
exercise and a formative assessment.

      Reflective exercise: You will be submitting
         weekly research journal entries or logs showing
         your progress on the efficiency and effectiveness
         of your research process, your progress on finding
         and analyzing research results, and your ability to
         reflect on your weekly progress toward your
         individual research goals. The weekly journal/log
         also documents the information you need to
         complete the assigned course projects.

      Formative assessment: Throughout the research
         process, you should receive substantive feedback
         on the work you are doing. This feedback allows
         you to learn from mistakes, improve research
         strategies, and exercise your metacognitive skills.
         Instructors will provide personalized feedback on
         each of your journal entries so that you continue
         to improve throughout the course.

FORMAT

The form/platform for the journal entries is up to you.

                         ADVANCED LEGAL RESEARCH: PROCESS AND PRACTICE 27
You can do a video entry, a blog, a text document,
substantive chart, or a diagram. Consider your audience;
make your journal easy to read and understand for both
you and the reader (i.e. a supervising attorney or
colleague).

SUBSTANCE

Journal entries/logs should include:

      an explanation of research process, including
         steps taken to navigate databases and commentary
         on the reliability/usability of the research
         database or platform;

      research results related to the week's subject focus
         (i.e. if we are covering secondary sources during
         that week, your journal entry should focus on the
         secondary sources you found), including evidence
         that you read and analyzed the material in that
         source (a summary or explanation) and citations
         to other legal sources that you found in the source
         and plan on investigating further;

      a reflective element demonstrating your thinking
         about your progress toward short and long-term
         research goals, new techniques you learned, new
         resources you encountered.

this week on secondary sources. Every weekly journal
entry should (1) explain the research that you done in
relation to the sources that we are covering during the
week (i.e. this week we are talking about secondary
sources), (2) discuss platforms, resources, websites, or
other tools you used, and (3) reflect on your development
as an effective researcher (did you discover something
new? become more efficient? become better at creating
effective searches?) You can use any form you like: a text
document, a video, a visual chart, or diagram.

RESEARCH LOG ASSIGNMENT

After a couple of weeks of searching for and finding
information for the client scenario, you probably will
have collected a few types of sources and learned some
foundational information about the legal issues. At this
point, you will need to start organizing and documenting
your research.

In your first-year legal research and writing course, your
professor might have provided you with a research log to
fill out for a project. Perhaps that worked well for you,
or perhaps you had different ideas about how to record
research results and organize your sources.

PURPOSE OF RESEARCH LOG ASSIGNMENT

The goal of this project is for you to develop a research
log that will be useful and practical for your academic and
professional lives. We do this project early in the semester
so you can use it to record and organize results going
forward. In previous semesters students have commented
that they started using the log/chart/instrument they
developed in this class for their jobs or internships and
found it very helpful. A few samples are available for
inspiration. Mostly it's important for you to develop a
log or chart or checklist that works for you so that you
have some way to track and organize your results. Also,

32 MEGAN AUSTIN
think about the possibility that a supervisor or colleague
might ask to see what you have found so far, so your log/
chart/instrument/checklist should be understandable to
someone who wants to consult your research results.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR CREATING THE LOG

Create a chart, checklist, or other document that you will
use to record and organize research process and results.
After you create the Log form, you will record the
research you have completed already, and you will
continue to use it for the remainder of the semester. You
can develop something completely new or modify a log
format that worked well for you in your first-year legal
research and writing course.

RESEARCH LOG SAMPLES

In the following section you will find samples of research
logs that students have created. You are invited to use
those for inspiration and/or add your own to the
collection of samples.

FINAL PROJECT

PROJECT DESCRIPTION - SUMMATIVE
ASSESSMENT

The Final Project will outline, summarize, and explain
all the research you have done on the client's scenario. It
should focus on the research resources and process -- it
is not a substantive memo in which you apply law to facts
and draw legal conclusions. The purpose of the project is
to identify research sources, explain information found in
those sources, and organize research process and results
so they can be communicated to a supervisor or colleague
thoroughly and effectively.

The project is an opportunity to demonstrate your
mastery of the research process you have been working
on during the semester. Throughout the semester you
reflected on your research process on a weekly basis and
received substantive feedback. Now it is time to organize
and synthesize all of that research to present a
comprehensive, structured work product.

Project Substance

The final project should (1) clearly identify each resource,
(2) summarize the information found in that resource, (3)

34 MEGAN AUSTIN
explain how/where to find the resource, and (4) have a
clear, logical organizational structure.

      Identify the Resource - Provide a title, author,
         chapter, name of the website, organization,
         government agency, statute, regulation, case, etc.
         A hyperlink does not count as identification of
         the resource. You can provide a hyperlink in
         addition to clearly identifying the name of the
         resource.

      Summarize the Information - Describe the
         information you found that is relevant to the legal
         issue and why it is relevant.

      Explain How/Where to Find the Resource - For
         some resources like cases or statutes, you will not
         need to explain how to find them. However, for
         government reports, proposed regulations, law
         review articles, treatises, or legislative history, for
         example, you should explain how to find the
         information so that a colleague or supervisor can
         access it. A hyperlink is not an explanation of how
         to find a resource. Links break or change. You can
         use hyperlinks in addition to explaining how to
         find the resource.

      Provide a Clear Organizational Structure - This is
         a complex problem raising several legal issues.
         Whenever you present your research to a
         colleague or a supervisor, you organize the
         information logically. Imagine that the colleague
         or supervisor is going to use your research in
         preparation for a meeting with the client. How
         can you present all of that research in a user-

                         ADVANCED LEGAL RESEARCH: PROCESS AND PRACTICE 35
         friendly way?

Project Form

There are many ways to present research information
effectively and thoroughly. Some possible presentation
forms are described below:

      Detailed Log - You might choose to use the
         research log you created at the beginning of the
         semester as a basis for your final project. You will
         need to reorganize some information and add
         more detail to descriptions of the substance and
         how to find the resource.

      Video - Many students enjoy creating a video in
         which they use Power Point slides to identify and
         explain resources and a screen-casting video tool
         to demonstrate how to find the resources on
         websites or research platforms.

      Research Guide - A research guide is an
         organized collection of resources related to a
         topic. You probably have encountered a research
         guide during your work on this problem that you
         can consult as a sample. If you choose this method
         for your project, think carefully about how to
         organize the research, provide thorough and
         meaningful descriptions of the relevant
         information, and explain how to find the
         resources.

OFFLINE PREPARATION FOR RESEARCH

LEARNING GOALS
After reading this chapter, you will be able to

    1. Read and analyze a set of facts.
    2. Identify relevant jurisdiction(s).
    3. Articulate initial legal issues or questions.
    4. Create a list of search terms to begin legal

         research.
OVERVIEW
An important, but often overlooked or neglected, step
in the research process is preparing to research. When
you get your research assignment, resist the temptation to
start typing words into a Google or commercial platform
search bar immediately. The time you invest thinking
about your research will increase your efficiency and
effectiveness later. To prepare for research (1) identify
the jurisdiction(s) relevant to your client's problem, (2)
articulate the legal question(s) presented by the client's
situation, and (3) create a list of search terms from the
information you have gathered from the client.

                         ADVANCED LEGAL RESEARCH: PROCESS AND PRACTICE 41
IDENTIFY THE JURISDICTION(S)

Before you start looking for legal information, you need
to know which jurisdiction's law controls. Keep in mind
that the problem might have multiple questions that
require research in several jurisdictions.

      Is this a state issue?
      Is this a federal issue?
      Are there issues covered by municipal law?
      Which state's law controls?
      Which federal district court and circuit court of

         appeals control?
      Is tribal law involved?
      Is foreign or international law involved?

ARTICULATE THE LEGAL QUESTION

Often, one of the most challenging aspects of getting
started with research is understanding exactly what the
client wants and framing the client's goals as legal
questions. When you are formulating a legal question,
you need to consider the facts you have gathered as well
as what legal principles might be involved. When you
are preparing to research, think about articulating
preliminary legal questions, because after you start
researching you are likely to refine, change, or add to
your legal questions.

CREATE A LIST OF SEARCH TERMS

Your terms will guide your online searches of databases,

42 MEGAN AUSTIN
websites, and commercial platforms such as Lexis and
Westlaw. They will also help you find information in
indexes and tables of contents if you are using print
sources. When generating your list of terms, think of legal
concepts and principles as well as words arising from
the facts gathered from the client. Consider synonyms, as
well as general and specific terms.

Suggested Activities

    1. Who, What, When, Where, How? Ask yourself or
         your colleagues these questions to help generate a
         list of terms.

    2. Question-storming. Because we are often
         unfamiliar with specific areas of law, we might
         have trouble identifying precise legal concepts or
         terminology. Sometimes, asking yourself or a
         colleague questions about the client's problem
         helps generate search terms. For example, I might
         ask myself or my colleague "why did a brewer
         write a letter to our client complaining that his
         customers are likely to be confused by our client's
         beer name and logo"? That question might lead
         me to put different forms of "likely" and
         "confusion" on my terms list.

STUDENT DISCUSSION AND REFLECTION
QUESTIONS

    1. In the past, have you spent time preparing to
         research? Why or why not?

    2. What methods did you use to prepare to research
         for the current problem?

FINDING AND USING SECONDARY
SOURCES

You likely encountered a few types of secondary sources
in previous legal research and writing courses. In this
chapter, you will review the main types of secondary
sources and learn about some secondary sources that you
might not have used previously.
LEARNING GOALS:
After reading this chapter, you will be able to

    1. Provide background on what a secondary source
         is and why you use secondary sources.

    2. Discuss the different types of secondary sources.
    3. Use various strategies for searching for secondary

         sources and using them effectively.
WHAT IS A SECONDARY SOURCE?
Legal information is divided into primary sources and
secondary sources. Primary sources are the law from
government entities: constitutions, statutes,
administrative rules/regulations, and cases.
Constitutions and statutes come from the legislature
(legislative branch). Administrative agencies (executive

                         ADVANCED LEGAL RESEARCH: PROCESS AND PRACTICE 45
branch) issue rules/regulations and administrative law
judges issue administrative opinions and rulings. Courts
(judicial branch) deliver court opinions, which we refer to
as case law.

In contrast, secondary sources are sources written about
the law. They explain, analyze, summarize, or discuss the
law. They are usually written by law professors or
attorneys.

WHY USE A SECONDARY SOURCE?

Sometimes a client will come to you with a question
about an area of law unfamiliar to you. Secondary sources
provide you with background information as well as refer
to statutes and cases that will give you a starting point
for further research. Even if you have some experience
with the legal topic, a secondary source might make your
research more efficient by summarizing some important
legal rules and highlighting important statutes, cases, and
administrative rules, giving you a quicker and easier entry
point.

Librarians and legal research and writing professors
often suggest starting your research with secondary
sources; but you can use secondary sources at different
points throughout your research process. You might find
some statutes and cases, and then recognize that you need
to read some secondary sources to put the law in a bigger
context or investigate how experts have analyzed the
body of law on your topic.

TYPES OF SECONDARY SOURCES

The main types of secondary sources are encyclopedias,

46 MEGAN AUSTIN
treatises and other books, law review and journal articles,
American Law Reports, and practice materials. Other
excellent places to find secondary source material are
government and organizational websites, as well as blogs.
With any source, you need to evaluate its credibility,
currentness, and impact; however, when looking at
organizational websites and blogs, you need also to
inquire whether the organization or blog author has a
particular bias.

Encyclopedias

What are legal encyclopedias?

Legal encyclopedias describe terms and concepts in
relatively easy to digest entries. The commentary is more
general, rather than detailed, so encyclopedias provide
quick grounding in a legal concept. The main legal
encyclopedias are American Jurisprudence (AmJur) and
Corpus Juris Secundum (CJS). AmJur and CJS are not
jurisdiction-specific but will often provide citations to
cases or statutes from multiple jurisdictions, so you will
need to do further research to find sources on the
controlling law of your state or federal jurisdiction. Some
states have their own legal encyclopedias that focus on
the law of that state. Wex is a free legal dictionary and
encyclopedia from the Legal Information Institute,
Cornell Law School.

Where do you find legal encyclopedias?

Some law libraries might still have print volumes of
encyclopedias. However, recently most libraries have
stopped updating print encyclopedias or have removed
them altogether. AmJur is available on Westlaw and Lexis

                         ADVANCED LEGAL RESEARCH: PROCESS AND PRACTICE 47
and CJS is available on Westlaw. Wex is freely available by
searching for the Legal Information Institute.

Treatises and other Books

There are many types of books that can aid in legal
research. You will hear terms like treatise, monograph,
looseleaf, practice guide, and desk book. To put it simply,
they are all books, but they range in breadth and depth
of treatment and format. You would choose one type of
book over another depending on the question you are
trying to answer, the amount of time you have, and the
stage of representation or litigation.

What is a treatise?

A treatise is a book covering a legal topic in a
comprehensive way. It provides analysis, legal rules, and
illustrative examples. A treatise can be single or multi-
volume, or serial in nature, and covers a general
topic.When you are doing legal research, you probably
will not have time to read a whole treatise on a legal topic.
Treatises have tables of contents and indexes that you
can use to find a specific issue or sub-topic relevant to
your problem. For example, Restatements of the Law is
considered a multivolume treatise.

What is a monograph?

A monograph is a singular volume that presents more
specific treatment of a topic. It is a specialized, scholarly
treatise. Like other treatises, they have tables of contents
and indexes to help you target the specific area relevant
to your problem.

48 MEGAN AUSTIN
Where do you find treatises and monographs?

Most law libraries have treatises and monographs in print
and ebook form. Lexis, Westlaw, and Bloomberg also host
collections of treatises. You can find some treatises on
HeinOnline as well; some public and academic law
libraries provide no-cost access to HeinOnline to the
general public.

Practice Example:

Many subscription databases available through law
libraries provide access to treatises, monographs and
other books. However, you can also find books on freely
available platforms as well. In this example, you will
search for trademark resources using Oregon Bar Books
and NOLO databases from the State of Oregon Law
Library website.

The following video will demonstrate the research steps
to find resources using the State of Oregon Law Library
website.

                     One or more interactive elements has been
                     excluded from this version of the text. You can
         view them online here: https://opentext.uoregon.edu/
         legal/?p=41#oembed-1

What is a practice guide?

A practice guide explains how to practice in a particular
area of law. Practice guides focus on succinct statements

                         ADVANCED LEGAL RESEARCH: PROCESS AND PRACTICE 49
of legal principles and provide tools such as checklists
and sample language for pleadings. Tables of Contents
provide excellent organizational structure to help you
analyze the necessary parts of a legal claim. Most practice
guides are jurisdiction specific. One popular example of
a practice guide is the collection of Oregon BarBooks.
Some states, such as California, have many practice
guides on a variety of topics.

Where do you find practice guides?

In Oregon, members of the Bar have access to Oregon
BarBooks. Members of the public can access them
through the State of Oregon Law Library. Law students
usually have access though their school's library website.
Lexis, Westlaw, and Bloomberg also provide access to
practice guides. Finally, many law libraries still have print
copies of practice guides on the shelves.

Practice Materials

What are Practice Materials?

In addition to practice guides, a type of book discussed
above, there are other practice materials: forms, model
pleadings, jury verdicts, dockets, and court rules.
Generally, practitioners consider any materials that
provide "how-to" information to be practice materials.
For example, an attorney might use a form to learn some
basic information on how to file a complaint on a
trademark issue. Or the attorney might look at dockets
for trademark infringement cases to see examples of how
trademark cases move through a court or what types of
motions are typically filed.

50 MEGAN AUSTIN
Where do you find practice materials?

If you are looking for freely available practice materials,
go to county, state and academic law libraries, which
might provide access to some of their databases.

Commercial platforms such as Westlaw, Lexis, and
Bloomberg have extensive collections of practice
materials.

Westlaw

Westlaw has the following databases with practice-
oriented materials:

Briefs: contains briefs from the U.S. Supreme Court (and
selected Petitions for Writ of Certiorari, Courts of
Appeals, Courts of Appeals for the Armed Forces, U.S.
Tax Court and various state courts and the District of
Columbia.

Dockets: Dockets are formal records noting all
proceedings and filings in court cases. The Westlaw
docket database contains docket information on cases

Benefits, Finance, Government Practice (Federal, State
and Local), Health Care, Intellectual Property and
Technology, Labor and Employment, Litigation, Real
Estate, and Trusts and Estates.

52 MEGAN AUSTIN
Lexis

Lexis has the following databases containing practice-
oriented materials:

Briefs, Pleadings & Motions: In addition to briefs from
state and federal courts, this database includes federal
and state pleadings (complaints, petitions, answers,
declarations, and memoranda of points and authorities),
motions, and other documents.

Dockets (Courtlink): This database allows you to search
for dockets and documents with keywords, docket
numbers, litigant names, attorney or judge information,
case type, litigation area, and other fields.

Expert Witness Materials: This database provides access
to expert witness challenges, resumes and CVs,
summaries, and testimonies and reports, searching by
content type, jurisdiction, or practice area.

Jury Instructions: Search for federal and state jury
instructions by jurisdiction or practice area.

Jury Verdicts & Settlements: This database contains jury
verdict and settlement information by jurisdiction or
practice area.

Sample Forms: Search for forms by jurisdiction or
practice area.

Bloomberg Law

Bloomberg Law is a practice-oriented platform. In their
practice centers for various topics, you can find toolkits,
forms, charts, checklists, practical guidance, clauses, and

                         ADVANCED LEGAL RESEARCH: PROCESS AND PRACTICE 53
documents. Bloomberg also provides access to federal
and some state dockets.

American Law Reports

What are American Law Reports?

American Law Reports (ALR) is a series containing
articles called annotations. The annotations cover narrow
legal issues concisely, and provide a user-friendly
organizational structure. Annotations cite to relevant
primary sources from multiple jurisdictions.

Where do you find American Law Reports?

Westlaw and Lexis provide access to American Law
Reports.

Scholarly Journal Articles

What is a law review or law journal article?

Authored by judges, practitioners, and law professors, law
review and law journal articles are deep, detailed
discussions on narrow legal issues; they often review the
historical development of legal principles and propose
changes to the law. Law reviews and journals also publish
Notes and Comments, authored by law students. The
Notes and Comments focus on a recent court decision or
discuss a broader issue of law.

Law reviews and journals are published by student
editorial boards. Many journals cover a broad range of
topics, but journals on specialized topics are available.
For example, a law school might have journals focusing

54 MEGAN AUSTIN
on international law, environmental law, women and the
law, or criminal justice.

Where do you find law review and journal articles?

You can find free access to many journal articles on
Google Scholar. In addition, state and county law
libraries often provide access to HeinOnline, which has
an extensive law journal database. Westlaw, Lexis, and
Bloomberg also provide access to law review and journal
databases. Increasingly, law schools provide free access
to their journals through their websites or online
repositories.

Practice Example:

In this example, you will search Google Scholar to find a
law review or journal article on trademark infringement
in the context of beer names and breweries.

The following video will demonstrate how to find and
access articles using Google Scholar.

                     One or more interactive elements has been

         legal/?p=41#oembed-2

Government and Organization Websites

In the last decade, governmental entities such as
administrative agencies have created websites containing

                         ADVANCED LEGAL RESEARCH: PROCESS AND PRACTICE 55
extensive amounts of helpful information. In addition to
linking to primary sources, government agencies provide
reports, FAQs, forms, tools, and other publications that
help you find and understand legal principles within their
jurisdiction. Non-governmental organizations have
similar types of information available on their websites.
With this wealth of information available for free, you
will often find helpful secondary sources just by using a
Google type of search.

On Google, you can refine your searches to be more
targeted and efficient by clicking on the "settings" link
in the lower right corner of the screen and using the
options for Advanced Search and working with "site or
domain." For example, if you just want government sites,
you can type .gov into the site or domain search box and
then put other search terms in the boxes at the top of
the Advanced Search page. Or, if you want to search a
particular site, you can type that site name and then add
search terms. This type of searching will allow you to
eliminate irrelevant results and save time and energy.

Practice Example:

In this example, you will look for a secondary source
on the issue of trademarks for beer and breweries on a
government website using a google advanced search.

The following video will demonstrate using a google
advanced search to find a secondary source on a
government website.

Blogs

Blogs on a variety of legal topics also are an easily
accessible way to start your research. Be attentive to the
credentials of the author and how current the blog is.
Blogs are a great way to read about current trends in
the law, breaking cases, and background information; but
always verify the information is correct with your own
research into primary sources.

SUGGESTED ACTIVITY

One group of students should use only free sources and
one group should use only subscription platforms to find
secondary sources on one aspect of the client's problem
(i.e. the trademark issue or Oregon brewery licenses) and
then compare and contrast results. This activity can be
done as an online discussion board or as in-class group
work and class discussion.

STUDENT-DRAFTED DISCUSSION AND
REFLECTION QUESTIONS

    1. What is your level of confidence that you have
         found the best secondary source for your research
         problem?

FINDING AND USING ENACTED LAW
(STATUTES AND ORDINANCES)

LEARNING GOALS:
After reading this chapter, you will be able to

    1. Use several methods to find statutes (federal and
         state) and municipal ordinances relevant to your
         issue(s).

    2. Navigate the sections of a statute or ordinance.
    3. Use statutes to find other relevant sources.
WHAT ARE STATUTES?
Statutes are codified laws. When a statute is codified, it is
placed into a code that is organized by topic. For example,
42 U.S.C. 1983 is a federal statute allowing a civil action
for deprivation of rights. That means the statute is section
1983 of Title 42. All the statutes in Title 42 address public
health and welfare.

You will often start your search for primary legal sources
with statutes because they address so many legal issues.
Any case law on that legal issue will interpret or apply
the relevant statute, so it makes sense to start with the
statutory sections. Also, you can use the statute to find

                         ADVANCED LEGAL RESEARCH: PROCESS AND PRACTICE 59
other legal sources such as case law and administrative
rules.

METHODS OF FINDING STATUTES

You can use several methods to find both state and federal
statutes:

    1. Use a citation to a statute from a secondary
         source.

    2. Use an index to a state or federal code.

    3. Use a table of contents for a state or federal code.

    4. Use a popular name table, if available.

Most researchers use online sources, so the following
discussion focuses on various online platforms. However,
you can still find print statutory codes in some state,
county, and academic law libraries. Print codes have
index volumes that are located on the shelf at the end of
the volume series.

State Statutes

Most states publish their codes on a government website.
For example, in Oregon, you can find the Oregon Revised
Statutes on the Oregon Legislature's website. From the
home page of that website, you choose the Bills and Laws
tab, then select the latest version of the Oregon Revised
Statutes.

Once you have located the statutory code, if you have a
citation from a colleague or from a secondary source, you
can use that citation to find the relevant section. If you do
not have a citation, you can

60 MEGAN AUSTIN
      browse an index, if available;
      look at the table of contents;
      or search using key terms.

Use the Index

Not all freely available government websites publish an
index to their statutory code, but many do. For example,
the Oregon Revised Statutes on the Oregon Legislature's
website provides an index.pdf to the statutes. To use the
index, think about the search terms you generated at the
beginning of your research process and navigate through
the index to check for those terms. The index often will
refer you to another similar word or issue. The index
term will refer you to a statute section or sections.

Use the Table of Contents

A table of contents is a list of titles, sections, or parts of
the code. It usually appears at the beginning of the code.
Browsing a table of contents may lead you to a part of
the statutory code that is relevant to your legal issue, then
you can look at the individual statutory sections more
carefully to see if they apply to your problem.

Search with Key Terms

Most government websites will have a search box where
you can enter key terms. Often this method is quicker
than scanning a Table of Contents. However, you will
need to sift through several results to decide which are
applicable to your legal issue.

                         ADVANCED LEGAL RESEARCH: PROCESS AND PRACTICE 61
Other Places to Find State Statutes

In addition to state government websites, you can find
statutes on Lexis, Westlaw, and Bloomberg. Westlaw
provides indexes to state statutory codes. Lexis, in
contrast, provides indexes for only some of the state
codes. Bloomberg provides access to state codes, but not
to indexes.

Practice Example:

In this example, you will practice using an index and a key
word search to find Oregon statutes on brewery licensing
issues on the Oregon Legislature's website.

The following video will demonstrate using an index and
key word search on the Oregon Legislature's website.

                     One or more interactive elements has been
                     excluded from this version of the text. You can
         view them online here: https://opentext.uoregon.edu/
         legal/?p=43#oembed-1

Federal statutes

Federal statutes are codified in the United States Code
(U.S.C.). You can find the official version of the United
States Code on the Government Printing Office website.
Also, the Legal Information Institute (LII) at Cornell Law
School publishes the United States Code. On Westlaw,
you will find the United States Code Annotated (USCA);

62 MEGAN AUSTIN
on Lexis, the United States Code Service (USCS); and on
Bloomberg, the United States Code.

Once you have located the United States Code, if you
have a citation from a colleague or from a secondary
source, you can use that citation to find the relevant
section. If you do not have a citation, you can

      browse an index, if available;
      look at the table of contents;
      use a popular name table;
      or search using key terms.

Use the Table of Contents

You can browse a Table of Contents to the U.S.C. on the
GPO website, the LII website, and on Westlaw, Lexis, and
Bloomberg.

Use the Index

Westlaw and Lexis both provide an index; however, on
Lexis, the index is more challenging to find. On Lexis, you
need to type "USCS index" into the "search sources" box.
Bloomberg does not have an index to the United States
Code.

Use the Popular Name Table

A Popular Name Table allows you to search for a federal
law when you do not have a citation, but have a popular
name for the law, such as the Affordable Care Act.
Westlaw, Lexis, and Bloomberg provide access to a
Popular Name Table. LII has a Table of Popular Names

                         ADVANCED LEGAL RESEARCH: PROCESS AND PRACTICE 63
that is located under the heading "Original Content" on
the website.

Search by Key Term

The Government Printing Office website allows you to
term-search in the titles. Of course, Westlaw, Lexis, and
Bloomberg allow sophisticated searching with your key
terms.

USING STATUTES EFFECTIVELY

Once you find a relevant statute, the work is not over.
To use statutes effectively in your research you need to
complete the following steps:

    1. Read and analyze the statutory language carefully;
    2. Look at surrounding sections; and
    3. Use the statutory annotations to find case law and

         other resources.

Read and Analyze the Statutory Language

First, you need to read the statute carefully and analyze
the language and how it applies to your problem. Take
note of words in statutes that might have more than one
meaning. Also, identify whether the statute lists elements
of a cause of action or mentions factors to be considered
in determining if a claim exists. Elements are a list of
things that are required to prove a claim or constitute
a crime. In contrast, factors are examples of things that
may be considered in determining whether a plaintiff has
stated a claim.

64 MEGAN AUSTIN
Look at Surrounding Sections

Often, other sections surrounding the relevant statutory
section you found will help clarify words, provide
context, or identify other legal principles that affect your
problem. For example, a definitions section of a statute
may help guide your interpretation and application of
certain words. Other sections might identify an
administrative agency that issues rules applicable to your
problem or specify damages or penalties.

Use Statutory Annotations to Find Case Law Interpreting the
Statute

What are annotations?

Annotations are short summaries of cases interpreting
and applying the statute. They provide an efficient entry
point to case law research.

Where do you find annotations?

Some states provide annotations to statutory codes on
freely available government websites. For example, the
Oregon Legislature's website provides annotations to the
Oregon Revised Statutes.

Both Westlaw and Lexis provide annotations for state
and federal statutes. For example, on Westlaw, you can
browse and search Notes of Decisions, which are
synopses of cases selected by Westlaw editors as examples
of cases that apply and interpret the statute. Similarly,
Lexis provides Notes to Decisions.

The Notes of Decisions (Westlaw) and Notes to Decisions
(Lexis) are driven by citator services. Citators are

                         ADVANCED LEGAL RESEARCH: PROCESS AND PRACTICE 65
important tools for two main purposes: (1) to make sure
that your source is still good law; and (2) to expand your
research to ensure you have found all relevant sources.
On Westlaw, the citator service KeyCite allows you to
see Notes of Decisions, Citing References, History, and
Context and Analysis. Lexis, with citator Shepards,
provides Citing Decisions, History, and Other Citing
Sources.

Difference between Notes of Decisions and Citing References:

On Westlaw, Notes of Decisions are case synopses that
are collected by Westlaw editors as examples of cases
applying and interpreting the statute. Consequently, the
Notes of Decisions are not all the cases that cite the
statute. In contrast, Citing References is a machine
algorithm that collects all the cases (and other sources)
that cite the statute.

Difference between Notes to Decisions and Citing Decisions:

On Lexis, Notes to Decisions are cases synopses that are
collected by Lexis editors as examples of cases applying
and interpreting the statute. Consequently the Notes to
Decisions are not all the cases that cite the statute. In
contrast, Citing Decisions is a machine algorithm that
collects all the cases that cite the statute. Other Citing
Sources collects all other sources that cite to the statute.

Annotated Codes in Print

Many state, county, and academic libraries have
annotated state and federal codes in print. For example,
the West Oregon Revised Statutes Annotated is an
annotated print code in Oregon. Federal annotated print

66 MEGAN AUSTIN
codes are the United States Code Annotated and the
United States Code Service.

LOCAL LAW (ORDINANCES)

What is local law?

When you are researching local law, you likely will be
doing one of the following tasks:

      Researching the power grants from the
         constitution or statute to a particular city or
         county;

      Determining what law controls in relation to the
         law of the state, county, city, or other government
         unit;

      Identifying a particular city or county law; or

      Uncovering court decisions about any of the
         above issues.

Local law is the law of cities, counties, school districts,
and special service districts such as water, fire, and
hospitals. Another term used for city and county law is
municipal law. When you are looking for municipal or
local law, you will mainly be concerned with county and
city laws called ordinances.

Counties are the largest territorial division for local
government within states. They provide a range of public
services such as public health, criminal prosecution,
airports, parks, libraries, land use planning, refuse
disposal, elections, air pollution control, economic
development, public housing, animal control, among
others.

                         ADVANCED LEGAL RESEARCH: PROCESS AND PRACTICE 67
City governments are formed by state constitutions and
statutes, and their powers are expressed through charters
and ordinances. They usually provide fire and police
protection, street maintenance, building permits, parks
and recreation, land use planning, and other social
services.

What is Home Rule?

Home rule is granted by state constitution or statute and
allocates some power to cities and counties to govern
themselves, subject to state and federal constitutions.
Home rule is expressed in a charter. Not all states are
home rule states. For states that do not follow the home
rule doctrine, they are under Dillon's Rule, which
provides that municipalities have only the powers given
to them explicitly by the state. For more information on
the Home Rule Doctrine, consult the National League of
Cities website.pdf.

How do you find local law?

City and county websites provide links to city and county
ordinances, codified in city and county codes. Sometimes
you can find codes in print; however, the best way to
find the most updated local codes is through internet
searching. City and county websites are less sophisticated
than state and federal websites, so access points will be
limited to tables of contents and simple keyword
searching. City and county websites also may have other
information, besides codes, helpful to your research, so
make sure to explore and search websites thoroughly.

Finally, if you are looking for case law that interprets
or applies county or city ordinances, you can use the

68 MEGAN AUSTIN
ordinance section number as one of your key terms in
case law searches.

Practice Example:

In this example, you will use the City of Eugene website
to find any ordinances on licensed premises for beer
brewing.

The following video will demonstrate how to use the City
of Eugene website to find ordinances and other
information.

                     One or more interactive elements has been

SUGGESTED ACTIVITY
For one of the aspects of the client's problem, students
should use different methods of finding statutes. For
example, one group should use an index, one group
should use term searching on a free website, one group
should use term searching on a subscription platform.
Students can then discuss the process and results with
the whole class. This activity can be completed using an
online discussion board or in-class group work and class
discussion.

FINDING AND USING CASE LAW

LEARNING GOALS

After reading this chapter, you will be able to

    1. Identify and use many search techniques to find
         relevant case law.

    2. Identify and use free, non-subscription platforms
         to find relevant case law.

    3. Conduct case law research more confidently and
         efficiently.

WHERE DO YOU FIND CASES?

Most people conduct case law research online. Several
websites provide free access to case law: Google Scholar,
state and federal court websites, Library of Congress
(only United States Reports), the Government Printing
Office website (federal court opinions), Findlaw, Justia,
and Caselaw Access Project. Fastcase is available through
some state law libraries (i.e. the State of Oregon Law
Library website) and with state Bar Association
membership. Keep in mind that freely available websites
and platforms will have few or no tools to help with
searching, and some provide cases only from certain
jurisdictions or for certain date ranges.

                         ADVANCED LEGAL RESEARCH: PROCESS AND PRACTICE 71
Commercial platforms such as Casetext, Westlaw, Lexis,
and Bloomberg will provide more editorial
enhancements to increase your efficiency and
effectiveness in finding results.

A note about print sources

Some academic and public law libraries still have case
reporters in print. Case reporters are multi-volume sets
that publish case law for different jurisdictions. Each state
has reporters for their courts. Regional reporters publish
cases for states in a certain geographic region. For
example, the Pacific Reporter series publishes state cases
from Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii,
Idaho, Kansas, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico,
Oklahoma, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming.

Federal cases are published in West's Federal Supplement
(U.S. District Court), West's Federal Reporter (Federal
Court of Appeals), West's Supreme Court Reporter (U.S.
Supreme Court decisions), Lexis's United States Supreme
Court Reports, Lawyers' ed. (U.S. Supreme Court
decisions), and United States Reports (official version of
U.S. Supreme Court decisions). The citations you see for
cases refer to the volume number, the reporter name, the
page number, the court and date of the decision.

HOW DO YOU FIND CASES?

Finding case law is an important part of your research
process for most legal issues. You probably practiced case
law research frequently in first year legal research and
writing courses. However, most students feel that they
need additional practice because they want more

72 MEGAN AUSTIN
confidence in their results and more efficiency in their
searches. This chapter will focus on practicing different
methods of finding cases:

      Using secondary sources.

      Using statutory annotations.

      Using one good case.

      Using an index (West's Topic and Key Number
         system, Lexis's Case Notes system).

      Using natural language and terms and connectors
         (Boolean) searching.

Using Secondary Sources

Chapter 9 discusses different types of secondary sources
and how to use them to learn background information
about your legal issue and find primary sources of law.
To reiterate, when you are starting your research and
reading secondary sources, you might come across
citations to cases important to that legal topic or issue.
You might have noted some cases at that point; but if not,
you can circle back to secondary sources to find citations
to cases that seem important now that you know a bit
more about your issue.

Use Statutory Annotations

If you found an important statute in your research, you
probably looked at the annotations to the statute to start
finding cases. (See Chapter 10).

Use One Good Case

If you found a citation to a relevant case in a secondary

                         ADVANCED LEGAL RESEARCH: PROCESS AND PRACTICE 73
source or a statute, you can use that case to find other
cases. There are several ways to use a good case to find
more cases:

    1. Look at the cases cited in the good case.
    2. On Westlaw or Lexis, use the headnote tools in

         the good case to find other cases.
    3. On Westlaw or Lexis, use the citators (Key Cite

         and Shepards) in the good case to find other cases.
    4. On Google Scholar, use the Cited By and How

         Cited links to find other cases.

Practice Activity

For the trademark issue, use google scholar to find any
relevant cases. Compare your results to the cases you find
on a subscription platform such as Westlaw or Lexis.

Use an Index

Westlaw and Lexis have indexing systems that allow you
to use legal topics and sub-topics to find cases. On
Westlaw, the Topic and Key Number system indexes all
U.S. case law; on Lexis, the Topics system provides that
service.

You can use the index in a few ways:

    1. In a case headnote, look at the corresponding
         index terms or Key Numbers and click on the
         links to find other cases categorized under that
         index term or number.

    2. On Westlaw, find Key Numbers under the
         Content Types tab and either browse or term

74 MEGAN AUSTIN
         search in that list of Key Numbers.
    3. On Lexis, find the Topics tab and search or

         browse.
    4. Use the Key Number or Topic as a search term

         when you are doing Boolean searching (see below
         discussion of Boolean searching).

Use Natural Language and Boolean Searching

Most students are adept at using natural language to
search for cases. An example of a natural language search
is what constitutes trademark infringement on a beer label?
Search algorithms have improved, so most platforms you
use for searching will produce relevant results. However,
most law librarians and legal research and writing
professors will advise you to use multiple methods and
tools to ensure that your results are both thorough and
accurate. In this section, you will learn more about using
terms and connectors (also called Boolean language) to
search effectively for cases. Boolean searching may seem
time-consuming and awkward at first, but with practice,
it will become easier.

Boolean Searching

When you encounter a website or research platform, look
for a "search help" link, which will inform you of search
language and other search tips for that platform.
Although the connectors will vary in meaning based on
the website or platform you are using, the following are
some common terms and connectors:

                         ADVANCED LEGAL RESEARCH: PROCESS AND PRACTICE 75
Boolean connector  Example                      Meaning
OR                 house OR residence
AND                emotional AND physical       alternative terms
"..."              "emotional distress"
(...)              frisk! OR (search /s seiz!)  both terms must be in results
!                  seiz!

FINDING AND USING ADMINISTRATIVE
LAW

LEARNING GOALS
After reading this chapter, you will be able to

    1. Explain the relationship of administrative law to
         statutory law.

    2. Name examples of federal and state
         administrative agencies.

    3. Identify and explain administrative law sources.
    4. Find agency rules/regulations on free websites

         and commercial platforms.
    5. Find agency decisions and guidance on free

         websites and commercial platforms.
Most law students do not have much time or opportunity
to research administrative law during first year legal
research and writing courses. The first part of this
chapter will explain how administrative law fits into the
legal research landscape. The next part will discuss
administrative law resources and where to find them.

78 MEGAN AUSTIN
WHAT IS ADMINISTRATIVE LAW?

Overview

Administrative law (both federal and state) is the law
governing the creation and operation of administrative
agencies. Most administrative agencies (including boards,
commissions, and departments) are part of the executive
branch of government. Legislatures establish agencies
and give them their powers through enabling statutes.
Some state agencies are established through the state
constitution. Thorough and accurate legal research
requires you to find, read, and analyze administrative
rules and decisions because they are primary sources of
law, just like statutes and cases.

Sources of Administrative Law

Agencies promulgate rules (also called regulations) that
administer, implement, apply, and interpret statutes in
the agencies' jurisdiction. Agencies also conduct
investigations and inspections to determine if regulations
are being followed, and issue licenses and permits. Also,
agencies, via administrative law judges, hold hearings and
decide cases involving the agencies' rules. Therefore,
when you are searching for relevant administrative law,
you will be looking for enabling legislation, agency rules/
regulations, agency guidance like interpretive opinions
or procedural manuals, administrative decisions, and
possibly federal court decisions reviewing agency actions
or decisions.

You can find a list of all federal administrative agencies
on the Federal Register website. As you can see from this
sampling, administrative rules touch every part of our
lives.

State (Oregon)

Below is a sampling of state agencies in Oregon. You can
find a full list of Oregon administrative agencies on the
State of Oregon's website.

      Oregon Department of Agriculture
      Board of Cosmetology
      Criminal Justice Commission
      Oregon Department of Education
      Employment Department
      Department of Energy

      Office of Public Defense Services
      Public Utility Commission of Oregon

82 MEGAN AUSTIN
      Oregon Secretary of State
      Oregon Department of Veterans' Affairs

You can find agencies for any state, usually by looking
at the state website. For example, in California, the state
website lists their administrative agencies. Similarly, the
Washington state website has an agency directory page.

WHERE DO YOU FIND ADMINISTRATIVE LAW?

Federal

Administrative Procedure Act

The Administrative Procedure Act (APA), Title 5 U.S.C.
 551 et seq., governs agencies' rulemaking procedures,
addresses agencies' issuance of licenses and permits, and
sets out standards for judicial review of agency actions.
The APA may be an important part of your research if
the issue involves a challenge to the scope of the agency's
authority to take a specific action.

Enabling Statutes

An enabling statute establishes the powers and
responsibilities of a government agency. For example,
Congress established the United States Patent and
Trademark Office (USPTO) by passing Title 35 U.S.C. 
1.pdf. Title 35 U.S.C.  2 outlines the powers and duties
of the agency and  3 designates officers and employees
of the agency. You find enabling statutes by searching the
sections of a Title that governs your legal issue, or by
using a table of contents for the United States Code.

                         ADVANCED LEGAL RESEARCH: PROCESS AND PRACTICE 83
Rules

Agencies issue rules just like legislatures pass statutes.
However, rules are subordinate to statutes in that they
implement, interpret, and prescribe the statutory law.
Administrative agencies have more expertise than the
legislature in the subject matter, so they are able to
provide more details and set particular standards for
implementation of a more general statutory law. An
agency rule is defined as

        "the whole or part of an agency statement of
        general or particular applicability and future effect
        designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law
        or policy or describing the organization,
        procedure, or practice requirements of an agency
        and includes the approval or prescription for the
        future of rates, wages, corporate or financial
        structures or reorganizations thereof, prices,
        facilities, appliances, services or allowances
        therefor or of valuations, costs, or accounting, or
        practices bearing on any of the foregoing."

5 U.S.C.  551(4).

A Proposed Rule (Notice of Proposed Rulemaking) is
published in the Federal Register for public comment.
Citations to proposed rules will have a Federal Register
citation such as, 88 FR 33968. After the comment period,
the agency will finalize the rule and then publish the final
rule in the Federal Register, with an effective date and
notice of the changes that the new rule makes to the Code
of Federal Regulations. The new rule is then integrated
into the e-CFR, which is an unofficial but authoritative

84 MEGAN AUSTIN
compilation published by the Office of the Federal
Register and the Government Printing Office. The
official edition of the CFR is published annually; each of
the 50 subject matter titles are re-published each year on
a staggered, quarterly basis. Once a final rule is codified
into the CFR, it will have a citation such as 10 CFR 431.

For more detailed information on rulemaking, please
consult A Guide to the Rulemaking Process.pdf, prepared
by the Office of the Federal Register.

In addition to using government databases such as the
Government Printing Office (govinfo.gov),
federalregister.gov, e-CFR, and agency websites, you can
find federal regulations, both the Federal Register and
the Code of Federal Regulations, on Westlaw, Lexis, and
Bloomberg.

Agency Decisions

Pursuant to the APA, agencies have some quasi-judicial
powers to adjudicate matters having to do with
enforcement of their rules. For example, the United States
Patent and Trademark Office uses its Trademark Trial
and Appeal Board (TTAB) to handle appeals involving
applications to register trademarks, appeals from
expungement proceedings involving registrations of
trademarks, and trials involving applications or
registrations of trademarks. You can find TTAB decisions
on the USPTO website.

You can find some agency decisions on Westlaw, Lexis,
and Bloomberg as well.

On Westlaw, navigate to federal materials, then select the

                         ADVANCED LEGAL RESEARCH: PROCESS AND PRACTICE 85
Federal Administrative Decisions & Guidance link.
Westlaw provides access to some, but not all decisions
from executive branch or independent agencies and
offices.

On Lexis, choose the "federal" tab, then select federal
administrative materials. Lexis provides access to various
types of administrative information such as decisions,
directives, memoranda, papers, and news releases for
executive branch and independent agencies.

Bloomberg has multiple access points for U.S.
government agency information. For example, you can
look at All Legal Content or search in topical practice
centers.

Agency Guidance

In addition to rules and formal adjudications, agencies
also produce guidance documents in the form of
procedural manuals, advisory opinions and notices,
handbooks, etc. These types of guidance documents are
most likely found on agency websites. For example, the
USPTO website provides a link to guidance documents
under the "Learning and Resources" tab.

As discussed above, the commercial platforms provide
variable access to agency guidance documents for several
agencies.

Court Decisions Reviewing Agency Actions

To find court decisions reviewing agency decisions or
other actions, you will use the case finding strategies and
tools discussed in Chapter 11.

86 MEGAN AUSTIN
Practice Example:

In this example, you will search the Alcohol and Tobacco
Tax and Trade Bureau website for administrative
information on beer brewing.

The following video will demonstrate searching the
Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau website for
relevant primary and secondary sources.

                     One or more interactive elements has been
                     excluded from this version of the text. You can

         legal/?p=47#oembed-1

State (Oregon example)

Researching state administrative law is similar to
researching federal administrative law. You may want to
look for the state's Administrative Procedure Act, as well
as the enabling legislation for the agency involved in your
legal problem if the agency's authority is in question. The
main sources of state administrative law are rules, agency
decisions, and agency guidance. Each state maintains a
government website providing access to administrative
rules and other information. For example, California's
Office of Administrative Law website provides access to
the California administrative rules, information on the
rulemaking process, publications and forms, as well as

                         ADVANCED LEGAL RESEARCH: PROCESS AND PRACTICE 87
an agency index. In Washington, the state legislature's
website links to the Washington Administrative Code and
the State Register. In Oregon, the Secretary of State
website links to the Oregon Administrative Rules and
some historical administrative orders and rule
compilations. In addition, state agencies host websites
with useful information such as relevant rules, decisions,
practical guidance, current awareness tools, and other
resources. The following sections will highlight sources
of administrative law from Oregon as an example.

Oregon Administrative Procedure Act

Oregon's Administrative Procedure Act, ORS 183.310,
defines powers, responsibilities, and procedures for state
administrative agencies.

Enabling Statutes

When you are doing statutory research (see Chapter 10),
you should look at surrounding sections to find laws
giving powers and responsibilities to a particular agency.
You should also use statutory annotations to find cases
interpreting and applying those statutory sections. For
example, if you were looking at the Oregon Revised
Statutes for laws on alcohol, you would look in Chapter
471. In Chapter 471, you will find 471.705 et seq. which
establishes the Oregon Liquor and Cannabis Commission
and defines its regulatory powers and procedures.

Rules

Free Government Websites

The best method for accessing Oregon Administrative
Rules is to use the Oregon Administrative Rules Database

88 MEGAN AUSTIN
(OARD) on the Secretary of State's website. The OARD is
continuously updated as rules are approved and received.
The database allows you to browse through current rules
using chapter numbers, chapter names, rule numbers, or
rule text. You can also use the OARD to access the Oregon
Bulletin, a monthly online publication containing Notices
of Proposed Rulemaking, Permanent and Temporary
Administrative Rule filings, rule text, and Minor
Correction filings, as well as Annual Compilations of
rules.

For example, you may be looking for rules from the
Oregon Liquor and Cannabis Commission (OLCC). First,
go to the Secretary of State website and link to the OARD.
If you do not have a rule number citation, you can browse
by Chapter name to find the Oregon Liquor and
Cannabis Commission, Chapter 845. If you are looking
for a rule addressing a specific issue, you might choose to
search by text of the rule. If you are wondering whether
a brewer can brew beer using cannabis, for example, you
might conduct a search using the terms cannabis and
beer.

Depending on when the rule was last updated, you would
look at the Oregon Bulletin to see if there are any
proposed new rules or corrections. For example, if the
rule you found was last updated in February 2023, you
would look at the Bulletins for March, April, and May
2023 for any changes or corrections to make sure you are
looking at the most recent rule language.

                         ADVANCED LEGAL RESEARCH: PROCESS AND PRACTICE 89
Commercial Databases

Westlaw, Lexis, and Bloomberg provide access to state
administrative information.

Westlaw has databases containing Oregon Regulations as
well as Administrative Decisions and Guidance. The
decisions and guidance database covers a limited number
of agencies: Attorney General Opinions, Bureau of Labor
& Industries Decisions, Division of Financial Regulation
Decisions, Employment Relations Board Decisions,
Environmental Administrative Decisions, Insurance
Bulletins, Land Use Board of Appeals Decisions, Legal
Ethics Opinions, Public Utility Commission Decisions,
and Workers Compensation Administrative Decisions.

On Lexis, you can access Oregon Administrative Codes
and Regulations, the Oregon Bulletin, as well as select
Oregon administrative materials such as decisions and
guidance: Oregon Insurance Bulletin & Notices, Attorney
General Opinions, Department of Commerce, Corporate
Division Materials, Department of Environmental
Quality, Government Ethics Commission Final
Dispositions, Public Utility Commission Decisions,
Workers' Compensation Decisions, Bureau of Labor and
Industries, Employment Relations Board Decisions,
Market Conduct Examinations, and Land Use Board of
Appeals.

Bloomberg has databases of state codified regulations as
well as proposed rules.

Agency Decisions and Guidance

As explained above, Westlaw and Lexis allow you to

90 MEGAN AUSTIN
access select agency decisions and guidance. However,
you can find an abundance of helpful information
including decisions and guidance, reports, forms,
publications, news, licensing and permitting information,
etc. on agency websites. For example, the OLCC website
provides extensive information on Alcohol Licensing and
Permits with links to applications, forms, educational
resources, rules, and compliance materials.

Practice Example:

In this example, you will practice searching the Oregon
Liquor and Cannabis Commission (OLCC) website for
primary law and other information on beer brewing.

The following video will demonstrate finding sources on
the OLCC website.

                     One or more interactive elements has been
                     excluded from this version of the text. You can

FINDING AND USING LEGISLATIVE HISTORY

Legislative history research (both federal and state) is
another topic that first year research and writing courses
do not cover in a comprehensive way. This chapter will
explain the reasons you might research legislative history,
sources (documents) of legislative history, legislative
process, and where to find legislative history documents.
LEARNING GOALS
After reading this chapter, you will be able to

    1. Explain federal and state legislative process.
    2. Identify a variety of free and subscription

         resources to find legislative history materials.
    3. Locate relevant documents to determine the

         legislative intent or goals of enacted legislation.
    4. Explain the legislative history information in the

         context of the client scenario.
WHY RESEARCH LEGISLATIVE HISTORY?
Legislative history research might come up in the context
of academic writing. However, in practice, there are a
couple of common types of legislative research you might
need to do: bill tracking and researching the "legislative

                         ADVANCED LEGAL RESEARCH: PROCESS AND PRACTICE 93
intent" underlying a statute to help with statutory
interpretation.

WHAT IS LEGISLATIVE HISTORY?

Legislative history is a secondary source consisting of bill
versions, documents, reports, transcripts of testimony,
debates, and statements that lead up to the passage of a
law which is then codified as a statute. Legislative history
material is produced in the framework of the legislative
process.

LEGISLATIVE PROCESS

Put simply, legislative process is the procedure by which
a proposed law becomes a law. The process is similar in
both federal and state government. Below is a general
overview of the legislative process:

    1. A bill is proposed or introduced.

    2. The bill is assigned to a committee.

    3. If the bill is released from the committee, it goes
         to the chamber (i.e. House or Senate) floor for
         debate, amendment, or vote.

    4. If the bill passes that chamber, it goes to the other
         chamber.

    5. The other chamber assigns the bill to a committee
         and if released, goes to debate and vote.

    6. If the other chamber makes changes, the bill must
         return to the original chamber for concurrence.

    7. The bill will go to conference committee to
         resolve differences and issue a report outlining the

94 MEGAN AUSTIN
         final version.

    8. After the bill has been passed in identical form by
         both chambers of congress, it is an "enrolled" bill
         that goes to the President (or State Governor) for
         signature or veto.

Helpful resources on federal legislative process:

website, whitehouse.gov, the House of Representatives
website, house.gov; Congressional Research Service

Become Law on the Oregon Legislature's website,
Overview of California Legislative Process on the
California State Association of Counties website.pdf,
Overview of the Legislative Process on the Washington
Legislature's website, Legislative Process on the National
Conference of State Legislatures website.

SOURCES OF LEGISLATIVE HISTORY

Each step of the legislative process produces documents,
which are the sources of legislative history you are
looking for when you conduct research.

Federal

    1. Preliminary documents - before a bill is even
         proposed, a committee might conduct studies or
         hear testimony by experts resulting in committee
         prints, bibliographies, analysis, or reports from
         the Congressional Research Service, the
         Congressional Budget Office, or the Government

                         ADVANCED LEGAL RESEARCH: PROCESS AND PRACTICE 95
         Accountability Office;
    2. Bill - versions of the bill;
    3. Committee - Committee Reports;
    4. Chamber Floor - Floor debates and votes;
    5. Conference Committee - Conference reports;
    6. President - signing statement or veto statement.

State (Oregon example)

    1. Bill - versions of the bill;
    2. Committee minutes, recordings, and exhibits for

         committee hearings and work sessions;
    3. Recordings of floor proceedings and submitted

         testimony;
    4. House and Senate journals that show votes.

HOW DO YOU FIND LEGISLATIVE HISTORY?

This section will explain how to find legislative sources
for different types of legislative history research in the
federal system and in the state system.

Bill Tracking

Bill tracking is searching for a bill that is relevant to a
client's issue and following the bill as it moves through
the legislative process. You can (1) search by bill number;
(2) search for a bill using search terms; and (3) search for
bills affecting a statute if you have a statutory citation
(some platforms).

96 MEGAN AUSTIN
Federal

You can track federal bills on the official congressional
website, Congress.gov; the GovTrack website,
govtrack.us; or Westlaw and Lexis.

Congressional Website

On Congress.gov, toward the top of the page you will
find the menu entitled "Bill Searches and Lists." Select
the "Introduced" link to see a list of bills introduced in
the current session, with tracking information. You also
can search legislation by entering a bill number or other
information in the main search bar, and then selecting
the "actions" tab in the result to see the bill's movement
through Congress. You can subscribe to various types of
alerts to get notifications about congressional actions.

GovTrack Website

On GovTrack, you can find bills by topic or you can select
the "Search" icon to use an advanced search template to
find bills by title, congressional session, sponsor, status,
or chamber (House or Senate). You can select the "Get
Alerts" icon to subscribe to various types of alerts for
legislation and legislative actions.

Westlaw and Lexis

On Westlaw, under the "Content Types" tab, select
"Proposed and Enacted Legislation" and then the
"Federal" link. On the right side of the page are "Tools and
Resources" including Bill Tracking, CRS (Congressional
Research Service) Bill Summaries, and Historical
Proposed Legislation. If you have a statute citation and
you want to determine if any bills affect that statute, you

                         ADVANCED LEGAL RESEARCH: PROCESS AND PRACTICE 97
will see a yellow flag icon when looking at the relevant
statutory section. If you select the icon, you will see the
proposed or pending legislation that affects that statute.

On Lexis, under the "Content" tab, select "Statutes and
Legislation," then "Bill Tracking." In the "Federal"
category, you will see "Bill Tracking Reports" for the
current congress as well as previous congressional
sessions. By selecting the "Bill Tracking Reports" link,
you will be able to search by various methods including
title, citation, date, and search terms. If you have a statute
citation and you want to determine if any bills affect that
statute, you will see a yellow triangle icon when looking
at the relevant statutory section. If you select the icon,
you will see the proposed or pending legislation that
affects that statute.

State (Oregon example)

You can track bills by using the Oregon Legislative
Information Service website, using The Oregonian bill
tracking service at https://gov.oregonlive.com/bill/, or
using Westlaw or Lexis.

Steps for bill tracking by bill number:

    1. On the Oregon Legislative Information Service
         (OLIS) website, first select the "Session" icon in
         the top right-hand corner of the page to select the
         current congressional session.

    2. Select the "Bills" icon in the top right-hand corner
         of the page and enter your bill number in the
         search box. HB signifies a House Bill. SB signifies
         a Senate Bill.

98 MEGAN AUSTIN
    3. The result will be a page that provides an
         overview of the bill, as well as tabs across the top
         where you can access the text of the bill, analysis,
         and amendments. Beneath the overview, you can
         access "Measure History," a schedule of the bill's
         path through the legislative process, with links to
         recordings of public hearings and work sessions.

The Oregonian bill tracking allows you to enter a bill
number or search by terms to access a bill overview,
measure text, and amendments.

Steps for bill tracking by search terms:

    1. On the OLIS website, select the "Session" icon and
         choose the current session.

    2. Select the "Bills" icon then choose the "Bill Text"
         tab and enter your search term in the search text
         box.

    3. The results of the search are bills that contain
         those terms. If you click on a result, you will see a
         bill overview.

You can use Westlaw or Lexis for bill tracking by search
terms. On Westlaw, in "Content Types," choose the
"Proposed and Enacted Legislation" database. You can
choose a particular state and then look at the right side
of the page to find available "Tools and Resources," such
as Bill Tracking, Historical Session Laws and Bills, and
Legislative History. If you choose the "Bill Tracking"
resource, for example, you can enter search terms in the
search bar at the top of the page to find bills containing
those search terms. If you select a result, you will see a
summary of the bill as well as the bill activity. On Lexis,

                         ADVANCED LEGAL RESEARCH: PROCESS AND PRACTICE 99
navigate to the "State" tab and select a state. Under the
"Statutes and Legislation" heading, you will see a link
for "Bill Tracking Reports" which will provide a search
template for multiple ways to search.

Bill tracking using an Oregon Revised Statutes citation

If you know of a statute that affects your client, but you
need to research if there are any bills that will affect that
statute, you can use the OLIS website, the Oregon
Legislature's website, or Westlaw and Lexis to find that
information.

On the OLIS website:

    1. Select the "Session" icon on the top right side of
         the page to choose the current session.

    2. Select the "More" icon on the top right side of the
         page and then select "Reports and Documents."

    3. Select "Daily and Cumulative Publications" and
         then select the arrow next to the "Cumulative
         Publications" heading.

    4. Select the "Statutes Affected by Measures" link.

    5. You can look through the table using your
         statutory section number to see the bill number, if
         any, that affects your statute.

On the Oregon Legislature's website:

    1. Select the "Bills and Laws" tab.

    2. On the left side of the page, you will see a menu.
         Under the "Session Information" heading, select
         "Session Publications." This will link you back to
         the OLIS page referenced above. Select the

100 MEGAN AUSTIN
         "Statutes Affected by Measures" link.

Lexis and Westlaw

The citator services on Lexis and Westlaw alert you to
bills that affect your statutory section. On Lexis, when
you are looking at a relevant statutory section, there will
be a yellow triangle icon to indicate proposed or pending
legislation. If you select the yellow triangle icon, you will
see the bill and the other legislative tracking information.
On Westlaw, a yellow flag appears next to the statutory
section to indicated pending or proposed legislation.
Selecting the icon will take you to the bill and other
legislative information.

Legislative Intent

A common research scenario is that a statute relevant
to your legal problem contains ambiguous or unclear
language and you need to find information to help with
statutory interpretation. If you are interpreting a statute,
you would first use primary sources such as a definitions
section in the statute, case law, and administrative
regulations and decisions. If you cannot fully answer the
ambiguity with those primary sources, you look at
secondary sources such as legislative history and legal
treatises. This section explains the process and sources
when researching legislative history for statutory
interpretation.

This type of legislative history research works backward,
starting with a codified statute to find a session law
chapter, then a bill, and the documents produced through
the legislative process.

                       ADVANCED LEGAL RESEARCH: PROCESS AND PRACTICE 101
Federal Legislative History Research

The most important documents for statutory
interpretation of a federal statute are committee reports,
versions of the bill, and congressional debates.

Sources of Federal Legislative History

Committee and Conference Reports

Congressional committee reports and conference
committee reports are considered to be the most
important sources for statutory interpretation.
Committee reports come from each of the House and
Senate committees that considered the legislation.
Reports provide the text of the bill, explain the purposes
of the bill, and analyze the bill section by section.

Conference committees are appointed to draft a
compromise bill if the House and Senate versions of the
bill are different. Conference Reports are considered to
be very useful because they come at the end of the
legislative process and report on the compromise bill text.

Bill Versions

The introduction of a bill usually begins the legislative
process. Bills are often amended several times during the
legislative process so comparing versions of the bill may
help with statutory interpretation based on changes or
deletions of language in the law.

Congressional Debates

Congressional debates include discussions and
explanations of bills and amendments. Transcripts of
proceedings and debates, which are not verbatim

102 MEGAN AUSTIN
transcripts, are published in the Congressional Record.
The Congressional Record is published in a daily edition,
which is published every day Congress is in session, and a
bound edition, published years after the daily edition. The
page numbers in the daily edition and the bound edition
are different. Usually, you will cite to the bound edition
if it is available. HeinOnline, in its U.S. Congressional
Documents database, has a "Congressional Record Daily
to Bound Locator" tool to help you convert Daily Edition
citations to Bound Edition citations.

Other legislative documents

House and Senate committees hold hearings to determine
the need for new legislation and hear the testimony of
individuals and organizations interested in the
legislation. Hearings may provide good background
information on the issue the legislation is addressing but
are not considered to be as important in legislative
history research because they involve the views of
individuals and organizations testifying rather than the
views of Congress.

Research process steps

     1. Find the version of the law when the language at
    issue was introduced. Sometimes laws are amended
    several times, so the version in which the relevant
    language was introduced is most likely to have
    legislative history materials helpful for interpretation.

               a. From the statutory section, scroll to the end
             of the section to find a parenthetical or source
             note that provides citations to the slip law or
             laws that are the source of the statute in its

                       ADVANCED LEGAL RESEARCH: PROCESS AND PRACTICE 103
             current form. The following is an example of a
             parenthetical or source note: (Pub. L. 111-353,
             title III,  306(b), Jan. 4, 2011, 124 Stat. 3959).

               b. You will use the slip law number (Pub.L.
             111-353) to find the bill. The 111 refers to the
             Congressional session, and the 353 means it
             was the three hundred and fifty-third law
             passed in that session. The slip laws are
             compiled at the end of the congressional
             session and published in chronological order
             in the Statutes at Large, which is the other
             citation in the parenthetical: 124 refers the
             volume of the Statutes at Large (abbreviated as
             Stat.) and 3959 refers to the page number of
             the volume where that law starts.

     2. Use the Public Law or Statutes at Large citation to
    find the bill in the following sources: Congress.gov,
    Proquest Congressional, Westlaw, Lexis.

               a. Congress.gov (a free source): Choose the
             Advanced Searches link on the top of the
             screen, then select the correct congressional
             session, and enter the search using the
             suggested citation forms in the "Legislation
             and Law Numbers" search box. For example, if
             you are looking for the bill number associated
             with Pub. L. 111-353, you would check mark
             the box for the 111th Congress, then enter
             111PL353 in the "Legislation and Law
             Number" search box. Your result is H.R. 2751
             FDA Food Safety Modernization Act. H.R.
             stands for House of Representatives, so you
             know it is a House Bill.

104 MEGAN AUSTIN
 b. Proquest Congressional (subscription -
available at some academic and public law
libraries): From the start page, choose "Search
for a Citation," then select "Public Laws" if you
are using a public law citation. Use the drop-
down menu to select the correct congressional
session and enter the law number. You will get
information for the public law, including the
bill number.

 c. Westlaw (subscription): Westlaw will do a
lot of work for you. When you scroll to the end
of a statutory section on Westlaw, you will find
the source note with a hyperlink to the public
law number. When you select that link, you
will get the public law, which also refers to the
bill number. You will see tabs across the top of
the page: Bill Drafts, Legislative History
Materials, and Statutes Affected. The
Legislative History tab will list citations to
reports and the Congressional Record. Keep in
mind that Westlaw may not provide all the
legislative history materials that exist, but
rather, only select documents.

 d. Lexis (subscription): On Lexis, when you
scroll to the source note at the end of the
statute, you will find a hyperlink to the public
law. When you select that link, you will see the
public law, with a reference to the bill number.
On the right side of the screen, you will find
links to Bill Tracking, Bill Text, and CIS
Legislative History. The CIS Legislative
History link provides access to many

   ADVANCED LEGAL RESEARCH: PROCESS AND PRACTICE 105
             legislative history materials.

     3. Use the Bill number to find legislative history
    materials in the following sources:

               a. Congress.gov: When you are looking at the
             relevant bill, you will find an overview, as well
             as tabs that provide a summary, the text of the
             bill, actions taken, titles of the act,
             amendments, sponsors, committees, and
             related bills. In those categories, you will find
             links to other documents.

               b. Proquest Congressional (subscription):
             Once you have the bill number, you can use the
             "Search for a Citation" option, select the
             correct congressional session, and enter your
             bill number in the search box. When you get
             the resulting bill, you will see the following
             tabs where you can access information:
             Overview, Actions, Committees, Sponsors,
             Related publications, and Bill text.

Compiled Legislative History

You can find compiled legislative histories for certain
laws. A compiled legislative history means that someone
has collected all the legislative history documents
associated with a law and put them in one place.
Compiled legislative histories can be found in the
following resources: Legal Histories of Selected U.S. Laws
on the Internet: Free Sources, Proquest Legislative
Insight (subscription), HeinOnline's U.S. Federal
Legislative History Library (subscription with some
public law libraries providing free access), Department of

106 MEGAN AUSTIN
Justice Legislative Histories (free), Westlaw (subscription),
and Lexis (subscription).

On Westlaw, you can find Arnold and Porter Legislative
Histories and U.S. GAO Legislative Histories. From the
Westlaw start screen, click on the Content tab to find
Specialty Areas, then Legislative History. Under the
"Federal" heading you will see a link for U.S. GAO
Legislative Histories. Clicking on that link will allow you
to search by terms or by various citations. To find Arnold
and Porter Legislative Histories, from the Legislative
History link under the Content tab, look at the right side
of the page under "Tools and Resources" and click on the
Arnold and Porter link. You will find a list of acts that
have compiled legislative histories.

On Lexis, under "Content," click on the Statutes and
Legislation link, then under "content type," select
"Legislative Histories" to find several compiled legislative
histories as well as other documents.

On HeinOnline, find the U.S. Federal Legislative History
Library in the list of databases. You can look at the U.S.
Federal Legislative History Title Collection to find a list
of acts that have compiled legislative histories. Or, you
can navigate "Sources of Compiled Legislative Histories"
to find legislative histories by bill number, public law
number, popular name of the public law, or congressional
session.

Proquest Legislative Insight allows you to search for
compiled histories by using several different types of
citations or use the "Advance Search" option to search by
term.

                       ADVANCED LEGAL RESEARCH: PROCESS AND PRACTICE 107
State Legislative History Research (Oregon Example)

The most important legislative history materials in
Oregon are the documents and audio or video recordings
from the committees that consider the bill. You will be
looking for committee minutes or audio and video logs
of the committee hearings and work sessions; audio and
video recordings of hearings and work sessions; exhibits
that were introduced; the original bill file; audio or video
recordings of activities from the chamber floor; and
journals that show votes recorded in the chambers. The
availability and format for these materials, and where you
can find them, depends on the date of the legislative
activity. The next section will discuss the various sources
of Oregon legislative history in greater detail.

For more information on researching state legislative
history, look for a research guide. In your browser, type
Oregon (or whatever the relevant state is) legislative history
research guide. For example, using that type of search, you
will get results such as Oregon Legislative History
Research from the Lewis and Clark Law School,
Legislative History Research from the State of Oregon
Law Library, Oregon Legislative Records Guide from the
Oregon State Archives, or Oregon Legislative History
Research from the University of Oregon. Such guides can
be found for legislative history research in other states as
well.

Sources of Oregon Legislative History

Minutes and Audio and Video Logs

Committee minutes summarize the discussions that take
place in legislative committees. The minute summaries

108 MEGAN AUSTIN
(also known as tape logs) help researchers locate where a
particular topic was discussed on the recordings. You can
find these logs in different places and forms depending on
the year:

2014 - forward: Recording logs located on the Oregon
State Archives website.

2007-2014: Audio logs listing only the speakers name and
the recorded time, with links to mp3 audio files can be
found on the Oregon State Archives website.

1991-2005: Audio logs with links to some audio
recordings can be found on the Oregon State Archives
website.

1926-mid 1990s: Minutes are located on microfilm at
some academic and public law libraries.

Audio and video recordings of committee hearings and work sessions

The Oregon State Archives website has online audio
recordings available for 1999 forward.

Links to archived video and audio recordings from 1999
forward are available on the Oregon Legislature's
website. From the Oregon Legislature's home page, go to
the "Get Involved" tab and then select Audio and Video.
You will find a section for recent archives for sessions
within the last year. On the right side of the page is a
section heading "Expand: View Archives" that links to
audio and video recordings on OLIS back to the
1999-2000 legislative session.

From 2015 - present, you can find online videos with
a log on the same screen on the Oregon Legislature's

                       ADVANCED LEGAL RESEARCH: PROCESS AND PRACTICE 109
website (which links to OLIS) by searching for the bill
number in the correct legislative session, then selecting
the link under "Measure History" and finding the meeting
date and time on the right side of the screen.

Exhibits

Exhibits are submitted by committee staff, legislators, and
the public in response to a proposed bill. They include
letters, proposed amendments, written testimony, and
reports. You can find online exhibits for legislative
sessions 2007 - present on the Oregon Legislature's
website using the session and bill number, and looking
under the Analysis tab.

You can also contact the Oregon State Archives for help
finding older exhibits.

Bill files

Original bill files are located at the Oregon State
Archives. They are files that contain the original measure,
with subsequent engrossed versions of the bill, as well
as committee reports, amendments, and staff measure
analyses. From 2007 to present, you can find some of this
information on the Oregon Legislature's website (which
links to OLIS) using the session and bill number, and
looking under the Text, Analysis, Meeting Material/
Exhibits, and Amendments tabs.

Audio and video recordings of chamber debates

Audio and video recordings of chamber debates are
available on the Oregon Legislature's website for
legislative sessions 1999 forward. From the "Get
Involved" page, go to Audio and Video, and find the View

110 MEGAN AUSTIN
Archives links on the right side of the page. For older
sessions, the Oregon State Archives has audio tapes.

Journals

House and Senate Journals record the actions of the
chambers while they are in session. In the journals you
can find votes, explanations of votes, and messages from
the Governor. Senate journals are available online from
2012 on the Secretary of the Senate web page. House
journals are available online from 2001 on the Chief
Clerk of the House web page.

Research Process Steps

The steps for researching Oregon legislative history are
similar to those discussed above for federal legislative
history.

    1. Locate the relevant Oregon Revised Statutes
         (ORS) section for your problem or issue. (See
         Chapter 10).

    2. From the ORS section, scroll to the end of the
         statute to find the source note which will list the
         session law number. For example, this is the
         source note for ORS 471.175. [1999 c.351 2;
         2001 c.104 213; 2001 c.154 1; 2010 c.33 2;
         2011 c.180 1; 2013 c.32 1; 2019 c.57 27; 2021
         c.180 7; 2021 c.275 3; 2021 c.351 51]. The
         session law is the law that is passed by the
         legislature. The citation 2021 c.275 3 refers to
         the 2021 Session Laws, chapter 275, section 3.

    3. Use the session law to find the bill. Once you have
         a Session Law citation, go to the Oregon

                       ADVANCED LEGAL RESEARCH: PROCESS AND PRACTICE 111
         Legislature's website, and select the Bills and Laws
         tab. On the left side of the page, click on the link
         to Oregon Laws. Select the correct session and
         scroll until you find the correct chapter. Once you
         are looking at the session law, you will see the bill
         number to the right of the chapter number. Using
         the session law referenced above, you would go to
         Oregon Laws, choose the 2021 Session, then scroll
         down to find chapter 275. The bill number to the
         right of chapter 275 is SB 317. SB refers to Senate
         Bill.

    4. Use the bill number to find legislative history
         materials. On the Bills and Laws page of the
         Oregon Legislature's website, find the Bills menu
         on the left side. Select the correction session for
         your bill, then scroll down the results to find your
         bill number. Using the example above, you would
         select 2021 Session Bills, then scroll down the list
         of results to find SB 317. You will see an Overview
         of the bill and tabs to access the Text, Analysis,
         Amendments, etc. If you scroll down, you will find
         Measure History, which you can expand to find
         links to public hearings and work sessions.

    5. In the legislative history materials, look for
         recordings and related documents. When you link
         to the public hearings and work sessions, you will
         find links to testimony, letters, and reports. On
         the right side of the page are links to recordings
         and recording logs.

PRACTICE ACTIVITY:

Students can work through the following example in class

112 MEGAN AUSTIN
either in groups or individually and then discuss. For
online classes, student can work through the example
individually then use a discussion board to discuss
process and results.
Your client has been a home brewer in Oregon and is
thinking about starting to sell her beer, so you have been
looking at statutes that outline the licensing schemes in
Oregon. The presumption is that her home brew
operation so far has not been subject to licensing laws.
In this example, you are going to look at the history of
Oregon Revised Statute 471.037 to learn more about the
motivations, values, incentives, etc. in passing that law.

    1. Use the Oregon Legislature's website to look up
         ORS 471.037 and find the session law that passed
         that law (2011).

    2. Look up the session law to find the bill number.
    3. Use the bill number to find measure history.
    4. Listen to the hearing/session.
The following video will demonstrate the research steps
to find the legislative history for 471.037.

    1. What is the most challenging aspect of legislative
         history research for you?

Contribute a discussion or reflection question to this
section.

        SAMPLE EXERCISES FOR LEGISLATIVE
        HISTORY
        Creating legislative history problems for student
        practice is a challenge. The goal is to tie them in
        some way to a realistic situation, while also
        facilitating practice with various platforms and
        legislative history documents. Below are some
        suggestions for legislative history practice that are
        related to the Client File for Isabel Perez-Anders
        presented in Chapter 3.

114 MEGAN AUSTIN
legislation, federal and state, that impacts brewers,
specifically for of brewing beer with CBD or
cannabis. Since recreational cannabis has been
legalized and regulated, both federal and state
laws have had to define new terminology and
amend historical legal categories of the substance.
Some recent legal changes have focused on
industrial hemp. Some statutory sections that
were modified in 2018 with regard to how hemp
is treated under federal law are Title 7 USC
sections 1639o, 1639p, 1639q, 1639r, and 1639s
and 7 USC 3319d (c)(3)(E); 21 USC 802 and 812
(c)(17). I think it was the 2018 Farm Bill, or
Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 and related
bills. We need to find legislative history
documents for that law that discuss hemp. The
documents could be the Congressional Record,
House or Senate Reports, Conference Reports
and Congressional Research Service
documents.

State Legislative History (Oregon)

In 2021, Oregon made some changes to hemp
laws as reflected in ORS 571.269. We need to find
the legislative history material for that law. Please
look at the hearings and work sessions to find
testimony and witness statements by people and
organizations that are in the hemp industry.
Please listen to any recordings of discussions of
hemp. From this information, please summarize

UPDATING, READING, ANALYZING, AND
ORGANIZING SOURCES

Entering search terms on research platforms and finding
primary and secondary sources are really just a small part
of a comprehensive research process. Legal analysis, as
well as effective communication skills, go hand-in-hand
with finding legal sources. For example, as discussed in
Chapter 2, you are engaging in legal analysis when you
are looking at statutory sections to determine which
sections are relevant, reading cases in a list of search
results to decide which cases might be mandatory or
persuasive authority for your research problem,
identifying a topic that requires you to find a secondary
source to learn more background information, deciding
which cases negatively impact an important case for your
legal issue, or identifying gaps in your research that
require further investigation. After you have found and
skimmed many legal sources, you will need to engage
in much deeper analysis to (1) determine if your statute,
case, or regulation is still considered good law, (2) identify
and define unclear terms in enacted law, (3) understand
facts that are determinative in case decisions, (4)
accurately articulate court rulings, and (5) synthesize
numerous legal sources to accurately communicate the
law.

                       ADVANCED LEGAL RESEARCH: PROCESS AND PRACTICE 117
First year legal research and writing courses
comprehensively cover updating. This chapter reviews
the updating process and tools, and discusses strategies
for effective reading, organization, analysis, and synthesis
of the sources and authorities you find during the
research process.

LEARNING GOALS:

After reading this chapter, you will be able to

    1. Explain reasons why you must update sources and
         authorities that you find during the research
         process.

    2. Explain various times (points in the research
         process) that you will update sources and
         authorities.

    3. Identify tools available for updating.
    4. Identify strategies and techniques for effective

         reading of sources and authorities.
    5. Explain and implement effective strategies for

         organizing sources and authorities.
    6. Explain and implement methods for analyzing

         and synthesizing sources and authorities.

WHY DO YOU UPDATE AUTHORITIES?

Updating legal authorities is a crucial step in the research
process so you know how your authorities have been
treated by legislatures, courts, and administrative
agencies. Also, the updating process often leads you to

118 MEGAN AUSTIN
cases or other sources that you might not have found
previously.

When you find a case that seems relevant, you need to
make sure that it still represents the current law. If you
find a statute, you need to consider if the statute has been
amended or held unconstitutional by a court.

WHEN DO YOU UPDATE SOURCES AND
AUTHORITIES?

Professors and librarians refer to updating as a crucial
step in the research process. Often it is discussed as one
of the final steps in your research. However, as you have
learned by now, legal research is not a linear process.
Frequently, your process will circle back around, and you
will complete research steps in a different order,
depending on the problem and the information you have
when you begin.

You will update your sources at many different times
during your research process. For example, perhaps you
found a statute that seems relevant to your problem. You
might see a symbol on Westlaw or Lexis that indicates
the existence of pending legislation that might affect the
statute. You would follow that link to look at the pending
legislation. If you are looking at the annotations to a
statute and find a case that looks relevant. You would use
Keycite, Shepard's or B-Cite to see if that case has been
affected by subsequent case holdings before you spend a
lot of time reading that case comprehensively and relying
on it in your analysis. So, updating occurs during the
research process as you find and initially evaluate
sources.

                       ADVANCED LEGAL RESEARCH: PROCESS AND PRACTICE 119
You will update your authorities toward the end of the
research process to make sure your searching has been
thorough and to see if any important cases have been
decided since you started your research. Finally, before
you file any pleading or document with the court, or
submit a memorandum to a colleague or supervisor, you
will update your legal authorities to make sure that the
authorities that you are citing in your document are still
good law.

TOOLS FOR UPDATING AUTHORITIES

Citators on major research platforms such as Westlaw
(KeyCite), Lexis (Shepard's), and Bloomberg (B-Cite) are
tools for updating legal sources. In addition, you can use
"Authority Check" on Fast Case and "How Cited" on
Google Scholar to update cases.

Using a citator to retrieve a list of authorities that affect
your case, statute, or regulation is only the first step. The
more challenging and important step requires you to
analyze the impact of the authority on the sources you
have found. Keycite, Shepard's, and B-Cite have a variety
of analytical tools that help.

Westlaw (Keycite)

Keycite is the citator service on Westlaw. This is a tool
that allows you to see and analyze legal authorities that
have cited, discussed, analyzed, or otherwise treated your
case or other authority. Keycite uses flags and other
symbols to indicate how your case has been treated by
other authorities; you can access a legend for these
symbols by clicking on the "Powered by KeyCite" link

120 MEGAN AUSTIN
towards the top of the screen when you are looking at a
case or statute. For example, a yellow flag next to cases
and administrative decisions indicates some negative
treatment, but not a reversal or overruling. A yellow flag
next to statutes or regulations means that proposed
legislation or a proposed rule is available, a court decision
has questioned its validity, or a prior version received
negative treatment from a court. Other symbols are a red
flag, a red-striped flag, a blue-striped flag, and an orange
circle with an exclamation mark. These symbols alert you
to potentially negative treatment of your authority, but
they are only the beginning of your analytical updating
process.

If you click on the symbol, Westlaw will link to negative
treatment. Note that you can also access negative
treatment by clicking on that tab at the top of the screen.
You will see a list of negative citing references for your
authority. All the negative citing references are organized
in a chart with the following columns: treatment, title,
date, type, depth, and headnotes. You should use the
information in these columns to help you analyze how
the negative citing references affect your case or statute.

Treatment

For example, if the treatment column indicates that a
case "criticized" your case, that case is probably less of
a priority than a case that indicates that it abrogates or
overrules your case. The treatment prompts will help you
prioritize which cases to read first to understand the
status and validity of your case.

                       ADVANCED LEGAL RESEARCH: PROCESS AND PRACTICE 121
Depth

The depth graph is a visual depiction of how much your
cases is discussed in the citing case. If you hover your
cursor over the bar graph, you will see a text description
of the depth of treatment. For example, two bars indicates
your case was cited by the case. Three bars means that
your case was discussed by the citing case. The depth of
treatment is another tool that allows you to prioritize
your reading and analysis of the citing authorities.

Headnotes

As you have encountered from your work with case law,
headnotes are summaries of legal principles in the case;
they are created by Westlaw as research aids. Also, you
have probably noticed that cases often address many
different legal issues. If you are concerned with a
particular legal issue or principle of a case but are not
concerned with other legal issues in that case, you can
use the Headnotes column to help you select the citing
references that deal with your legal issue.

Lexis (Shepard's)

Shepard's is the citator service on Lexis. The functionality
is similar to Keycite on Westlaw, but the symbols are
different. A symbol will appear next to the case name;
you can click on that to link to the citing authority. Also,
you can use the "Shepardize this Document" link on the
right side of the screen to access the whole list of citing
authorities. Lexis uses the following symbols: a green
diamond with a plus sign is a positive reference; a yellow
triangle is a cautionary symbol indicating possible
negative treatment; an orange square with the letter Q

122 MEGAN AUSTIN
indicates that validity is questioned; a dark blue octagon
is neutral indicating that citing information is available.

In the citing decisions, Shepard's also provides analytical
information on the type of treatment, depth of treatment,
and headnotes to aid in your analysis.

Bloomberg (B-Cite)

B-Cite is the citator service for Bloomberg, with a similar
functionality to Keycite and Shepard's. B-Cite has a
collection of symbols that alert you to treatment of your
authority. On the right side of the authority, you will see
an icon for "B-Cite Analysis"; by clicking that icon, you
will access a summary of the treatment of your authority.
You will also see a link "What are the B-Cite Indicators"
where you can access a comprehensive analytical chart
explaining all the symbols. For example, negative
treatment is indicated by a red square with a minus sign;
cautionary treatment is depicted by a yellow square with
a white triangle; distinguishing treatment is depicted by
a blue square with a white back slash; and positive
treatment is indicated by a green square with a plus sign.
If you select the case analysis list, or select a particular
symbol to see the citing authorities, you will see a table
with type of treatment and depth of treatment. You can
also select a "see details" link to access the particular parts
of the citing authority that discuss or refer to your case.

Fast Case (Authority Check)

The tools on Fast Case are less sophisticated than citator
services on Westlaw, Lexis, and Bloomberg. On the left
side of the screen, you can access the "Authority Check"
icon to see a citation report for your authority. If a case

                       ADVANCED LEGAL RESEARCH: PROCESS AND PRACTICE 123
has no negative treatment, Fast Case uses a white flag
icon; if a case has negative treatment, you will see a red
flag icon. Click on those icons to see the citator report.

Google Scholar (How Cited)

If you are using Google Scholar for case law research, you
will find a "How citied" link on the left side. You will see
a list of excerpts from cases under the heading "How this
document has been cited" and a list of cases under the
"Cited By" heading. Google Scholar does not provide the
analytical tools that the commercial databases provide.
However, Google Scholar is freely available to everyone.

HOW TO USE CITATOR INFORMATION

The analytical tools on commercial databases will
enhance the efficiency of your analytical process, but you
will still need to do the more time-consuming work of
reading the cited authorities that affect your case or
statute in an active, critical, and reflective way. The next
section provides some strategies for effective legal
reading.

EFFECTIVE READING STRATEGIES

Many excellent articles and books discuss effective legal
reading strategies. A few important points emerge from
those studies and discussions: 1. Legal reading is different
from other types of reading; 2. Students who read with
a professional purpose and use critical reading strategies
read more effectively and have higher grades; and 3.
Students can learn to use effective legal reading strategies.

Legal reading is different

In your undergraduate classes, most likely you were
reading texts, articles, and other materials to gain a
general understanding of a subject. The authors of these
texts were writing for the purpose of describing
information for the reader to understand the topic.

In legal sources such as cases, statutes, and regulations,
the author's purpose is not to explain or describe general
information to the reader. In cases, judges are issuing a
legal ruling by applying law to a set of facts and listing
the reasons for a particular decision. Statutes set out a
law as passed by a legislature, using language that often
has a precise meaning. In issuing regulations or rules,
administrative agencies use specific language to
implement and enforce those statutes. As someone
reading legal authorities, your purpose is not to gain a

                       ADVANCED LEGAL RESEARCH: PROCESS AND PRACTICE 125
general understanding of a topic, but rather to solve a
legal problem based on applying legal rules to your
client's particular facts. Adding further complexity, legal
authorities contain terminology that may be unfamiliar
to the reader. Therefore, a successful legal reader needs to
read purposefully, actively, critically, and reflectively.

Successful students read with professional purpose

Several studies show that students who read with purpose
have higher grades than students who do not read with a
purpose. For further information on these studies, please
read the following resources:

What is reading with a professional purpose?

What does it mean to read purposefully and actively?
When you read a case, for example, you take on a
professional role, such as a lawyer representing a client,
or a judge deciding a legal issue. What do you need to find
in, or learn from, that case to fulfill that professional role?

126 MEGAN AUSTIN
As a lawyer advocating for a client, you would examine
and give meaning to the case based on your
representation of a client: What is happening
procedurally? Who are the parties? How does the case
relate to others with similar issues? Is the court
addressing the precise legal issue that you are
investigating? How do the case facts relate to your client's
situation? What are the specific arguments made by the
parties in the case, and could you make those arguments
in your client's situation?

As a judge reading a case, you are examining the case in
the context of deciding how the law applies to the facts
before you: What is the procedural posture of the case?
Who are the parties? What are the applicable rules? Does
the case affect the decision you will render? How does the
case affect your decision?

When you adopt one of these roles in your reading, you
are becoming an active, critical, and reflective reader by
asking yourself questions, challenging the text, reflecting
on the information, and thinking about the parts of the
case strategically.

Strategies for reading critically, actively, and reflectively

Below is a list of specific strategies to use to become a
more effective reader.

Prior to reading:

      Find a setting that is comfortable and free of
         distractions

      Connect with your professional purpose

                       ADVANCED LEGAL RESEARCH: PROCESS AND PRACTICE 127
      Establish the context of the case: note the date of
         the case; consider the social and procedural
         context; note the identity of the parties

      Articulate how the case connects to your pre-
         existing knowledge

During reading:

      Read all the headings and other structural aspects
         of the case (i.e. the first sentence of each
         paragraph) before you read the case carefully

      Comprehend the facts
      Predict what you will learn from the case
      Think about what questions will be answered
      Develop new questions as you are reading
      Create graphic depictions of ideas, topics, and

         subtopics
      Annotate the case with your questions and

         observations
      Paraphrase what you are reading
      Look up terms and solve confusions before you

         move on in your reading
      Identify the main ideas in the issue, holding, and

         court's reasoning
      Identify the legal rules

After reading:

      Evaluate the court's reasoning
      Brief the case

128 MEGAN AUSTIN
      Ask yourself questions

      Ask questions to others (professors, colleagues)

      Connect the case to your existing knowledge and
         experiences

      Determine how the case fits with other cases and
         write a synthesis

EFFECTIVE ORGANIZATION STRATEGIES

Legal professionals use a variety of tools and methods for
organizing legal sources. Organization should take place
throughout the research process rather than waiting until
the end to wade through a mass of citations or notes.
Chapters 4, 5, and 6 describe suggested activities and
assignments in conjunction with this text; one of those
assignments is developing a research log to track research
process and results. A log, which can take many forms,
is one good way to organize your research as you are
working through the research process. A log will also
help you at the end of your research process when you
are analyzing and synthesizing your research. The major
research platforms, Lexis, and Westlaw, provide some
tools to help with tracking and organizing research as
well.

Research log

Research logs track research process steps, identify
resources found during that process, and describe the
information in those resources relevant to the legal
problem. They can take the form of charts, tables,
outlines, or spreadsheets. You should use a form that
makes sense to you but is organized and comprehensive

                       ADVANCED LEGAL RESEARCH: PROCESS AND PRACTICE 129
enough so that you can easily communicate crucial
research information to a colleague or supervisor.
Chapter 5 provides examples of research logs for
inspiration.

Westlaw and Lexis

Westlaw and Lexis have folder systems in which to
organize research. Also, you can use several tools to
highlight and annotate the sources you find on Westlaw
or Lexis. While these tools are helpful for research
conducted on commercial platforms, most likely you will
use freely available websites and other sources outside of
commercial platforms, so you will need a way to collect
and organize all of your research in one place.

EFFECTIVE STRATEGIES FOR ANALYZING AND
SYNTHESIZING SOURCES AND AUTHORITIES

As discussed in Chapter 2, legal analysis and legal
research are intertwined. You engage in legal analysis
starting in the first step of the research process when
you are thinking about your legal problem. As you read
secondary sources, your analysis grows more complex
and detailed. Your analysis of the problem gains structure
as you discern statutory requirements or common law
elements of a claim or criminal violation. While you will
engage in deep reading and analysis of each statute or
case separately to gain understanding, your ultimate goal
with legal research is to synthesize all the legal authorities
to comprehend the applicable law and be able to
communicate how it applies to your client's situation.

Many people choose to create a detailed outline of their

130 MEGAN AUSTIN
analysis and synthesis of legal research results. Others
may find that charts or tables help them analyze and
synthesize their research. Whatever form you choose for
your analysis and synthesis, you should identify the legal
authority (case, statute, regulation), state the rule
(elements, factors, principle), explain the rule, and
describe how the rule applies to your client's situation. By
clearly identifying all of these analytical parts, you will be
able to see how the parts fit together into a synthesized
body of law.
Below are some examples of charts, tables, and outlines to
use as tools for organization, analysis, and synthesis.
